Japanese automakers, including Nissan, have had to reassess parts of their strategy in the region as new U.S. trade rules, the expiration of EV tax credits, and reduced demand have created challenges.

The two midsize electric SUVs — one for Nissan and the other for luxury brand Infiniti — were expected to begin production at the automaker’s plant in Mississippi in 2028.

However, the timeline has now been delayed to late 2028 or early 2029, Nikkei reported.

The company had initially planned to launch five electric vehicles in the U.S., but has since canceled development of a small SUV and a sedan, reducing its pipeline to three EV models.

The shift comes after the Trump administration’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill Act’ eliminated EV tax credits effective September 30. The Biden-era incentives, worth up to $7,500, were initially aimed at boosting sales of North American-made EVs.

A 2023 revision under the Biden administration expanded eligibility to include leased vehicles made overseas, which lifted EV lease penetration from 10% in early 2023 to 66% by March 2025, according to Cox Automotive.

Japanese and South Korean automakers lacking U.S. EV production facilities depended on leasing provisions to maintain their competitive edge.

EV demand faces additional pressure from incentive elimination while also struggling with high vehicle costs, insufficient charging stations, and widespread preference for gasoline SUVs. Currently, EVs account for just 7% of new vehicle sales in the U.S.

In April, EV incentives averaged 14.5% of sticker prices — double that of gasoline cars — but demand remains sluggish.

Meanwhile, Nissan’s battery supplier, AESC, has suspended construction of a plant in South Carolina. If EV demand continues to stagnate, U.S. battery production capacity could become excessive, Nikkei reported, citing a finance industry source.

Separately, Nissan reportedly halted production in May of three Canada-bound models — the Pathfinder and Murano SUVs, built in Tennessee, and the Frontier pickup, produced in Mississippi — following the Trump administration’s decision in April to impose a 25% tariff on auto imports.

Mazda also paused Canada-bound production at its Alabama plant and is shifting output to the U.S. market, the company said.

Other Japanese automakers are also adjusting. Toyota has postponed EV production in Indiana by two years and is increasing the output of hybrid and gasoline versions of the Grand Highlander SUV. Honda has halted the development of a large electric SUV it had positioned as a key product for the U.S. market.

On Stocktwits, retail sentiment for Nissan was ‘bullish’ amid ‘extremely high’ message volume by late Tuesday.

Nissan’s U.S. shares have declined 26.8% so far this year.

The deficit-boosting bill President Donald Trump signed into law last Friday included provisions that will undermine US clean energy development. Indeed, a team led by Princeton energy expert Jesse Jenkins estimates that it will reduce US solar and wind output by at least 300 gigawatts by 2035—enough to power some 225 million homes.

But some Republicans still thought the bill didn’t go far enough. After a failed last-minute bid to add further subsidy cuts and an industry-killing renewables tax to the bill, Republicans agreed to vote yes after Trump promised to take matters into his own hands.

He delivered on Monday with an executive order titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable Foreign Controlled Energy Sources.”

The order basically instructs the Treasury Department to deny a developer’s application for soon-to-disappear clean energy subsidies “unless a substantial portion” of their project is already built. It also directs the Department of the Interior to revise policies favoring renewables. “While many executive orders have limited effectiveness, this one might actually have some bite,” says Yale energy economist Kenneth Gillingham.

“The Trump administration is taking every opportunity it can find to assert its authority not to spend money on things with which it disagrees,” says Don Kettl, a professor emeritus and former dean at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. “The implications here are enormous.”

Because of the time it takes to permit and site US projects, Gillingham says, the order’s stringent interpretation of the statutory language will have “the effect of quashing the market sooner than would have happened otherwise.”

Bob Keefe, executive director of E2, a national organization of business leaders advocating for smarter climate policies, isn’t too pleased with the order. “Just in case last week’s legislative sledgehammer didn’t do enough damage to our economy, our environment, and the pocketbooks of anybody who pays an electricity bill, the Trump administration is taking yet another swing,” he said.

Trump’s decree asserts that renewables threaten “the fiscal health of the Nation,” a claim Gillingham deems entirely false. “Renewables cost something, but they create jobs and generate clean energy.”

“Our workforce is growing, businesses are expanding, and communities are saving money with consistent, reliable energy,” explains Bill Johnson, the owner of Brilliant Harvest, a Florida solar company, but the legislation and subsequent order put that progress at risk, he says.

The order, Keefe told me, suggests that the administration “either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care that solar, wind, and batteries are the cheapest, quickest, made-in-America energy we can deploy.”

And although Trump questions the reliability of renewables, Gillingham insists that “at the levels of renewable energy we have today, we have nothing to worry about.” He adds, “If anything, adding more renewable capacity could help us meet additional electricity demand.”

As for the notion that the renewable energy market is “dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries,” well, sure, China dominates the sector, but that’s the result of supportive policies, Gillingham says—and the policies Trump is targeting were enacted to help US firms compete: “We would have to support our clean energy industries if we wanted to increase our share of clean energy manufacturing.”

Solar company stocks took a hit after the order was released. Gillingham says “the combination of high tariffs and removing the tax credits is a one-two punch that will greatly suppress the market for renewable energy.”

Johnson, the renewable energy businessman, concurs: “These federal policies create uncertainty [which] threatens to stall projects already in the pipeline and make it harder to keep building here at home.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25189618341984.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:01.540664

Trump’s EO Ends Support for “Unreliable” Green Energy

Trump’s administration labeled these renewable sources as unreliable, expensive, and overly dependent on foreign supply chains. According to Trump, clean energy policies threaten U.S. national security, disrupt the electric grid, and harm the natural environment.

This executive order marks a major reversal from the direction set by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, passed by Democrats, which offered strong incentives for clean energy projects.

Now, Trump’s energy policy shifts back to conventional energy sources like coal, natural gas, and nuclear—those he calls “reliable and dispatchable.” His administration argues that green energy has received unfair advantages and is weakening the nation’s energy system.

Tax Breaks for Renewables Face the Axe

As part of the executive order, the Treasury Department is now required to end tax credits for wind and solar production. It must also apply stricter rules concerning foreign-controlled companies involved in renewable energy supply chains.

In addition, the Interior Department must revise current policies that have so far favored renewables, such as streamlined permitting and lease arrangements. Both agencies have 45 days to submit detailed reports of their actions to the White House.

Moreover, the order freezes new permits and approvals for wind energy projects, especially offshore developments. Until a full government review is completed, federal agencies are barred from issuing new loans or contracts for wind projects. This decision creates immediate uncertainty in a sector that has been growing rapidly due to both state and federal commitments.

Wind Power at Risk: What’s at Stake

As per EIA, currently, wind energy plays a vital role in the U.S. electricity mix, contributing about 10% of the nation’s power, making it the largest single source of renewable energy. In states like Iowa and South Dakota, wind supplies more than half of all electricity.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, over 131,000 Americans are employed in wind energy-related jobs. These workers now face an uncertain future as federal support for their industry is scaled back.

Under the new law, developers will only be able to claim tax benefits for wind and solar projects if construction begins before the end of 2026. Furthermore, these projects must be completed and placed in service by the end of 2027.

Previously, developers could rely on tax incentives through 2032 under the 30% tax credit program. The shorter timeline could discourage companies from launching new renewable projects due to the higher financial risks and increased upfront costs.

Offshore Wind Goals in Limbo for States

This dramatic shift in policy could most severely impact states with ambitious climate targets. For instance, New York aims to install nine gigawatts of offshore wind capacity by 2035, enough to power roughly six million homes. The state has already invested heavily in infrastructure and workforce development to support this target.

Similarly, New Jersey plans to develop 11 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2040 and transition to a 100% clean energy power sector by 2050.

Offshore wind was a central pillar in both states’ strategies. Now, with federal support in question, these states may be forced to revise their energy roadmaps or find alternative funding solutions. Several state officials have already expressed concerns that their clean energy timelines may slip, which could push critical emissions targets further into the future.

Solar Slowdown: Cheap Power Faces New Roadblocks

The clean energy sector, especially solar, has made remarkable progress in lowering costs. Today, solar energy is one of the cheapest sources of new electricity in the United States. However, despite falling prices, large-scale projects still rely heavily on financial incentives to offset their high upfront expenses.

According to Wood Mackenzie, the U.S. solar industry installed 10.8 gigawatts (GWdc) of new capacity in Q1 2025. This was a 7% drop compared to Q1 2024 and a 43% decrease from Q4 2024.

If these federal benefits are removed, it could significantly slow the pace of new solar developments. It may also discourage private investors at a time when international competition in green energy is heating up.

What’s Next for U.S. Energy Policy Under Trump?

Supporters of the move believe that Trump’s new policy will help restore American energy independence and reduce unnecessary government spending. His energy policy puts the spotlight back on fossil fuels and nuclear power. On his first day back, he declared a “National Energy Emergency” aimed at eliminating what he calls bureaucratic barriers to energy production.

Fossil Fuels Back in the Spotlight

So, as part of this plan, he established the National Energy Dominance Council, which will focus on increasing fossil fuel production, attracting private investment, and accelerating domestic energy production.

According to Trump, returning to traditional energy sources will strengthen the economy, create well-paying jobs, reduce trade deficits, and improve the U.S. position on the global stage.

A Major Clean Energy Setback

Countries across Europe and Asia are increasing their investments in renewables, treating green energy as both an environmental and economic priority.

According to the IEA’s World Energy Investment 2025 report, global energy investment is projected to reach $3.3 trillion in 2025.

Out of this, approximately $2.2 trillion will go toward clean energy sources like renewables, nuclear, power grids, storage, low-emission fuels, energy efficiency, and electrification. That’s twice the amount, around $1.1 trillion, allocated to fossil fuels like oil, gas, and coal.

So if the U.S. steps back from clean energy leadership, it could fall behind in both technology development and global market share.

Thus, critics warn that this approach overlooks the long-term risks of continued reliance on fossil fuels, especially in a world already experiencing the impact of climate change.

Many cities, companies, and even Republican-led states have embraced renewables, not just for environmental reasons but also for economic growth. Pulling back federal support now, they say, risks stalling progress and undermining years of clean energy investment.

The Bottom Line: U.S. Climate Goals at Crossroads

In the near term, this executive order is expected to cause major uncertainty across the wind and solar industries. Projects currently in the pipeline could be delayed or canceled entirely.

Developers who had planned on receiving federal tax credits now face stricter deadlines and higher costs. Meanwhile, states will need to reevaluate their clean energy goals and consider alternative funding methods to stay on track.

Over the next several months, federal agencies will begin to implement the executive order. Their decisions and the public and state-level responses will shape the future of U.S. energy policy. Whether this move marks a new era of energy dominance or a costly detour from climate leadership remains to be seen.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2551753511.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:30.918212

Stronger storms often lead to more damage and higher insurance rates.

The aerodynamic shape of Tener's home is built to reduce wind pressure by 30%. Inside, trusses fan out like spokes on a bicycle wheel, distributing storm forces to help keep the roof in place.

""You worry about the wind blowing off the roof,"" Tener said of the main concerns for any home during a hurricane. ""You worry about the rain. And you worry about flooding.""

Anchored deep into the ground, the home also includes flood vents to relieve water pressure and protect the foundation. With these features, the house is rated to withstand 190-mile-per-hour winds — a very strong Category 5 hurricane.

""The inspector, when he came and inspected, he says, 'If we have a hurricane, I'm coming here,'"" Tener said.

A different kind of builder

Tener's home was built by Deltec Homes, a family-run company based in Asheville, North Carolina. The company has built more than 5,000 homes around the world, many designed specifically for resilience in extreme weather.

""We're taking that great shape and we're pairing it with amazing materials,"" said Matt Oblinsky, Deltec's lead engineer. The company estimates its homes cost about 10% more than traditional construction, but they often fare far better in storms. ""We're 99% successful,"" Oblinsky said of the homes' performance in past hurricanes. But he adds a note of caution: ""There's no such thing as a hurricane-proof home. We're very careful to say these are hurricane-resistant.""

Testing the limits

At the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) in South Carolina, engineers are working to make both new and existing homes more resilient. Using a massive wall of over 100 fans, the institute can simulate a Category 3 hurricane to test how well homes hold up under intense conditions.

In essence, IBHS builds homes and then destroys them.

And we do it all in the name of science,"" said Sarah Dillingham, senior meteorologist at IBHS.

The tests often reveal the vulnerabilities that can lead to catastrophic damage.

""Your roof is your first line of defense,"" Dillingham said. ""And it is what helps hold everything together in your home.""

She recommends storm-ready upgrades like high-impact windows, reinforced doors, and — crucially — wind-rated garage doors. ""Your garage door is your biggest opening of your home,"" she said. ""Because when wind gets in, it will find the weakest link.""

Longterm savings

For Tener, investing in a storm-resilient home has paid off financially as well. He even canceled his optional flood insurance saving him $12,000 per year.

""You put a little more money into it and it lasts forever,"" he said. ""It pays off in the long run.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/08/dc5b9fb7-3111-4ba3-b18a-4e8715751b4a/thumbnail/1200x630/d9e98a4e0dc4cfc3bf7cc663eadc7c60/f5-hurricane-homes-transfer-frame-2013.jpg,N,,2025-07-09 00:01:23.543838

The up to 11 gigawatt (GW) facility in Amarillo powered by nuclear, natural gas, and renewable energy, is planned near the Department of Energy's Pantex nuclear weapons plant and in partnership with Texas Tech University.

Fermi said in its application at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which the regulator made public on July 8, that it is engaging in talks with many Big Tech companies, known as ""hyperscalers,"" on letters of intent and term sheets, or preliminary documents that are usually non-binding.

The application said that the hyperscalers would be tenants, apparently meaning they would not own part of the plants. Fermi did not immediately answer questions about financial arrangements being discussed with Big Tech companies or which or how many hyperscalers it is in talks with.

The last two reactors built in the U.S. were AP1000, completed in Vogtle, Georgia. They cost a total of more than $30 billion, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Those plants were delayed by years and came in billions of dollars above projected costs. But nuclear backers say lessons learned should cut construction time and final costs of the next AP1000 reactors.

Fermi said in the application that the nuclear complex, which it calls the Donald J. Trump Generating Plant, will be eligible for financing from the Department of Energy's Loan Programs Office. The only time the president tapped the LPO in his first term was for the Vogtle plants.

The company said other plans to finance construction and operation include equity capital contributions from institutional infrastructure and real estate investors, structured bond offerings, and clean energy tax credits.

Berlin, 9 July — Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and with it, the climate advantage of electric cars is growing.
“Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” said Dr. Marta Negri, Researcher at the ICCT.
Since cars sold today typically remain on the road for about 20 years, continued improvement of the electricity mix will only widen the climate benefits of battery electric cars.
The study also accounts for other powertrain and fuel options such as hydrogen fuel cell electric cars.","A new study by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) estimates that battery electric cars sold today in Europe emit nearly 4 times less greenhouse gases over their lifetime than gasoline cars.

Berlin, 9 July — Europe’s electricity mix is getting cleaner, and with it, the climate advantage of electric cars is growing. According to new ICCT research, battery electric cars sold today produce 73% less life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions than their gasoline counterparts — even when factoring in production. That’s a 24% improvement over our 2021 estimates. In contrast, other powertrains, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids, show only marginal or no progress in reducing their climate impacts.

The study, a comprehensive life-cycle analysis of all major powertrain types, reinforces earlier findings: only battery electric cars can deliver the large-scale emission cuts needed to address Europe’s most polluting transport mode. Passenger cars account for nearly three-quarters of the sector’s emissions.

“Battery electric cars in Europe are getting cleaner faster than we expected and outperform all other technologies, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” said Dr. Marta Negri, Researcher at the ICCT. “This progress is largely due to the fast deployment of renewable electricity across the continent and the greater energy efficiency of battery electric cars.”

By 2025, renewable energy sources are expected to account for 56% of electricity generation in Europe, an 18-point increase compared with 2020. The EU’s Joint Research Centre projects this share will increase further in the next decade, to 86% by 2045. Since cars sold today typically remain on the road for about 20 years, continued improvement of the electricity mix will only widen the climate benefits of battery electric cars. In contrast, the fuels mix used by internal combustion engine cars will continue to mainly rely on fossil fuels, as the availability and price of alternative fuels remains uncertain.

Other technologies continue to lag behind battery electric vehicles in terms of life-cycle emission reductions. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars offer only 20% and 30% lower lifetime emissions than gasoline, respectively. This is also because plug-in hybrids are found to be driven less on electricity than previously assumed. While hybridization offers some benefits, these reductions are relatively small when compared with the emissions savings of battery electric cars—and they are not sufficient to meet the long-term climate targets.

The study also accounts for other powertrain and fuel options such as hydrogen fuel cell electric cars. This pathway can also offer significant emissions reduction (79%) compared with gasoline cars—but only when using renewable electricity-based hydrogen, which is currently not produced and available at scale in Europe. In contrast, fuel cell electric cars run on hydrogen produced from natural gas, which corresponds to almost the entirety of hydrogen available today, allowing only a 26% reduction of life-cycle emissions compared with gasoline cars.

Addressing misuse of data in the EV debate

Misinformation and selective use of data have generated confusion regarding the climate credentials of electric vehicles. The ICCT analysis provides transparency on the impact of a selection of flawed assumptions, such as not accounting for the development of the grid during the lifetime of vehicles and using non-representative data on vehicle fuel consumption and lifetime.

One common claim is that electric vehicles have higher emissions associated with battery manufacturing. While manufacturing emissions for battery electric cars are roughly 40% higher than for gasoline cars, the ICCT’s research shows that this initial “emissions debt” is typically offset after around 17,000 kilometers of driving, usually within the first one to two years of use in Europe.

“We hope this study brings clarity to the public conversation, so that policymakers and industry leaders can make informed decisions,” said Dr. Georg Bieker, ICCT Senior Researcher. “We’ve recently seen auto industry leaders misrepresenting the emissions math on hybrids. But life-cycle analysis is not a choose-your-own-adventure exercise. Our study accounts for the most representative use cases and is grounded in real-world data. Consumers deserve accurate, science-backed information.”

The ICCT analysis covers the greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle and battery production and recycling, fuel and electricity production, fuel consumption, and maintenance. Its methodology also accounts for the development of the electricity mix along the lifetime of vehicles, as well as real-world usage rather than official test values to estimate fuel and electricity consumption, which is key to assessing plug-in hybrid emissions.

Solar Stocks Renewables and several other energy stocks trended lower Tuesday following the order.","Solar stocks retreated Tuesday after President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday ending subsidies for green energy sources. The Department of Energy released a corresponding report the same day warning of a major spike in blackouts by 2030 due to the retirement of coal-fired plants.

The White House on Monday released the new executive order that eliminates subsidies for ""unreliable"" green energy sources, like wind and solar. The order claims that such projects displace ""affordable, reliable"" dispatchable domestic energy sources, which ""compromises our electric grid."" Dispatchable energy sources include conventional energy sources like fossil fuels. President Trump's announcement claims that reliance on green subsidies threatens national security by making the U.S. dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries.

Energy Executive Order

""Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth and the fiscal health of the Nation,"" the order reads.

The executive order aims to eliminate taxpayer-funded green energy as well as support for green energy sources and supply chains built in or controlled by ""foreign adversaries."" The EO also builds on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act by strengthening repeals and modifications to wind, solar and green energy tax cuts.

The Secretary Of Treasury has been ordered to within 45 days terminate clean electricity production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities as part of the Internal Revenue Code. There are some additional ""beginning of construction"" revisions, including restricting safe harbor provisions unless a ""substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.""

During that time period, the Department of the Interior will determine if wind and solar facilities have been given any preferential treatment compared to dispatchable energy sources. The Secretary of the Interior will then revise any regulations or policies to eliminate any such preferences for wind and solar.

The Treasury and Interior departments will submit their findings to the president after the 45 day period in order to plan for the next steps.

Need For New Energy

Meanwhile, the Department of Energy released a report on Monday warning that blackouts in the U.S. could increase 100x by 2030 ""if the U.S. continues to shutter reliable power sources and fails to add additional firm capacity."" Firm capacity refers to natural gas plants, coal-fired plants and nuclear power plants, which do not rely on variable sources like wind and sunlight.

The department warned that the status quo is ""unsustainable"" with growing electricity demand from AI and data centers. The U.S. currently plans for 104 gigawatts (GW) of power generation plant retirements, to be replaced by 209 GW of new energy generation by 2030. But only 22 of those new GW come from what the DOE deems firm generation sources.

The DOE wrote this could lead to significant outages when weather conditions do not accommodate wind and solar generation. Wind and solar facilities increasingly use batteries and other energy storage strategies in order to save their generated power supply and extend availability.

The DOE's model predicts annual outage hours could increase from ""single digits today to more than 800 hours per year."" Even without retirements, the model found outage risks in ""several regions"" would rise more than 30-fold during the forecast period, meaning ""the queue alone cannot close the dependable-capacity deficit.""

Solar Stocks

Morgan Stanley in a Tuesday research note wrote that energy companies AES (AES) and NextEra Energy (NEE) may be the most affected by the executive order, The Fly reported. The firm noted that the EO directs agencies to adjust construction guidelines for tax credit eligibility, implement FEOC restrictions and remove preferential policies for renewables from the Department of Interior. The order targets clean tech, solar stocks and other renewable developers the most, primarily AES and NextEra. It looks ""less meaningful"" for the likes of GE Vernova (GEV), Bloom Energy (BE), Plug Power (PLUG), First Solar (FSLR) and Fluence Energy (FLNC).

RBC Capital analyst Shelby Tucker noted that the plan to curtail renewables does not come as a surprise following commentary from members of the House Freedom Caucus last week, according to The Fly. Tucker expects more pressure on the sector as the order leaves the solar industry in another state of limbo while awaiting the Treasury interpretation. Meanwhile, it is still unclear how the Trump administration plans to redefine the ""beginning of construction.""

Solar Stocks

Renewables and several other energy stocks trended lower Tuesday following the order.

AES stock fell nearly 4%. First Solar and Array Technologies (ARRY) both tumbled almost 7%.

NextEra slid 3%.

SolarEdge (SEDG) pared its Tuesday declines to around 1%, while GE Vernova eased slightly.

“The 18 proposed rules also identify as an additional significant new use, manufacturing or processing of the chemical substances using feedstocks that contain any amount of contaminants listed in the proposed rules,” the proposal added.

And in the past year or so, several industry groups have added nuance to their positions on chemical recycling.
More stories about chemical recycling","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn rules first proposed by the Biden administration that addressed chemical recycling and had attracted significant industry opposition.

In a document set to publish July 9, the current Trump administration-led EPA said it is withdrawing “significant new use rules,” or SNURs, proposed in June 2023 under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). These rules would have required companies that intend to “process any of 18 specific chemical substances derived from plastic waste for an activity that is proposed as a significant new use by this rule to notify EPA at least 90 days before commencing that activity” to allow the agency to assess risks and regulate the significant new use if needed.

“The 18 proposed rules also identify as an additional significant new use, manufacturing or processing of the chemical substances using feedstocks that contain any amount of contaminants listed in the proposed rules,” the proposal added.

During the extended public comment period for the 2023 proposal, chemical recycling firm Brightmark suggested additional time for stakeholders to consider “a number of key terms and potential effects of the proposed rule which would merit additional clarification.”

In its comments at the time, Freepoint Eco-Systems, which has been involved in several chemical recycling projects, said the rules put undue administrative burdens on industry, and asserted there were inconsistencies between the policy and the EPA’s mission, including that:

Imposing regulatory obstacles for realistic recycling scenarios runs counter to EPA’s stated objective of developing a circular economy for plastics.

Focusing on feedstock purity deviates from EPA’s approach to regulating chemicals under TSCA.

Michigan-based Dow cited in its comments the lack of a de minimis level for impurities, which “makes analytical testing and quantification impractical.” The company recommended EPA specify the chemicals of concern and identify a content threshold, among other suggestions for increasing clarity.

Ironically, the 2023 proposal purported to be addressing a lack of clarity surrounding pyrolysis, the most common method of chemical recycling: “As a result of recent market trends, especially with respect to the increased processing of waste plastics, the EPA received several inquiries about OSWI (other solid waste incineration) units and the applicability of OSWI regulations to pyrolysis/combustion units for a variety of process and feedstock type,” the proposal stated. “Based on these requests and the absence of a statutory definition of pyrolysis in the CAA (Clean Air Act), the Agency believed that there was considerable confusion in the regulated community regarding the applicability of OSWI to pyrolysis/combustion units. Moreover, the term ‘pyrolysis/combustion’ is not defined in the current OSWI regulation, nor is it included in the definition of ‘Institutional waste incineration unit.'”

In comparison, no official company comments were submitted during the public comment period for a 2020 proposal from the Trump EPA that, among other issues, sought to remove the reference to “pyrolysis/combustion units” from the OSWI definition of ‘‘municipal waste combustion unit.” However, the agency “received significant adverse comments on that revision,” largely from environmental and tribal groups, the agency said in its own withdrawal in 2023.

Plastics makers applaud withdrawal

In a statement, Ross Eisenberg, president of America’s Plastic Makers, said the rules “imposed unnecessary burdens and hindered investments in the advanced recycling industry.”

Eisenberg went on to say the SNURs lacked the required scientific basis required under TSCA, exceeded EPA’s authority by attempting to regulate feedstock impurities, and “failed to recognize the thermal and chemical transformation processes — such as pyrolysis — that can remove these impurities during the advanced recycling process.”

In a February 2025 blog post, Eisenberg lauded the first Trump administration for its “great progress on updating and clarifying federal policy to treat the re-manufacture of plastic (and other materials) like similar manufacturing processes.” He urged the current EPA to re-introduce its proposed regulations from 2020, adding that “companies need regulatory certainty if they’re going to invest in technologies and facilities designed to last for decades” and “there are few more surefire paths to stifle innovation than ambiguous regulations.”

Recycling industry stakeholders have expressed similar concerns about inconsistency and uncertainty in how chemical recycling will be handled amid federal administration changes and state-level initiatives that are creating a patchwork of regulations.

For example, as California works to finalize regulations for its extended producer responsibility law for packaging, proposed procedures for handling new and emerging technologies — including chemical recycling — have drawn debate, especially from environmental groups. One recent draft placed the responsibility on the requesting facility to prove a new technology meets state requirements.

Recycling stakeholders in both Europe and the U.S. have struggled to advance chemical recycling projects, citing legislative hurdles along with high capital expenditures among the headwinds they face.

And in the past year or so, several industry groups have added nuance to their positions on chemical recycling.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” CUTS DOWN THE YEARS SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES.","The renewable energy industry faces a new series of hurdles after President Donald Trump signed the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ into law on July 4. The law quickly phases out tax incentives for wind and solar power, which some experts warn could lead to project cancellations, job losses and higher electricity prices as well as power shortages.

The changes are a significant shift in policy as the Trump administration looks to end taxpayer support for renewable energy. In the lead-up to the bill’s passage, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright called incentives for wind and solar “wasteful and counterproductive.”

“The more we load our grid with intermittent generation, the worse the grid performs during times of maximum stress and demand,” Wright wrote in an op-ed for the New York Post. Wright referenced a January winter storm in which the mid-Atlantic’s regional grid received only 4% of its power from renewables when electricity demand was high.

Opponents of the policy change, however, argue that it will slow renewable energy development at a time when the U.S. grid needs additional power generation to feed power-hungry data centers. In addition to causing project cancellations and job losses, renewable energy groups and industry analysts argue the new deadlines will limit new supply, forcing prices up and making the grid less reliable, especially during hot summers.

“This bill on the whole is negative for energy development in the United States, for manufacturing, and for just everyday families and consumers,” said Harry Godfrey, managing director focused on federal policy at the advocacy group Advanced Energy United.

How did the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ change renewable energy incentives?

The tax credits allow companies to earn a small reward — typically less than 1 cent per kilowatt-hour — for power generated by renewable energy sources. Once a new wind or solar installation begins providing electricity to the grid, the companies can claim the tax credits for the next 10 years.

Under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, companies that began construction by 2033 would qualify for 10 years of credits once they started operating. The new law shortens the deadline and adds a requirement for the project to begin providing power to the grid. Now, projects that begin construction within the next 12 months have until 2030 to begin operations. Any projects that start construction after July 4, 2026, or those already under construction, need to be operational by the end of 2027 to qualify for tax credits.

How will the deadlines affect renewable energy?

Godfrey said project development usually takes two to four years before construction of new wind or solar projects begin. In that time, projects can be held up by local or federal permitting processes and lawsuits.

As a result, Godfrey said there are projects “in active development right now that are not going to be able to commence construction here in the next year.” The new deadlines threaten to “cut those projects off at the knees,” he said.

Construction can take as little as six months for some solar projects or several years for large offshore wind, Godfrey said. Even once construction is finished, Godfrey added that projects must be connected to the grid before being deemed truly operational. That lengthy process, called interconnection, is controlled not by the renewable energy companies but by regional grid operators.

“The vast majority of these project developers are looking to outside capital in order to go about financing their projects,” Godfrey said. Without certainty that the projects will qualify for tax credits, he expects a significant number of financers will pull out of projects already underway.

Will the grid become less reliable?

Michael Keyser is the CEO of the National Renewables Cooperative Organization, where he helps local electric cooperatives around the country adopt renewable energy and other emerging technologies. In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Keyser said he is skeptical about dire predictions of cost increases and grid reliability issues.

While he acknowledged that some ongoing projects may not qualify for tax credits, he said that changing the long-term incentives away from wind and solar is a “shift that we needed.”

The Big Beautiful Bill keeps the window to qualify for tax credits open longer for clean energy sources like nuclear, hydropower, geothermal and batteries, which are not dependent on weather conditions. Keyser said electric co-ops are increasingly leaning toward these technologies — especially batteries — and other “dispatchable” resources that provide power to the grid whenever it’s needed.

“It’s time for [wind and solar] to stand on their own two feet,” Keyser said.

Doug Lewin, an energy expert and author of the Texas Energy and Power Newsletter, agreed that the grid needs clean dispatchable power, but he sees a danger in “hamstringing” renewables.

In an interview with Straight Arrow News, Lewin noted that dispatchable technologies, such as natural gas and nuclear, have even longer planning and construction timelines than wind and solar. In the immediate future, the grid needs more power, and solar is the fastest-growing energy source.

The new law, Lewin said, lacks “any sort of logical, sensible vision for how we’re going to grow power.”

Another source of uncertainty for renewable energy comes from the “foreign entities of concern” rule, a part of the law that places limits on the number of components companies can source from China, Russia, Iran and a few other nations. The exact guidelines have not yet been written, but on Monday, July 7, President Trump issued an executive order, giving the Treasury Department 45 days to finalize a rule.

Lewin said the policies amount to “choking out supply,” which he said could have dire consequences. “

“Higher prices and a whole lot more conservation alerts, energy emergencies, and the occasional rolling outage. That’s what we’re looking at over the next few years,” he said.

WITH THE SWEEP OF A PEN, PRESIDENT TRUMP PUT THE RENEWABLE ENERGY INDUSTRY ON NOTICE.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL” CUTS DOWN THE YEARS SOLAR AND WIND COMPANIES HAVE TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES.

AND A NEW EXECUTIVE ORDER DEMANDS AGENCIES “RAPIDLY ELIMINATE THE MARKET DISTORTIONS,” TRUMP SAYS THESE SUBSIDIES CAUSE.

ENERGY SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT HAS CALLED THESE TAXPAYER INCENTIVES “WASTEFUL AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.”

BUT THOSE FOR INCENTIVES SAY THE START AND STOP FOR THE INDUSTRY IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE, TOO.

BACK IN 2022, LAWMAKERS EXTENDED THE DECADES-OLD SUBSIDIES FOR SOLAR AND WIND WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT.

UNDER THAT LAW, ENERGY COMPANIES HAD THROUGH 2032 TO START CONSTRUCTION TO QUALIFY FOR TAX INCENTIVES. ONCE A QUALIFIED SOLAR OR WIND FARM WAS GENERATING POWER, THE COMPANY COULD CLAIM A TAX CREDIT ON THAT RENEWABLE POWER FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS.

THE “ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL,” NOW LAW, SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTENS THAT TIME FRAME.

CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT BEGIN WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS HAVE UNTIL 2030 TO GET ONLINE.

EVERYONE ELSE MUST BE GENERATING POWER BY THE END OF 2027 TO CASH IN.

ADVANCED ENERGY UNITED’S HARRY GODFREY SAYS THE TIMELINE WILL PUT SOME PROJECTS IN A TOUGH SPOT. THAT’S BECAUSE IT CAN TAKE TWO TO FOUR YEARS OF PLANNING BEFORE CONSTRUCTION EVEN STARTS.

“You could have projects that are in active development right now, that are not going to be able to commence construction here in the next year,” said Godfrey. “The passage and enactment of this law did mean that those projects got cut off at the knees.”

BUT MICHAEL KEYSER FROM THE NATIONAL RENEWABLES COOPERATIVE ORGANIZATION SAYS SOLAR AND WIND HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH HELP FROM TAXPAYERS.

“These technologies have had 20 years’ worth of subsidies and it’s time for them to stand on their own two feet if they’re going to exist,” he said.

KEYSER SAYS HE’D PREFER TO SEE FEDERAL INVESTMENT SHIFT TO POWER SOURCES THAT CAN PROVIDE ELECTRICITY AROUND THE CLOCK.

In 1977, President Carter issued an Executive Order4 (Carter EO) directing CEQ to “[i]ssue regulations to Federal agencies for the implementation of the procedural provisions of [NEPA]” and stipulated some of the requirements to be incorporated therein. On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued EO 141545 rescinding the Carter EO and directing CEQ “to issue guidance on implementing NEPA and to propose rescinding the NEPA implementing regulations.”6 At this direction, CEQ rescinded its regulations implementing NEPA, concluding that “it may lack authority to issue binding rules on agencies in the absence of the now-rescinded” Carter EO.7

Grid Faces Urgent Reliability Challenges Amid AI-Driven Load Growth and Plant Retirements","A new report by the U.S. Department of Energy provides a comprehensive assessment of the adequacy and reliability of the U.S. electric grid and warns that without urgent reforms and investment, the U.S. electric grid will be unable to support the nation’s economic ambitions, particularly in artificial intelligence (“AI”) and digital infrastructure. The report responds to recent executive orders emphasizing the need for a uniform, data-driven approach to evaluating grid reliability, particularly in the face of accelerating power plant retirements and surging electricity demand from data centers and AI applications.

Key findings include:

Grid Reliability at a Crossroads: The report finds that the current trajectory of plant retirements, coupled with insufficient additions of firm, dispatchable generation, places the S. grid at significant risk of widespread outages by 2030. This risk is compounded by rapid load growth, especially from data centers supporting AI and digital infrastructure.

AI and Data Center Load Growth: Electricity demand from data centers represents a major new source of load. This growth is concentrated in key regions such as PJM, ERCOT, and the West and cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management.

Retirements Outpacing Reliable Additions: By 2030, 104 GW of generation (primarily coal and natural gas power plants) is slated for retirement, while only 22 GW of new firm baseload generation is expected to be added. The majority of new generation will come from intermittent sources (solar and wind), which do not provide the same reliability benefits as traditional baseload plants.

Risk of Outages Increases Dramatically: Under a scenario where all announced retirements occur, the report projects a 100-fold increase in annual hours of lost load, with some regions facing the possibility of losing up to 43% of hourly load during extreme events. Even if retirements are avoided, reliability risks remain elevated in several regions.

Regional Vulnerabilities: The analysis highlights that PJM, SPP, ERCOT, and SERC are particularly exposed to reliability shortfalls, especially during winter peaks. In contrast, regions such as ISO-NE and NYISO, which are not projected to see significant AI/data center load growth, remain relatively robust.

Modernization and Data Sharing Needed: The report underscores the inadequacy of traditional resource adequacy metrics and calls for modernized, granular approaches that account for the frequency, magnitude, and duration of outages. Enhanced regional collaboration and data exchange are identified as critical to effective grid planning and risk mitigation.

Solar power is reaching ever higher shares in some of the world’s largest power systems, but batteries promise to take this to the next level. Advances in technology and price reductions for both batteries and solar mean that solar power is no longer constrained to the daytime, but can deliver power 24 hours a day across the whole year. One of my favourite pieces published in June was an investigation into how 24/365 solar can already be a reality with today’s technology.

Ember also reported on the need for more ambitious grid planning if countries in Europe want to compete in the growing race for AI data centers – a topical issue right now. Another favourite June report described how electrification — the process of moving from fossil fuels to electricity — can fundamentally change the game and move us faster towards a clean energy future. It’s a brilliant read!

My pick for June’s chart of the month is taken from our analysis of the EU’s final National Energy and Climate Plans. One of Ember’s data viz experts, Reynaldo Dizon, took inspiration from the circular layout of the EU Council’s meeting room in Brussels and its vibrant carpet (designed to give equal visual weight to all 27 Member States) to provide a fitting visual metaphor presenting national target data on common ground.

The graphic reveals that most EU countries still lack adequate or complete data for critical aspects of the energy transition. Many targets are missing entirely or rely on outdated scenarios, limiting the EU’s ability to coordinate effectively and deliver on its climate goals.

You can see more of Ember’s best graphics from June in Datawrapper’s recent Data Viz Dispatch blog, which showcases some of the best data visualizations produced by newsrooms and other organisations from around the world.

China reached a major milestone in April with more than a quarter of its electricity coming from wind and solar – a level that was maintained in May, according to the latest data. China installed 93 GW of solar in May, which is roughly equivalent to the total solar capacity that Germany — the world’s sixth largest solar generator — has ever installed.

So far this year, China’s increase in clean power has been large enough to meet and exceed demand growth, resulting in a fall in fossil generation of 2.6% in January to May compared to the same period in 2024.

Scientists are worried what comes next,"Andrew Freedman, Ella Nilsen",,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/08/climate/doe-climate-contrarians-trump,"The Trump administration has hired three prominent researchers who over the course of their careers have questioned and even rejected the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change.
He, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science findings during the first Trump administration, but was overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time.
CNN has reached out to Koonin, Christy and Spencer individually for comment on their work at DOE.
Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted where Koonin and Christy’s views, for example, fall in the broader climate science community.
“While Koonin and Christy are among the more reasonable climate contrarians, they represent a tiny minority view representing perhaps 1% or less of climate scientists,” he told CNN.","The Trump administration has hired three prominent researchers who over the course of their careers have questioned and even rejected the scientific consensus on human-caused climate change. Each were given positions in the Energy Department, which is led by Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas fracking executive.

The researchers are John Christy and Roy Spencer, both of whom are research scientists at the University of Alabama at Huntsville, and Steven E. Koonin of Stanford University’s Hoover Institution.

Koonin previously served at DOE during the Obama administration, and earlier was a scientist for the oil and gas giant BP. He, along with others, pushed for a public “red team” debate on climate science findings during the first Trump administration, but was overruled by political advisors in the White House at the time.

The hirings were first reported by the New York Times and confirmed by CNN.

In the Energy Department’s internal employee directory, Koonin is listed as a “special government employee,” Christy is listed as “expert” and Spencer a “consultant,” according to an agency source familiar with the matter. All three are listed as being under the office of Energy Secretary Wright, the source confirmed.

The Energy Department did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment on the hires of the three men, as well as questions on what they were working on at DOE and how long they would be there.

CNN has reached out to Koonin, Christy and Spencer individually for comment on their work at DOE. Christy told CNN in an emailed response that he was not on the Energy Department’s payroll and was “just here to help as needed.”

Koonin, a theoretical physicist, served as the undersecretary for science at DOE under the Obama administration. He is the author of the 2021 book, “Unsettled: What Climate Science Tells Us, What It Doesn’t, and Why It Matters.”

The Trump administration is currently working on overturning a 2009 federal scientific finding that planet-warming pollution poses a threat to public welfare, which underpins many regulations designed to curb the nation’s pollution. That effort is being led by the Environmental Protection Agency, but is likely to involve other agencies, including the Department of Energy.

In addition, the second Trump administration has taken a hatchet to public spending on climate science research, proposing to eliminate the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s research activities altogether while making cuts at other agencies as well.

The Energy Department employs numerous climate scientists and houses some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers, which are used in part for modeling future global warming and its impacts.

Christy and Spencer have long maintained that satellite data does not show the same trends and extent of global warming as surface weather data and have used that to poke holes in the mainstream scientific data.

The Trump administration recently let go of hundreds of scientists who were beginning to work on the next iteration of the congressionally mandated National Climate Assessment, which includes input from all climate-related federal agencies.

In recent weeks, the administration took down past iterations of these climate assessments, which are the most authoritative reports on how climate change will affect the US. It also shut down the educational website, climate.gov, and laid off its staff.

While the scope of their work is currently unclear, some prominent climate scientists are concerned Christy, Spencer and Koonin will be working on an alternative version of the next National Climate Assessment, which would be far more slanted to fringe views on the causes and consequences of global warming.

Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist at Texas A&M University, told CNN the hires signal an effort by DOE to arrive at a predetermined result.

“Hiring Koonin, Spencer, and Christy is not just irregular, it’s a recognition that none of the normal channels would not give them the answer they want,” Dessler said. “This seems to be a thread running through this administration. They don’t seek out legitimate expert opinion; instead, they find people to give them the answer they want.”

Christy suggested in his email to CNN that he wasn’t involved with either the national climate assessment or efforts to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding.

“I don’t know what is happening with the National Climate Assessment or the Endangerment Finding,” he wrote.

Dessler noted that Koonin, Christy and Spencer are well-known for making value judgements in their supposedly scientific assessments as well as cherry picking data, and the language they use tends to be in the personal-opinion space, rather than the science space.

“There’s also a lot of ‘I’m not convinced’ on areas that everyone else in the field is convinced by (‘I’m not convinced climate models are any good’). That’s not really a scientific argument,” Dessler said.

Climate scientist Zeke Hausfather noted where Koonin and Christy’s views, for example, fall in the broader climate science community.

“While Koonin and Christy are among the more reasonable climate contrarians, they represent a tiny minority view representing perhaps 1% or less of climate scientists,” he told CNN. “While it’s useful to assess a variety of views, specifically seeking out and elevating fringe views that are not supported by the vast majority of the scientific research on a subject is deeply problematic.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/20250708-koonin-christy-spencer.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-07-08 19:15:21.015247

July 8 (Reuters) – U.S. power consumption will hit record highs in 2025 and 2026, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its short-term energy outlook on Tuesday.

The EIA projected power demand will rise to 4,189 billion kilowatt hours in 2025 and 4,278 billion kWh in 2026, up from a record 4,097 billion kWh in 2024.

Those demand increases come in part from data centers dedicated to artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency, and as homes and businesses use more electricity and less fossil fuels for heat and transportation.

The EIA forecast 2025 power sales will rise to 1,517 billion kWh for residential consumers, 1,474 billion kWh for commercial customers and 1,052 billion kWh for industrial customers.

Those forecasts compare to all-time highs of 1,509 billion kWh for residential consumers in 2022, 1,434 billion kWh in 2024 for commercial customers and 1,064 billion kWh in 2000 for industrial customers.

The EIA said natural gas’ share of power generation would slide from 42% in 2024 to 40% in 2025 and 2026. Coal’s share will rise from 16% in 2024 to 17% in 2025 before sliding to 15% in 2026 as renewable output rises.

The percentage of renewable generation will rise from 23% in 2024 to 25% in 2025 and 26% in 2026, while nuclear power’s share will slide from 19% in 2024 to 18% in 2025 and 2026, according to the outlook.

The EIA projected gas sales in 2025 would rise to 13.1 billion cubic feet per day for residential consumers, 9.8 bcfd for commercial customers and 23.5 bcfd for industrial customers, but fall to 35.8 bcfd for power generation.

That compares with all-time highs of 14.3 bcfd in 1996 for residential consumers, 9.6 bcfd in 2019 for commercial customers, 23.8 bcfd in 1973 for industrial customers and 36.9 bcfd in 2024 for power generation.

Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the end of the tax credits for clean energy projects.
But on his long-running hostility to green energy, Trump has remained constant.
The decision lifts a lower court’s injunction that had blocked 21 agencies from complying with Trump’s order.
The Trump administration had told the weather service to hire 126 meteorologists and other specialists more than a month ago.","President Donald Trump is wasting no time hastening the demise of green energy tax credits — in keeping with the big, beautiful bargain he made with conservative Republicans.

The deal with Republican holdouts to end incentives for wind and solar power paved the way for passage of Trump’s mega-tax-and-spending bill. Trump’s July 4 signature on the bill completed the legislative assault on the Inflation Reduction Act’s subsidies for renewable energy.

But just how quickly the White House turned a handshake deal with House hard-liners into a presidential order — almost overnight — is notable, Christa Marshall reports.

Trump signed an executive order Monday that calls for the Treasury Department to strictly enforce the end of the tax credits for clean energy projects. It directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to look for ways in which wind and solar are getting preferential treatment. And it gives Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent 45 days to implement provisions in the law aimed at preventing projects from partnering with “foreign entities of concern.”

That means primarily China, the globe’s dominant source of solar and battery technology.

The deadlines are tight. Wind and solar projects receive tax credits as long as they start construction by mid-2026, while projects that start later would need to be placed into service by 2027. In comparison, nuclear and geothermal resources have until 2033 to obtain tax credits.

Promises made, promises kept

Trump’s eagerness to make good on his promise to Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and other budget hawks fits neatly with his disdain for Biden-era climate policy. Trump has rebuked the previous administration’s goal of shutting down coal plants in favor of carbon-free wind and solar generation, which he recently called “windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK.’”

Monday’s order to Treasury and Interior is also striking for another reason: The famously transactional president isn’t always known for holding his ground on big policy announcements.

Wall Street investors started using the term TACO (“Trump Always Chickens Out”) after Trump repeatedly backed away from threats and deadlines for slapping high tariffs on U.S. trading partners. The president is walking back a pause on the delivery of U.S. weapons to Ukraine in the war against Russia.

And last month’s bombing of Iran — raising the possibility of deeper U.S. involvement in a Middle East war — came despite the president’s boasts of keeping Americans out of foreign entanglements.

After last weekend’s tragic rains and floods in Texas, which took the lives of more than 100 people, including 27 kids at a Christian summer camp for girls, the seriousness of the administration’s on-again, off-again talk of abolishing the Federal Emergency Management Agency faces a real-world test, as do Trump’s cuts at the National Weather Service.

But on his long-running hostility to green energy, Trump has remained constant.

Supreme Court says Trump can order mass firings

The Supreme Court gave Trump the go-ahead today to launch his plan to fire thousands of federal workers, write Josh Gerstein and Hassan Ali Kanu.

The high court’s unsigned order grants the administration’s emergency appeal to enforce a February executive order that instructed agencies to carry out “reductions in force.” The justices said they were not assessing the legality of agency layoff plans, and litigation over the downsizing efforts is sure to continue.

The decision lifts a lower court’s injunction that had blocked 21 agencies from complying with Trump’s order.

Help wanted

The National Weather Service still hasn’t posted job ads for vacant positions in depleted forecast offices around the country, Daniel Cusick writes.

The agency has lost nearly 600 employees in recent months, as the administration fired probationary employees and made early retirement or buyout offers. Those vacancies are now in the spotlight after catastrophic floods in Texas killed more than 100 people, including dozens of children.

The Trump administration had told the weather service to hire 126 meteorologists and other specialists more than a month ago. A spokesperson for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the weather service, said the process to post job ads “is currently underway.”

Meanwhile, experts are warning that Trump’s upcoming cuts to weather and disaster spending — including warning systems and flood projects — could mean new risks for areas around the country, write Scott Waldman and Chelsea Harvey.

“Lives are going to be lost, property is going to be damaged,” said Rick Spinrad, who served as NOAA administrator under former President Joe Biden.

Emergency coal for AI?

The Department of Energy released a report Monday that lays the groundwork for keeping open coal and gas plants slated for closure, Peter Behr writes.

The analysis details the worst-case scenarios if the energy needs of artificial intelligence expand beyond the grid’s capacity — including weeks of power outages in some states by 2030. The report is widely seen as setting the stage for Trump to use an emergency provision of the Federal Power Act, written for wartime use, to order fossil fuel plants to keep running.

“Absent intervention, it is impossible for the nation’s bulk power system to meet the AI growth requirements while maintaining a reliable power grid and keeping energy costs low for our citizens,” said the report.

It could mark a serious win for the automaker, as it prepares to launch multiple next-generation affordable EVs, developed by its ""skunkworks"" teams.

The LFP supply chain has long been dominated by China. But American manufacturing of automotive-grade LFP cells marks a pivotal moment for the industry.

Ford’s upcoming electric vehicle battery plant in Michigan should still qualify for production credits under the Trump administration’s newly enacted legislation, the automaker said on Tuesday. If that happens, it could mark a major win and a turning point for the Dearborn automaker’s EV plans. The federal funding could help offset manufacturing costs for Ford’s next-generation affordable EVs.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” Ford said in a statement. “The BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is on track to qualify for the production tax credit—a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness,” the automaker added. Reuters reported the news first.

The $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park Michigan is already 60% complete and slated to begin producing lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries next year. These batteries, which are cheaper and more durable than traditional lithium-ion packs (but less power-dense), will power Ford’s upcoming affordable EVs. The Marshall, Michigan, facility is the first in the U.S. to make automotive LFP batteries.

The LFP supply chain has for years been dominated by China. But LFP tech is now going global. Auto executives increasingly see it as key to making affordable, mass-market EVs.

""This is an opportunity for Ford to lead in this space and bring the technology back to the U.S.,"" Lisa Drake, Ford’s vice president of Technology Platform Programs and EV Systems, told InsideEVs in an interview in June during a tour of the BlueOval Battery Park Michigan.

The Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” now signed into law, dramatically undercuts federal support for clean energy. The clean vehicle tax credit is being phased out far earlier than expected, fuel economy rules have been rolled back and the Environmental Protection Agency is reportedly preparing to loosen its Multi Pollutant Emissions Criteria—again.

Still, incentives for domestic battery manufacturing remain intact, at least in some capacity. The rules are now stricter, requiring a higher share of raw materials to be sourced from within the U.S. But projects that were already under construction by the end of 2024, such as Ford’s LFP plant, are not affected under Section 45X of the advanced manufacturing credit, and therefore do not need to meet the tougher requirements.

Ford broke ground on the LFP plant back in 2023 and seems relatively shielded from the new restrictions under the newly passed spending bill. That's a relief for the company, as the plant has drawn scrutiny from Republican lawmakers over Ford’s licensing agreement with Chinese battery giant CATL, which some have alleged has ties to forced labor over in China.

But the automaker said the plant is key to bringing affordable EVs to the masses and to bring back LFP tech—which was invented at the University of Texas at Austin—to the U.S. It will support 1,700 manufacturing jobs when complete.

Plus, Ford has long maintained that the new battery plant is “Ford-owned” and “Ford-operated.” The CATL collaboration is merely a “legal fact” because of who owns the patents and the licensing deal which will allow for the technology to truly proliferate in the U.S.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/rKqbWE/s1/ford-blueoval-battery-park-michigan.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:13:37.026455

In the Chicago area and around the country, dealership owners are preparing for the cuts to go into effect in just a couple of months. The owners said they are already seeing changes in the market.

The federal tax credits, which are meant to get drivers behind the wheel of electric cars, end Sept. 30. The credits cut up to $7,500 off the price of a new electric car, and up to $4,000 off to a used car.

""The $7,500 incentive is fully 20% the price of this vehicle,"" said John Crane, who runs Hawk Auto Group, as he pointed out a Fiat 500E for sale on one of his lots.

The end of the federal tax credits for electric car purchases is a consequence of the massive tax and spending cut bill passed last week. Crane said the electric vehicles currently in stock will sell out, and then dealerships after that will only get supply to the tune of a handful a month.

""We're not going to order as many as we currently have in stock,"" he said.

Crane added that a $7,500 credit going away also amounts to a cost of about $200 more a month for the average consumer.

He said the result of all this is sure to be that a lot of people just won't buy electric cars anymore.

""The barrier to entry is going to be higher, and less people will be willing to take a chance,"" he said.

Hawk Auto Group, which has dealerships across Illinois, said the end of the tax credit will mean changes for them too.

""The $7,500 credit is beyond the scope of what a dealership could afford to make up,"" Crane said.

Meanwhile, the change is already making waves in the auto industry — to the point where some manufacturers aren't making as many electric cars.

""Nissan has pushed out production for some of their electric vehicles,"" Crane said, ""and you know, even at the high end, Maserati was planning on going all-electric, and now they're not going to do that at all.""

It is not just a couple of automakers reassessing plans for electric vehicles.

""Nearly all automakers have reassessed their product portfolio and are pushing their new entrants into electric vehicle segments further out, so they have more time to adjust what the real market is going to end up being without the incentive,"" said Crane.

John Truckenbrod is founder of Chicago-based EV Energy Group. He offered some perspective on the situation.

""Globally this year, one out of four cars sold will be electric,"" Truckenbrod said. ""Now, the United States isn't necessarily the leader in electric vehicles.""

The EV Energy Group installs different types of chargers — residential and commercial. He said the end to the tax credit may slow down electric vehicle purchases, but interest is not going anywhere.

""It will probably slow the market down, but it's not going to end the market,"" Truckenbrod said.

But what does the end to the tax credit mean for those who are shopping for a car. Regardless of whether interest is maintained, consumers may indeed see fewer all-electric vehicles on dealership lots.

""If price goes up, we expect sales to go down. It's very simple,"" said Crane. ""So that means we would have to stock a few less, and we'll probably be working more off an order-based system for electric vehicles in the future.""

(TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF) CEO told InvestorNews host Tracy Hughes, ticking off a string of recent hires: an operations veteran, a Ph.D. process-chemistry lead “who joined the team in the last two weeks,” and a project manager “who actually built an SX plant, both heavy and light.” Those additions anchor a company that—by design—intends to become, as Ryan put it, “very much an American story.”

Ucore’s ambitions rest on RapidSX™, a proprietary separation technology that has already logged “over 5,000 hours” on a Kingston, Ontario, demo line and just received a show-of-faith from the Pentagon. In May, the U.S. Department of Defense expanded its Other Transaction Agreement, layering US$18.4 million atop a previous US$4 million allocation. Ryan called it “about C$38 million added to the mix,” money earmarked for an 80,800-square-foot Strategic Metals Complex in Alexandria, Louisiana, slated to start shipping separated oxides in the first half of 2026.

Armed with that federal endorsement, Ucore moved quickly to thicken its own war chest. A June financing added C$15.5 million, lifting available funds to “over $50 million.” The timing, Ryan said, avoided “summer doldrums” and the market’s “China on-again, off-again” anxiety, positioning the company to pursue only “strategic equity” going forward.

Location is its own hedge. Alexandria sits inside a foreign-trade zone, giving the plant tariff insulation for concentrates shipped up the Mississippi, whether from “Brazil, Australia,” or elsewhere. “Critical rares are needed,” Ryan noted, adding that the Louisiana build-out will be modular, scalable, and buffered from Gulf hurricanes yet within “good freight in, good freight out” corridors.

Kingston remains the company’s laboratory—now doubled in size—where engineers are exploring “oddball” feedstocks such as samarium-rich concentrates banned from export by China.

Meanwhile, the visitor log hints at downstream traction: “twenty-nine visitors” in 2024, including potential offtake partners seeking REEs for magnets and “other uses” beyond motors.

Shareholders can expect, in the next quarter, an engineering schedule for Louisiana, specifics on South American and Australian supply agreements, and “three- and four-prong partnerships” linking feedstock, processing, alloying, and end users. Ryan’s view is blunt: “You don’t just (want to) have one-off transactional relationships (because they) don’t do a whole lot for building out the complete supply chain.”

Dive Brief:

Detroit has launched a drone inspection pilot program for city-owned buildings that can identify energy-saving improvements and optimize performance.

The drones capture visible and thermal imaging of the building; an AI platform developed by Lamarr.AI processes the images and building analytics to create 3D models and energy simulations that help city officials identify thermal inefficiencies, assess structural conditions and optimize potential upgrades.

A partnership among Lamarr.AI, Detroit-based technology incubator Michigan Central and startup venture platform Newlab, the pilot “is a prime example of how public-private collaboration can unlock innovative solutions for cities,” said Tim Slusser, Detroit’s chief mobility officer, in a statement.

Dive Insight:

Detroit, the Michigan Department of Transportation, Michigan Central and Newlab in 2022 launched the Advanced Aerial Innovation Region as a real-world testbed for next-generation drone technologies “to move drone technology from concept to city-scale deployment,” according to a press release.

The number of use cases for drones in city operations is “phenomenally high,” said Matt Whitaker, director of mobility innovation platforms at Michigan Central.

Detroit had already established a transportation innovation zone to streamline permitting for new mobility solutions such as drones, and Michigan Central helped the city get Federal Aviation Administration permissions to fly the drones, Whitaker said.

For this project, Lamarr.AI, working with aerial photographers FlyGuys and drone operations management system Airspace Link, deployed drones to identify thermal deficiencies such as insulation gaps and potential water infiltration in three municipal buildings. It used the data to create 3D models it paired with energy simulations to pinpoint targeted upgrades that could reduce the three buildings’ HVAC energy use by up to 22%, according to the press release.

The final reports give the city a tiered approach to retrofitting the buildings, such as targeted weatherization at the curtain wall, replacement of specific failing windows, continuous wall insulation and roof enhancements.

“We are helping the city of Detroit, through the Office of Sustainability specifically, to identify vulnerabilities for cost and climate challenges,” said Lamarr.AI co-founder and CEO Tarek Rakha. “Our AI analyzes and categorizes building deficiencies and uses simulation to clearly state the return on investment once we identify an anomaly or a deficiency.”

Rakha said the combination of drones and its AI platform is “20 times faster, five to 10 times more affordable and 50% more accurate than [assessing thermal deficiencies by] regular means — including using drones in general because drones can collect data but not analyze it.”

The company’s technology can scan “a huge number of buildings in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost because we’re using our own AI analytics,” Rakha said. “That makes scaling quite accessible.”

We have updated this article to correct an error in the quote from Lamarr.AI co-founder and CEO Tarek Rakhaabout of the speed of the process. He said it’s 10 times faster.

Let alone [we don’t know] how that extreme weather is going to change over the years due to climate change,” said Di Liberto.
Meteorologists warn that it is important to have an emergency kit in case of flash floods.","From Texas to North Carolina, scientists say flash floods are not only becoming more frequent but also growing in intensity.

As of Tuesday, the devastating flash flooding in Texas has claimed the lives of over 100 people. This comes not even ten months after Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina.

According to the National Weather Service, flash floods are the nation's number one storm-related killer.

“During Helene, they talked a lot about it being a once-in-a-thousand-year event or more,” Carl Schreck, senior research scholar with NCSU and NC Institute for Climate Studies, told News 13.

According to Climate Central, rainfall rates today are now 15% higher than in 1970.

""That's not taking into account climate change, where these events are starting to happen more frequently,"" Schreck added. ""So, the same rainfall today will have more moisture to work with and cause more rain than it would have 50 or 100 years ago.""

Scientists say climate change is one of the main causes. They say that as the planet warms, storms get stronger and rain gets heavier.

“A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture in it,” said Tom Di Liberto with Climate Central.

Climate Central reported that for every one degree of warming, the air can hold four percent more moisture, leading to heavier downfalls. WLOS Chief Meteorologist Jason Boyer says the landscapes of certain areas can also play a role. He broke down the difference between the flooding in Texas and Hurricane Helene.

“With the rainfall here in Western North Carolina, we were able to push it down into several different river stems and flush it. Even though we had flash flooding, it could have been much worse. In Texas, they only had the Guadalupe and Colorado River,” Boyer said.

But it is not just the floodwaters that pose a threat; they can cause a chain reaction of landslides and erosion.

“I think it’s clearly shown over the past couple of years that we are clearly not prepared. Let alone [we don’t know] how that extreme weather is going to change over the years due to climate change,” said Di Liberto.

Scientists say that to better prepare, people must be educated on the dangers of living by a river and listen to warnings when they are presented.

Meteorologists warn that it is important to have an emergency kit in case of flash floods.

An emergency kit should be stocked with food for at least three days, prescription medication and important papers such as insurance, birth certificates and licenses.",https://wlos.com/resources/media2/16x9/8256/986/0x430/90/a2f168f1-5a01-4cab-afa9-61992a418272-AP25188632711290.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:15:25.744486

“In 2023, domestic power plants alone released 1.4 billion metric tons of [carbon],” according to Callie Sharp, an associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago.
“If EPA finalizes this repeal, people will die preventable deaths,” Bender said in her comments at the hearing.
Power plant cooperatives and advocates including the US Chamber of Commerce testified later in the day, reiterating calls for cheaper and more affordable energy through the repeal of “costly” regulations.
“The carbon rule would cause the retirement of the entire coal fleet,” Michelle Bloodworth, CEO of America’s Power, said in her testimony.","Clean air and climate advocates urged the Environmental Protection Agency in public testimony Tuesday to scrap a proposal that would repeal strong limits on greenhouse gas emissions from the coal-fired power sector.

Officials from the EPA hosted multiple sessions of public comment during the day on a proposed repeal of all power plant carbon limits under Section 111 of the Clean Air Act, the latest of which relied on carbon capture technology to drastically reduce planet-warming emissions.

The EPA plan marks a significant shift from the Biden administration, which finalized the current limits as an effort to reduce the climate and public health effects of air pollution from coal-fired power plants.

Citing the Biden-era rule as a burden on the development of domestic energy sources, the Trump administration’s proposal justifies the repeal by claiming that “fossil fuel-fired power plants do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.”

Advocates testifying at the Tuesday hearing lambasted that reasoning.

“In 2023, domestic power plants alone released 1.4 billion metric tons of [carbon],” according to Callie Sharp, an associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center in Chicago. “This is more than the total annual greenhouse gas emissions of nearly every other nation on Earth, and is greater than the collective greenhouse gas emissions of over half of the world’s countries.”

Many of the speakers expressed disappointment that the hearing was only one day long, when the last power plant rules finalized under the Biden administration had such extensive comment opportunity. The agency set a 30-day deadline to submit comments on the rule by Aug. 8.

Laura Kate Bender, vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association and a hearing speaker, said in an email that the EPA staff were “as engaged as ever in listening to testimony,” but also echoed concerns about the single-day schedule.

“If EPA finalizes this repeal, people will die preventable deaths,” Bender said in her comments at the hearing.

Extending the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit: The bill extends the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit by two years, through 2029 (prior to enactment, these credits would expire in 2027).
[1] There are similar restrictions applicable to the Section 45Q carbon capture credit and the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit.","On July 4, President Trump signed H.R.1—the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” referred to as the OBBB—into law. This sweeping tax and policy law, enacted through the process of budget reconciliation requiring a simple majority vote by Congress, carries significant implications for environmental funding, clean energy development, and climate-related programs administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as well as the tax code. Much of the provisions affect programs and funding originally authorized under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), which was former President Biden’s signature budget reconciliation bill. Below, we outline some of the key features of the OBBB environmental and energy provisions.

Environmental Provisions

In an effort to hit topline federal spending reductions, the OBBB includes funding cuts for environmental programs previously appropriated to the EPA. This includes rescinding unobligated balances for the following programs authorized under the IRA:

Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction fund (rescind unobligated balance of the $27 billion appropriated for nonprofit organizations to use for direct and indirect investment in various qualified environmental projects);

Environmental and climate justice block grants (rescind unobligated balance of the $2.8 billion for grants related to environmental and climate justice activities);

Environmental product declarations (rescind unobligated balance of the $250 million to develop and implement a program to standardize and increase transparency regarding environmental product declarations for construction materials that include assessments of GHG usage);

Funding for implementing the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act of 2020 (rescind unobligated balance of the $38.5 million appropriated to carry out AIM Act goal to phase down hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), including competitive grants to shift to lower global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants);

Renewable fuels standards under Clean Air Act § 211(o) (rescind unobligated balance of the $15 million for test/protocol development with respect to environmental and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive, procedures for determining lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of a fuel, and the impacts of transportation fuels); and

GHG corporate reporting (rescind unobligated balance of the $5 million for enhanced standardization and transparency of corporate climate action commitments and plans to reduce GHG emissions).

The OBBB includes other fee- and royalty-related provisions to enact policy changes that seek to reduce burdens with domestic energy development, including:

Delay in methane emissions fee: OBBB delays a fee imposed by the IRA on certain methane emissions from oil and natural gas sources for 10 years, to 2034. This fee applies to excess emissions as defined in the IRA from facilities subject to EPA’s subpart W reporting under the greenhouse gas reporting program, unless eligible for an exemption. Congress rescinded EPA’s 2024 rule implementing the methane emissions fee by a Congressional Review Act resolution signed by President Trump in March 2025.

Expedited National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) review: The OBBB creates a new White House Council on Environmental Quality program in which a sponsor of a project requiring environmental review under NEPA can obtain expedited review by paying an optional fee—125% of the anticipated costs to prepare the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement—to have the environmental assessment completed no later than 180 days after paying the fee and the environmental impact statement completed within a year of the date of publication of the notice of intent to prepare the environmental impact statement.

Tax Implications

The legislation has significant tax implications for industry sectors with environmental impacts. This includes:

Phasing out the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax credit: The Section 45X credit—which provides a tax credit for manufacturers of eligible components that are produced and sold by a taxpayer to an unrelated party—will terminate for wind components sold after 2027. The Section 45X credit applicable to other eligible components will be phased out in accordance with the original IRA phaseout schedule (with phaseout beginning in 2030), but the OBBB now imposes a commensurate phaseout schedule for the Section 45X credit applicable to critical minerals, which was previously excluded from any phaseout schedule under the IRA.

Phasing out the Section 45Y and Section 48E Clean Energy Production and Investment Tax Credits for Wind and Solar Projects: The Section 45Y and 48E credits—related to clean electricity production and investments, respectively—will terminate for qualifying wind and solar facilities that are not placed in service by the end of 2027, with the exception of projects that begin construction by July 4, 2026, (i.e., 12 months after the OBBB’s enactment). The termination cliff is not applicable to other technologies that are eligible for the Section 45Y credit or the Section 48E credit, such as qualifying energy storage technologies, which would remain subject to the original IRA phaseout schedule.

Implementing Prohibited Foreign Entity-Related Restrictions: The OBBB implements sweeping restrictions relating to “prohibited foreign entities” (or “PFEs”) for the Sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X credits,[1] disqualifying eligibility for such credits if the taxpayer is a PFE or if the taxpayer receives “material assistance” from a PFE. “Material assistance” is determined using a cost-based formula benchmarked against technology-specific thresholds. In respect of the Sections 45Y and 48E credits, the material assistance restrictions apply to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025, and in respect of the Section 45X credit, such restrictions generally apply to components manufactured in 2026 or later.

Terminating Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credits: The OBBB erminates the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production credit for projects on which construction begins after December 31, 2027. Significantly, the OBBB’s termination timeline is five years earlier than the current IRA sunset date for the Section 45V credit.

Extending the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit: The bill extends the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit by two years, through 2029 (prior to enactment, these credits would expire in 2027). Additionally, credit eligibility for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, is contingent on such fuel being exclusively derived from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada, and its emissions rates cannot be negative (with an exception for animal manure-derived transportation fuels).

Ending the tax credit for electric vehicles (EVs) and related infrastructure: The Section 30D Clean Vehicle credit—which allows consumers to obtain a $7,500 tax credit for purchasing a new EV and $4,000 for used EVs—will now terminate on September 30, 2025. Additionally, the Section 30C credit for EV charging infrastructure will terminate after June 30, 2026.

Other Notable Energy Provisions

The OBBB contains other notable provisions related to the energy sector, including:

Increased royalties on oil and natural gas leases: The OBBB restores the pre-IRA royalty rates on oil and gas leases from 16.6% to 12.5%, and repeals the IRA-codified royalty imposed on methane produced from oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. The OBBB would also require the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a minimum of four oil and gas lease sales of available land in nine western states per year, and 30 region-wide oil and gas lease sales over the next 15 years (at least two per year). It also removes Biden-era restrictions on leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.

Funding for critical minerals mining: Congress appropriated $5 billion to the Secretary of Defense for investments in critical minerals supply chains, as well as $2 billion to improve the S. stockpile of critical minerals through the National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund.

S. petroleum reserves: $171 million is appropriated to the Department of Energy to acquire petroleum products for storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

“Energy Dominance” grant: $1 billion in funding is appropriated for the Department of Energy’s loan program to support various energy initiatives.

Next Steps

Federal activity now shifts to the individual agencies to implement the new law, including regulatory changes that will provide opportunities for public comment. Entities across manufacturing, energy, transportation, infrastructure, real estate, and other sectors should also watch for state-level environmental actions and funding opportunities as federal incentives wane.

Sidley Austin’s Environmental and Energy practices are closely tracking the progress of this law and related regulatory developments. We are available to advise clients on risk assessments and compliance protocols, and investment planning in response to the OBBB and the coming regulatory changes.

[1] There are similar restrictions applicable to the Section 45Q carbon capture credit and the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit.

By aligning bacterial cellulose (BC) fibers through a dynamic, rotational biosynthesis process, the team has created transparent, flexible, and ultra-strong sheets that rival metals and plastics in performance — without the environmental tradeoffs.

Published in Nature Communications, the research outlines a scalable, single-step method that uses controlled fluid flow to direct the growth of cellulose-producing bacteria. The result: nanofiber alignment in real time, producing biopolymer sheets with tensile strength up to 436 MPa, and 553 MPa when enhanced with boron nitride nanosheets — surpassing many synthetic composites in both strength and thermal conductivity.

From Disorder to Precision: Training Bacteria for Performance

Plastic pollution persists because synthetic polymers break down into harmful microplastics. Bacterial cellulose, one of Earth’s most abundant and pure biopolymers, offers a biodegradable alternative — and now, we’ve unlocked its full potential.

The challenge with bacterial cellulose has long been its random fiber orientation, which limits mechanical performance. By introducing a rotational bioreactor, the team leveraged fluid shear forces to align the motion of Novacetimonas hansenii, a cellulose-producing bacteria.

“Our approach involved developing a rotational bioreactor that directs the movement of cellulose-producing bacteria,” said M.A.S.R. Saadi, the study’s first author and a doctoral student at Rice. “This alignment significantly enhances the mechanical properties of microbial cellulose, creating a material as strong as some metals and glasses yet flexible, foldable, transparent and environment friendly.”

Building Multifunctionality into the Manufacturing Process

Beyond strength, the researchers infused hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) into the nutrient solution, enabling simultaneous material enhancement during biosynthesis. The resulting hybrid bionanocomposite offers three times faster heat dissipation than traditional BC — a promising feature for thermal management in green electronics.

“This dynamic biosynthesis approach enables the creation of stronger materials with greater functionality,” Saadi added. “The method allows for the easy integration of various nanoscale additives directly into the bacterial cellulose, making it possible to customize material properties for specific applications.”

The process is chemical-free, energy-efficient, and compatible with existing incubator equipment, making it immediately viable for industrial upscaling.

Tech Applications: From Circuit Boards to Thermal Shields

With its optical clarity, mechanical durability, and customizable nanoscale functionality, flow-aligned bacterial cellulose is poised to disrupt a wide range of markets:

Flexible electronics and displays

Heat-dissipating films in data centers and EVs

Biodegradable packaging with embedded conductivity

Textiles and wearable tech materials

Lightweight structural components

“The synthesis process is essentially like training a disciplined bacterial cohort,” Saadi explained. “Instead of having the bacteria move randomly, we instruct them to move in a specific direction, thus precisely aligning their cellulose production.”

A Biopolymer Designed for the Circular Economy

As the tech sector seeks low-impact alternatives to plastic films, PET layers, and synthetic polymers, this innovation arrives with high relevance for ESG-aligned industries.

According to First Street, ""We have spent nearly a decade advancing research in climate and flood risk modeling.","Western North Carolina homeowners are pushing back on climate risk labels they argue don't match reality.

News 13 Investigates talked with several homeowners who have raised concerns and the company behind the data to explore the broader impacts on property owners and home sales.

FOR SALE - LITTLE INTEREST

John and Laura Haldane have done their share of wandering across the globe.

“At our core, people are the same everywhere — we all love music, family, hugs, and dancing,” explained John, standing in front of a map of the globe with pins marking the couple’s travels.

The currents have always carried them back to the mountains.

“This has been such a special place in our hearts,” said John.

Recently, those winds shifted.

“I’m dragging my heels,” said John.

“We want the house to sell, but it was hard,” explained Laura. “Nibbles before it actually went on the market, and then almost nothing since,” said Laura.

A call to their realtor unraveled why they haven’t seen much traffic.

“The buyers' agent said the buyers were concerned about the high flood risk, and we were shocked,” said Laura.

Confused, they checked their listing on popular real estate websites.

CLIMATE RISK RATINGS

“It’s in very large print. We are a 10 out of 10 extreme risk for flooding,” said John about what they found.

It's a hard rating to swallow since during Hurricane Helene, rainfall maps showed that between 13 and 15 inches fell at their home over three days, and the property never flooded.

“I thought this was so obviously incorrect. It should be easy just to point out why it’s incorrect and get the information changed,” said Laura.

It has been anything but easy, and Brian Cagle, Allen Tate/Beverly-Hanks' regional vice president, said the Haldanes aren’t alone.

“We pulled some numbers in Waynesville, and we have 20 properties that are not in a flood zone, did not flood, and have very high ratings, so I don’t know why,” said Cagle.

IMPACT ON WNC MOUNTAINS

The rating comes from First Street Technology. Its climate risk ratings started in September on websites including Zillow, Realtor.com and Redfin, among others.

“We’re appreciative of their work and their efforts and their concern for climate change, that’s all great, but it has to be right. The data has to be accurate,” said Cagle, who has since reached out to the NC Realtors Board, which was looking into the matter.

In addition to the Haldanes, the LeGwins in Asheville, the Schrecks in Hendersonville, and the DeMerrits in Pisgah Forest reached out to News 13 when their 10 of 10 flood rating also ran buyers off.

We reached out to First Street Technology with their concerns. The company pointed us to their YouTube page, which explains their flood modeling. It uses physics versus statistics to predict heavier rainfalls now and 30 years from now.

“It’s actually simulating rainfall on this earth, how that rainfall moves across the surface, collects into streams and rivers, and moves downhill, basically,” said Dr. Ed Kearns, chief science officer for First Street Technology, in the on flood modeling.

Coupled with data from FEMA, NASA, USGS and the Army Corps of Engineers, the model generates a score, not just for a region, but for specific homes, according to First Street’s video.

The above graphic and image from the News 13 drone show why the Haldanes' question whether the data is accurate.

When checking neighboring properties above and below the Haldanes' lot, five were rated one out of 10, and two received nines for flood factors.

“Water flows downhill, so there’s no way that we can have polar opposite flood risks,” said Laura.

All four of the homeowners who reached out to News 13 had minimal flood risk in North Carolina's Flood Risk Information System. First Street's YouTube video also explained why the models differ.

“Unfortunately, that doesn’t tell the whole story because flood zones don’t capture heavy rainfall, and those FEMA flood zones are not capturing climate change,” said Dr. Kearns.

CAN YOU DISPUTE IT?

First Street's says: ""As a rule, we do not update factor scores based on individual requests or disputes.”

However, in an email, a spokesperson told News 13 they would review the addresses I shared, plus any FEMA letters of map amendments, elevation certificates, base flood elevation documents, and proof of new construction or updates not in public record that homeowners submitted.

The LeGwins sent both Zillow and First Street some of that data, but Zillow confirmed First Street’s assessment in a letter and said the climate risk feature will remain. The Haldanes got a similar response.

“Their policy is not to make changes,” said Laura of the email they received back from their complaint to First Street.

News 13 reached out to a local environmental scientist and geologist familiar with area flooding. After consulting debris flow maps, he didn’t understand the varying scores around the Haldanes' property.

The LeGwins' property is mapped at risk for a debris flow, but the Schrecks' Hendersonville property is out of the floodway. That is why the Land of the Sky Association of Realtors is encouraging home buyers not to just look at these scores.

“I would remind folks it’s a projection and that there are other modeling programs out there, so as with anything else, check multiple sources, visit the property and develop your own conclusions,” said realtor Rachel Brown.

Even First Street admits a property ranked 10 of 10 for extreme flooding may never flood, which home sellers say is frustrating.

News 13 is aware that several homeowners have filed complaints about First Street's data with the North Carolina Attorney General's Consumer Protection Division. They have reached out to First Street on the homeowners’ behalf.

News 13 also found nationwide complaints with the Better Business Bureau about First Street’s Data, with the responses that they don’t address individual concerns.

First Street has yet to get back to News 13 about the addresses we provided.

DISPUTE PROCESS:

According to First Street Technology, ""anyone can submit a dispute"" at .

First Street told News 13 the following:

""We want to assure you that every submission is reviewed to ensure data accuracy. In the rare instance that data is found to be incorrect or if appropriate supporting documentation is provided, we take prompt action to issue a response. If not, our system directs users to the following resources to help them better understand their score.""

Congressional Democrats are calling for Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin to reinstate 139 of the agency’s employees, who were recently put on administrative leave after signing a letter dissenting with its latest policies.

On Tuesday, several members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee claimed the action by President Donald Trump’s administration is illegal, since the employees are whistleblowers.

“Taking adverse actions against employees for making a protected disclosure — including investigating them and placing them on administrative leave — in a manner that deters others from coming forward is a textbook violation of the whistleblower Protection Act,” the lawmakers said in a letter sent to Zeldin.

The letter was signed by the ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Frank Pallone, of New Jersey, as well as New York Reps. Paul Tonko and Yvette Clarke.

A group of Democratic lawmakers from Virginia and Maryland also spoke out against the action taken by Zeldin at a news conference on Tuesday.

“Zeldin and his Trump administration colleagues are taking taxpayer money and sabotaging the essential work that this agency does to protect public health,” said Rep. Don Beyer, who represents Virginia’s 8th District.

Beyer was joined by fellow Virginia Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, of the 11th District, as well as Maryland Reps. Glenn Ivey, who represents the 4th District, and April McClain Delaney, of the 6th District.

“These 139 (workers) stand up for the safety of the public, for the safety and protection of the environment, for the assistance and help of the American people; and the first thing they do is try to kick them out,” Ivey said. “It’s wrong, it’s retaliatory and we have to do everything we can to turn it around.”

EPA’s ‘zero tolerance’

When the EPA announced the employees were being put on administrative leave last week, it accused them of “unlawfully undermining” the administration’s agenda.

The employees had signed a “declaration of dissent,” arguing that the agency is failing to maintain its mission to protect public health and the environment.

The EPA said in a statement that it has a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting” the president’s agenda. But employees were also told it was not a disciplinary action.

The EPA said the employees would be paid during their “temporary, non-duty” status for a period of two weeks, as an administration investigation was carried out.

Under Zeldin’s leadership, the EPA has reduced funding for environmental improvements in minority communities, proposed repealing rules limiting greenhouse gas emissions and undid a ban on a type of asbestos.

During a cabinet meeting at the White House on Tuesday, Zeldin said the president’s “one big beautiful bill” that was approved by Congress last week delivered a “sledgehammer” to what he called the “green new scam,” which is what administration officials often call various environmental initiatives approved when former President Joe Biden was in office.

Zeldin touted various efforts to reduce spending in the agency.

“This is about us being good stewards of American tax dollars, without any apology or regret,” he said.

Key Takeaways Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance.
Tax credit buyers and investors should continue to carefully diligence projects to ensure that energy tax credit requirements are met.","On July 4th, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “Act”), which included a phaseout of incentives for solar and wind generation projects. Projects must either begin construction within one year or be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the Section 45Y Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit or the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit. The House’s version of the legislation required a more accelerated phaseout than the Act and only allowed projects that began construction within 60 days of enactment of the bill to be eligible for the tax credits. In discussions last week with House conservatives who favored the faster phaseout of solar and wind tax credits, which was not adopted in the Act, President Trump promised strict enforcement of the rules, including the beginning of construction requirements, for solar and wind projects to qualify for energy tax credits.

On July 7th, President Trump issued an Executive Order (“EO”) titled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources. In the EO, the Trump Administration directs the Treasury Secretary to “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities” within 45 days following the enactment of the Act.

Beginning of Construction Rules

Specifically, the EO directs the Treasury Department to issue new and revised guidance for the beginning of construction requirements, which it states should prevent the “artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility” and “restrict the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

Many House conservatives disfavor the current IRS guidance provisions: the Five Percent Safe Harbor and the Physical Work Test. The Five Percent Safe Harbor allows energy projects to demonstrate “beginning of construction” by incurring at least five percent of the total project cost, even if the project isn’t completed within the same tax year. The Physical Work Test allows a taxpayer to establish “beginning of construction” by beginning physical work of a significant nature.

These “beginning of construction” tests are set forth in IRS Notices. Because IRS Notices are informal guidance and not formal guidance, the IRS may withdraw, amend, or issue notices at any time. Taxpayers may rely on the existing IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59, both specifically referenced in the Act, until Treasury and the IRS withdraw and/or issue new guidance.

The “beginning of construction” rules are important not only to retain eligibility for the credits past the termination date for the credit, but also to determine whether a project must meet the foreign entity of concern requirements set forth in the Act.

Foreign Entity of Concern Requirements

The EO also directs the Treasury Secretary to take “prompt action” to implement the enhanced foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions in the Act within 45 days following enactment. The complex FEOC provisions included in the Act limit the ability of “prohibited foreign entities,” as defined in the Act, to claim tax credits for qualified facilities, qualified interconnection property, and energy storage technology that begin construction after December 31, 2025. Taxpayers cannot claim these credits if they engage in sourcing (including, “material assistance”), licensing, or payments to a prohibited foreign entity. The material assistance restriction renders a taxpayer ineligible for the credit if a certain percentage of the value of a project is sourced from one or more prohibited foreign entities. A taxpayer needs to have a ratio higher than the thresholds set forth in the Act to qualify for the credit.

There are some exceptions, including for certain foreign-controlled publicly traded companies. There are also exceptions for certain manufactured products and eligible components acquired pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025, and that are placed into service before January 1, 2030 (or for wind and solar facilities before January 1, 2028) in a facility the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025.

Key Takeaways

Project developers, particularly of wind and solar projects, should pay close attention to the beginning of construction rules and carefully document steps taken towards compliance. Ensuring that substantiation and documentation requirements are met at the outset will allow for better results during an IRS examination.

The Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba is choking on smoke as fires rage through the territories, with 767 people trying to escape the worst fires in history. The skies are filled with smoke here even, and the sun has been red in the sky for days. It’s really a terrifying feeling, that is hard to escape, it’s in our DNA to be fearful of catastrophe.

As the air particulates come to our land, and towns like Detroit Lakes and Grand Marais hit records for poor air quality, we go outside in masks or not at all .We are closer than we think. Some of our electricity comes from this very community, and the price is high. “Many that couldn’t get out because the junction at Highway 374 and Highway 373 is their lifeline to Norway House, and now it’s being compromised by the fire and the smoke,” said Chief David Monias, Chief of the Nation at Pimicikamak Okimawin – Cross Lake Band.

Terrifying. Pimicikamak is Cree territory of the north – Cross Lake it’s called. The word refers to a current cross the lake. It’s the same word as Bemidji – or Bemdjigaamag. The lake with a cross current. As I write, the airport is closed, roads and rivers compromised. Residents were being flown out from the bush airport, about 530 kilometers north of Winnipeg, but high winds and dry conditions worsened the situation, flights were cancelled without notice, just as Chief Monias issued a full evacuation order, telling the remaining 6,500 residents of the territory to head south to Norway House Cree Nation.

That’s another community is under an evacuation notice. While the media treats the raging fires as sort of an annual horror show, the background to these times has been building. Pimicikamak’s traditional territory is the upper Nelson River watershed, Kichi Sipi (Cree for Great River, or Mississippi). It drains the fourth largest watershed in North America. Lake Winnipeg, the seventh largest lake in North America, and two of the continent’s largest rivers.

There’s been a long assault on the integrity of that ecosystem, with Minnesotans as some of the primary beneficiaries. What am I talking about? Manitoba Hydro and the mega dams. Hydro electric power has been misrepresented as clean energy – but that’s a matter of scale. Drowning entire ecosystems under water, creating wastelands of dead trees, and receding shoreline, silting and clogging dams till they are inefficient.

Ecologically, the extensive boreal shoreline ecosystem nourishes the vast forests of the north and that destruction has a large ripple for the boreal forest. The boreal forest is an ecological stronghold remaining in North America. It is the northern lung of the planet, covering 40% of Canada’s land mass (and part of it is in Russia). It may be as important as the world’s rainforests (the other lung) in producing oxygen and absorbing greenhouse gases. But the boreal forest is now the most threatened of all major landscapes on our planet according to William Pruitt, at the University of Manitoba.

In Manitoba alone, hydro-electric development has resulted in the flooding or clearing of roughly 600,000 acres of boreal forest. That is roughly 10 times the area lost to clear-cutting in Canada annually. In addition, an unknown area of forest is lost each year as destabilized land is dumped into rivers and lakes by erosion. Canada is the world’s largest producer of hydroelectricity. The people who are dammed are Indigenous – a way of life buried under huge dams.

“Our people are grieving; they are grieving for land, the water and a way of life that was brought to an abrupt halt. I remember going along the shoreline to pick medicine with my late grandmother only to find it flooded. My grandmother stood there crying because that was her life. Her life was the land.”said Bobby Brightnose, traditional healer told a reporter.

“Millions of tons of earth wash into the rivers and lakes from shoreline erosion each year; erosion of burial sites continues to take place. Historic camp sites are washed away. Entire islands disappear. Spawning grounds have been destroyed. Wildlife has become scarce. Navigation has become hazardous. Our people feel and fear the effects day after day, week after week, year after year.” Nelson Miller, Pimicikamak Executive Council, said.

The response: “…it’s just the cost of doing business,” Manitoba Hydro President and CEO said, in regard to the 1994 death of a Pimicikamak citizen in a boating accident caused by Manitoba Hydro’s hydro-electric project. Who has benefited? That would be the US. The north has dams, and the powerlines go south. That’s what an energy colony looks like, and money is to be made. One of the largest contracts with Manitoba Hydro is with XCEL Energy. That, however, is about to change. Between Trump’s Trade War with Canada, and a visionary Premier of Manitoba – Wab Kinew, the first Anishinaabe Premier of Manitoba, the XCEL contracts will not be renewed.

On Aprii 14, Kinew announced that Manitoba Hydro would not renew two contracts totaling 500 megawatts of power capacity to XCEL. Instead, Manitoba has decided to export power to Nunavut, a largely Indigenous Province further north.

One more point. These fires are the direct result of fossil fuel combustion. Between Canada’s dirty tar sands, and Enbridge, there’s an ecological mess being made. Far away, those fires, but the smoke is in my lungs, scorches my throat and my primal fears are at an all-time high.

Pimicikamik, I pray for you.",https://thecirclenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hydro-damn.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:53.277558

Changes to the big, beautiful bill allow the automaker to plan on multi-million dollar tax breaks

The decision set criteria for Ford to show its Chinese affiliation was not an equal partnership

Ford Motor Co.’s massive electric vehicle battery factory under construction in Marshall will be eligible for federal tax credits after revisions to President Donald Trump’s so-called $3.4 trillion ""big, beautiful bill.”

The change follows a warning from the automaker’s executive chair Bill Ford Jr. in May, when he told Michigan business leaders gathered on Mackinac Island that the planned EV tax cuts in the bill “imperiled” the $3 billion BlueOval Battery Park.

Now Ford can move ahead with opening the facility as planned in 2026 with assurances that it could qualify for the Biden-era credits for manufacturers in effect when it launched construction in 2023 due to changes in how the US views the automaker’s relationship with a Chinese battery maker.

“Ford is committed to making the best, most cost-effective batteries for the next generation of electric vehicles in the United States,” Ford spokesperson Jessica Enoch told Bridge in a statement on Tuesday.

Qualifying for the tax credit, she continued, is “a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness.”

The factory is among Michigan’s largest manufacturing projects inked during the administration of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Originally valued at $3.5 billion, it promised 2,500 jobs in the community east of Battle Creek,

Facing concerns about EV profitability and battery capacity, Ford (NYSE:F) hit pause on the project after the state committed over $1.3 billion in public funding, including tax breaks and land development.

The automaker [NYSE:F] later reinstated its plans to build EV batteries with the less-expensive LFP technology, licensed from Chinese partner CATL.

Bill Ford: Federal EV policy changes ‘imperil’ $2B Michigan EV factory

Stung by EV losses, Ford plans smaller Michigan factory with fewer jobs

But this year, the Trump administration vowed to end federal subsidies for the EV market. The production credit — along with several other clean energy credits, including the $7,500 credit for buyers of many EVs — had been eliminated in the House and early Senate versions of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The move prompted Ford’s warnings, saying it was not fair to change the funding mid-stream, even as he said he agreed with the motives “to have a strong American industrial base.”

The sticking point became scrutiny by lawmakers of the CATL deal due to strained US-Chinese relations, prompting questions about Ford’s affiliation with the “foreign entity of concern.”

The Senate, after more than a month of lobbying by Ford, set the tax break criteria on “effective control” in the partnership, the Automotive News reported Tuesday.

The Dearborn automaker has said it is in control because it owns the site in Marshall and its equipment, the publication said, while CATL trains Ford workers.

Under the new revisions, the 45X Advance Manufacturing Production Credit will provide a credit of $35 per kWh for battery cells and $10 per kWh for modules. The bill says EV batteries must contain 60% U.S. content in 2026, increasing to 85% in 2030.

With the factory’s capacity reaching 20 gigawatt hours per year, the tax break could be worth tens of millions to Ford annually.

While Ford proceeds with its plans to open in Marshall in 2026, critics of CATL’s involvement are not comforted by the bill’s distinction of who’s in control.

""The nature of the ‘deal’ between Ford and China-based and Chinese Communist Party (CCP)- tied CATL remains high risk and volatile, both for our national security and taxpayers,” said Joseph Cella of Michigan, who served as US ambassador to Fiji.

The alliance remains “politically fraught,” Cella said. “I trust the Trump administration will continue to fortify the provision of our common defense from the threat presented by the CCP to our national and economic security.""

Marshall business leaders who were instrumental in the Ford deal are relieved by the final bill, they said. Many raised concerns about the end of the tax credit and emphasized over the last month that they are counting on this project’s economic boost.

“We are thrilled to hear that President Trump and Congress came together to preserve the pro-growth federal tax policies that ensure families and businesses across southwest Michigan and the state will continue to benefit from Ford’s investment in BlueOval Battery Park,” said James Durian, CEO of Marshall Area Economic Development Alliance.

“When Ford’s facility begins production next year, it will bring back our supply chain to the United States, which will make our country less reliant on – and more competitive with – foreign countries like China,” Durian said.

Even with the production tax credits surviving threatened cuts, Ford is still planning on EV battery production at a time when the market is volatile and rapidly changing.

Intense rain is falling more frequently in many areas of the U.S. — though where it occurs and whether it causes catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance, according to experts.
This week, flooding from the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal prompted dozens of water rescues in other parts of North Carolina.
Nielsen-Gammon said the overall intensity of extreme rainfall in Texas has increased by 15% over the past 40-50 years.
Still, it’s almost impossible to predict where the most catastrophic rain will fall in any given year, Kunkel said.","It’s not just Texas and North Carolina. Intense rain is falling more frequently in many areas of the U.S. — though where it occurs and whether it causes catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance, according to experts.

More than 100 people died in Texas Hill Country over the weekend after 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain fell in just hours. The deluge was driven by warm, moist air left over from Tropical Storm Barry and Hurricane Flossie that created conditions for repeated thunderstorms in the same location, said Texas Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon.

Last year, Hurricane Helene dumped more than 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain on western North Carolina, triggering catastrophic flooding that washed away roads and homes, killing more than 100 people in that state alone. This week, flooding from the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal prompted dozens of water rescues in other parts of North Carolina. And this spring, record rainfall in Kentucky caused severe and deadly flooding.

Although it can be difficult to attribute a single weather event to climate change — and hilly or mountainous terrain worsen flooding — experts say a warming atmosphere and oceans due to the burning of fossil fuels make catastrophic storms more likely.

That’s because the atmosphere can hold 7% more water for every degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), creating a giant sponge of sorts that sucks up moisture from bodies of water and vegetation. The moisture later falls back to earth in increasingly intense, unpredictable and destructive downpours.

“It’s just loading the dice toward heavy rainfall when the situation is right,” said Kenneth Kunkel, a climate scientist at North Carolina State University.

Intensifying rain storms

Going back through U.S. weather station records dating to 1955, Kunkel found that rain over the past 20 years has become more intense in the eastern two-thirds of the country, including the southern Great Plains, where Texas is located. Intensities have remained the same or declined in the West and southwest.

At the 700 stations that began collecting data in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the highest proportion of two-day rainfall records have been set in just the past 10 years, Kunkel said, though that doesn’t fully reflect most Western stations, which were established later.

Nielsen-Gammon said the overall intensity of extreme rainfall in Texas has increased by 15% over the past 40-50 years.

Still, it’s almost impossible to predict where the most catastrophic rain will fall in any given year, Kunkel said.

“This month was the Texas Hill Country’s turn to get hit. Last fall ... in western North Carolina, it was our turn,” Kunkel said, adding that just because an area was spared over the past 20 or 30 years, it “doesn’t mean that they aren’t vulnerable. ... They got lucky.”

A ‘perfect storm’ in Texas

The worst flooding and greatest loss of life in Texas occurred in Kerr County, in an area known as “flash flood alley” because of its steep terrain that funnels water to the Guadalupe River, a popular recreational area.

Though the county did not get the most rain from the storms, the “distribution of rainfall was one of the worst possible patterns” because the most intense downpours were over the headwaters of the south fork of the Guadalupe River, causing water to rush into areas where hundreds of people, including children, were camping, said Nielsen-Gammon.

If the epicenter had been 10 miles (16 kilometers) north or south, the rain would have been divided among different river basins, he said. If it had been farther downstream, larger floodplains would have absorbed and slowed much of the water.

Years of drought also likely exacerbated the flooding.

Kerr County, for example, had been in extreme or exceptional drought for more than three years, aside from one four-week period last fall. That likely left the soil compacted, which caused water to run off instead of soaking into the ground, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist.

Then, air from the warmer-than-normal Gulf of Mexico — a reflection of global warming — blew into the state with a higher water content than it would have had decades ago.

It all added up to “just a perfect storm of events” that caused a catastrophe, said Rippey. “There are things that had to come together to make this happen.”

The existing tax credits Dominion expects to secure ​“will result in substantial savings for our customers,” he added.","On June 30, after an exhausting round of late-night negotiations, Delaware state legislators passed a bill to effectively green-light the Southeast’s second offshore wind farm. Within days, lawmakers in Washington passed legislation that may doom its future.

MarWin, the first phase of a 114-turbine project off the Delmarva Peninsula, is slated for installation in 2028 with onshore construction possibly starting next year, but that timeline is perhaps unrealistic, said Harrison Sholler, an offshore wind analyst with BloombergNEF. MarWin doesn’t have its financing in place yet to underwrite construction and, to make matters worse, Congress just unleashed a crushing new deadline.

When President Donald Trump signed the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” on Friday, he dramatically shortened the window in which offshore wind projects can qualify for tax credits that offset up to 30% of their costs. The law now requires new wind farms be ​“placed in service” by the end of 2027 or begin construction by July 4, 2026, to qualify.

“We don’t predict any new offshore wind projects starting construction … at least in the next four years,” Sholler told Canary Media two days before Congress passed the bill.

He described Republicans’ tightening of the tax credit — from an original deadline to start construction by 2033 or potentially later, to this one-year sprint — as the final nail in the coffin for offshore wind farms that are fully approved but not currently underway. Two projects — MarWin near Maryland and New England Wind off the Massachusetts coastline — float in this gray zone, and are now vulnerable to being put on ice indefinitely.

Wind developers have faced mounting hurdles in recent months: new tariffs, a federal permitting pause, higher investment risk, and the looming threat of the Trump administration halting already-approved projects, like it did in a shocking monthlong pause on New York’s Empire Wind.

A BloombergNEF report released in April states that losing the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, known as 45Y and 48E, would be ​“devastating” for U.S. projects already in the pipeline. Analysts estimate that the electricity produced by offshore wind farms that qualify for the credits costs on average 24% less over a project’s lifetime.

That April report predicted ​“all but the most advanced projects [will] pause development activities.” Now, with tax credits officially rolled back, prospects for offshore wind appear even more dim.

“If you take away the tax credits, it doesn’t make much sense to develop an entirely new sector,” said Elizabeth Wilson, a professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College who studies offshore wind policy.

America’s offshore wind sector is still in its infancy. While the U.K. has already built over 50 wind farms in its waters, America has only completed one large-scale project: South Fork Wind, located off the coast of Long Island, New York.

Trump issued an executive order on Inauguration Day that froze all offshore wind permitting and leasing pending a federal review. Seemingly safe from the president’s ire at the time were eight projects, including MarWin, that already had all their federal permits in hand. Since then, at least one of those permitted projects — the 2.8-gigawatt Atlantic Shores project off the New Jersey coast — has fallen apart. Five are currently under construction.

The largest offshore wind project now being built in America — Dominion Energy’s 2.6-gigawatt Virginia project — appears unscathed by the Inflation Reduction Act rollback.

“There is no impact to Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind. The project is nearly 60 percent complete and is on schedule to be completed in late 2026,” wrote Jeremy Slayton, a spokesperson for Dominion Energy, in an email to Canary Media, dispelling concerns that the 176-turbine project off the Virginia coastline would suffer from the scaleback of tax credit eligibility.

The existing tax credits Dominion expects to secure ​“will result in substantial savings for our customers,” he added.

Dominion has so far spent approximately $6 billion on this monumental project. Some in the industry feared that the impact of Trump’s reconciliation bill could have been far worse, and are celebrating that the five wind farms under construction might see full operation.

“While this fight is over, I’m incredibly proud of Oceantic’s members and staff,” said Liz Burdock, president and CEO of the offshore wind industry group, in a July 3 statement after Congress passed the bill. ​“Because of their relentless push, developers now have one year to start construction and retain 100% of their tax credits, with a simple ​‘safe harbor’ option.” (On Monday, Trump issued an executive order that tries to further limit the bill’s ​“safe harbor” and ​“beginning of construction” options.)

But for Maryland and Delaware state lawmakers who backed MarWin in the face of considerable county-level pushback in recent months, the ​“Big, Beautiful Bill” is a major blow. The project’s turbines were slated for installation off Maryland’s coastline but its cables would come ashore in Delaware, making it a much-anticipated joint investment.

On June 30, Delaware’s Democratic lawmakers passed a bill that strips Sussex County officials of their ability to revoke local permits for certain aspects of the wind project. A county-level block on an onshore substation was MarWin’s final hurdle and clearing it meant construction on the substation could, in theory, begin as early as February of next year.

“This bill helps eliminate unlawful and unnecessary hurdles to a project that will help ensure electric reliability for Delawareans while lowering the price they pay for electricity,” Nancy Sopko, a spokesperson for MarWin developer US Wind, told Canary Media via email.

But whether US Wind can lock in financing and officially break ground by July 2026 — the new deadline for tax credit eligibility — is another story. US Wind is suing the Sussex County Council over the permit denial in hopes of starting earlier, before the new state law goes into effect.

Before signing the final bill, Delaware’s Gov. Matt Meyer (D) said it is important to get the offshore wind energy project ​“done quickly and safely to provide sustainable power to Delaware.” Within days, however, MarWin had potentially been rendered incapable — at least in the view of analysts — of taking advantage of the tax credits that would make its construction financially possible.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1867528717_2025-07-08-210740_mecq.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4bc2872d35bc32080f5e67f93d54916a,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:59.551375

Under the tax and spending bill President Trump signed last week, those credits will no longer be available after September 30.

Federal incentives for EVs have a reasonably long history — they have been around in some form since 2008, back when EVs were just barely a thing.

“It was, for most car companies, a tech demonstration, a very low-volume production … mostly because of the high price of batteries,” said Gil Tal, director of the Electric Vehicle Research Center at the University of California, Davis.

At that point, car companies didn’t really know if these things would work — or if they’d sell. And they were really expensive to produce.

But with a tax credit, Tal said, “that allowed them to start thinking about it as a larger volume production.”

Soon, companies started investing in new plants, battery technology, and supply chains. A tax credit of up to $7,500 per vehicle allowed car companies to charge more for EVs and let the credit soften some of the sticker shock for consumers, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions.

“The incentive lowers the price for the end consumer, while the manufacturer still gets to keep an additional $7,000 above what the consumer is paying for the electric vehicles,” he said.

Last year, the Biden administration made the credits available at the point of sale. That helped electrics grow to just over 8% of vehicle sales in the U.S.

“This meant that you didn't have to worry about having that extra money to pay for the vehicle upfront. It meant that it expanded the market, for the average person to be able to buy the vehicles,” said Tallis Blalack, a consultant on EV infrastructure projects.

If you’re interested in going electric after the credits go away, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, said a lot of leased EVs that benefited from a credit will soon come off lease into the used vehicle market.

“There's going to be a lot more options for consumers at different price points, different segments,” she said.

That could be one legacy that outlives the EV tax credit.",https://img.apmcdn.org/0150e8facc1096c95eb78d6ad4d768d4ef54090d/widescreen/ae3c18-20250708-aerial-view-of-a-busy-highway-2000.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:14:16.807136

The facility would be Alaska’s first green ammonia plant.
Pacific H2 said the green ammonia facility could bring 150 jobs to Adak, where about 50 people live today.
While conventional ammonia production relies heavily on fossil fuels, green ammonia is produced entirely using renewable energy sources.
After those approvals, Pacific H2 would need to secure the $1.7 to $2.5 billion in funding.","The Aleut Corp., Adak’s regional Native corporation, signed an agreement in May to lease 3,500 acres to Pacific H2, an Oregon-based energy company. The 90-year lease allows Pacific H2 to build wind turbines that would power a permanently docked green ammonia plant in Adak’s harbor. The facility would be Alaska’s first green ammonia plant.

“This is a transformational opportunity for Aleut and for Adak,” said Skoey Vergen, CEO of the Aleut Corp. “It isn't just a clean energy project, it's an economic engine for Adak and the entire Aleut region.”

Vergen described the green ammonia facility as a potential “anchor point” for revitalizing Adak, an island that formerly housed a large military base.

The project would be Pacific H2’s first facility and could cost nearly $2 billion to complete. The company plans to start a yearlong wind study this summer for the 70 wind turbines proposed for the project.

Pacific H2 said the green ammonia facility could bring 150 jobs to Adak, where about 50 people live today. The island has a lot of abandoned infrastructure from a naval air station that closed in 1997, and residents have been looking into ways to revitalize their community.

Adak City Manager Breck Craig said the community is mostly excited about the facility’s potential benefits, like high-paying jobs and access to renewable energy.

“It's a real game changer, as long as they can address the environmental concerns around ammonia,” Craig said.

So what exactly is green ammonia? It’s not the color that makes it “green” – it’s how the ammonia is produced. While conventional ammonia production relies heavily on fossil fuels, green ammonia is produced entirely using renewable energy sources.

Pacific H2 would use Adak’s wind and water to power and produce the facility. The company expects the plant will make more than 2,000 tons of ammonia annually.

Ammonia can be toxic in high concentrations, a particular concern given that part of Adak lies within the federally protected Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge.

Pacific H2’s CEO Charles Deister said the facility would follow established safety protocols used in industrial ammonia plants for decades, including double-walled pipes and multiple containment systems.

“We’ll have gas detection systems, emergency ventilation systems, there'll be various alarms, automatic shutdown valves,” Deister said in a community presentation in June.

The company also plans to establish a “buffer zone” prohibiting vessel traffic around the facility.

So why invest in green ammonia? According to Deister, green ammonia is in high demand in Asia, making Adak’s location ideal for shipping.

“Adak is as far west as we can get. It reduces the shipping time to the lowest possible,” he said. “For example, Adak to Tokyo is a seven-day shipping time at 14 knots.”

The project still needs permits and environmental reviews, which could take several years. After those approvals, Pacific H2 would need to secure the $1.7 to $2.5 billion in funding. If all goes according to plan, the facility could begin producing green ammonia by 2032.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/260fc76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3037x1594+0+57/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F18%2Fe2%2F3850207c42f8856fec7664256629%2Fimg-9652.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 23:05:04.078096

Introducing new tax deductions for businesses and rollbacks of clean energy measures, the bill, which was signed into law on July 4, saw criticism from labor unions concerned about workers and apprentices on renewable energy jobs. Some contractors and engineering firms applauded the bill for job creation and growth through extended tax reform.

The 900-page legislation included a wide range of tax breaks, spending cuts, money for national defense and deportation, the Associated Press reported. The new law affects nearly every American citizen, with money for the border wall and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP funding.

The legislation has around $4.5 trillion in tax cuts, which lawmakers said was crucial as tax breaks from Trump’s first term were set to expire in December, the AP reported. It will solidify the tax cuts approved in the president’s first term.

The SALT cap, which is a deduction limit on payment for state and local taxes, will quadruple from $10,000 to $40,000 through 2029, as reported by the AP.

Clean energy tax credits axed under ‘big beautiful’ bill

A big provision in the bill is cutting tax credits that were designed to boost clean energy projects that used renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. In 2022, former president Joe Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act which focused on addressing climate change by incentivizing the use of renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Different legs of the construction industry have watched the IRA closely as the bill included prevailing wage and registered apprenticeship participation for clean energy credits. Around $2.7 billion in tax credits were included in the IRA for clean manufacturing and recycling, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Tax breaks for solar and wind were crucial for labor unions such as the Laborers’ International Union of North America. After the Senate passed the bill, Kent Miller, president and business manager of the Wisconsin Laborers’ District Council, said on social media the Senate’s version of the bill was a “jobs killer for the wind and solar industry.”

The bill included a provision that would get rid of tax credits for projects if they aren’t completed by 2027, Miller added.

“That means some projects that were counting on those credits may not move forward and that means less job opportunities for our members,” Miller said. “You might say, “Hey, I don’t work in solar, so this doesn’t affect me.” But as trade unionists we believe an injury to one is an injury to all. And health and pension funds live and die on growing members and growing more work hours,” he added.

Miller addressed the fact that the legislation included a temporary tax deduction on overtime.

“Not taxing your overtime doesn’t mean [expletive] if you don’t have a job,” he said.

Seven Wisconsin labor leaders representing trades such as painters, sheet metal workers, plumbers, concrete masons and electricians on July 2 took part in a virtual press event to speak out against the “big beautiful” bill and its rollbacks for federal incentives.

The BlueGreen Alliance, a nonprofit bridging labor unions and environmentalist groups that hosted the event, shared that the bill will risk $8.6 billion in private investments and put more than 7,000 jobs at risk in Wisconsin.

Andy Buck, the director of governmental affairs for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades District Council 7, said clean energy projects put union members to work and gave apprentices a start in the trades. Because of high apprenticeship participation standards, IUPAT saw a record number of apprentices last year, he added.

However, repealing the energy tax credit will mean communities already planning projects using that credit will have to rethink their plans, Buck said.

Engineering companies applaud the legislation

Before the bill made it to Trump’s desk, the American Council of Engineering Companies leadership on July 3 praised chambers of Congress for passing the spending bill and for its extension of tax laws established under the previous administration.

“ACEC applauds the passage of this critical legislation that will promote job creation and innovation across the U.S. Economy,” said Linda Bauer Darr, president and CEO of ACEC, in a statement. “The extension of the 2017 Tax Law will deliver critical certainty for American businesses. These are pro-growth policies that directly support investment, innovation, and workforce expansion, especially in the engineering sector,” she added.

Eighty-two percent of engineering companies used their tax savings from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to hire new employees, data from the ACEC Research Institute showed. Tax savings were also used to invest in technology and expand services, officials added.

Among scores of business-related tax cuts, the legislation will allow businesses to write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.

“In addition, this bill includes a long-sought provision by ACEC to permanently restore full deductibility of R&D expenses for engineering firms,” Darr said. “Engineering firms are in the innovation business, designing the next generation of American infrastructure, and it was critical to restore the tax code’s traditional role in incentivizing research and development.

“As the bill heads to the president’s desk, we commend both chambers of Congress for delivering a package that gives America’s engineering industry the certainty it needs to improve our communities while developing the next generation of engineers. While more work remains, particularly around energy tax policy, this legislation is a strong step forward for America’s future,” Darr added.

The Associated Builders and Contractors also applauded the bill’s signing.

“On this July 4, ABC celebrates Congress and the White House working together to bring this pro-growth tax reform to reality for the millions of hardworking Americans who build and power our economy,” said Kristen Swearingen, ABC vice president of government affairs, in a statement. “This new law provides long-overdue tax certainty that empowers construction businesses to invest in their workforce, expand operations and keep America building,” she added.

The legislation provided certainty to more than 95% of American businesses structured as S corporations, partnerships and sole proprietorships, ABC officials said. Those businesses employ 62% of the private sector workforce, officials added.

Highlighted reforms included solidifying deductions for small businesses, a permanent increase to the estate tax exclusion amount, restoration of full bonus depreciation and expanding the use of 529 savings accounts for career and technical education in the skilled trades.

“Now that this critical legislation has been signed, we urge Congress and the administration to build on this momentum by enacting additional reforms to reduce regulatory burdens on businesses,” Swearingen said. “Smart, targeted regulatory relief will give contractors even greater ability to create jobs, strengthen their communities and drive economic growth nationwide,” she added.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/07/Depositphotos_478070700_XL.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 18:15:21.918636

Dirty coal plants that continue to operate despite economic inefficiencies are sometimes called ""zombie"" plants.
""More clean energy will make the U.S. grid stronger, more reliable, and more resilient.""
""The only energy crisis faced by the American public is the catastrophic increase in costs that the Trump administration is forcing on the country's ratepayers.""
In 2017, the first Trump administration also moved to bail out financially floundering coal and nuclear plants.","Green groups warned Tuesday that the Trump administration's plan to invoke a bogus ""energy emergency"" in order to keep old, polluting coal-fired plants running will make electricity generation dirtier and more expensive while failing to produce enough power to keep up with surging demand.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Energy published a resource adequacy analysis that includes plans for boosting fossil-fueled electricity generation, including at coal-fired plants. The report cites President Donald Trump's executive orders declaring a national energy emergency and strengthening the reliability and security of the nation's electric grid, and highlights the DOE's plan to classify aging fossil fuel plants as critical to system reliability. The administration is also likely to continue invoking Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and the Defense Production Act in order to extend the lifespans of older fossil fuel plants.

Although the analysis acknowledges that ""old tools won't solve new problems,"" its methodology supports keeping expensive and polluting coal plants in operation. Dirty coal plants that continue to operate despite economic inefficiencies are sometimes called ""zombie"" plants.

""More clean energy will make the U.S. grid stronger, more reliable, and more resilient.""

Not only does the report fail to state that the burning of fossil fuels is the leading driver of the climate emergency, it does not even mention the word ""climate"" once in its 73 pages. This tracks with the Trump administration's long-standing proscription of the term ""climate change.""

""The methodology released today is another attempt to push the false narrative that our country's energy future depends upon decades-old coal and gas plants, rather than clean renewables,"" said Sierra Club senior attorney Greg Wannier. ""The only energy crisis faced by the American public is the catastrophic increase in costs that the Trump administration is forcing on the country's ratepayers.""

Wannier noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and states ""are already well equipped to meet any projected resource needs through the existing regulatory process, which ensures that electricity demand is reliably met at the least public cost.""

""Any effort by DOE to override this process to forcibly keep coal plants online past their planned retirements would be an extraordinary and unlawful overreach of its regulatory authority,"" Wannier added. ""It would be particularly harmful and costly to the communities living near these power plants who face the possibility of continued exposure to toxic levels of air and water pollution.""

Ted Kelly, director and lead counsel for U.S. clean energy at the Environmental Defense Fund, said Tuesday:

The Trump administration is once again putting its thumb on the scale to help old, dirty power sources at the expense of air quality, public health, and higher energy bills for American families and businesses. This time it has issued a methodology that uses dodgy accounting to ignore all the clean energy we have at our disposal—including solar, wind, and battery technologies that are helping meet our nation's energy needs and support the reliability of our electric grid—in order to make a bogus case that these old, dirty power plants are needed. The administration's deeply flawed approach can't hide the fact that clean energy resources are helping keep lights on and lower electricity bills across the country, while keeping old, dirty power plants on life support will mean higher power bills for families and more toxic, cancer-causing pollution in the air we breathe.

The Trump administration has already used the nonexistent energy emergency in a push to fast-track fossil fuel permitting, keep fossil-fueled plants operating, and to wage lawfare against Democrat-controlled states trying to hold Big Oil financially accountable for its role in causing the climate emergency. In 2017, the first Trump administration also moved to bail out financially floundering coal and nuclear plants.

""No matter how they try to gussy it up, bailing out coal or other fossil fuels when low-cost solar and wind power is growing so quickly makes even less sense today than it did in 2017 when the previous Trump administration tried it before,"" Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), said in response to the DOE plan.

""It's ironic that the Energy Department is warning about reliability just days after Republicans in Congress repealed the clean energy tax credits,"" Kennedy added, referring to a provision in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by Trump on Friday.

NRDC cites analysts' predictions that the legislation will reduce additions of the electricity needed to meet rapidly growing demand and raise wholesale electricity prices as much as 25% by 2030 and up to 74% by 2035.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61180292&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C76%2C0%2C77,N,,2025-07-08 22:04:21.141686

Despite this, analysts expect the EV market to grow.
VinFast's sales in the United States are very limited, comprising only 6.2% of total revenues in 2024.
However, the company must deal with 25% automotive tariffs, which hurt its competitiveness in the United States.
While VinFast Auto currently has a Moderate Buy rating among analysts, top-rated analysts believe these five stocks are better buys.","Understanding the electric vehicle market has become increasingly important over the past several years as EV sales have really started to explode.

Looking forward, EVs are likely to become a larger part of the overall economy, presenting a significant opportunity for investors. The International Energy Agency reported that in 2024, 20% of new cars sold were electric vehicles. They expect this number to grow to 40% by 2030, positioning EVs as a clear growth market. However, the path to this is not likely to be a straight one, especially as government attitudes toward EVs shift.

Take the passing of President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” for example. It means that the significant tax breaks that come from buying EVs in the United States will expire in September, which will weigh on adoption. Despite this, analysts expect the EV market to grow.

VinFast Auto NASDAQ: VFS and Lucid Group NASDAQ: LCID stand out as two electric vehicle stocks with high upside potential, positioned to benefit from shifting market dynamics and evolving U.S. policies.

Big Beautiful Bill Increases VinFast’s Chances of U.S. Success

VinFast makes and sells relatively low-cost EVs primarily in Vietnam. The MarketBeat consensus price target on the company is $5.75, implying that shares could rise by nearly 64%.

Ending the EV tax credit actually helps VinFast. Its vehicles were not eligible to receive it before, putting it at a disadvantage in the U.S. market. Now, the playing field will become more level as domestic companies will no longer receive the credit either.

VinFast's sales in the United States are very limited, comprising only 6.2% of total revenues in 2024. Thus, the United States represents a significant growth opportunity for VinFast that just became easier to capitalize on. However, the company must deal with 25% automotive tariffs, which hurt its competitiveness in the United States.

Still, Vinfast clearly doesn’t need the United States to grow fast. EV deliveries spiked 296% last quarter, while E-scooter deliveries rose 473%. The company is still deeply unprofitable, with a gross margin of negative 35%. However, this figure is a big improvement over its negative 59% gross margin a year ago. VinFast will need to continue making progress here by accelerating production and deliveries to achieve greater economies of scale. The recent opening of the company’s second factory should aid this. The company also just signed with its first authorized dealership in California as it looks to expand its U.S. presence.

Recent Price Targets Indicate +40% Upside in Lucid

The MarketBeat consensus price target on Lucid is $2.68, implying a solid but not huge 27% upside in shares. However, focusing on the stock’s two most recent price target updates paints a considerably more bullish picture. Both come in at $3, which implies 42% upside in shares.

In contrast to VinFast, most of the company’s revenue comes from the United States, accounting for around 73% of its total sales in 2024. The rest of the company’s sales primarily come from Saudi Arabia. The company will no longer be able to benefit from tax credits post-September, but some believe that this will actually help Lucid.

That includes James Picariello of BNP Paribas. He believes that the sunsetting of the credit means that Lucid will face less EV competition. This is because companies that make both EVs and gas-powered vehicles may “deemphasize” their EV ambitions in the United States as government incentives go away. This is plausible, but it is also important to note that companies like Ford Motor NYSE: F have invested billions in their EV efforts. Given the long-term growth many see in this market, they are not likely to simply hand over this growth to EV pure plays.

In Q2, Lucid’s vehicle deliveries hit 3,309, rising by 38% compared to the same period a year ago. Like many early-stage EV makers, Lucid remains highly unprofitable. It will need to significantly boost deliveries to change this.

Winning in the United States Is Key to VinFast and Lucid’s Success

VinFast and Lucid are attempting to compete in the crowded U.S. vehicle market. Success will be key to achieving the scale required to be profitable one day. With EV tax credits set to expire soon, shifts in the competitive landscape may help their ambitions, which could help shares achieve the significant upside some analysts see.

“While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim,” reports Tech Crunch.

A potent combination of tariffs, anti-clean energy legislation, and stunningly bad PR have led to devastating drops in the company’s share values, with reverberating consequences for the company’s many ventures, not to mention clean energy tech research and development writ large.

Tesla has been failing to meet its forecasts for a while now, even with projections much reduced to reflect the current policy atmosphere. For two consecutive financial quarters, the company’s vehicle deliveries have fallen short of 400,000. Bloomberg reports that “Tesla Inc. is in trouble,” adding that “having promised a revolutionary new automated product for a decade, missing repeated deadlines, the company finally launched a limited, somewhat automated pilot that looks years behind the competition.”

While the company’s electric vehicle sales numbers have been dismal since the middle of last year, the company has had at least one bright spot of growth in its portfolio – its energy storage business. Between 2020 and 2024, revenue derived from energy storage and solar installations ballooned from $2 billion to $10.1 billion. But even this business is not immune to the pall cast over the company. Deployments of its Powerwall and Megapack stationary storage products have declined in the first two quarters of this year.

On Monday, Tesla’s stock tumbled 7.5% in a single morning as the (in)famous founder and Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk announced that he will be forming his own political party. This move comes on the heels of a frenzied period of collaboration followed by a high-profile fracas with President Donald Trump. Investors are clearly worried about Musk’s behavior, and the stock market is reflecting that defection.

“Very simply, Musk diving deeper into politics and now trying to take on the Beltway establishment is exactly the opposite direction that Tesla investors/shareholders want him to take during this crucial period for the Tesla story,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, recently told The Guardian. He added that there is a “broader sense of exhaustion” among Tesla investors stemming from Musk’s repeated and divisive involvement in the political sphere.

Ironically, Musk’s company has been kneecapped by the very same political party and policy initiatives that Musk himself helped spearhead in the initial months of the Trump presidency. While Musk stood with his arms folded in the Oval Office, his company was releasing statements against Trump’s proposed end to clean energy tax credits, writing on X (also owned by Musk) that “abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid.”

The current administration’s approach to clean energy subsidies and international trade amount to a whole lot of bad news for nearly all of Tesla’s portfolio, including energy storage. “While battery storage installations might continue to receive tax credits under the bill, new restrictions over parts or materials sourced from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) could make any remaining tax credits nearly impossible to claim,” reports Tech Crunch. Like so many other domestic clean energy supply chains, the lion’s share of raw materials are sourced from China, which dominates global critical mineral refining.

Musk is now publicly distancing himself from Trump, but the damage is already done. The bottom is about to fall out of electric vehicle sales thanks to the Big Beautiful Bill, a (highly predictable) outcome which Musk realized “too late.”

The impact of the bill on domestic clean energy, energy storage, and other major growth sectors in global energy markets are likely to hit American consumers hard, potentially “setting America up for the worst energy-affordability crisis since the 1970s.” Meanwhile, Elon Musk is still the richest person on planet earth, by a comfortable margin.

We discussed the version of the bill that passed in the House in May (the House bill) in our previous update. On July 1, the Senate passed the OBBBA, which was then passed in the House on July 3 and signed into law by the president on July 4.

The OBBBA includes significant changes to the timing and availability of several clean energy tax credits, including the clean energy ITC (CEITC) and PTC (CEPTC), the clean hydrogen PTC, the advanced manufacturing credit, and the zero-emission nuclear PTC, as well as restrictions related to foreign entities applicable to such credits and to the carbon capture sequestration credit. The OBBBA includes various timeframes for grandfathering renewable energy projects from such changes.

A chart of key dates for solar, wind, and battery projects under the OBBBA can be downloaded here.

Key Changes

This alert focuses on issues of particular significance to the energy industry and the timeframes for beginning construction before the relevant effective dates and is not intended to be comprehensive. Four key changes discussed below include:

Accelerated phase-out of various clean energy tax credits;

New restrictions related to foreign entities of concern (FEOC);

Adoption of existing beginning of construction guidance for purposes of the FEOC restrictions; and

Denial of CEITC and CEPTC for small wind leasing arrangements.

Accelerated Phase-Out/Sunset of CEPTC, CEITC, Clean Hydrogen PTC, and Advanced Manufacturing Credits

Sections 45Y (the CEPTC) and 48E (the CEITC)

For solar and wind projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (the date which is 12 months after enactment), the OBBBA phases out the CEPTC and CEITC for projects placed in service after 2027.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the phase-out period for the CEPTC and the CEITC for all projects (including solar and wind) would have occurred over three calendar years, commencing upon the later of 2032 and the year in which greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production have been reduced by 75% from 2022 levels.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The one-year ""beginning of construction"" standard is much more accommodating than both the 60-day standard in the House bill and the ""date of enactment"" standard in an early draft of the OBBBA in the Senate. The early draft of the OBBBA in the Senate also included an excise tax that applied to solar and wind projects based on use of foreign materials, which is no longer included in the OBBBA. We note that the 2027 placed in service deadline is unlikely to apply to many utility-scale solar and wind projects given typical project development timelines.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The final OBBBA does not include the elimination of five-year MACRS for CEITC and CEPTC property that was included in early drafts of the Senate bill.

Section 45V (Clean Hydrogen PTC)

The OBBBA accelerates the phase-out for the clean hydrogen PTC by revising the beginning of construction deadline to January 1, 2028.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the beginning of construction deadline for the clean hydrogen PTC was January 1, 2033.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: It may be more challenging for clean hydrogen projects to meet the beginning of construction deadline than wind or solar projects, given that the industry is still nascent and many developers are not yet able to procure significant equipment. However, the December 31, 2027, deadline is much more accommodating than the House bill, which included a December 31, 2025, deadline.

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Credits)

The Section 45X advanced manufacturing credit applies different credit rates to the production of different eligible components.

For tax years beginning after enactment, the OBBBA modifies the relevant phase-out and termination dates for certain types of eligible components and the requirements for battery modules.

Metallurgical coal was added as an applicable critical mineral, but the advanced manufacturing credit rate is only 2.5% (as opposed to the 10% rate for other applicable critical minerals).

For applicable critical minerals (except for metallurgical coal), the OBBBA adds a phase-out that begins in 2031 (prior law included no phase-out or termination for critical minerals). The OBBBA terminates the credit for wind energy components and metallurgical coal. For wind energy components, the advanced manufacturing credit is terminated for components produced and sold after December 31, 2027. For metallurgical coal, the advanced manufacturing credit is terminated for metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, the phase-out period for the advanced manufacturing credit was set to begin in 2030 for eligible components other than critical minerals, with the complete phase-out for components sold after 2032.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The accelerated phase-out for wind components is consistent with the Administration's other policies, including a presidential memorandum targeting wind energy and an order to stop work on the Empire Wind 1 Project.

Finally, the term ""battery module"" was modified to clarify that battery modules are comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.

Restrictions on Foreign Entities and Investors

The OBBBA includes complex restrictions related to relationships with or assistance from certain FEOCs, which apply to the CEITC, CEPTC, the Section 45Q carbon capture sequestration credit, the Section 45U nuclear PTC, and the advanced manufacturing credit.

For taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, no such credit is available if the facility is owned by a ""specified foreign entity"" (SFE). An SFE is defined in the OBBBA to include specifically identified threats to the security of the U.S., Chinese military companies operating in the U.S., entities subject to Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act restrictions, and battery-producing entities eligible for Department of Defense contracts as identified by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: This definition includes Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL), BYD Company, Envision Energy, EVE Energy Company, Gotion High Tech Company, and Hithium Energy Storage Company, thus impacting significantly all battery energy storage systems.

SFEs also include foreign-controlled entities. An entity will generally be a ""foreign-controlled entity"" only if it is owned more than 50% by entities or individuals with ties to North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran.

In addition, for taxable years beginning after two years after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, no credit is allowed under Section 45U if the facility is owned by a ""foreign-influenced entity"" (FIE). Further, no credit is allowed under Section 45Q, Section 45X, Section 45Y, and Section 48E for any taxable year beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA if the facility is owned by an FIE. An FIE is one that satisfies one of two tests: first, one of the following conditions must be met during the applicable taxable year: (i) an SFE has authority to appoint a covered officer, (ii) a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity, (iii) one or more SFEs own in the aggregate 40% or more of the entity, or (iv) at least 15% of the entity's debt is held in the aggregate by one or more SFEs. Second, during the previous taxable year, the entity must have made a payment to an SFE pursuant to a contract, agreement or other arrangement which entitles such SFE (or an entity related to such SFE) to exercise control over (i) any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer) or (ii) with respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), (a) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral, or (b) the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral.

Effectively controlled entities are ineligible for credits. For purposes of defining an FIE, the OBBBA broadens the definition of effective control to encompass licensing agreements and related contractual arrangements with respect to a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible facility where (i) a contractual counterparty retains any of the following rights to: (A) control sourcing of components and subcomponents, (B) direct operations, (C) restrict the taxpayer's use of intellectual property, (D) receive royalties beyond 10 years of a licensing or similar agreement, (E) direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into service agreements exceeding two years, (ii) such agreement fails to provide the licensee with the technical data and know-how necessary to produce an eligible component independently, without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or an SFE, or (iii) such agreement was entered into after the date of enactment. However, the OBBBA carves out the bona fide purchase and sale of intellectual property from the restrictions, excluding purchases where the intellectual property reverts after a period of time.

The OBBBA provides that the Secretary shall issue such guidance with respect to the FIE provisions no later than December 31, 2026.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: If read literally, the practical effect of the ""entered into after the date of enactment"" standard is that any licensing agreements executed after July 4, 2025 are deemed to provide the licensee with effective control.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The OBBBA's omission of the FEOC rules from Section 48 means that geothermal heat pump property that begins construction before January 1, 2035, will not be subject to the FEOC rules if the Section 48 ITC is claimed with respect to such property.

In addition to the ownership-related restrictions described above, new project-level restrictions prevent facilities from being eligible for the CEITC, CEPTC, or advanced manufacturing credits if they begin construction after the end of 2025 (or, in the case of the advanced manufacturing credits in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, if an eligible component is used in a product sold before January 1, 2027) and receive ""material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity"" (PFE). A PFE is an SFE or an FIE. The term ""material assistance"" from a PFE means that, with respect to any property, a facility has a ""material assistance cost ratio"" that is less than the applicable threshold percentage.

With respect to any qualified facility or energy storage technology, the threshold percentage is 40% in the case of a qualified facility that begins construction in 2026 and is 55% in the case of energy storage technology that begins construction in 2026. The threshold percentage increases 5% each year through 2029. The ""material assistance cost ratio"" for qualified facilities and energy storage technology is an amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to (i) the total direct costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products (including components) incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology other than the total direct costs attributable to all manufactured products (including components) that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, divided by (ii) the total direct costs to the taxpayer attributable to all manufactured products (including components) that are incorporated into the qualified facility or energy storage technology.

The OBBBA requires the Secretary to issue safe harbor tables to identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product or eligible component that is attributable to a PFE and to provide rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer's material assistance from a PFE no later than December 31, 2026. Prior to the issuance of such safe harbor tables, taxpayers may use the tables included in Notice 2025-08 to establish the percentage of the total direct material costs of any listed eligible component and any manufactured product, and rely on a certification by the supplier of the manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent of an eligible component regarding (i) the total direct costs or the total direct material costs, as applicable, of such product or component that was not produced or manufactured by a PFE, or (ii) that such product or component was not produced or manufactured by a PFE.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: While compliance with the material assistance ratio may not be as burdensome for taxpayers developing projects with domestic content strategies, the compliance burden may be more significant for projects without such strategies in place.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: Certain suppliers may be reluctant to provide certifications since violations of the material assistance ratio resulting from misrepresentations can result a penalty to the person that provides the certification.

Taxpayers may elect to exclude costs from the material assistance cost ratio with respect to a product, component, element, material, or subcomponent that is (i) acquired, manufactured, or assembled pursuant to a binding written contract with a PFE that was entered into before June 16, 2025, and (ii) placed in service before 2030 (or before 2028, in the case of solar and wind property used to generate electricity) in a facility the construction of which begins before August 1, 2025.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The material assistance ratio is expected to impact nearly all major suppliers of battery storage systems and solar modules.

The OBBBA amends the recapture rules for the CEITC to provide that payments to FEOCs result in recapture of the CEITC. However, unlike the normal ITC recapture rules, this FEOC recapture rule applies during the 10-year period beginning at placed in service, and results in 100% recapture at all points during that period.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: The recapture rule for the CEITC is stricter than the FIE disallowance discussed above as applied to the CEPTC because an applicable payment to an SFE results in the recapture of the entire CEITC. With respect to the CEPTC, such a payment results in the disallowance of the CEPTC for the taxable year following the payment.

Adoption of Existing Beginning of Construction Guidance for Purposes of the FEOC Restrictions

For purposes of the FEOC restrictions, the OBBBA provides that the beginning of construction date is determined pursuant to rules similar to Notice 2013-29 and Notice 2018-59 as well as any subsequently issued guidance in effect on January 1, 2025.

Additionally, the OBBBA directs the Secretary to prescribe regulations and guidance to prevent the circumvention of the FEOC restrictions. Further, on July 7, President Trump issued an executive order directing the Treasury to issue new guidance to ensure that policies concerning the ""beginning of construction"" are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: Taxpayers may find it helpful that the OBBBA adopts a familiar standard for the beginning of construction given the longstanding application of the beginning of construction guidance. However, the anti-circumvention rule and executive order indicate the IRS may change the standard to take a more prohibitive approach.

Troutman Pepper Locke Insight: For existing ""beginning of construction"" guidance, please see our prior analysis on Notices 2013-29, 2013-60, 2014-46, 2015-25, 2016-31, 2017-04, 2018-59, 2019-43, 2020-41, and 2021-41.

Denial of Credit for Expenditures for Small Wind Leasing Arrangements

The OBBBA denies the CEITC or CEPTC to solar water heating and wind generation property if the taxpayer rents such property to a third party. Unlike the House bill, solar electric property is not included in the list of prohibited property. Accordingly, residential solar electric property that is leased to customers remains eligible for the CEITC and CEPTC.

Conclusion

As enacted, the OBBBA provides substantive rules and transition rules that are significantly more favorable to the industry than interim versions of the bill that had been proposed. Because certain of the more unfavorable provisions in the OBBBA do not apply to projects that ""begin construction"" as of certain dates, it is essential to consider and implement ""beginning of construction"" strategies for applicable projects as soon as possible.

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.","President Trump signed the “One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act” (the “OBBB”) into law on July 4, 2025. Congress passed the legislation using the budget reconciliation process to avoid the 60-vote Senate filibuster. In addition to making many of the individual tax cuts from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, the bill makes significant changes to many of the clean energy credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Projects that began construction before 2025 and are planning on claiming production tax credits (“PTCs”) or investment tax credits (“ITCs”) under sections 45 and 48 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. However, the OBBB is a mixed bag when it comes to the other energy tax credits that were introduced or extended by the IRA. The OBBB makes substantial cuts to the tech-neutral tax credits for solar and wind and eliminates certain other energy tax credits (e.g., those for hydrogen, EVs and homeowners), but other technologies and activities (e.g., geothermal, carbon capture, nuclear, clean fuel production) experienced fewer claw backs of the benefits provided by the IRA. The OBBB also adds foreign entity of concern (“FEOC”) restrictions to the surviving energy tax credits. Finally, the OBBB expands the definition of “qualifying income” (“QI”) for master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) under section 7704(d)(1)(E).

While a prior version of the OBBB released by the Senate contained an excise tax on certain wind and solar facilities deemed to have received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity (“PFE”), the tax was removed shortly before its passage by the Senate and is not included in the OBBB.

On July 7, 2025, President Trump also issued an Executive Order (Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources) (the “EO”) directing the Secretary of the Treasury to, within 45 days of enactment of the OBBB, “take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” The EO specifically directs Treasury to issue new and revised guidance on “beginning of construction” (BOC), and notes that broad safe harbors should not apply “unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” In the same 45-day window, Treasury is also directed to implement the FEOC restrictions in the OBBB.

Below is a summary of the key changes for the clean energy industry as a result of the enactment of the OBBB.

I. TAX CREDIT AND DEDUCTION MODIFICATIONS

1. Sections 45Y (Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit) and 48E (Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credits when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

PIS DEADLINE: Adds a placed in service (PIS) deadline for solar and wind facilities of December 31, 2027.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after July 4, 2026 (e., more than 12 months after the enactment of OBBB).

Akin Note: Allowing construction to begin for up to one year after enactment was a late change to OBBB. However, taxpayers’ ability to take advantage of this window may be limited as a result of guidance to be issued by Treasury implementing the EO.]

Statute makes clear that batteries are not impacted by this change. Other facilities that qualify for credits under §§ 45Y and 48E (besides solar and wind facilities) are also not impacted.

[Akin Note: The language making clear that batteries are not impacted by this change is arguably not necessary in light of the Treasury position in regulations that energy storage technologies cannot be part of qualified facilities.]

LEASING DISALLOWANCE: Disallows credits for solar electric heating and small wind residential property if the taxpayer rents or leases the property.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., after enactment of the OBBB).

[Akin Note: In earlier versions of OBBB, this rule also applied to residential photovoltaic solar systems. The final enacted version of OBBB does not disallow ITCs or PTCs for residential photovoltaic solar systems.]

PHASEOUT TIMELINE: Sets both §§ 45Y and 48E to begin phasing out in 2032.

Except for solar and wind facilities that have a special PIS deadline (see above), facilities that qualify for either §§ 45Y or 48E and:

BOC before 2034 can access the full credit;

BOC in 2034 can access 75% of the credit;

BOC 2035 can access 50% of the credit; and

BOC after 2035 cannot access either credit.

TAX OWNERSHIP OF GEOTHERMAL HEAT PUMPS: For purposes of determining tax ownership geothermal heat pumps for depreciation and tax credit purposes, the fact that such property is not readily usable by anyone other than the lessee or offtaker is disregarded.

[Akin Note: This point removes a key obstacle to allowing geothermal heat pumps to be subject to “third party ownership” structures which more readily allows for tax equity financing.]

FUEL CELL FACILITIES (§ 48E (ITC) only): Removes requirement that the anticipated greenhouse gas emission rate not be greater than zero for fuel cell facilities.

Changes apply to facilities the construction of which begins after December 31, 2025.

Sets a 30% ITC rate without the ability to increase with adders and apparently without needing to satisfy Prevailing Wage and Apprenticeship requirements.

NUCLEAR ENERGY COMMUNITY (§ 45Y (PTC) only): Creates an energy community adder based on local employment in nuclear facilities, nuclear R&D, and nuclear component manufacturing.

DOMESTIC CONTENT (§ 48E (ITC) only): Facilities that begin construction on and after June 16, 2025, are subject to the same domestic content thresholds for the ITC as the PTC.

Domestic content thresholds are 45% for BOC in 2025, 50% for BOC in 2026 and 55% for BOC in 2027+ (separate rates still apply for off-shore wind).

[Akin Note: This change corrects what has long been viewed as a typo or glitch in the statutory framework.]

Facilities that began construction before June 16, 2024, can utilize a 40% threshold.

2. Section 45Z (Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT EXTENSION: Extends the deadline to sell eligible fuel from December 31, 2027, to December 31, 2029.

EMISSIONS RATES: Disallows emissions rates from being negative, excludes indirect land use changes from the lifecycle analysis, and requires Treasury to provide emissions rates for each specific animal manure feedstock.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

[Akin Note: Many clean fuels producers were hoping to be able to generate multiples of the statutory credit rate as a result of their fuel having negative emissions rates. This change eliminates this possibility, which had previously been implied by other statutory language that contemplated negative emissions rates.]

FEEDSTOCK SOURCING: Requires feedstock to be produced or grown exclusively in the United Stated, Mexico or Canada.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

Disallows any feedstock sources that already generated a 45Z credit but includes a directive to Treasury to issue regulations or guidance to implement this anti-double counting rule.

RELATED PARTY SALES: Directs Treasury to expand the rule allowing sales between related parties prior to a sale to an unrelated party.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL: Eliminates the increased credit rate of $1.75/gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but the standard $1.00/gallon rate remains available for SAF.

Applies to transportation fuels produced after December 31, 2025.

EXCISE TAX CREDIT: Eliminates the ability to claim § 45Z and the § 6426(k) excise tax credit for the same fuel.

Applies to fuel sold or used on or after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB), and to fuel sold or used before such date if claims for the § 6426(k) excise tax credit have not been paid or allowed as of such date.

3. Section 45Q (Carbon Oxide Sequestration Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT RATES: Equalizes the credit rate for all potential disposal pathways (g., EOR, secure geologic storage and utilization) to $17/MT (indexed for inflation after 2026).

Rate is $36/MT for direct air capture.

Applies to facilities PIS after July 4, 2025 (e., after the date of the enactment of OBBB).

4. Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

SALE OF INTEGRATED COMPONENTS: No credit for the sale of integrated components unless certain requirements are satisfied.

Applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

To the extent an eligible component (called a “primary component”) is incorporated into another eligible component (called a “secondary component”) prior to sale to an unrelated person, a 45X credit is allowed with respect to the primary component only if:

The secondary component is produced in the same manufacturing facility as the primary component; and

At least 65% of the total direct material costs of the secondary component are attributable to primary components which are mined, produced or manufactured in the United States.

PHASEOUT FOR WIND ENERGY COMPONENTS: Wind energy components, sold after December 31, 2027, no longer generate a 45X credit.

PHASEOUT FOR CRITICAL MINERALS: Adds a phaseout for applicable critical minerals produced after 2030 based on timing of production.

ADDITION OF METALLURGICAL COAL: Metallurgical coal added as an applicable critical mineral.

Defined as “metallurgical coal which is suitable for use in the production of steel (within the meaning of the notice published by the Department of Energy entitled ‘Critical Material list; Addition of Metallurgical Coal Used for Steelmaking’ (90 Fed. Reg. 22711 (May 29, 2025))), regardless of whether such production occurs inside or outside of the United States.”

Generates credit at a special rate of 2.5% of costs (as opposed to 10% for other critical minerals).

Applies only to metallurgical coal produced before December 31, 2029.

REVISED DEFINITION OF BATTERY MODULE: Definition of “battery module” is updated to include a requirement for the module to include “all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment.”

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., taxable years beginning after the enactment of OBBB).

5. Section 45U (Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit)

FEOC: Disallows the credit when certain FEOC provisions are triggered. These provisions are discussed below in Section II.

CREDIT TERMINATION: Terminates credit for electricity produced and sold after December 31, 2032.

6. Terminated Credits and Deductions

SECTION 45V (CLEAN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT): The deadline for beginning construction under §45V is moved up to December 31, 2027 (instead of December 31, 2032).

EV RELATED CREDITS: Credits for EVs and EV charging property are eliminated.

The deadlines for acquiring an eligible vehicle under §§ 25E (Previously Owned Clean Vehicle Credit), 30D (Clean Vehicle Credit), and 45W (Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit) are moved up to September 30, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

The deadline for PIS under § 30C (Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property) is moved up to June 30, 2026 (instead of December 31, 2032).

RESIDENTIAL CREDITS: Credits energy efficient homes and residential clean energy tax credits are eliminated.

The PIS deadline for residential clean energy property under § 25D (Residential Clean Energy Credit) of December 31, 2034, is replaced with a deadline for incurring expenditures of December 31, 2025.

The deadline for PIS for energy efficiency improvements, residential energy property expenditures and home energy audits under § 25C (Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit) is December 31, 2025 (instead of December 31, 2032).

REPEAL OF 5-YEAR MACRS: Removes the ability to utilize 5-year MACRS schedules under § 168 for “energy property” described in § 48.

Property eligible for a credit under §§ 45Y and 48E would remain eligible for 5-year MACRS.

ENERGY EFFICIENT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS DEDUCTION: Deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings is eliminated by adding a new BOC deadline of June 30, 2026.

II. NEW FEOC RESTRICTIONS

1. Key Definitions

PROHIBITED FOREIGN ENTITY (“PFE”): Means any “Specified Foreign Entity” or “Foreign-Influenced Entity”.

Generally, determination is made as of the last day of each taxable year.

For the first taxable year beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB), determination is made as of the first date of such taxable year (except with respect to status as a “Foreign-Controlled Entity”).

SPECIFIED FOREIGN ENTITY (“SFE”): A “specified foreign entity” means:

a foreign entity of concern described in subparagraph (A), (B), (D), or (E) of section 9901(8) of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116–283; 15 U.S.C. 4651),

an entity included on a list required by clause (i), (ii), (iv), (iv) of section 2(d)(2)(B) of Public Law 117-78 (135 Stat. 1527),

a foreign-controlled entity.

FOREIGN-CONTROLLED ENTITY:

A “foreign-controlled entity” means:

the government (including any level of government below the national level) of a covered nation;

an agency or instrumentality of a government described in the immediately preceding bullet;

a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation, provided that such person is not an individual who is a citizen, national, or lawful permanent resident of the United States;

an entity or a qualified business unit (as defined in § 989(a)) incorporated or organized under the laws of, or having its principal place of business in, a covered nation; or

other than certain publicly traded entities, an entity (including subsidiary entities) controlled by an entity described in the foregoing bullets.

For purposes of this definition, “control” means, (i) in the case of a corporation, ownership (by vote or value) of more than 50% of the stock of such corporation, (ii) in the case of a partnership, ownership of more than 50% of the profits interests or capital interests in such partnership, or (iii) in any other case, ownership of more than 50% of the beneficial interests in the entity.

For purposes of this definition, “covered nation” has the same meaning given such term under 10 U.S.C. 4872(f)(2) (e., means the Democratic People’s republic of North Korea, the People’s Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the Islamic Republic of Iran).

FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITY (“FIE”):

Other than certain publicly traded entities, an entity with respect to which, during the taxable year,

A specified foreign entity has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer of such entity,

“Covered Officer” means, with respect to an entity: (i) a member of the board of directors, board of supervisors, or equivalent governing body; (ii) an executive-level officer, including the president, chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, general counsel, or senior vice president; or (iii) an individual having powers or responsibilities similar to those of officers or members described in the foregoing bullets.

A single specified foreign entity owns at least 25% of such entity,

One or more specified foreign entities own, in the aggregate, at least 40% of such entity, or

At least 15% of the debt of such entity has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more specified foreign entities, or

Which, during the previous taxable year, made a payment to a specified foreign entity pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which entitles such specified foreign entity (or an entity related to such specified foreign entity) to exercise effective control over:

Any qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), or

With respect to any eligible component produced by the taxpayer (or any person related to the taxpayer), (i) the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral, or (ii) the production of an eligible component which is not an applicable critical mineral.

The term “taxpayer” for purposes of the FIE rules includes any person related to the taxpayer.

ATTRIBUTION RULE: For purposes of the definition of a PFE (and the subsidiary definitions), ownership is determined by taking into account the attribution rules under § 318(a)(2) for purposes of determining ownership of stock in a corporation and with similar principles being applied for non-corporate entities.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL:

“Effective Control” means one or more agreements or arrangements similar to those described in the following bullets (relating to determination prior to the issuance of guidance and licensing arrangements) which provide one or more contractual counterparties of a taxpayer with specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage which are not included in the measures of control through authority, ownership, or debt held which are described in the definition of “foreign-influenced entity”.

During any period prior to the date that guidance has been issued by Treasury, the unrestricted contractual right of a contractual counterparty to:

Determine the quantity determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer;

Determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer or the storage of electrical energy in energy storage technology of the taxpayer;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit of the taxpayer that produces eligible components;

Determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer;

Restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy undertaken at a qualified facility of the taxpayer, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or energy storage technology of the taxpayer, to the personnel or agents of such contractual counterparty; or

On an exclusive basis, maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production by the taxpayer of eligible components or electricity, or

With respect to a licensing agreement for the provision of intellectual property (or any other contract, agreement or other arrangement entered into with a contractual counterparty related to such licensing agreement) with respect to a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or the production of an eligible component:

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to specify or otherwise direct one or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals utilized in a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct the operation of any qualified facility, any energy storage technology, or any production unit that produces an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to limit the taxpayer’s utilization of intellectual property related to the operation of a qualified facility or energy storage technology, or in the production of an eligible component;

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to receive royalties under the licensing agreement or any similar agreement (or payments under any related agreement) beyond the 10th year of the agreement (including modifications or extensions thereof);

A contractual right retained by the contractual counterparty to direct or otherwise require the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than 2 years (including any modifications or extensions thereof);

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable the licensee to produce the eligible component or components subject to the contract, agreement, or other arrangement without further involvement from the contractual counterparty or a specified foreign entity; or

Such contract, agreement, or other arrangement entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

BEGINNING OF CONSTRUCTION (BOC):

Generally, determined pursuant to rules similar to rules under IRS Notice 2013-29 and IRS Notice 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either such Notice), as in effect on January 1, 2025.

Treasury is directed to prescribed regulations and guidance as may be necessary or appropriate to prevent circumvention of the subparagraph relating to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, including the prevention of any evasion with respect to the Material Assistance Cost Ratio “where the fact demonstrate that the beginning of construction of a qualified facility or energy storage technology has not in fact occurred.”

2. Credit Disallowance

SPECIFIED FOREIGN ENTITIES AND FOREIGN INFLUENCED ENTITIES: Prevents “Specified Foreign Entities” and “Foreign-Influenced Entities” from claiming the credit.

SFE restriction applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

Credits Impacted: §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Z, 45Q, 45X, and 45U.

FIE restriction applies to:

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB) for §§ 45Y, 48E, 45Q, and 45X.

“Effective Control” is carved out from the FIE restriction for §§ 45Y, 48E and 45X.

Taxable years beginning after July 4, 2027 for §§ 45Z and 45U.

EFFECTIVE CONTROL: Prevents taxpayers subject to “effective control” by a “specified foreign entity” for a given taxable year from claiming credits if the effective control determination was made with respect to a qualified facility, an energy storage technology, or an eligible component (as applicable).

Applies to §§ 45Y, 48E, and 45X for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (e., enactment of the OBBB).

MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Credits under §§ 45X ,45Y and 48E are disallowed if the taxpayer receives material assistance from a PFE.

Applies to facilities that BOC after December 31, 2025, for §§ 45Y and 48E.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, for § 45X.

Determination of whether the taxpay received “material assistance” is discussed below in Section II.3.

APPLICABLE PAYMENTS: For any ITC allowed in a taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027 (e., after two years following the enactment of OBBB), recapture of 100% of any allowed ITC is required if an “applicable payment” (defined by cross-reference to payments that trigger “effective control”) is made to a “Prohibited Foreign Entity” within 10-years of placement in service of the facility.

3. Material Assistance

CALCULATION OF RATIO: Requires calculation of a percentage, the numerator of which is direct costs not attributable to PFEs and the denominator of which is all direct costs.

For Qualifying Facilities and Energy Storage Technologies under §§ 45Y and 48E, the calculation focuses on Manufactured Products (including components) and can be expressed as:

For eligible components under § 45X, the calculation focuses on direct material costs related to the production of eligible components and can be expressed as:

QUALIFIED FACILITIES AND ENERGY STORAGE TECHNOLOGY (§45Y/§48E): Requires an increasing amount of a facility’s manufactured products NOT to be manufactured by PFEs based on the beginning of construction date of the qualified facility or energy storage technology. This calculation is called the “Material Assistance Cost Ratio”.

Applies to facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025.

Material Assistance Cost Ratio calculations include qualified interconnection property (as defined in §48E(b)(4)).

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Qualified Facilities:

Material Assistance Cost Ratio for Energy Storage Technology:

ELIGIBLE COMPONENTS (§45X): Requires an increasing amount of an eligible component’s direct material costs NOT to be mined, produced, or manufactured by PFEs based on the year the eligible component is sold.

Applies to taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., after the enactment of OBBB).

Solar Energy Components:

Wind Energy Components:

Battery Components:

Critical Minerals*:

*Subject to increase by Treasury no later than December 31, 2027, taking into account domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs and national security concerns

GUIDANCE ON CALCULATION: Prior to promulgation of new guidance from Treasury (required by December 31, 2026), for purposes of calculating the Material Assistance Cost Ratio, the statute permits reliance on:

IRS Notice 2025-08 (relating to certain safe harbors for domestic content adder calculations), but scope of such reliance is not yet clear; and

[Akin Note: This guidance only applies to §§ 45Y and 48E projects, and thus there is no current guidance for calculation of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio in the context of § 45X credits.

4. Audit and Penalty Provisions

EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR MATERIAL ASSISTANCE: Extends the statute of limitations from three to six years for assessing deficiencies related to the material assistance rules.

REDUCED PENALTY THRESHOLD: Reduces the threshold from 10% to 1% for the threshold to assess penalties related to a substantial understatement of income tax if the cause is an overstatement of the Material Assistance Cost Ratio with respect to the determination of credits under §§ 45Y, 48E or 45X.

NEW SUPPLIER CERTIFICATION PENALTY: Creates a new penalty based on inaccurate supplier certifications that result in a disallowance of credit.

Penalty applies where:

the certifying person knew or reasonably should have known that (A) the certification was inaccurate and (B) the certification would be used in connection with a credit determination; and

the disallowance exceeds the lesser of (x) 5% of the tax required to be shown on the return for the taxable year to be shown on the return and (y) $100,000.

Penalty is the greater of (x) 10% of the underpayment and (y) $5,000.

In executive order, Trump delivers on promise to ‘deal with’ wind and solar In an executive order on Monday, President Trump directed the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” restricting which projects will still qualify for wind and solar tax credits.","Copper traders and producers have anticipated tariffs on copper since Trump announced in February that his administration would investigate the national security implications of copper imports, calling the metal an “essential material for national security, economic strength, and industrial resilience.”

Trump has already imposed tariffs for similarly strategically and economically important metals such as steel and aluminum. The process for imposing these tariffs under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 involves a finding by the Secretary of Commerce that the product being tariffed is essential to national security, and thus that the United States should be able to supply it on its own.

Copper has been referred to as the “metal of electrification” because of its centrality to a broad array of electrical technologies, including transmission lines, batteries, and electric motors. Electric vehicles contain around 180 pounds of copper on average. “Copper, scrap copper, and copper’s derivative products play a vital role in defense applications, infrastructure, and emerging technologies, including clean energy, electric vehicles, and advanced electronics,” the White House said in February.

Copper prices had risen around 25% this year through Monday. Prices for copper futures jumped by as much as 17% after the tariff announcement and are currently trading at around $5.50 a pound.

The tariffs, when implemented, could provide renewed impetus to expand copper mining in the United States. But tariffs can happen in a matter of months. A copper mine takes years to open — and that’s if investors decide to put the money toward the project in the first place. Congress took a swipe at the electric vehicle market in the U.S. last week, extinguishing subsidies for both consumers and manufacturers as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. That will undoubtedly shrink domestic demand for EV inputs like copper, which could make investors nervous about sinking years and dollars into new or expanded copper mines.

Even if the Trump administration succeeds in its efforts to accelerate permitting for and construction of new copper mines, the copper will need to be smelted and refined before it can be used, and China dominates the copper smelting and refining industry.

The U.S. produced just over 1.1 million tons of copper in 2023, with 850,000 tons being mined from ore and the balance recycled from scrap, according to United States Geological Survey data. It imported almost 900,000 tons.

With the prospect of tariffs driving up prices for domestically mined ore, the immediate beneficiaries are those who already have mines. Shares in Freeport-McMoRan, which operates seven copper mines in Arizona and New Mexico, were up over 4.5% in afternoon trading Tuesday.

More than 100 people — many of them children — ultimately died as extreme rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to rise 34 feet in 90 minutes. But the tragedy was “not really a failure of meteorology,” UCLA and UC Agriculture and Natural Resources climate scientist Daniel Swain said during a public “Office Hours” review of the disaster on Monday. The National Weather Service in San Antonio and Austin first warned the public of the potential for heavy rain on Sunday, June 29 — five days before the floods crested. The agency followed that with a flood watch warning for the Kerrville area on Thursday, July 3, then issued an additional 21 warnings, culminating just after 1 a.m. on Friday, July 4, with a wireless emergency alert sent to the phones of residents, campers, and RVers along the Guadalupe River.

The NWS alerts were both timely and accurate, and even correctly predicted an expected rainfall rate of 2 to 3 inches per hour. If it were possible to consider the science alone, the official response might have been deemed a success.

Of all the storm systems, convective storms — like thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes, and extreme rainstorms — are some of the most difficult to forecast. “We don’t have very good observations of some of these fine-scale weather extremes,” Swain told me after office hours were over, in reference to severe meteorological events that are often relatively short-lived and occur in small geographic areas. “We only know a tornado occurred, for example, if people report it and the Weather Service meteorologists go out afterward and look to see if there’s a circular, radial damage pattern.” A hurricane, by contrast, spans hundreds of miles and is visible from space.

Global weather models, which predict conditions at a planetary scale, are relatively coarse in their spatial resolution and “did not do the best job with this event,” Swain said during his office hours. “They predicted some rain, locally heavy, but nothing anywhere near what transpired.” (And before you ask — artificial intelligence-powered weather models were among the worst at predicting the Texas floods.)

Over the past decade or so, however, due to the unique convective storm risks in the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and other meteorological agencies have developed specialized high resolution convection-resolving models to better represent and forecast extreme thunderstorms and rainstorms.

NOAA’s cutting-edge specialized models “got this right,” Swain told me of the Texas storms. “Those were the models that alerted the local weather service and the NOAA Weather Prediction Center of the potential for an extreme rain event. That is why the flash flood watches were issued so early, and why there was so much advanced knowledge.”

Writing for The Eyewall, meteorologist Matt Lanza concurred with Swain’s assessment: “By Thursday morning, the [high resolution] model showed as much as 10 to 13 inches in parts of Texas,” he wrote. “By Thursday evening, that was as much as 20 inches. So the [high resolution] model upped the ante all day.”

To be any more accurate than they ultimately were on the Texas floods, meteorologists would have needed the ability to predict the precise location and volume of rainfall of an individual thunderstorm cell. Although models can provide a fairly accurate picture of the general area where a storm will form, the best current science still can’t achieve that level of precision more than a few hours in advance of a given event.

Climate change itself is another factor making storm behavior even less predictable. “If it weren’t so hot outside, if it wasn’t so humid, if the atmosphere wasn’t holding all that water, then [the system] would have rained and marched along as the storm drifted,” Claudia Benitez-Nelson, an expert on flooding at the University of South Carolina, told me. Instead, slow and low prevailing winds caused the system to stall, pinning it over the same worst-case-scenario location at the confluence of the Hill Country rivers for hours and challenging the limits of science and forecasting.

Though it’s tempting to blame the Trump administration cuts to the staff and budget of the NWS for the tragedy, the local NWS actually had more forecasters on hand than usual in its local field office ahead of the storm, in anticipation of potential disaster. Any budget cuts to the NWS, while potentially disastrous, would not go into effect until fiscal year 2026.

The proposed 2026 budget for NOAA, however, would zero out the upkeep of the models, as well as shutter the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma, which studies thunderstorms and rainstorms, such as the one in Texas. And due to the proprietary, U.S.-specific nature of the high-resolution models, there is no one coming to our rescue if they’re eliminated or degraded by the cuts.

The impending cuts are alarming to the scientists charged with maintaining and adjusting the models to ensure maximum accuracy, too. Computationally, it’s no small task to keep them running 24 hours a day, every day of the year. A weather model doesn’t simply run on its own indefinitely, but rather requires large data transfers as well as intakes of new conditions from its network of observation stations to remain reliable. Although the NOAA high-resolution models have been in use for about a decade, yearly updates keep the programs on the cutting edge of weather science; without constant tweaks, the models’ accuracy slowly degrades as the atmosphere changes and information and technologies become outdated.

It’s difficult to imagine that the Texas floods could have been more catastrophic, and yet the NOAA models and NWS warnings and alerts undoubtedly saved lives. Still, local Texas authorities have attempted to pass the blame, claiming they weren’t adequately informed of the dangers by forecasters. The picture will become clearer as reporting continues to probe why the flood-prone region did not have warning sirens, why camp counselors did not have their phones to receive overnight NWS alarms, why there were not more flood gauges on the rivers, and what, if anything, local officials could have done to save more people. Still, given what is scientifically possible at this stage of modeling, “This was not a forecast failure relative to scientific or weather prediction best practices. That much is clear,” Swain said.

As the climate warms and extreme rainfall events increase as a result, however, it will become ever more crucial to have access to cutting-edge weather models. “What I want to bring attention to is that this is not a one-off,” Benitez-Nelson, the flood expert at the University of South Carolina, told me. “There’s this temptation to say, ‘Oh, it’s a 100-year storm, it’s a 1,000-year storm.’”

“No,” she went on. “This is a growing pattern.”

2. 17% of the continental U.S. now has restrictions or bans on wind and solar development: Heatmap analysis

The development of new wind and solar power plants is “now heavily restricted or outright banned in about one in five counties across the country,” according to a major new survey of public records and local ordinances by my colleagues Robinson Meyer and Charlie Clynes. Their report found bans and restrictions — such as a rule that wind turbines must be placed a certain number of miles from homes, or that solar farms cannot take up more than 1% of a county’s agricultural land — in a total of 605 U.S. counties, including at least 59 municipalities in the more-renewables-friendly Northeast. In total, the bans and restrictions on renewables cover approximately 17% of the continental United States’ total land mass.

Robinson and Charlie’s findings have not been previously reported, and their research involved calling thousands of counties where laws, in some cases, were not in existing public databases. You can access the full project- and county-level data and associated risk assessments via Heatmap Pro, here.

3. In executive order, Trump delivers on promise to ‘deal with’ wind and solar

In an executive order on Monday, President Trump directed the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” restricting which projects will still qualify for wind and solar tax credits. The order builds on the repeal of renewable energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which had stipulated that such projects would need to begin construction within a year and come online by 2028 to be eligible for the subsidies. Now the government will take a stricter approach to defining “the beginning of construction” to prevent “the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility” by limiting credits to projects in which “a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

Freedom Caucus members had described the tax credits as a sticking point during their late negotiations over the bill. As my colleagues Jael Holzman and Katie Brigham previously reported, North Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman alluded to a conversation with Trump in which the president had assured him that he was “going to deal with [the tax credits] in his own way.” It appears the executive order is the follow-through on that promise. Additionally, Trump’s executive order called for the Department of the Interior to determine whether any of its policies, practices, or regulations “provide preferential treatment to wind and solar facilities in comparison to dispatchable energy sources” and revise them accordingly.

4. DOE resource report warns of blackouts, ‘overreliance on intermittent energy sources’

An Energy Department report released Monday warned that blackouts in the U.S. could “increase by 100% in 2030” if the country continues to close its coal and natural gas power plants. The report, completed at the direction of an April executive order by President Trump, anticipates 209 gigawatts of new generation by 2030 to replace 104 gigawatts of retirements — but “only 22 gigawatts would come from firm baseload generation sources,” so that, “even assuming no retirements, the model found increased risk of outages in 2030 by a factor of 34.” The DOE concluded that the U.S. grid “will not be able to sustain the combined impact of coal and other plant closures, an overreliance on intermittent energy sources like wind and solar, and data center growth, highlighting the urgency of increasing dispatchable energy output.”

The DOE’s report sets the stage for the department to continue to prevent the phase-out of old fossil fuel power plants and open new facilities. Many are skeptical of the agency’s logic, however, pointing to renewable-heavy grid success stories like Texas. The Department of Energy “appears to exaggerate the risk of blackouts and undervalue the contributions of entire resource classes, like wind, solar, and battery storage,” Caitlin Marquis, the managing director at Advanced Energy United, said, per Axios.

5. Trump threatens South Korea, Japan with 25% tariffs

On Monday, the Trump administration sent letters to 14 countries warning them they’ll face tariffs of up to 40% if they don’t reach a trade deal with the U.S. by an August 1 deadline. Significantly, automaking giants Japan and South Korea — which each account for about 4% of U.S. imports, per The New York Times — were among the recipients, and face 25% tariffs according to the letters. As my colleague Jael Holzman previously reported, Japan in particular had been “positioned to be an ally in U.S. efforts to wean off China-linked minerals and signed a minerals trade agreement under Biden,” with the imposition of such tariffs potentially threatening to tank America’s own “mineral supply chain renaissance.”

Chemical Lobby’s Delay Tactics Rejected, but EPA Must Remain Vigilant to Protect Public Health from Asbestos Hazards

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a significant and overdue course correction, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has withdrawn its plan to rewrite or delay the Biden-era ban on chrysotile asbestos, the last form of asbestos still legally in use in the United States. This shift comes after widespread public criticism and mounting pressure from health advocates, scientists and environmental justice leaders demanding that the agency prioritize lives over lobbyists.

Just weeks ago, EPA signaled its intent to stall this life-saving regulation, in what appeared to be a direct concession to chemical industry interests. At the center of that maneuver was a court filing by Lynn Ann Dekleva, Deputy Assistant Administrator for EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, and a former policy director at the American Chemistry Council, the trade group whose members stand to profit from regulatory rollbacks.

That move would have suspended the asbestos ban for years, prolonging exposure to a known carcinogen responsible for an estimated 40,000 deaths annually in the United States. The reversal represents a hard-won reprieve, but the original filing and its motivations reveal a disturbing pattern of regulatory capture and political interference.

“While the withdrawal of this delay is a step in the right direction, it was never voluntary. The agency moved only after facing fierce public pressure and legal accountability,” said Michelle Roos, Executive Director of the Environmental Protection Network. “Let’s be clear: the original decision to delay this ban was a gift to chemical lobbyists, not a science-based policy choice. One down, 30 to go. This is just the beginning of the public backlash against the Trump administration’s plans to roll back 31 standards that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink.”

In formal comments submitted to EPA in June 2024, the Environmental Protection Network endorsed the agency’s determination that asbestos, including legacy uses and disposal, poses an unreasonable risk to human health. EPN emphasized that many workers remain dangerously unprotected due to outdated or unenforced OSHA standards, and highlighted the urgent need for strong federal action to prevent persistent, preventable exposures. The resulting 2024 rule, issued under the amended Toxic Substances Control Act, was the most robust federal measure in decades to phase out chrysotile asbestos in commercial and industrial applications. It affirmed what science has long made clear: there is no safe level of asbestos exposure. The now-withdrawn proposal would have undermined key provisions of that rule, particularly those restricting use in chlorine manufacturing and industrial gaskets, sectors where safer alternatives already exist.

The Environmental Protection Network reaffirms that any further attempt to weaken or delay this ban must be met with unified resistance and warns that this reversal does not mark the end of the administration’s broader deregulatory agenda. It is part of a disturbing pattern of catering to corporate polluters at the expense of human health, environmental safety, and scientific integrity.

“We’re not standing by; we’re standing up,” Roos added. “This administration has shown that it will try to dismantle as many protections as it can get away with. But, every time that they move to put polluters before people, we will push back — loudly, strategically, relentlessly — because it works, in the courts and in the streets. Public health is not up for negotiation.”

In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.
However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits.
The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits.
Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026.","On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the OBBB), which significantly rolls back many of the core tax incentives that clean energy projects have relied on since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Under the new law, tax credits for wind and solar projects phase out much sooner. To qualify, these projects must either be completed by the end of 2027 or begin construction within the next 12 months. This compressed timeline will likely force developers to accelerate their project schedules or risk losing critical tax credits. In contrast, the OBBB largely preserves tax credits into the next decade for newer clean energy technologies, like battery storage and carbon capture.

However, all new clean energy projects must now meet strict new foreign ownership and sourcing requirements to be eligible for any tax credits. Originally introduced under the Biden administration, and limited to electric vehicles and advanced manufacturing tax credits, these “foreign entity of concern” (FEOC) rules have now been expanded under the OBBB to cover virtually all tax credits. The expanded FEOC rules deny credits to projects that are owned or controlled by certain foreign entities — or that purchase components from or make payment to these foreign entities. Notably, the list of FEOCs includes all companies owned or controlled by the Chinese government or its citizens.

Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects face a shorter window to qualify for tax credits. Projects that were under construction by the end of 2024 are largely unaffected by the new law. Projects first starting construction in 2025 must generally comply with the FEOC ownership requirements, and projects beginning construction in 2026 or later must navigate a complex set of FEOC sourcing and payment rules, including proving that an increasing share of components are sourced outside of China.

Going forward, a key factor for most clean energy projects will be the date they begin construction, as this will determine both their eligibility for tax credits and the extent to which they must comply with the FEOC rules. Over the past 12 years, the IRS has issued a series of notices that define what it means for a project to be “under construction” along with related rules on transfers and completion deadlines. The OBBB clarifies that this existing guidance continues to apply for purposes of the effective date of the “material assistance” FEOC rules described below.

However, the Trump administration issued an executive order on July 7, 2026, directing the US Treasury department to revisit the begun construction rules with respect to solar and wind facilities within 45 days, including by “restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” These guidelines (and the extent to which they are changed for solar and wind) are now likely to become central to how developers assess the value of their pipelines and plan future investments. Many in the industry will now rely on these IRS rules to guide investment decisions and accelerate project timelines, as construction start dates become a critical factor in securing favorable tax treatment under the new law.

This Client Alert provides a detailed description of the OBBB’s changes to the tax credits across different technologies and the FEOC rules.

Solar and Wind ITC and PTC

Projects that began construction before 2025 are generally unaffected by the OBBB. Projects that start construction in 2025 or later are eligible under existing law for tax credits that are similar to the investment tax credit (ITC) or production tax credit (PTC) and referred to as “technology neutral credits.” Most of the restrictions in the new law related to renewables are aimed at curtailing these technology neutral credits.

Despite the technology neutral focus of existing law, solar and wind are subject to different — and harsher — treatment under the OBBB than other technologies. Projects have to either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to qualify for credits. Under pre-OBBB law, projects beginning construction in 2025 or 2026 would have until the end of 2029 or the end of 2030, respectively, to be placed in service, or else their developers must demonstrate that work is continuous based on the facts.

Solar and wind projects, as well as other projects eligible for technology neutral tax credits, will also become subject to the FEOC requirements, which are described in further detail below.

Helpfully, the OBBB does not affect eligibility for tax credit adders (e.g., for projects located in an energy community or that meet domestic content requirements), eligibility for accelerated depreciation, the ability to transfer tax credits to third parties for cash, or place restrictions on residential solar leasing. Restrictions on the latter three had been proposed in prior iterations of the bill. The final bill focuses the leasing restriction on solar water heating property or small wind energy property.

Although the domestic content tax credit bonus is retained, the OBBB fixes an apparent glitch from the Inflation Reduction Act that would have increased the qualification threshold to up to 55% over time for PTC projects but left the ITC threshold static at 40%. ITC projects that began construction before June 16, 2025, can still rely on a 40% threshold, but projects seeking to claim a domestic content adder that began construction after that date must meet a domestic content threshold of 45%, with increasing annual thresholds that match the PTC version thereafter.

Storage and Other Technologies Eligible for the ITC and PTC

Non-solar and wind technologies (e.g., storage, hydropower, and geothermal) fare much better under the OBBB. Tax credits for these projects are subject to a phase-down schedule that begins for projects that commence construction after 2033. Projects beginning construction in 2034 and 2035 will still qualify for tax credits but with a 75% and 50% haircut, respectively. These projects must meet the traditional continuity test, which requires placement in service by the end of the fourth year after the end of the year in which construction starts, or else demonstrate that construction was continuous based on the facts.

Fuel cells (including linear generators) were added as a special category of ITC-eligible technology. Fuel cell projects generally involve some level of greenhouse gas emissions, which would make them ineligible for the technology neutral ITC pre-OBBB. They are newly eligible for a 30% ITC without regard to emissions and are also exempt from prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. They cannot qualify for tax credit adders. Eligibility begins for projects that start construction after 2025.

Clean Fuels

The OBBB significantly modifies the section 45Z PTC for clean transportation fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel. The credit is extended by two years to cover fuel sold through December 31, 2029, but reduces the value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon beginning for fuel produced after 2025. The OBBB also eliminates the excise tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel with respect to any sale or use after September 30, 2025, and prohibits double counting by barring 45Z credits on any fuel produced from fuel that would have qualified for 45Z credits on its own. Fuel feedstock will have to come from the United States, Mexico, or Canada to qualify for a credit.

The new law forecloses the possibility of claiming additional 45Z credits based on “negative emissions.” The credit amount is calculated according to the “emissions factor” of the fuel, with a floor of 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU to qualify. The greater the emissions rate, the smaller the emissions factor and the smaller the tax credit. Conversely, if the emissions rate is negative, prior law appears to allow taxpayers to claim a credit above $1.00 for clean fuel and above $1.75 for sustainable aviation fuel. The OBBB prevents this result.

The OBBB also restores the expired tax credit under section 40A for small agri-biodiesel producers through 2026 and increases the credit amount from 10 cents a gallon to 20 cents a gallon. The tax credit will be newly eligible to be sold to third parties for cash.

As described in further detail below, projects intending to claim 45Z credits will become subject to FEOC ownership restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration

The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture receives relatively favorable treatment under the OBBB compared to other credits. The credit is available for carbon dioxide that is captured and then permanently sequestered, used in enhanced oil recovery, or put to another commercial use. The credit amount had been higher for a sequestration use case compared to the others on the theory that sequestration is uneconomic without the tax incentive. The OBBB puts all use cases on equal footing so that both enhanced oil recovery and commercial utilization can qualify for a credit of up to $85 per metric ton (or more in the case of direct air capture).

Similar to the 45Z tax credit for clean fuels, projects will become subject to the ownership-related FEOC restrictions, but not material assistance restrictions.

Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit

The OBBB makes numerous changes to the section 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit, which provides a tax credit for the production and sale of certain solar, wind, and battery components, as well as the production and purification of certain critical minerals. Among other changes, the OBBB:

terminates the tax credit for wind components sold after 2027;

creates a new category of eligible critical minerals for “metallurgical coal”;

begins phasing out tax credits for critical mineral production (other than metallurgical coal, which terminates after 2029) after 2030, with termination after 2033;

subjects manufacturers to similar FEOC rules as those that apply to the technology neutral ITC and PTC; and

requires battery modules to be “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, or any other essential energy collection equipment,” as a condition for tax credit eligibility.

Metallurgical coal is unique compared to the other critical minerals in that it is allowed to be produced outside of the United States. Federal tax credit eligibility in general, even outside of the critical minerals context, usually requires the activity being subsidized to occur in the United States. However, the credit is only worth 2.5% of the cost compared to 10% with respect to other critical minerals. The coal must be suitable for use in the production of steel.

Notably, the OBBB does not fully restrict the sale of integrated components, which had been proposed in the initial Senate bill. The initial Senate bill would have essentially prevented manufacturers of multiple components that are integrated into an end product from claiming credits on each individual component. Instead, the OBBB permits the stacking of credits provided that the components that are integrated together are produced in the same facility, the end product is sold to an unrelated person, and at least 65% of the direct material costs of the underlying components are attributable to US mining, production, or manufacturing.

Foreign Entities of Concern

The OBBB imposes important new restrictions limiting the ability of projects to generate tax credits if certain FEOCs are involved. These restrictions fall into two categories: (1) those relating to ownership or control, and (2) those relating to assistance during construction. To the extent an FEOC restriction contains a beginning of construction concept, the OBBB memorializes long-standing IRS guidance that allows a project owner to begin construction by either incurring 5% of project costs or else beginning physical work of a significant nature.

1. FEOC — Ownership Restrictions

The first FEOC restriction generally prohibits a project owner from claiming technology neutral tax credits, advanced manufacturing tax credits, clean fuel production tax credits, and tax credits for carbon sequestration for any tax year in which the person otherwise generating the tax credit is either a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign influenced entity.” These restrictions generally apply to tax years beginning after July 4, 2025, though the restrictions relating to foreign-influenced entities do not restrict clean fuel production tax credits until tax years beginning after July 4, 2027.

Specified foreign entities should be relatively easy to identify. These include entities owned by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia; entities owned by citizens of those countries or otherwise organized or having a principal place of business in one of those countries; certain battery manufacturers; and certain other similar entities.

An entity is a foreign-influenced entity if: a specified foreign entity has direct or indirect authority to appoint board members or officers; a single specified entity owns more than 25% of the entity; one or more specified foreign entities owns an aggregate of 40% of the entity; or at least 15% of the entity’s debt is held by specified foreign entities (in the aggregate).

An entity is also a foreign-influenced entity if during the prior taxable year the entity made payments to a specified foreign entity pursuant to an arrangement that allowed the specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a project (in the case of technology neutral tax credits) or production of any components (in the case of advanced manufacturing tax credits). The concept of effective control does not restrict project owners from claiming clean fuel production tax credits or carbon sequestration tax credits. Because effective control requires examination of payments made in the prior taxable year, project owners should closely scrutinize any contract that requires a payment, or any payments recently made, which could provide a contractual counterparty with any specific authority over production of components, energy generation, or energy storage.

Contractual rights that allow a counterparty to determine the amount or timing of production, restrict access to data relating to production, determine the purchase of power output, or maintain or otherwise operate a project on an exclusive basis can create effective control. Effective control can also be granted by licensing arrangements that specify or direct material or other components in a project, allow the licensor to direct the operation of the project, limit the taxpayer’s use of the licensed property, provide a right to royalties for more than 10 years, or otherwise require the project owner to hire a project operator for more than two years at the licensor’s direction.

Finally, for projects claiming the technology neutral ITC, the OBBB imposes a recapture of 100% of the tax credit value if payments conveying effective control are made within 10 years of the project being placed in service.

2. FEOC — Material Assistance Rules

The second set of FEOC restrictions prohibits project owners from claiming technology neutral tax credits if construction on the project started after December 31, 2025, and the project receives material assistance from a specified foreign entity. A similar prohibition limits project owners from claiming advanced manufacturing tax credits for any tax year beginning after July 4, 2025, if the owner received material assistance from a specified foreign entity.

An entity receives material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity if the material assistance cost ratio applicable either to the power generation project or the manufacturing project is less than the applicable threshold percentage. The applicable threshold percentages are shown in Exhibit A (below), which can be adjusted by the Secretary of the Treasury in the case of the applicable threshold relating to critical minerals.

The material assistance cost ratio for a power plant or battery is generally the difference between the total direct costs for manufactured products less the direct costs attributable to a specified foreign entity, divided by the total direct costs. This effectively examines the “good” costs over the total costs. The material assistance cost ratio for a manufactured component is the “good” material costs over the total material costs.

The OBBB directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue safe harbor tables applying a methodology similar to that adopted with respect to the calculation of domestic content under Notice 2025-08 for material assistance. Before these tables are issued, taxpayers can rely on Notice 2025-08 along with a supplier certification, though this has an obvious shortcoming in that Notice 2025-08 has tables for a limited subset of power production technologies. Developers of other technologies will have to rely on actual labor and materials costs to run the calculations.

Other Changes

The clean hydrogen PTC terminates for projects that begin construction after 2027. Prior iterations of the bill in both the House and Senate would have terminated the credit if construction did not begin by the end of 2025.

Bonus depreciation — the ability to write off 100% of the cost of certain business property, including renewables projects, as a depreciation deduction — is made permanent for property acquired after January 19, 2025. Bonus depreciation was enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and was set to phase out after 2026 for most property. Taxpayers can elect out of bonus depreciation entirely or alternatively elect into a 40% bonus (or 60% bonus for property with a longer production period).

The PTC for nuclear facilities under 45U will become subject to the FEOC ownership restrictions.

Multiple other tax credits will terminate between September 30, 2025, and June 30, 2026. The exact dates and mechanics vary by credit. Affected credits include the 30D clean vehicle credit, the 45W qualified commercial vehicles credit, the 30C credit for charging stations, and the residential clean energy credit under 25D.

Martin wanted to go further and link the homes with a small power grid that would let homeowners share surplus power with each other.","Hawaiian Electric Co.’s century-long hold on Hawaiʻi’s electricity market soon will change in a major way, creating a potential path to lower rates for businesses and residents.

Starting in 2027, HECO will be required to let independent electricity producers use its grid to deliver electricity directly to customers for a fee, potentially ending the utility’s standing as the sole choice for most electric consumers in the state. Under the current system, producers must sell electricity at a wholesale price to HECO, which pools it to sell to customers at a higher rate.

Gov. Josh Green signed the groundbreaking bill on Thursday, despite having previously signaled his intent to veto the measure.

It remains to be seen to what extent the new system will lead to significant savings for residential customers. A previously passed law allowing renters to buy power from community solar farms, for instance , has gone nowhere, hampered by what critics say are untenable rules. But even critics of the new law have said it could generate savings for some customers.

State Sen. Glenn Wakai, who chairs the Energy and Intergovernmental Affairs Committee and sponsored the bill, said the measure was meant to introduce competition in Hawaiʻi’s electricity market and reduce costs in a state where Hawaii%20has%20the%20highest%20average,highest%20share%20for%20any%20state."">customers pay the nation’s highest costs for electricity — more than three times the national average.

“We have for more than 100 years been at the mercy of HECO for our electricity needs, and we’ve seen in recent times that the delivery of that electricity has been very unreliable and very, very expensive,” Wakai said. “In the next two years, come 2027, all HECO’s customers will have an option of buying from someone other than HECO.”

“I think this is a game changer to benefit the consumers,” Wakai said.

Green’s office also expressed optimism.

“We believe that the provisions contained within the bill will allow for greater energy choice and hopefully a reduction in costs for Hawai‘i’s consumers,” Green’s spokeswoman, Makana McClellan, said in a written statement.

HECO spokesman Jim Kelly declined an interview request.

Law Could ‘Really Open Up Our Grid’

The law includes several provisions to break HECO’s hold on Hawaiʻi’s electricity market, but the most important involves what energy experts call wheeling.

Under the current system, developers build big wind and solar farms and sell the power to HECO under long-term contracts. HECO pays as little as 8 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity from these independent power producers, said Jeff Mikulina, a renewable energy consultant who was an architect of the law requiring Hawaiʻi to produce all of the electricity sold in the state from renewable resources by 2045.

Meanwhile, HECO charges residential customers on Oʻahu almost 43 cents per kilowatt hour. Big Island residents pay 48 cents.

Wakai said a goal of the law is to enable customers to pay closer to what the renewable electricity costs HECO to buy and to encourage smaller players to get in the game.

The wheeling provision does this by letting independent electricity producers pay a set fee to use HECO’s grid to deliver power to customers. Although wheeling has long been allowed on the mainland, it’s been prohibited by law in Hawaiʻi.

The PUC had been investigating a proposal to allow wheeling between government entities only, and Green’s intent-to-veto statement pointed to that as a reason to veto the broader bill. Green decided to sign the broad bill after the PUC said it would cancel the intra-governmental wheeling inquiry, McClellan said.

Hawaiʻi’s previous prohibition against wheeling has played out on the ground at places like Green Homes Hanalei, a cluster of seven homes in west Oʻahu built in 2017 around the idea of using solar and storage to make the subdivision as energy self-sufficient as possible.

Developer R.J. Martin powered each home with photovoltaic solar cells combined with two Tesla Powerwall batteries. Each home had garages with chargers for electric vehicles.

Martin wanted to go further and link the homes with a small power grid that would let homeowners share surplus power with each other. But he quickly learned that would be illegal. Homeowners would have to become regulated utilities to share surplus electricity with their neighbors.

“No one in their right mind is going to go through that exercise,” Wakai said. “So now, it just simplifies what has been all these walls and impediments put up by the government as well as by HECO.”

Martin hopes the new law will enable him to do something more innovative in the near future: use renewables and perhaps a microgrid to power a larger, workforce housing subdivision he’s planning for West Oʻahu.

But much will depend on how the Hawaiʻi Public Utilities Commission implements the law, Mikulina said.

“If the PUC does it right, it can really open up our grid to some innovative renewable solutions,” Mikulina said. “This could catalyze renewable growth and really help folks who need access to this.”

Critics Say Some Could Be Left Out

Critics point to potential unintended consequences.

A major issue involves equity. The concern is that HECO customers with the money and wherewithal to partner with an independent power producer will defect from HECO, leaving those less well-off to still deal with higher rates.

Testifying against the bill, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260, which works on utility infrastructure, argued the long-term technical effects of wheeling on HECO’s grid are unknown.

“Further,” the union wrote, “the fixed-cost of operating and maintaining the system will remain unchanged and passed on to those left in the system, essentially increasing the cost of electricity to those who can least afford it.”

Given this risk, it will be key to make sure lower-income residential customers can benefit as the commission creates rules governing the program, said Michael Colón, director of energy for the Ulupono Initiative, which supports the use of renewable energy.

To address such concerns, Wakai said, the law limits the size of a wind or solar farm allowed to use the wheeling provision to two megawatts, the size needed to power about 3,000 homes.

“We’re not talking about, you know, large 50- to 60-megawatt plants going and selling to all the Waikīkī hotels,” Wakai said. “That’s not going to be possible under this scenario.”

“What is possible under this scenario,” he said, “is, if you have let’s say 10 acres of land that can create two megawatts of power, you are free to go and sell to the nearby residents or wheel it across the island to someone who’s willing to take it.”

That’s promising news to people like Steve Mazur, director of commercial business development for RevoluSun, one of Hawaiʻi’s largest solar companies.

Mazur said he’s encountered business owners with energy hogging cold storage systems but small rooftops located near businesses with huge rooftops but little electricity needs. If implemented well by the PUC, Mazur said, the new law could make way for solar panels on the large roof to power the neighboring business.

,EPA,2025-07-08 20:37:29+00:00,Colorado Public Radio,Colorado has a new rule to limit gas-powered lawn equipment in favor of electric,"Sam Brasch, Tom Hesse, Tony Gorman, Jesse Paul, The Colorado Sun, Olivia Bagan",,,,,https://www.cpr.org/2025/07/08/gas-powered-lawn-tools-colorado-law-enforcement/,"A new state air quality rule went into effect on June 1, banning government entities from using small gas-powered lawn equipment during the summer ozone season.
Gas-powered lawn and garden equipment plays an outsized role in the perennial air quality problem.
Those entities are now restricted from using smaller gas-powered equipment such as leaf blowers, tillers and edgers from June 1 to August 31.
The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission could also reconsider whether to phase out the sale of handheld gas-powered lawn tools at Front Range retailers.
Air quality advocates want to better understand compliance with current lawn equipment rules before pushing for further restrictions.","At the start of the summer, Johnny Jimenez gathered the crews he manages at Designscapes Colorado, a commercial landscaping company headquartered in Centennial, a suburb south of Denver.

A new state air quality rule went into effect on June 1, banning government entities from using small gas-powered lawn equipment during the summer ozone season. Since the company holds contracts to maintain public parks, Jimenez told his workers all gas-powered, hand-held lawn equipment had to come off their trailers in favor of newly purchased electric leaf blowers and string trimmers.

“To put a battery-operated machine in their hand, it was kind of like a learning curve, and it still is a learning curve,” Jimenez recalled. “It's just trial and error. We have no choice.”

The switch comes as Colorado struggles to cut ground-level ozone pollution along the Front Range. The dangerous lung irritant — better known as smog — routinely climbs above federal health standards on summer afternoons. After decades of failing to fix the problem, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reclassified a nine-county region around metro Denver as a “severe” ozone violator in 2022.

Gas-powered lawn and garden equipment plays an outsized role in the perennial air quality problem. The lawn equipment rule — approved in 2023 — marks Colorado's most aggressive effort to address the pollution source so far, but the state is taking a “flexible” enforcement approach, prioritizing education and outreach over fines and other penalties.

The strategy has put Designscapes at the forefront of the transition to electric lawn care. Despite the lax enforcement approach, the company embraced the shift to win government contracts and satisfy residential customers bothered by the guttural roar of gas-powered equipment. It’s now figuring out whether battery-powered lawn care can work at a commercial scale.

New rules to mow down pollution

Gas-powered lawn equipment might be small, but the tools are a major pollution source because their engines effectively work as smog machines.

Many weed wackers and leaf blowers rely on two-stroke motors burning a combination of oil and gasoline. The resulting exhaust contains large amounts of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds, the two key ingredients necessary to form ground-level ozone. Most mowers rely on cleaner four-stroke motors but lack emissions control systems like catalytic converters found in most cars.

One byproduct is some shocking air quality statistics. The California Air Resources Board estimates running a commercial leaf blower for a single hour emits as much smog-forming pollution as driving a new car 1,100 miles from Los Angeles to Denver. Around metro Denver, the lawn tools emit more volatile organic compounds than all vehicles on the road, according to the Regional Air Quality Council, the leading air quality planning agency for the Front Range.

Air quality regulators adopted the new lawn care rules — known as Regulation 29 — in 2023. The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, a nine-member panel appointed by the governor, opted against more aggressive proposals supported by environmental advocates and local governments to ban the sale of gas-powered lawn equipment or directly regulate commercial companies.

It instead signed off on a plan to focus on public entities like school districts and city park departments. Those entities are now restricted from using smaller gas-powered equipment such as leaf blowers, tillers and edgers from June 1 to August 31.

But Michael Ogletree, Colorado’s senior director of air quality programs, said the state isn’t rushing to fine or punish anyone for failing to follow the rules.

“This is a new space we haven’t regulated in the past,” Ogletree said. “Right now, the way we’re working towards compliance is through education and outreach, and providing some flexibility if there are reasons why any particular entity can’t comply.”

Denver is one city taking advantage of extra breathing room. In a written statement, Stephanie Figueroa, a spokesperson for Denver Parks and Recreation, said her team “hasn’t purchased much equipment” because the city paused spending amid an ongoing major budget crunch.

Until those restrictions are lifted, Figueroa said her department will report usage of gas-powered tools to state authorities while it outlines a plan to transition to electric equipment.

A shift from gas cans to battery packs

Designscapes offers a preview of how governments across Colorado might adjust their operations to comply with the rules.

On a recent morning, a crew employed spanned out across Westlands Park in Greenwood Village, a 28-acre area packed with playgrounds and pavilions. The company still uses a gas-powered riding mower to cut large spaces, but switches to all-electric trimmers for smaller sections of weeds and grasses. Any debris on the sidewalks is then cleared with leaf blowers powered by a backpack stocked with batteries.

Brian Levins, the manager of the company’s landscaping operations, said Designscapes bought around $50,000 in electric equipment in anticipation of the new air quality rules. A $12,000 matching grant from the Regional Air Quality Council helped subsidize the purchase, and the equipment was further discounted by a 30 percent tax credit Colorado offers to offset the cost of electric lawn equipment.

“Reducing the noise, reducing the stress through all the vibration, reducing being exposed to those fumes all day — I thought that was a really positive thing to give to our team members,” Levins said.

The quieter equipment is appreciated by Jose Lara, the worker leading the crew maintaining the park. At the same time, he said he hopes battery technology continues to improve so he can work for longer stretches without trekking back to a trailer for a fully-charged pack.

More regulations could be on their way

After approving the new rules in 2023, Colorado air quality regulators plan to consider further regulations in November.

Those restrictions could include restricting commercial landscapers from using gas-powered equipment, not just public entities and their contractors. The Colorado Air Quality Control Commission could also reconsider whether to phase out the sale of handheld gas-powered lawn tools at Front Range retailers.

It’s unclear if the Gov. Jared Polis’ administration would support those policies. Ogletree, Colorado’s top air quality official, said his staff is in the early stages of researching the feasibility of different regulations given current market conditions and recent improvements in electric lawn care technology. The state hasn’t developed any formal proposal to offer commissioners later this year.

The landscaping industry is already gearing up to push back on anything it sees as too restrictive. Levins said Designscapes is glad it’s shifting to all-electric equipment, but he hopes regulators recognize other operators might lack the facilities and capital to manage a rapid transition.

“ There's just a lot of other costs that you don't necessarily think through when you first hear about these things. So for a smaller operator, I think it can be very, very burdensome,” Levins said.

Air quality advocates want to better understand compliance with current lawn equipment rules before pushing for further restrictions. Danny Katz, the executive director of the Colorado Public Interest Research Group, said it appears usage of gas-powered lawn tools remains common in parks and other public spaces. “Let’s get that right and then see what the next step is,” Katz said.

Other advocates want to see the state take decisive action. Elise Jones, the executive director of the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, an environmental advocacy group, recently left her appointment on the Colorado Air Quality Control Commission, where she pushed for more aggressive regulations to limit pollution from lawn equipment.

Jones said the state can’t hesitate to act if it wants to meet a mid-2027 deadline to comply with federal ozone standards, and should adopt plans to phase out gas-powered equipment from commercial lawncare companies and Front Range retailers.

“We'd all breathe easier if Colorado would step up and be a leader in transitioning away from noisy, polluting gasoline-powered lawn mowers, weed whackers and leaf blowers to clean, quiet electric-powered alternatives,” Jones said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250623_163630678-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-08 19:14:33.776990
