It also follows the Trump administration’s monthslong assault on the industry, which has included multiple attacks on in-progress projects.

Amid federal setbacks, Maine ‘closely tracking’ development of Canadian offshore wind

Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official ​“wind energy area.” Smaller lease areas are later carved out of these broader expanses.

Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as ​“Central Atlantic 2,” which started back in 2023 and is now dead in the water.

The draft area — or ​“call area” — started out as a thick belt roughly 40 miles wide and reached from the southernmost tip of New Jersey to the northern border of South Carolina, according to maps on BOEM’s website. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and NASA, then provided input on where that initial area might have been problematic. NASA, for example, maintains a launch site on Virginia’s Wallops Island and in 2024 found that nearby wind turbines could interfere with the agency’s instrumentation and radio frequencies.

The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024, according to BOEM’s website, its staff was hosting in-person public meetings from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to Morehead City, North Carolina, to gather input from fishermen, tourism outfitters, and other stakeholders. Under a wind-friendly administration, a final designation and lease sale notice would have likely been released this year or by 2026, based on a timeline posted to BOEM’s website.

But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.

Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction. Last month, Trump’s ​“big, beautiful bill” sent federal tax credits to an early grave, requiring wind developers who want to use the incentives to either start construction by July 2026 or place turbines in service by the end of 2027. The move is particularly devastating for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.

Wednesday’s order halts all work on Central Atlantic 2 and similar areas, like one near Guam, and also revokes completely finalized wind energy areas with strong state support. One example is in the Gulf of Maine, where Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has been a fierce advocate for the emerging renewable sector.

These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee. Still, in the best case, that means developers will have to wait several more years for new lease areas to become available, further slowing down an industry whose projects already take many years to go through permitting and construction.

On today’s episode of CBT Now, Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of insights at Cox Automotive, joins us to break down the report’s findings and what they mean for the remainder of 2025.

According to the report, U.S. EV sales declined 6.3% year over year in Q2, closely matching Cox Automotive’s projections. Still, the market showed signs of resilience with nearly 5% growth quarter over quarter, driven in part by consumers rushing to take advantage of the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credit before its expiration. Tesla, which still leads the EV market, saw a 12% drop in sales, weighing down the overall numbers. Excluding Tesla, EV sales were largely flat, with some automakers, like Chevrolet, posting growth thanks to new offerings like the Equinox EV.

Valdez Streaty emphasized that the EV market continues to face several headwinds. Price remains a top concern, with EVs carrying an average premium of around $10,000 over gas-powered vehicles. Meanwhile, infrastructure limitations and regulatory uncertainty continue to challenge broader adoption. Despite these barriers, leasing is emerging as a key driver of growth, now accounting for approximately 60% of EVs on the road. Leasing not only lowers monthly payments, but also addresses consumer concerns over battery longevity and depreciation.

Additionally, Valdez Streaty underscores the importance of educating consumers about EV battery warranties, which typically last 8 to 10 years or up to 100,000 miles. She notes that this knowledge gap can fuel hesitation among buyers unfamiliar with EV ownership.

Another key issue she touched on was dealer readiness. During the conversation, host Jim Fitzpatrick highlights how fewer than 15% of new car salespeople currently drive EVs themselves. Valdaz Streaty notes that the lack of firsthand experience can hinder their ability to effectively guide customers through the transition, making education and local engagement efforts increasingly critical for retailers.

“The EV market is very dynamic and complex. It’s not just about incentives; it’s about infrastructure, pricing, and consumer education.”

Meanwhile, competition in the EV space is intensifying. General Motors and Honda have gained ground in the first half of 2025 with broader lineups and competitive incentives, while Tesla has seen its market share slip due to product delays and ongoing brand challenges. The expiration of federal tax credits in September is expected to drive a short-term sales spike in Q3, followed by a likely dip in Q4. Ongoing state-level incentives and OEM strategies will remain key to shaping adoption moving forward.

Moreover, the used EV market is accelerating rapidly, with a record 100,000 units sold in Q2. Used EV prices are nearing parity with used internal combustion engine models, offering more affordable entry points for buyers. Valdez Streaty also highlighted the potential future impact of low-cost, high-quality EV imports from China, although timelines remain unclear.

Nevertheless, Valdez Streaty said that while EVs are a vital part of the industry’s future, the transition remains complicated. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid models continue to serve as crucial options for many consumers as the market adapts to shifting regulations and evolving consumer preferences.",https://d9s1543upwp3n.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/08.04.25-Stephanie-Valdez-Streaty.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 06:02:22.161975

""To build what customers really want is going to be a tailwind for us,"" said Ford CEO Jim Farley, citing what he called a ""multi-billion dollar opportunity"" over the next couple of years.
Trump ditched his predecessor's ambitious CO2 emissions targets and canceled California's EV mandates (although 11 states are suing to block that effort).
His administration is also erasing consumer tax credits for EV purchases and repealing existing fuel economy targets and CO2 emissions standards.
By removing penalties for non-compliance, the government is also eliminating any incentive for carmakers to buy regulatory credits from overachieving rivals.","For all their complaints about how unfair President Trump's tariffs are for U.S. automakers, the industry seems quite pleased with his environmental policies, which lift a massive regulatory cost burden.

Why it matters: Trump's agenda could wind up as a net win for the auto industry, allowing them to sell more high-margin, U.S.-built trucks and SUVs for the foreseeable future, while avoiding penalties for not building enough electric vehicles.

Stunning stat: Together, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis are projecting nearly $10 billion in gross tariff costs this year.

For the most part, they're eating those taxes rather than passing them on to consumers.

Yes, but: Trump's deregulation policies could help them offset most or all of that burden, depending on the outcome of continuing trade talks.

Driving the news: In quarterly earnings calls with analysts, the CEOs of the Detroit 3 said Trump's reversal of Biden-era EV policies will boost their finances.

""To build what customers really want is going to be a tailwind for us,"" said Ford CEO Jim Farley, citing what he called a ""multi-billion dollar opportunity"" over the next couple of years.

GM CEO Mary Barra had a similar message, calling Trump's regulatory policies a ""huge opportunity"" that allow the automaker to keep selling profitable trucks and SUVs while EV demand slowly builds.

Stellantis, meanwhile, is bringing back muscle cars and Hemi engines now that it's no longer obliged to produce EVs and fuel-sipping engines. ""And this will mean to us a lot of additional profit,"" said CEO Antonio Filosa, trying to steer a turnaround.

The big picture: The Trump administration has been moving quickly to unwind Biden's EV-favorable policies.

Trump ditched his predecessor's ambitious CO2 emissions targets and canceled California's EV mandates (although 11 states are suing to block that effort).

His administration is also erasing consumer tax credits for EV purchases and repealing existing fuel economy targets and CO2 emissions standards.

By removing penalties for non-compliance, the government is also eliminating any incentive for carmakers to buy regulatory credits from overachieving rivals.

Zoom in: Ford, for example, said last year it had contracts to purchase about $3.8 billion of non-compliance credits from other carmakers — presumably Tesla, which said in October that it had long-term contracts to sell $4.7 billion of credits.

As of this week, however, Farley told analysts that Ford has already reduced that commitment by nearly $1.5 billion — money that can instead be invested in other parts of the business or to improve profits.

On the flip side, Telsa is staring down a ""few rough quarters"" as support for EVs goes away and it pivots toward autonomy and robots starting next year.

Aside from vanishing tax breaks that will likely dampen EV demand, Tesla is also losing that easy money — $15 billion since 2012 — it made from selling regulatory credits.

What to watch: While the Detroit 3 welcome the relief from regulatory pressures, they're still anxious to see how Trump will revamp the existing trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada on which they depend.",https://images.axios.com/XC3j1vy2BdYILYmrc5ZTdYaDVBM=/0x0:1920x1080/1366x768/2020/03/20/1584669009565.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 06:01:31.645431

”But sometimes what’s less visible is the economic impact on small businesses in our community over time.“ Whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, or ice storms, small businesses are more vulnerable to climate shocks than larger businesses, said Shehryar Nabi, a senior research associate at the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program.
He co-wrote a recent report outlining the hurdles small businesses face from severe weather.
These waves of impacts are coupled with limited support options for small businesses in both the long and short term.
“When we think about fortifying small businesses,” she said, “it’s about going beyond a physical structure.”","The United States is home to millions of small businesses that form the backbone of countless communities. Even during the best of times keeping shops solvent can be a struggle, but when climate-driven disasters strike the impact on mom and pops can be particularly devastating — and prolonged.

“The news coverage has definitely focused on the physical destruction,” said Kyle McCurry. He is the director of public relations for Explore Asheville, an organization that promotes the North Carolina city, which Hurricane Helene pummeled with torrential rain and flooding last fall. ”But sometimes what’s less visible is the economic impact on small businesses in our community over time.“

Whether it’s hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, or ice storms, small businesses are more vulnerable to climate shocks than larger businesses, said Shehryar Nabi, a senior research associate at the Aspen Institute Financial Security Program. He co-wrote a recent report outlining the hurdles small businesses face from severe weather. They can be hobbled by a range of challenges, from limited preparation resources to a lack of post-disaster financing.

“One reason we focused on small businesses here is because of their importance to the U.S. economy,” said Nabi. That was certainly the case in Asheville, a city known for its artists, breweries and boutiques. Helene not only destroyed homes and upended lives, it sent the region’s economy into a tailspin.

In 2023, McCurry said, visitors to the area spent $2.9 billion. Last year, Helene hit Appalachia right before the busy fall foliage season, when tourists flock to places like Asheville to see the leaves turn. McMurry says the storm, which knocked out some municipal services for weeks, led to a 20 to 40 percent drop in annual business revenue.

Ten months later, a slew of businesses haven’t reopened: Vivian’s restaurant, Pleb Urban Winery and TRVE Brewery, to name a few. Another was New Origin Brewery, which started pouring in 2021 and soon had fans lauding it as their favorite brewery in Asheville. Although the floodwaters inundated the business, the bulk of the destruction occurred when railroad cars floated off nearby tracks and crashed into the building.

“There’s not a way to get money for damages in that scenario,” said Dan Juhnke, one of New Origin’s founders. Even after maxing out the brewery’s flood insurance claim, it wasn’t enough to cover the damage. The only other option was to take on more debt from the federal Small Business Administration, or SBA, which didn’t seem prudent. Ultimately,Juhnke and his business partner decided to apply for a Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, funded buyout program that purchases flood-damaged property and limits rebuilding as a way to mitigate the damage from future storms.

“We signed up for it and have been waiting almost a year now,” said Juhnke.

McCurry estimates that, overall, around 85 percent of Asheville businesses have reopened in some form, which is relatively good news. According to 2014 national data from FEMA and the U.S. Department of Labor, 40 percent of small businesses do not reopen after a natural disaster and another 25 percent shutter within a year.

These waves of impacts are coupled with limited support options for small businesses in both the long and short term. While FEMA has individual and public assistance programs, there is little if any funding for businesses. The SBA often offers low-interest loans, but the paperwork can be burdensome and the money might not start arriving for months. Only 14 percent of businesses were able to rely on support from the federal government, according to an analysis of the 2021 Small Business Credit Survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

“Support makes a meaningful difference,” said Nabi. “For a lot of businesses it is the difference between closing down and surviving, But it doesn’t reach all the businesses that could benefit.”

State and local governments, private lenders and community fundraising are other potential sources of money. New Origin, for example, raised more than $100,000 via a GoFundMe campaign but fell short of its $300,000 goal. The fund that Explore Asheville established has brought in $2.1 million, which has been awarded to more than 500 businesses.

Still, Nabi says, these avenues don’t usually address one of the toughest challenges facing businesses after a storm: liquidity. Even a month or two of disrupted cash flow can devastate some operations, which is why experts point to pre-disaster planning as one of the most effective steps a business can take to help protect itself.

“Often businesses see contingency planning as a distraction from the core thing they want to do,” said Benjamin Collier, an associate professor in the Department of Risk and Insurance at the Wisconsin School of Business. But things like better understanding your insurance coverage, or where to move inventory in the event of a threat, should be routine steps for business owners and generally aren’t expensive.

“The natural tendency for many small business owners to be reluctant to really engage with the risks that they’re exposed to,” he said. “This is a call to have more buffers and be more cautious.”

Nabi also underlines the importance of planning, but says structural change could help as well. Greater use of parametric insurance, which automatically pays out when a specific event like a disaster happens, would allow quicker access to funds. Shifting more money to pre-disaster preparation could help businesses avoid the worst impacts of a storm, too.

“The financing for preparation is limited compared to what’s available post disaster,” said Nabi.

Pat Nye is the regional director for the Los Angeles Small Business Development Network. Earlier this year, the counties he oversees saw historically devastating wildfires and one thing that he’s noticed was that, unlike with residential properties, insurance companies hadn’t offered small businesses discounts for any improvements they might have made to make their buildings more fire-resilient.

“As it stands, there is no incentive that exists for this work,” said Nye. “A lot of stuff just focuses on home owners.”

Governments often don’t do enough to include small businesses in their recovery plans either, contends Kristen Fanarakis, associate director, small business policy and innovation at the nonprofit Milken Institute. She pointed to a landscaper in the Asheville area who spent weeks helping clear debris after Helene without pay and ended up facing eviction. Those are the kind of businesses, she said, that municipalities should be hiring and including in rebuilding efforts.

More broadly, a report Fanarakis wrote called for a cross-agency “Small Business Resilience czar,” standardized disaster assistance forms and quicker grant dispersal, among other recommendations. She called the current system “very reactionary” and argues for increased attention to not just the immediate impacts of disasters but the long-term economic fallout as well.

Emergency Department Visits Reach Five-Year High

The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) has documented more than 3,300 emergency department visits for heat-related illness from May 1 to July 12, 2025 — nearly double the average of 1,675 visits recorded during the same period from 2020 to 2024. This marks the highest number of heat-related emergency visits in the past five years.

“We are seeing more people coming to emergency departments across the state with heat-related illnesses this summer,” said Dr. Zack Moore, NCDHHS State Epidemiologist.

Vulnerable Populations at Greatest Risk

While heat-related illnesses can affect anyone regardless of age or physical condition, certain groups face elevated risks, according to health officials. These high-risk populations include:

Outdoor workers

Infants and children

Older adults

Pregnant individuals

Athletes

Low-income individuals

People with underlying health conditions

Warning Signs and Symptoms

Health officials emphasize that recognizing heat illness symptoms is crucial for preventing serious complications, including death. Key warning signs include:

Heavy sweating

Paleness

Muscle cramps

Racing or weak pulse

Dizziness

Headache

Fainting

Nausea or vomiting

State Response and Alert System

To combat the growing threat, NCDHHS has activated its Heat Health Alert System, which issues warnings when forecasted temperatures reach dangerous levels. From May 1 to July 18, 2025, the system distributed more than 900 county-level alerts in both English and Spanish across North Carolina.

Residents can sign up for heat alerts by visiting the NCDHHS Climate and Health webpage.

Safety Recommendations

State health officials recommend the following precautions during hot weather:

Stay Hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day without waiting until thirsty. Limit alcohol and caffeine consumption.

Limit Outdoor Exposure: Avoid outdoor activities during peak heat hours when possible. Wear light, loose-fitting clothing and take frequent breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas.

Seek Air Conditioning: When temperatures exceed 95 degrees and air conditioning is unavailable at home, seek refuge in cooler public buildings.

Stay Informed: Monitor heat alerts and local weather forecasts to plan outdoor activities safely.

Comprehensive Prevention Efforts

The NCDHHS Division of Public Health has implemented multiple initiatives to combat extreme heat impacts beyond surveillance and alert systems:

Distributed 1,300 high-velocity cooling fans to farmworkers statewide and partners in the Sandhills region

Developed specialized training programs for healthcare providers treating heat-related illnesses in farmworkers, in collaboration with the NCDHHS Office of Rural Health

Provided educational materials and protective equipment — including water bottles, cooling towels, and hats with heat prevention guidance — to at-risk populations

Partnered with the NC Department of Environmental Quality to lead the Extreme Heat Cohort Program, helping local governments and organizations develop comprehensive heat action plans

“Refineries across America, especially in the northeast like Detroit or Chicago rely heavily on oil from Canada,” observed Rey Trevino with energy company Pecos Operating.

North Carolina House Bill 569 — which remains under consideration — would require polluters to reimburse public water systems for the cost of cleaning up PFAS contamination.","By Will Atwater

This week, state lawmakers made it more difficult to establish regulations that potentially protect the environment and public health with the passage of House Bill 402. Critics say the measure creates significant roadblocks to addressing air and water pollution.

The new law, known as the “Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Scrutiny (REINS) Act,” requires rules with a projected financial impact of $1 million over five years to be approved by a two-thirds majority of the rulemaking body making the rule. For rules with impacts over $10 million, unanimous approval is required. And if a proposed regulation is expected to cost $20 million or more, it must be ratified — formally approved — by the General Assembly before it can take effect.

Environmental advocates warn that the law, combined with the Trump administration’s push to weaken federal environmental protections, could stall urgently needed responses to emerging and growing environmental and public health threats.

“Lawmakers who passed this bill did not have the best interests of North Carolinians at heart,” said Mary Maclean Asbill, in a release. Asbill is the director of the Southern Environmental Law Center’s North Carolina offices. “This new law marks an awful turning point for families and communities across North Carolina when elected officials in the state legislature ignore serious illnesses and deaths in favor of polluters’ profits.”

Asbill also pointed to potential economic consequences, arguing that the new law will likely increase the costs to consumers of Duke Energy power, which she argues is a monopoly in North Carolina

Asbill also estimated that the aspect of the law could cost the state, “$23 billion in additional electricity bill payments over the next few decades and all but guaranteeing a more polluted and riskier future.”

House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) dismissed criticism of the legislation, saying it’s intended to ensure transparency and accountability — not to hinder progress.

“What we had in the REINS Act was a situation where if you have a regulation that is extremely expensive, our position is that it’s something that [the legislature] needs to take a look at, because ultimately, constitutionally, this body appropriates funds in this state,” Hall said.

“It doesn’t mean that we’re always going to turn down a proposed regulation just because it comes over,” he noted. “But I think that often what they’re doing in the agencies and regulatory bodies doesn’t always come to the attention of this body until it’s already implemented and already too late and somebody’s suffering from it.”

Environmental advocates argue that delays in enacting environmental regulations can cause the public to suffer in other ways — including higher costs and increased health risks.

Costs passed on to consumers

Environmental advocates warn that the added red tape may delay or block rules needed to control harmful industrial chemicals — such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 1,4-dioxane — both linked to adverse health outcomes, including cancer. They say it could also drive up utility costs in the process.

For example, the Cape Fear Public Utility Authority spent nearly $50 million in 2022 to install a system that filters PFAS from drinking water. It’s now exploring additional upgrades to better address 1,4-dioxane — a chemical the EPA classifies as a likely human carcinogen. Because no enforceable federal limit exists for 1,4-dioxane, the responsibility for removing it falls to utilities — and ultimately to customers.

That burden comes at a cost. As reported by Port City Daily, the technology needed to better control upstream 1,4-dioxane pollution is expected to cost millions — expenses likely to be passed on to ratepayers.

“If you’re allowing 1,4-dioxane in people’s water, if you’re allowing thousands of different PFAS in drinking water, and you’re not allowing the necessary rulemaking that would remove them, then you’re not protecting the people of North Carolina. You’re not,” said Erin Carey, conservation policy director for the North Carolina Chapter of the Sierra Club.”You’re protecting the polluters.”

Critics argue that protecting the public requires weighing both the costs and benefits of regulations — especially those designed to safeguard health and the environment. But under House Bill 402, only financial costs can be considered, not any benefits flowing from the imposition of a new regulation.

“It is expensive to have clean drinking water, to keep things out of our drinking water that would be harmful for us to ingest,” said Brooks Rainey, SELC lobbyist to the North Carolina General Assembly. “That costs money, but the reason we’re all willing to do it is because the benefit so greatly outweighs the cost. For example, keeping fecal matter out of our drinking water means we don’t have cholera outbreaks.”

Rainey noted, “If we’re only allowed to think about the cost of a rule, every rule is going to look like a burden on industry, and it is a scary road to walk down when the only thing we even think is worth considering is the cost to industry and the health of the people isn’t even taken into consideration.”

“Everything about that bill is kind of rigged to make it harder to enact or keep on the books important environmental protections,” said state Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford), a fierce opponent of the bill.

Where does House Bill 402 leave North Carolinians?

As the cost of living rises, environmental advocates warn that laws like House Bill 402 — which make it harder to implement pollution controls — are forcing public utilities to shoulder the burden of removing hazardous contaminants from drinking water. Without strong “polluter pays” provisions, those costs often end up being passed on to ratepayers.

At the same time, residents are also facing higher insurance premiums and reduced coverage as extreme weather events — including Hurricane Helene, California’s wildfires, and Tropical Storm Chantal — strain the insurance industry’s capacity.

“North Carolina decision-makers have more than enough information to move forward on strong legislative and regulatory actions around PFAS and 1,4-dioxane, whether that is a “polluter pays” bill like H.B. 569 or surface water quality standards,” said Grady O’Brien, water policy manager for the North Carolina Conservation Network.

North Carolina House Bill 569 — which remains under consideration — would require polluters to reimburse public water systems for the cost of cleaning up PFAS contamination. The bill passed the House of Representatives by a wide margin, but has not had any legislative action since the House sent the bill to the Senate in early May. Advocates say HB 569 stands in direct contrast to HB 402, which they argue creates unnecessary red tape and stalls meaningful reform.

Another proposal environmentalists are watching closely is Senate Bill 666, the Water Safety Act, introduced by Senate Majority Leader Michael Lee (R–New Hanover) who represents a district that has been heavily affected by PFAS contamination in the Cape Fear River basin. If passed, it would direct the Environmental Management Commission to establish regulatory limits on PFAS. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Rules and Operations in March and has yet to advance.

“It is an essential function of government: we need to be able to regulate, to make rules — otherwise it becomes the wild, wild West out there,” Carey said. “People will start building wherever they want, filling in wetlands wherever they want, discharging chemicals where and when it suits them.

“If there are no regulations, no rules in place, then there is no protection for the environment — and no protection for the people.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/house_chamber-768x427-2.jpg?fit=768%2C427&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-04 06:02:54.304790

According to Bloomberg, Adani is personally heading discussions with BYD executives, which took place as recently as last week. Amid delicate diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Beijing, any prospective partnership between the Adani Group and China’s BYD is expected to be signed through BYD’s subsidiaries in third countries rather than its Shenzhen headquarters, according to sources familiar with the matter who requested anonymity.

The discussions are driven by Adani’s ambition to begin large-scale production of lithium-ion cells for electric vehicles and, more crucially, for stationary energy storage systems—critical to supporting its expansive renewable energy operations. As India’s largest solar power producer, the Adani Group sees battery technology as a cornerstone of its clean energy strategy.

Why BYD Fits the Bill?

Chinese manufacturers currently lead the world in advanced and cost-effective battery technology, and Adani considers a technology-sharing agreement vital to achieving its clean energy goals. While talks are still in the early stages and may not materialize, BYD is seen as a natural partner. The Chinese giant is not only the world’s leading EV maker but also a global leader in rechargeable battery innovation.

However, such a partnership would test the political climate in both countries. India and China remain locked in a long-standing border dispute and are increasingly at odds over global supply chains and manufacturing. China has been limiting the export of technologies and critical components—such as rare earth magnets—to India and Southeast Asia since April. On the other hand, India has withheld visas for BYD’s executives, compelling meetings to be held in neighboring countries.

Adani’s Broader Outreach and Low-Key China Visit

The Adani Group is not limiting its options to BYD. It has also initiated conversations with other Chinese renewable energy firms, including Beijing Welion New Energy Technology Co., the sources said. Adani is reportedly aware of the political hurdles in securing approval for any Chinese partnership.

Although alternative suppliers in Europe and South Korea are available, none can currently compete with the cost-efficiency of Chinese firms. During a discreet trip to China in June, Adani met with companies such as Broad Group and Jinko Solar Co., as confirmed by social media activity and company announcements. However, some firms reportedly declined to meet the delegation, highlighting the sensitive political environment. There has been no response from Beijing Welion as of now.

Expanding Green Ambitions

Adani Green Energy Ltd., the group’s renewable arm, is already India’s largest green power producer with 15.8 GW of operational capacity—over 70% of which comes from solar. It aims to scale up to 50 GW by 2030. The group also operates India’s only ingot and wafer manufacturing facility, alongside 4 GW of solar cell and module capacity.

Looking ahead, the Adani Group plans to deepen its investments across the green energy value chain, including renewable power, green hydrogen, and energy storage. These initiatives are critical to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of a carbon-neutral India by 2070. Notably, Adani has also pledged to decarbonize its own operations—including coal power, ports, and airports—under this broader transition.",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Adani-BYD.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 04:59:30.871910

The Vietnamese electric-vehicle maker opened its first Indian factory on August 4, betting on expansion even as its existing plant at home sits mostly idle. The new 160-hectare (400 acres) facility in the southern state of Tamil Nadu can produce 150,000 cars annually, according to VinFast. That’s more than its entire global output last year, when it delivered fewer than 100,000 vehicles — 90% of them in Vietnam.

The India plant, originally slated to start operations on June 30, debuted after multiple delays. VinFast broke ground in February 2024 and showcased its VF6 and VF7 premium SUVs at New Delhi’s auto show in January. It started taking prebookings in July.

The India push comes as VinFast has accumulated $11.5 billion in losses and pivoted away from the U.S. market after poor reviews and disappointing sales. The company now targets Asia and the Gulf, where consumer expectations differ from Western markets and U.S. reviews may not impact demand.

The plant will initially assemble 50,000 combined units of VF6 and VF7 SUVs a year. The facility will create as many as 3,500 direct jobs, Tamil Nadu Industries Minister T.R.B. Raja said, while inaugurating the facility.

“This plant marks a strategic milestone in our long-term commitment to the Indian market,” VinFast Asia CEO Pham Sanh Chau said at the press briefing. “It enables us to offer high-quality, competitively priced electric vehicles to Indian consumers.”

In the U.S., VinFast sold 332 EVs in December 2024, compared to more than 65,000 by market leader Tesla. The VF8 suffered from software glitches, poor build quality, and safety concerns. VinFast delayed its North Carolina factory to 2028 and resorted to heavy discounts, offering what industry observers called the cheapest lease in America.

While VinFast has yet to disclose its strategy for India, its playbook in Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines includes setting up a network of VinFast-exclusive chargers and deploying its vehicles as part of a taxi service owned by a group company.

“With local manufacturing in India, VinFast hopes to avoid high import duties and tap into government incentives,” Abhik Mukherjee, automotive analyst at Counterpoint Research, told Rest of World. “This strategy could lead to unused factory capacity if sales don’t pick up.”

India has slashed duties to 15% from 110% for EVs priced above $35,000, but only for carmakers who invest at least $500 million in local production. VinFast doesn’t yet qualify, although its new factory could eventually unlock these benefits.

India’s regulatory hurdles for Chinese automakers could benefit VinFast. BYD’s billion-dollar plant was blocked last year because of national security concerns, while Great Wall Motor couldn’t secure government approval for its factory in 2022.

MG Motor — a China-India venture — already operates successfully and is among the market leaders. VinFast must also contend with established local players Tata Motors and Mahindra, plus Tesla, which opened its first India showroom last month.

VinFast’s Vietnamese factory can produce 250,000 EVs annually, but operated at just 12% capacity in mid-2023. Despite the underutilization, the company recently opened a second Vietnamese plant with a 200,000-unit capacity.

Almost all VinFast’s deliveries have been made in Vietnam, with Green and Smart Mobility, majority owned by VinFast founder and CEO Pham Nhat Vuong, receiving 46,500 EVs between March 2023 and December 2024. VinFast, which introduced Green and Smart Mobility in Indonesia and the Philippines, relies heavily on its taxi subsidiary for sales volume rather than individual consumers.

The company may find it difficult to copy-paste this strategy in India because the ride-hailing sector has long been dominated by the Uber-Ola duopoly, and these services favor lower-trim, cost-effective models, Counterpoint’s Mukherjee said.

A 2024 report by Mathias Corvinus Collegium, a Hungarian think tank, noted that VinFast has addressed production capacity through massive investment but failed to realize the economies of scale through actual sales.

Last year, when VinFast postponed building its $4 billion North Carolina plant to 2028, chairperson Le Thi Thu Thuy said the company was reallocating capital to markets with “policies and the culture a lot closer to us [in Vietnam].”

""The house has a radiant heat system that is absolutely TERRIBLE in cold weather,"" they posted on r/Maine. ""... So we decided to abandon ship and go the heat pump route.""

An appliance that doesn't perform well in cold weather is a bit of a problem in the Pine Tree State. According to World Population Review, Maine is the fifth-coldest state in the Union. Heating and cooling tend to be the largest expenses on home utility bills, accounting for almost half, so opting for a more energy-efficient system is a smart move.

In simple terms, a heat pump works by gathering heat from the air or the ground outside the home and concentrating it for indoor use. Unlike a standard HVAC system, a heat pump can be used for heating and cooling a home. That efficiency can translate into big savings for homeowners.

While making the right choice can seem daunting, Mitsubishi has online tools to help you find the right system and trusted installers to install the unit that's right for you.

The thread garnered thoughtful comments, with a few posters noting that the homeowner could save even more money by taking advantage of tax credits. ""Have you looked into the inflation reduction act tax credit?"" one said. ""You might be able to drop that price even lower. It's a tax credit, so you won't see it for a while, but keep it in mind when filing taxes next year.""

Another user noted the poster could save 30% if they take advantage of the rebate and congratulated the Redditor on thinking ahead, writing, ""Smart move that will pay dividends when propane costs inevitably go up.""

It's worth noting that these incentives won't last after recent legislation eliminated them. Some clean appliance rebates, however, are still available.

However, compared with 4Q24, when renewable diesel production capacity was comparable to current levels, 1Q25 production was down almost 25%.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/US-renewable-diesel-pic-Biofuel-4-8-768x511.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 03:59:10.270428

— Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia

BANGOR, ME, UNITED STATES, August 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Suncovia, a leading advocate for equitable clean energy solutions, has expressed deep concern over the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025. With its passing, the federal 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) is officially ending on December 31, 2025. The legislation abruptly stops the long-standing tax credit without a phase-out period — creating a narrow and urgent window for homeowners to take advantage of this historic incentive.

Suncovia, a leading force in solar project development and clean energy financing, is calling on homeowners, contractors, and developers to move quickly. This tax credit sunset is one of the most consequential energy policy shifts in over a decade.

“This change dramatically shortens the planning horizon for families considering solar,” said Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia. “If you're thinking about going solar, the time to act is now — not next year.”

WHAT HOMEOWNERS NEED TO KNOW:

DECEMBER 31, 2025 IS A HARD DEADLINE

To qualify for the 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit, solar systems must be fully installed and operational by the end of 2025 — no extensions, no carryovers.

THERE IS NO PHASE-DOWN — NO GRACE PERIOD

Contrary to the Inflation Reduction Act’s original plan for a gradual wind-down through 2034, this legislation cuts the credit off entirely after 2025.

COMMERCIAL SOLAR CREDIT REMAINS, BUT WITH NEW DATES

The 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for commercial and utility-scale projects still stands but now includes new rules: projects must start by July 4, 2026, and be operational by December 31, 2027, to remain eligible.

IMPACTS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THE INDUSTRY:

The end of the federal residential solar tax credit could significantly impact both consumers and the broader solar market. For homeowners, the loss of the 30% credit may result in noticeably higher upfront costs for solar installations. Without the federal incentive, many may experience longer return-on-investment timelines beginning in 2026, which could dampen enthusiasm and delay decision-making.

Additionally, the compressed deadline is expected to create logistical challenges. As the end-of-year deadline approaches, installers may become overbooked, and material availability could tighten. These bottlenecks could prevent some homeowners from completing their installations in time to qualify for the credit.

From an industry perspective, the sudden removal of the residential incentive is likely to cause market disruption. The reduced demand could lead to job losses, particularly among smaller solar contractors and residential-focused providers. This shift may also slow the overall pace of solar adoption, just as the U.S. seeks to solidify its leadership in the global clean energy transition.

Suncovia remains committed to making clean energy accessible. In response to these changes, the company is expanding its support for residential installations through Q4 2025. The company is also closely monitoring legislative activity and working with industry partners and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to advocate for long-term policies that support clean energy adoption and economic resilience.

Suncovia strongly encourages homeowners to act now, before it’s too late. Homeowners should schedule their solar evaluations, secure permits, and finalize installations well before year-end to ensure eligibility for the 30% tax credit.

“This is the last full year for homeowners to take advantage of the most generous solar incentive in U.S. history,” added Craig Mattson. “We don’t want anyone to miss out due to delays or misinformation.”

Lee Zeldin argues that its scientific basis is flawed and economically damaging.
""EPA’s reconsideration of the endangerment finding will eliminate burdensome regulations and save small businesses at least US$170bn.
However, eliminating the Endangerment Finding would strip federal agencies of their authority to set GHG standards for new light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.
Transport remains one of the largest contributors to US GHG emissions.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under Administrator Lee Zeldin has proposed to revoke the 2009 Endangerment Finding, a key legal instrument that has enabled the federal regulation of GHG emissions from vehicles and engines.

Announced at an Indiana car dealership alongside Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Governor Mike Braun, the proposal represents a sharp reversal in the country's climate and energy regulatory framework.

It marks a move away from emissions controls and toward expanded fossil fuel use in transport and industrial sectors.

Understanding the Endangerment Finding’s role in energy and transport

The Endangerment Finding, issued in 2009 during the Obama administration, concluded that six pollutants, including CO₂, posed a danger to public health and welfare.

This determination gave the EPA authority, under the Clean Air Act, to regulate GHG emissions.

That ruling has underpinned more than US$1tn in climate regulations, including those targeting fuel efficiency, vehicle standards and the push for EV adoption. The Biden administration's EV mandate also stems from this legal framework.

Lee Zeldin argues that its scientific basis is flawed and economically damaging. ""With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” says Lee.

“The Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent and warped science to achieve their preferred ends.”

According to the EPA’s new analysis, repealing the finding would reverse what Zeldin describes as “US$1tn or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.”

The agency contends that this will lower goods prices, restore consumer choice in vehicles and reduce supply chain friction, particularly for logistics and trucking.

""EPA’s reconsideration of the endangerment finding will eliminate burdensome regulations and save small businesses at least US$170bn.

""I’m excited to work alongside Administrator Zeldin to cut red tape and unleash President Trump‘s new golden age for Main Street.”

Energy policy, emissions and legal consequences

While the EPA claims that the repeal is supported by updated science and economic modelling, including estimates of US$54bn in annual savings, environmental advocates warn of long-term risks.

The Department of Energy’s 2025 Climate Work Group study has been cited as part of the revised rationale.

However, eliminating the Endangerment Finding would strip federal agencies of their authority to set GHG standards for new light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles.

Measures such as fuel-saving start-stop systems, controversial but effective, could also be dropped.

Transport remains one of the largest contributors to US GHG emissions.

Removing national limits on vehicle emissions risks slowing the country's decarbonisation effort and impacting international credibility.

Legally, the proposal draws strength from the Supreme Court’s decision in West Virginia v. EPA, which determined that major regulatory actions must be backed by clear Congressional approval.

Lee believes the 2009 ruling bypassed that requirement: “The Obama Administration ignored Congress’ clear intent... using unprecedented logic to expand EPA’s power.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/01e79ecb02434b67070ed7d51d95afdf:d4db82b803729228dd59f2451bed7208/p20250207dt-0103-54325633746-o-055296.webp.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 03:59:14.463753

And their innovative diagnostic setup will have range-boosting potential, according to a news release from developer ZF.

The product, called TempAI, uses artificial intelligence to improve temperature control by 15%. It's an invention that boosts efficiency, reduces the need for rare and expensive materials, and shortens development times from months to days, per ZF.

""We are proud to bring this innovation into series production and thus making a significant contribution to more efficient e-mobility,"" Otmar Scharrer, ZF's head of development for electrified powertrain technology, said in the release.

Generally, electric motors use power from the battery to drive the wheels. Cooling systems, controllers, and other tech are typically part of the setups, per the U.S. Department of Energy.

ZF's AI software doesn't require more hardware add-ons. The temperature analysis requires low energy but provides fast, actionable metrics for existing control units. As a result, the motors can operate to their safest limit, giving 6% more peak power, while reducing energy consumption up to 18%. The performance was proved during testing, according to ZF.

""This technology enables us to further increase the efficiency and reliability of our drives. At the same time, TempAI demonstrates how data-driven development can be not only faster, but also more sustainable and more powerful,"" Dr. Stefan Sicklinger, head of AI, digital engineering, and validation in research and development, said in the release.

AI is being used by experts at the University of Liverpool to develop a better EV battery electrolyte. In China, advanced computing is helping scientists better understand nuclear fusion reactors.

At ZF, it is giving experts an inside look at e-motors through millions of data points.

""TempAI is a real technological breakthrough for the temperature management of electric drives."" Scharrer said in the release.

The improved performance could help increase already strong EV numbers. BloombergNEF reported that experts expect 22 million EVs to be sold globally this year. It would be a 25% jump from last year.

That's despite slowing numbers stateside — mainly due to fossil-friendly energy policy that leverages ""a mighty federal arsenal,"" according to Politico. EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 are being retired years early, on Sept. 30, CNBC reported. The clean energy cutbacks are part of President Donald Trump's spending bill.

Still, certain states provide their own incentives. That's in addition to the approximately $1,500 a year EV owners can save in gas and service costs. What's more, each EV that replaces a gas-guzzling ride prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution annually, according to the DOE. Tailpipe exhaust and other fumes are released when fossil fuels are burned, polluting the air with toxic substances that contribute to 6.5 million deaths worldwide a year, per the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

Hastening the shift to cleaner transportation can help clear the air.

According to data from the automaker, total U.S. sales reached 79,543 units, a 15% increase from July 2024, with electrified models—including pure EVs and hybrids—driving much of the growth. This surge underscores Hyundai’s aggressive push into sustainable mobility, even as global automotive markets grapple with fluctuating demand and supply chain hurdles.

The standout performer was the IONIQ 5, Hyundai’s flagship electric SUV, which saw retail sales jump 71% compared to the previous year. Models like the Santa Fe hybrid and Elantra hybrid also set records, contributing to electrified vehicles making up a significant portion of the sales mix. Randy Parker, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, highlighted in a company statement that this performance reflects strong consumer demand for efficient, tech-forward options amid rising fuel costs and environmental concerns.

Electrified Lineup Fuels Record-Breaking Momentum

While Hyundai’s global sales dipped slightly by 1.4% to 332,003 units in July, as reported on the company’s official worldwide newsroom, the U.S. market told a different story. Electrified sales not only boosted totals but also highlighted a shift in buyer preferences, with hybrids and EVs representing 32% of retail sales. This aligns with broader industry trends where consumers are increasingly opting for vehicles that offer both performance and lower emissions, helping Hyundai outpace competitors in key segments.

In contrast to the global dip, North American demand remained robust, driven by incentives like federal tax credits for EVs and competitive pricing. Publications such as Electrek, cited in a Slashdot summary, noted that Hyundai’s growth was “mainly driven by electrified vehicles,” emphasizing how models like the IONIQ 5 are resonating with tech-savvy buyers seeking fast-charging capabilities and modern designs.

Competitive Edge in a Crowded EV Market

Hyundai’s success comes at a time when rivals like Tesla and Ford are also vying for EV market share, but posts on X (formerly Twitter) from industry watchers like Sawyer Merritt indicate Hyundai and its affiliate Kia captured 10% of U.S. EV sales in the first seven months of 2024, trailing only Tesla’s dominant 49.7%. This positions Hyundai as a formidable challenger, especially with its expanding lineup that includes the upcoming IONIQ 9 three-row SUV, set to further bolster its portfolio.

Analysts point to Hyundai’s strategic investments, such as the $5.5 billion EV and battery plant in Savannah, Georgia, which began ramping up production in late 2024. As detailed in a Reuters report referenced on X by user John Raymond Hanger, this facility is expected to enhance supply and meet growing demand, with executives stating they could sell even more if capacity allowed. Such infrastructure plays a critical role in Hyundai’s long-term electrification strategy, aiming for 21 EV models globally by 2030.

Challenges Amid Global Headwinds

Despite the U.S. triumphs, Hyundai faces headwinds elsewhere. In India, for instance, July 2025 sales totaled 60,073 units, with domestic figures at 43,973 and exports at 16,100, as per a Business Upturn article. SUVs like the Creta led with 71.8% of domestic sales—the highest ever for Hyundai Motor India—yet overall growth was modest compared to U.S. figures, reflecting regional variations in EV adoption.

Globally, Hyundai sold 757,191 electrified vehicles in 2024, an 8.9% increase, with acceleration in the fourth quarter, according to an AInvest analysis. This resilience is notable against a backdrop of cautious consumer spending, as seen in BYD’s minimal 0.6% year-over-year growth in July, highlighted in X posts by energy analyst Dan Tsubouchi. Hyundai’s hybrid-heavy approach provides a buffer, appealing to buyers not yet ready for full EVs.

Strategic Shifts and Future Outlook

Looking ahead, Hyundai is doubling down on electrification, with CEO statements from May 2024, as reported by Sawyer Merritt on X, affirming commitment despite any perceived slowdowns. Innovations like bidirectional charging in the IONIQ 5 and software updates are enhancing appeal, positioning Hyundai to capture more market share as infrastructure improves.

For industry insiders, this July surge signals Hyundai’s adept navigation of a transitional era in automotive manufacturing. By blending hybrids with pure EVs, the company mitigates risks associated with battery supply chains and charging networks, potentially setting a blueprint for others. As Randy Parker noted in the Hyundai Newsroom release for July 2025 sales, “We achieved new records across multiple nameplates,” underscoring a momentum that could redefine competitive dynamics in the coming years.

Innovation and Market Adaptation Drive Sustained Growth

Hyundai’s record-breaking July also included highs for models like the Palisade SUV, up 59% in retail sales, blending traditional strengths with electrified options. This hybrid strategy is particularly effective in markets like the U.S., where EV adoption is accelerating but hybrids serve as a bridge for mainstream buyers.

Ultimately, Hyundai’s performance reflects a broader industry pivot toward sustainability, backed by data from sources like PR Newswire’s November 2024 sales report, which showed an 8% year-over-year increase. As the automaker continues to innovate, its July 2025 results may well mark the beginning of a new chapter in global mobility leadership.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-a9a604d8-e7a2-4292-b6a0-cf40c1ce592d.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 03:59:03.409971

MK Stalin inaugurated the plant in the presence of the company’s CEO of VinFast Asia, Pham Sanh Chau, with the roll out of the premium VF7 car.

VinFast setting up its base in the State adds another feather in the cap for the thriving auto sector in Tamil Nadu, called the Detroit of Asia. For Thoothukudi, this is a major boost for industrial development as the town is yet to recover from the closure of the Sterlite Copper smelter plant in 2018 due to alleged environmental issues.

Tamil Nadu is home to car manufacturing by vendors like Hyundai, Renault-Nissan (now Renault), Stellantis and BMW. The Ford plant is defunct now and Tata’s JLR will start production in a few months.

The State produces one out of every five cars made in India and contributes to nearly 40 per cent of India’s automobile exports, according to the State Planning Commission.

In April 2024, Vietnam-based electric vehicle maker VinFast Auto Ltd commenced construction work for establishing a new integrated EV manufacturing unit at Thoothukudi with planned investment of ₹4,000 crore, spread over 5 years. In March 2024, the Vietnamese company signed an agreement with the Tamil Nadu government to invest ₹16,000 crore over some time.

The new factory has been set up in a 400-acre site at the industrial park of State Industries Promotion Corporation of Tamil Nadu (SIPCOT) and it is expected to generate jobs for 3,000 to 3,500 people.

The plant is the company’s third operational plant - the first outside Vietnam - and the fifth project in its global manufacturing network.

Chief Minister MK Stalin said that the facility will boost bilateral relations between Vietnam and Tamil Nadu. “Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu saw the first car manufacturing (Hyundai in 1998) while the EV car manufacturing plant is being inaugurated at Thoothukudi. This is a big to the industrial development for the region,” he said.

The plant will be the country’s full EV car manufacturing unit, which will provide employment to a large number of local people, he said. The company has so far invested ₹1,300 crore in the plant, he added.

Vinfast CEO Chau said that the company did a survey of 15 sites in 6 states across India looking at infrastructure, government incentive and growth potential. Tamil Nadu stood out, and the company decided to set up the facility, he said. The first global customers were from countries like Sri Lanka and Maldives, he said.

Tamil Nadu Industries Minister TRB Rajaa said that 20 months ago, the possibility of a car manufacturing (in Thoothukudi) was not thought of. But, 18 months ago, the MoU was signed with VinFast and today, the dream has become a reality with a ₹16,000 crore investment through the new factory.

In the initial phase, VinFast Tamil Nadu will focus on assembling two premium electric SUV models - the VF7 and VF6. The plant’s annual capacity is 50,000, scalable up to 150,000 to meet rising market demand. With the launch of the plant, VinFast moves closer to its target sales target of 200,000 vehicles and its long-term production goal of 1 million vehicles per year by 2030, the company said in a statement.

On August 1st, VinFast opened its showroom (its biggest) in Chennai - the second after Surat on July 27. The company is scheduled to inaugurate its plant in the port town of Thoothukudi on Monday. VinFast Auto India, the Indian subsidiary VinFast, as part of its roadmap, aims to launch 35 dealerships by year-end, across 27+ cities.

VinFast officially opened pre-bookings for its premium electric SUVs, the VF6 and VF7 on July 15. Customers can now book their preferred VinFast premium electric SUV either at the exclusive showrooms or through the official website, VinFastAuto.in, with a fully refundable booking amount of ₹21,000.

It has also partnered with multiple dealer groups in key cities and teamed up with RoadGrid, myTVS and Global Assure to build a digital services and after-sales support network. VinFast has also joined forces with BatX Energies to enable battery recovery and reuse, advancing circular production and sustainable development in the world’s third largest automobile market, the release said.

According to an official of a major freight forwarder, the new factory will be a major boost to the shipping community. “We need more such facilities to help the shipping community to grow,” he added.

The inauguration of VinFast is likely to be followed by large industrial projects worth over ₹45,000 crore like ACME Green Hydrogen & Chemical (₹27,000 crore); Green Infra Renewable Energy Farms Pvt Ltd (₹8,460 crore); Amplus Ganges Solar (₹6,000 crore) and Renew E-fuels Pvt Ltd (₹400 crore).

China’s export restrictions on next-generation battery technologies allow Beijing to dictate the global market as these innovations are commercialized.
It was inevitable that the “age of economic warfare,” as coined by Edward Fishman in “Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare,” would eventually find its way into the energy transition.
The age of economic warfare is marked by the use of tools like sanctions, financial restrictions, export controls, and the weaponization of key chokepoints to exert economic power.
But it is highly unlikely the U.S. will follow the same playbook when it comes to LFP technologies.","China’s export restrictions on heavy rare earths and permanent magnets have garnered the majority of the public’s attention, but a new set of restrictions on battery supply chain technology signal a turning point. The April restrictions on rare earths were a continuation of China’s past approach, focusing on dual-use applications and minerals with small markets. But Beijing’s decision in July to implement export licensing requirements on lithium-ion cathode active materials and lithium extraction technologies marks the start of a new era. The age of economic warfare has now come for the energy transition.

In a move initially proposed in early January, China’s Ministry of Commerce, in coordination with the Ministry of Science and Technology, formally added a series of advanced critical minerals and battery supply chain technologies to the “Catalogue of Technologies Prohibited and Restricted from Export from China.” The most impactful are export-licensing requirements on technologies necessary to produce next generation lithium-iron phosphate (LFP) and lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode active materials along with technologies for direct lithium extraction. Cathode active materials are a core component of a lithium-ion battery that determines its energy density, performance, and cost.

China dominates the global lithium-ion battery supply chain, with particularly overwhelming control over LFP technologies. Chinese companies produce nearly 99 percent of the world’s LFP cathode materials and lead in LFP cell manufacturing, driven by strong domestic demand for affordable electric vehicles. LFP, instead of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC), is now the chemistry of choice in the world’s largest EV market. In the context of these restrictions, Chinese companies are also the only companies that have started to produce next-generation LFP cathode active material. Next-generation LFP material significantly increases the energy density of LFP batteries. The higher density allows vehicles to compete with NMC batteries, which have higher energy density, on driving range, without the added cost of additional raw materials like nickel and cobalt. The result is a “best of both worlds” solution: lower-cost EVs with superior performance.

China’s export restrictions on next-generation battery technologies allow Beijing to dictate the global market as these innovations are commercialized. By limiting access to the best LFP technology, Beijing can slow the development of foreign competitors while forcing them to rely on Chinese imports – effectively reinforcing its dominance in the battery supply chain. These controls not only protect and promote domestic manufacturing, but also advance China’s broader strategy of exporting battery technologies and EVs worldwide, as Chinese brands expand their global footprint.

China has also restricted technologies key to direct lithium extraction (DLE). Unlike traditional brine-based methods – which rely on large evaporation ponds and take 18-24 months to yield lithium – DLE technologies can extract lithium in a matter of hours or days. This makes it possible to produce lithium from brine sources that were previously uneconomical or geologically unsuitable. By enabling faster production timelines, reducing water usage, and expanding the geographic footprint of viable lithium projects, DLE could diversify global supply if it is fully commercialized.

The new restrictions target adsorption‑membrane related technologies that are necessary for the development of DLE. Chinese producers, like Sunresin, are the leading providers. As Reuters reported in February, several U.S. companies looking to expand into DLE currently rely on Sunresin’s technologies. U.S. companies could eventually produce their own material, but it would severely slow their extraction development and allow Chinese companies to become the global leaders in a still emerging industry. The United States can support companies like Lilac Solutions and Albemarle that are building non-Chinese technologies to respond to these restrictions.

Previously, China’s export restrictions focused predominantly on materials and technologies with dual-use applications: gallium, germanium, graphite, and most recently heavy rare earths elements and advanced permanent magnets. Graphite and rare earths are necessary for batteries, wind turbines, and electric vehicles but the restrictions were implemented because of their dual use applications. The new restrictions are focused solely on technologies vital to the energy transition. China created key chokepoints in clean energy supply chains, and now Beijing is taking advantage of them. China is exerting its control to slow the development of competitors, support domestic producers, and dictate the next generation of the clean energy economy.

It was inevitable that the “age of economic warfare,” as coined by Edward Fishman in “Chokepoints: American Power in the Age of Economic Warfare,” would eventually find its way into the energy transition. It has already proliferated through all aspects of our economy. The age of economic warfare is marked by the use of tools like sanctions, financial restrictions, export controls, and the weaponization of key chokepoints to exert economic power. As Fishman describes in “Chokepoints,” the modern age of economic warfare has reshaped the global financial system, oil market, and semiconductor industry. It was only a matter of time before the energy transition became entangled.

The shift from export restrictions on raw or processed materials to advanced technologies mirrors Beijing’s broader strategy in the battery supply chain over the last two decades. China began its ascent in the supply chain in the upstream with overseas investments in lithium, cobalt, nickel, and other critical mineral mining projects. Then it moved downstream, leveraging those resources to focus on advanced technologies and build a comprehensive battery supply chain and electric vehicle sector. As global competition over clean energy supply chains intensifies, China is demonstrating that the battle is not just about resources – it’s about who controls the tools of the transition. And Beijing decided to follow the Washington playbook to make their mark.

In September 2022, weeks prior to announcing the United States’ strongest export restrictions to date on advanced semiconductors, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser for previous U.S President Joe Biden, stated “on export controls, we have to revisit the longstanding premise of maintaining ‘relative’ advantages over competitors in certain key technologies…we must maintain as large of a lead as possible.” The new export restrictions on LFP and DLE allow China to maintain “as large of a lead as possible” in the battery supply chain. Whereas the United States has used export controls to slow down China’s military-adjacent technology sectors, Beijing has adopted a similar playbook, but repurposed it to serve industrial, not security, priorities. China is looking to slow down foreign commercial competitors and support domestic manufacturing rather than denying adversaries military capabilities.

China is following the United States’ playbook, but it remains to be seen if the Trump administration will follow China’s playbook when it comes to responding to technology restrictions. Beijing poured funding into a domestic semiconductor supply chain when the U.S. implemented restrictions on advanced semiconductors. They decided they were going to have to build their own industry if they could not rely on access to leading Western technology.

The Trump administration did follow a similar playbook in response to restrictions on rare earth elements and permanent magnets through the Department of Defense’s investment into MP Materials. The creative funding mechanism aims to build a domestic mine to magnet supply chain. Like Beijing before it, Washington finally realized that it could not allow a competitor to control key chokepoints on technologies necessary for the defense sector. Additionally, rare earths could continue to be a major bargaining chip in any trade negotiations.

But it is highly unlikely the U.S. will follow the same playbook when it comes to LFP technologies. There has been a series of recent announcements of new domestic LFP production from LG, SK ON, and Samsung. However, these efforts are constrained by the absence of domestic cathode production, limited technical expertise in advanced LFP materials, and higher production costs. To compete with China, the United States would have had to double down on the energy transition to build domestic demand and strengthen the Inflation Reduction Act benefits.",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2025-08-01-194711.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 03:00:41.312450

“In May, we launched the Strengthen Your Roof program, which invested $20 million in grants to policyholders in the Outer Banks and Barrier Islands,” said Gina Hardy, CEO of the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association, the state-created program to help coastal homeowners find coverage.
Roof claims are among the most common in coastal areas that are vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storm winds.
The endorsement provides up to $5,000 in additional coverage for FORTIFIED Roof upgrades when a roof is replaced due to damage from a covered claim.

“In May, we launched the Strengthen Your Roof program, which invested $20 million in grants to policyholders in the Outer Banks and Barrier Islands,” said Gina Hardy, CEO of the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association, the state-created program to help coastal homeowners find coverage. “Now, we are expanding that commitment with the Strengthen Your Coastal Roof program, adding another $20 million in funding to the remaining 18 coastal counties we serve.”

The program, unlike most other states’ wind-mitigation grant programs, is funded largely through the NCIUA’s surplus, which has grown in recent months due in large part to reduced reinsurance costs, Hardy said earlier this year.

The FORTIFIED process was developed by the Insurance Institute for Business and Home Safety and is considered to be something of a gold standard for wind-resistant roofs. Roof claims are among the most common in coastal areas that are vulnerable to hurricanes and tropical storm winds. The standard requires stronger roof deck attachment, sealed roof decks, and locked-down edges.

Crucially, each installation is verified by a third party to ensure the upgrades meet IBHS standards, state Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey said at the announcement in July.

“Research from the Institute for Advanced Analytics at North Carolina State University shows that homes with a FORTIFIED Roof had about 35% fewer claims after Hurricanes Matthew, Florence, Dorian, and Isaias,” Causey said in a statement. “When claims were filed, the damage was about 23% less severe.”

Grants made through the expanded program will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. Eligible policyholders in the following counties are encouraged to apply promptly to reserve funding: Brunswick, Carteret, New Hanover, Onslow, Beaufort, Camden, Chowan, Craven, Jones, Pender, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrell, Washington, Currituck, Dare, Hyde, and Pamlico.

NCIUA also offers the Stronger Roof Endorsement at no cost to all policyholders. The endorsement provides up to $5,000 in additional coverage for FORTIFIED Roof upgrades when a roof is replaced due to damage from a covered claim.

With the combined impact of the Strengthen Your Roof and Strengthen Your Coastal Roof programs, along with the Stronger Roof Endorsement, NCIUA said it has assisted more than 18,000 policyholders in obtaining an IBHS FORTIFIED roof since adopting the standard in 2016. These efforts represent more than $120 million invested in building stronger, safer homes across the coast.

The programs are another indication that wind-mitigation efforts, including FORTIFIED roofs, are catching on across much of the country as ways to reduce insurance claims and premiums. More states have introduced mitigation grant programs. And most property insurers are required to offer premium discounts or credits when mitigation work is completed.

And it’s not just hurricanes that are protected against: Research from the Institute for Advanced Analytics found a 63% reduction in claims from non-named storms among homes with FORTIFIED Roofs, Causey noted.",https://www.insurancejournal.com/app/uploads/2025/08/north-carolina-expands-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 06:02:59.046828

(CNN) — Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Sunday defended the Trump administration’s move to repeal the so-called endangerment finding that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health.

“To reach the 2009 endangerment finding, they relied on the most pessimistic views of the science. The great news is that a lot of the pessimistic views of the science in 2009 that was being assumed ended up not panning out,” Zeldin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We can rely on 2025 facts as opposed to 2009 bad assumptions.”

The 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety, which has served as EPA’s basis for many of its significant regulations aiming to protect the environment and decrease climate pollution. If successful, the repeal could strip away the federal government’s most powerful way to control the country’s planet-warming pollution and fight climate change.

The text of the administration’s proposal to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding said that while greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the atmosphere, that rise has been “driven primarily by increased emissions from foreign sources,” and has happened “without producing the degree of adverse impacts to public health and welfare in the United States that the EPA anticipated in the 2009 Endangerment Finding.”

The US is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and historically has emitted more planet-warming pollution than any other country. Many rigorous scientific findings since 2009 have showed both climate pollution and its warming effects are not just harming public health but killing people outright.

In the nearly 16 years since the EPA first issued the Supreme Court-ordered endangerment finding, the world has warmed an additional 0.45 degrees Celsius (or 0.81 degrees Fahrenheit) to 1.4 degrees Celsius, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather.

“Both the scientific certainty around climate change and evidence of the dangers it is causing have grown stronger since 2009,” Hausfather said in an email. “There is no evidence that has emerged or been published in the scientific literature in the past 16 years that would in any way challenge the scientific basis of the 2009 endangerment finding.”

Pressed on whether he’s skeptical of the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are the overwhelming driver of man-made climate change, Zeldin said, “That might be your way to try to twist my words.”

The EPA is in a public comment period on its proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles, since they stem from the 2009 finding.

“We’re going through a public comment period. We want to make the right decision afterwards. But for people who want to sum up the 2009 endangerment finding as if they study carbon dioxide as an endangerment on human health, they did not do that,” Zeldin told CNN.

Asked whether the EPA should have a role in trying to combat climate change, Zeldin said that the Supreme Court “made it very clear that I have to follow the law.”

“I have to follow the plain language of the law, and I can’t get creative. So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion. The Supreme Court has made it very clear that that is not what is a power that I have,” he said, adding that drawing up such a regulation should be left to Congress.

Fast forward to today and the frontiers of global technology have pivoted to AI and next‑generation energy.

In one domain, AI, the US has far outpaced any other nation — though China looks to be closing the gap. In the other, energy, it has just tied its shoelaces together. The reason isn’t technology, economics or, despite the government’s official line, even national security. Rather, it is politics.

Since returning to the White House in January, Donald Trump has handed out huge wins to the coal and oil and gas industries. This is no great surprise. Trump has long been supportive of the US fossil fuel industry and, since his reelection, has appointed several former industry lobbyists to top political positions.

According to the Trump administration, national security requires gutting support for renewable energy while performing political CPR on the dying coal industry.

The reality is that, since 2019, the US has produced more oil, gas and coal annually than Americans want to use, with the rest exported and sold overseas. It is currently one of the most prolific exporters of fossil fuels in the world.

In short, the US does not have an energy security problem. It does, however, have an energy cost problem combined with a growing climate change crisis. These issues will only be made worse by Trump’s enthusiasm for fossil fuels.

Over the past six months, the Trump administration has upended half a decade of green industrial policy. It has clawed back billions of US dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.

Meanwhile, China has roared forward. Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined. To China’s delight, the US has simply stopped competing to be the world’s clean energy powerhouse.

Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China. Many of the newest high‑tech batteries are also being developed and patented there. While Trump repeats the tired mantra of “drill, baby, drill”, China is building factories, cornering the market for critical minerals such as lithium and nickel and locking in export partners.

At the same time, household energy spending in the US is expected to increase by $170 (£126) each year between now and 2035 as a result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The bill, which includes sweeping changes to taxes, social security and more, will raise energy costs mainly because it strips away support for cheap and abundant renewables like wind and solar.

Household energy costs could go up even more as Trump threatens to make large‑scale clean energy development much more onerous by putting up bureaucratic hurdles. The administration recently issued a directive requiring the secretary of the interior to approve even routine activities for wind and solar projects connected to federal lands.

Meanwhile, climate change is hitting American communities harder with each passing year. As recent flooding in Texas and urban fires in California and Hawaii have shown, fewer Americans still have the luxury of ignoring climate change.

As the cost of these disasters mount — $183 billion in 2024 — the grifting of the oil and gas industry will become an increasingly bitter pill for the nation to swallow.

China, with its authoritarian government, is less susceptible to the petroleum-obsessed dogma fueling the Republican party. It does not have prominent leaders like US politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, who previously warned that Democrats are trying to “emasculate the way we drive” by advocating for electric vehicles. Rather, China’s leaders are seeing green — not in the environmental sense, but in a monetary one.

It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations. According to a June 2025 report by Lazard, an asset management company, electricity from new large-scale solar farms costs up to $78 per megawatt hour — and often much less. The same electricity from a newly built natural gas plants, by comparison, can cost as much as $107 per megawatt hour.

Across the world, utilities are embracing clean energy, choosing lower costs for their customers while reducing pollution. China saw the writing on the wall decades ago and its early investments are bearing a rich harvest. It now produces more than half of the world’s electric vehicles and the vast majority of its solar panels.

The US can still compete at the leading edge of the energy sector. American companies are developing innovative new approaches to geothermal, battery recycling and many other energy technologies.

But in the battle to become the world’s 21st-century energy manufacturing powerhouse, the US seems to have walked off the playing field.

In Trump’s telling, the US may have simply exited one race and reentered another. But the fossil fuel industry — financially, environmentally and ethically — is obviously a dead end.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-08-04%2Ficeii36s%2Fwind-farm.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-08-04 02:00:02.930274

SK On is focused on honing its edge in thermal management technology, such as immersion cooling designed to boost the efficiency of batteries for AI data centers, energy storage systems and electric vehicles, Park Kisoo, head of the company’s research and development arm, said in an interview. The battery specialist already is in talks with Ford Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. to collaborate on the cutting-edge tech, he said.

A representative for Ford declined to comment. Hyundai didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The push comes amid a broad reorganization of the SK group, a leading South Korean conglomerate, which plans to merge money-losing SK On with more profitable sister company SK Enmove in a bid to stabilize its balance sheet. The move follows another in-group transaction by SK On’s parent company a year ago with a similar goal of shoring up finances as the battery unit pursues aggressive expansion overseas.

The Korean company operates two standalone battery plants in Georgia which supply Ford and Volkswagen AG, and is planning another facility in the state with Hyundai. SK On and Ford received a $9.63 billion loan from the US government late last year to build two battery factories in Kentucky and another in neighboring Tennessee. They have paused plans for a battery plant in Canada. SK On also has battery production facilities in China, Europe and at home in South Korea.

Park said his R&D center will spur internal efforts to diversify suppliers and strengthen supply chains to bolster the company’s US production and ramp up its energy storage business there.

EV demand is set to decline further with the looming end of US tax credits in September, but the R&D chief sees global sales rebounding as early as late 2027 — if automakers can close the price gap between EVs and gas-powered vehicles.

“For many EV drivers, there’s no going back, and the penetration rate is only set to grow in China and elsewhere,” Park said.

SK On also is targeting development of solid-state batteries by the end of 2027 and mass production of them from 2029, he said. Semi solid-state batteries, a hybrid version of current and next-generation tech, could be commercialized even sooner.

“When the world of solid-state batteries arrives, it will definitely be first applied in pouch-type cells in which we already have a technological edge,” Park said. “That could be a weapon that can help us beat China.”

Solid-state batteries are more powerful, durable, faster to charge and safer than the lithium-ion cells currently dominating the EV sector. That’s set off a global race to bring those batteries to market among top suppliers, including China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. and BYD Co. as well as South Korea’s LG Energy Solution Ltd. and Samsung SDI Co.

Jiang argues that blockchain can coordinate unused resources, including labor and infrastructure, in a decentralized manner to build a more resilient energy system [1]. By incentivizing individuals to install solar panels or home batteries through token-based rewards, blockchain can help create a grid that operates without heavy reliance on centralized systems [1].

This approach aligns with the Trump administration’s emphasis on upgrading the U.S. energy grid to support energy-intensive sectors such as artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency mining. A recent White House report highlighted the importance of modernizing the grid, which is described as “one of the largest and most complex machines on Earth,” to meet the demands of future technologies [1]. The administration has also proposed exploring nuclear energy and protecting the grid from electromagnetic disruptions to enhance its reliability and security [1].

According to the White House report, building redundant systems to ensure maximum grid uptime and resiliency is a key policy objective. This strategy reflects a broader recognition that the U.S. must optimize its energy resources to sustain high-performance computing applications and maintain its competitive edge in the global AI race [1]. The administration has repeatedly stressed the importance of maximizing energy output to meet the growing needs of data centers and other high-energy consumption industries [1].

Meanwhile, blockchain’s potential to support decentralized energy systems is being explored in various academic and industry contexts. Research into Ethereum-based smart contracts has revealed their potential to enhance transparency and security in digital infrastructures, suggesting similar applications in energy management [2]. Additionally, companies such as LumiShare are experimenting with tokenizing real-world assets, including renewable energy projects, to improve access to clean energy and create new investment opportunities [3].

The integration of blockchain into energy systems, however, is not without challenges. It requires the development of robust regulatory frameworks, stakeholder cooperation, and significant investment in supporting infrastructure. Despite these hurdles, venture capitalists and industry experts remain optimistic about the long-term benefits of decentralized energy models, including reduced costs, greater consumer control, and improved grid resilience [1].

As blockchain-based solutions continue to gain traction in the energy sector, the U.S. could see a shift toward a more distributed and efficient energy model. While the pace of transformation remains uncertain, the technology is already drawing interest from investors, researchers, and policymakers, signaling a potential turning point in how energy is generated, distributed, and consumed.

Cosmo Jiang, a general partner at Pantera, emphasized that blockchain can revolutionize how energy is produced and distributed by aligning incentives in a way that was previously unachievable. He noted that the core of human civilization has always been the coordination of incentives, and blockchain introduces a new decentralized method to achieve this [1].

Jiang explained that gig economy platforms have already demonstrated how individuals can monetize their spare resources outside of regular work hours. Blockchain can extend this concept by leveraging unused infrastructure and human labor to create a decentralized energy grid. For instance, protocols using token incentives can encourage everyday people to install solar panels or home batteries, creating a decentralized power network without the need for large capital investments [1].

This shift toward decentralization aligns with the broader goals of the Trump administration, which has positioned energy grid modernization as a key priority for advancing artificial intelligence and high-performance computing [1]. A recent White House report highlighted the need to upgrade the U.S. energy grid to support energy-intensive sectors such as AI data centers and cryptocurrency mining. The report also called for exploring alternative energy sources like nuclear power and implementing measures to protect the grid from electromagnetic interference [1].

President Donald Trump has repeatedly underscored the importance of maximizing energy resources to meet the demands of these high-tech industries. His administration’s energy infrastructure plan includes building redundant systems to ensure maximum grid uptime and resiliency. These actions aim to streamline regulatory processes that have traditionally slowed infrastructure development [1].

Beyond the U.S., blockchain-based energy solutions are gaining traction globally. In Singapore, for example, smart home devices are being developed to leverage blockchain for secure and transparent energy transactions [4]. These initiatives highlight the adaptability of blockchain in creating scalable and modular systems across different regulatory environments [4].

The potential of blockchain in energy systems also extends to other sectors, such as artificial intelligence. The immutable and permissionless nature of blockchain is being explored as a framework for decentralized AI systems [3]. In the energy context, this could support AI-driven grid management that autonomously optimizes energy distribution based on real-time data [3].

The growing interest from venture capital in blockchain for energy reflects a broader recognition of the technology’s role in addressing infrastructure challenges. By decentralizing energy control and enabling localized markets, blockchain can create a more robust, resilient, and responsive energy ecosystem [1]. It also facilitates the integration of renewable energy by making it easier to connect distributed generation sources into the grid [1].

As the U.S. energy landscape continues to evolve, blockchain is emerging as a key tool for building a modern, decentralized infrastructure. Its ability to offer transparency, security, and efficiency positions it as a compelling solution for the challenges of the 21st century [1].

Agencies have responded by issuing a flurry of IFRs over the last few weeks, rescinding most of their NEPA regulations.","Key Takeaways

What happened: Over the last few weeks, individual federal agencies have issued interim final rules (IFRs) to largely rescind their existing NEPA regulations. Agencies have replaced those regulations with a mixture of slimmed-down regulations and non-binding guidance/manuals/handbooks.

Major Streamlining: Following CEQ's lead, agencies are making major changes to NEPA processes to speed up and simplify reviews. There are some variations in agency approaches, but they all follow the theme of expediting NEPA compliance and final decision-making.

Who this affects: Companies, States, and other sponsors undertaking projects that require federal permits, involve federal funding, occur on federal lands, or otherwise may trigger NEPA review.

What you should do: Stay informed about changes to relevant agency NEPA provisions and submit public comments where applicable. Many agencies are accepting comments on their IFRs until August 4, 2025. Agencies have indicated that even more NEPA changes are forthcoming.

Background

The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) took effect in 1970. The Council on Environmental Quality originally issued non-binding guidance to assist agencies in developing implementation procedures. In 1977, to standardize NEPA procedures across the federal government, President Carter issued an executive order requiring CEQ to promulgate regulations that would be binding on federal agencies.

CEQ promulgated binding regulations in 1978 that largely went untouched for over 40 years. Agencies issued their own supplemental regulations that incorporated CEQ's regulations by reference. But recently, NEPA has not been immune to policy pendulum swings across administrations. The first Trump administration promulgated new CEQ regulations in 2020 that provided the first overhaul of the 1978 regulations. Congress then passed the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA), which codified a number of the CEQ 2020 rule provisions into law while streamlining other permitting requirements. The Biden administration then issued another overhaul of CEQ NEPA regulations in 2024, trumpeting concepts like climate change, environmental justice, and indigenous knowledge.

Over the last year, courts have driven major NEPA changes, upon which the latest agency actions seek to capitalize. First, multiple courts held that CEQ lacks the authority to issue binding NEPA regulations. In light of those rulings, the administration has used the good cause exception of the Administrative Procedure Act to rescind CEQ's binding regulations through an interim final rule (IFR) without typical prior notice-and-comment. The administration has since directed other agencies to also rescind their own NEPA regulations and issue non-binding guidance in place of rulemakings where possible. Most recently, the Supreme Court's Seven County decision afforded agencies greater discretion in determining the scope of their NEPA reviews and focusing on the effects of ""the project at hand.""

Agencies have responded by issuing a flurry of IFRs over the last few weeks, rescinding most of their NEPA regulations. Agencies have retained binding regulations to address NEPA topics most beneficial to project proponents, including categorical exclusions, emergencies, and third-party preparation of NEPA documents. Agencies have shifted the majority of their NEPA provisions to separate guidance documents, issued concurrently with the IFRs.

Although the agencies' IFRs are immediately effective, agencies are still accepting public comments on many IFRs and agency guidance. For example, the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI), U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)—encompassing their respective subagencies—as well as other agencies, are accepting public comment until August 4, 2025.

Agencies Adhere to CEQ Guidance Template

Although CEQ rescinded its binding regulations, it issued a guidance template that agencies can use while updating their own NEPA procedures. The guidance will assist agencies in adopting replacement procedures to expedite NEPA reviews, without a gap after rescinding their binding regulations. Agencies have quickly adopted many of the provisions suggested in the guidance template, with some differences.

For example, DOI, DOT, USACE, and DOE have all issued guidance or updated their regulations adopting almost word-for-word the CEQ guidance template's provisions on page limits of environmental impact statements (EISs) and environmental assessments (EAs). All have also adopted nearly identical definitions of ""impacts,"" ""major federal actions,"" and ""non-federal actions."" They have also adopted similar language around project sponsors and analytical methodologies.

Agencies have discretion in using the template, however, and some have already chosen to deviate from CEQ's guidance template in other areas.

For example, the FRA statute requires agencies to include an analysis of the negative environmental impacts of a no-action alternative in an EIS. While CEQ's guidance template largely mirrors the FRA, the agencies have adopted slightly different interpretations. DOT's guidance is to include an analysis of both beneficial and negative environmental impacts of a no action alternative, while USACE's and DOE's guidance suggests they only needs to consider negative environmental impacts of not selecting the proposed action.

Agencies' NEPA Procedures Stripped Down to Statutory Requirements in Some Instances, While Going Beyond in Others

Public Comments: Some agencies are forgoing longstanding public comment policies, particularly on a draft EIS, to include only the public input required by statute. The CEQ 1978 rule required agencies to seek comments from ""interested parties"" during both the scoping and the public comment period for the draft EIS. The CEQ 2020 rule went one step further and required agencies to publish an EIS notice of intent for public comment while maintaining the requirement to seek comment on the draft EIS. The FRA codified the requirement for agencies to publish an EIS notice of intent for public comment.

Yet, new CEQ and agency guidance suggests agencies do not need to seek comment on a draft EIS from the public, the applicant, or certain agencies without authority to develop and enforce environmental standards for the project. USACE's new procedures largely follow CEQ's guidance template, while DOI, DOT, and DOE take slightly different approaches; DOI provides for comments from a broader set of agencies and from the applicant (but not the public), while DOE and DOT make all public comment discretionary (subject to statutory requirements identified by DOT unique to surface transportation projects).

Categorical Exclusion (CE) Borrowing: CEQ and agency guidance, on the other hand, go beyond what is expressly authorized by statute in borrowing of other agencies' CEs. Under new guidance, even without adopting another agency's CE, agencies can nevertheless ""rely on the agency's determination"" that a CE applies to the action at issue, provided that it is substantially the same as the action for which the other agency applied a CE.""

Time limit extensions: The FRA codified a one-year deadline for completing an EA and a two-year deadline for completing an EIS, unless an extension is ""necessary"" to complete the analysis. The recently enacted reconciliation legislation allows project sponsors to cut those times in half by paying the government 125% of anticipated NEPA document preparation or oversight costs. The CEQ guidance template goes a step further and instructs agencies to abide by those deadlines, even if the NEPA document is incomplete, unless the analysis is ""fundamentally in breach of the spirit of NEPA's requirements."" Agencies have adopted similar, but slightly different, language in their newly issued non-binding guidance and updated regulations. For example, DOI, DOT, and USACE have all instructed their agencies to abide by the deadlines unless the analysis is ""inadequate."" DOE guidance abides by the deadlines unless the analysis is ""not sufficiently developed.""

Next Steps

Although streamlining NEPA processes will be a welcome change for many project proponents, some of these new approaches are novel and have not yet faced litigation. Agency staff will need time to adjust to these new requirements, a task complicated by the current shrinking of the federal workforce. The removal of binding regulations may also lead to inconsistencies across agencies and within different offices of a single agency. Project proponents should be aware that agency approaches to NEPA are in flux and of the ways that these new procedures could affect NEPA reviews and any associated litigation.

The Small Parties group — a collection of small and large manufacturers — defended the EPA’s settlement and its endorsement by the district court.
“The surrounding communities have waited far too long for action, and objectors to the settlement should not be allowed to delay the river cleanup any further.
What OxyChem wants OxyChem reported it has already spent $260 million on designing and preparing for the cleanup of the lower river and expects to spend another $257 million on designing the cleanup of the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic.
“I could imagine EPA securing a cleanup for the river even if this settlement is voided.”","After decades of court battles and hundreds of thousands of pages of documentation, the companies that have contributed to severe pollution in an eight-mile stretch of the Lower Passaic River are still fighting over who pays — and how much — for the cleanup.

The latest shot was fired by Occidental Chemical (OxyChem), which says it has already designed an approved cleanup plan but it wants dozens of other companies to share the estimated $1.84 billion cost of removing or capping the cocktail of toxic chemicals on the bottom of the river.

On July 28, OxyChem appealed a federal district court ruling that upheld a consent decree by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency saying the company is responsible for nearly all the cleanup costs. In 1986, the company bought Diamond Alkali, which made dioxin and other deadly chemicals in its manufacture of herbicides and pesticides in Newark from the 1940s to the 1960s.

OxyChem’s argument

The chemical giant maintains Diamond Alkali was not responsible for many of the chemicals in the river, including those resulting from prior industrial production by about 80 other companies starting in the 19th century.

“This extraordinary consent decree — which leaves OxyChem holding the bag for practically all the estimated $1.84 billion cost of cleaning up the Lower Passaic, while purporting to eliminate its right to seek contribution toward that cost from any settling party — cannot be sustained,” the company said in its appeal to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Philadelphia.

OxyChem said the river contains ‘staggering amounts’ of contaminants.

OxyChem accused the District Court of New Jersey of ignoring the requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, and of effectively nullifying Congress’s intent to subject settlements related to the law to meaningful judicial review.

“Instead of letting OxyChem spend its own money to clean up the river and try to recover some of its costs via private-party litigation, EPA decided to let virtually everyone but OxyChem off the hook for a pittance,” the appeal reads.

“Companies that indisputably spewed vast quantities of contaminants into the Passaic for decades — many before OxyChem’s predecessor even came on the scene — thus have been relieved of all risk of liability for pennies on the dollar (if that),” the appeal said.

What the EPA decided

The EPA consent decree said the other companies, known collectively as the Small Parties Group, would pay a total of $150 million toward the cleanup, a sum that OxyChem says is nowhere near their liability. The EPA designated the lower 17 miles of the Passaic River as the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site in 1984; it is one of the nation’s most costly Superfund sites.

The Small Parties group — a collection of small and large manufacturers — defended the EPA’s settlement and its endorsement by the district court.

‘All OxyChem has asked in return is to be allowed to pursue its statutory contribution rights to recover some of the costs of that massive undertaking from the dozens of other polluters of the Passaic River.’ — OxyChem appeal

“The settlement is fair, reasonable, and will help facilitate EPA’s selected remedy for the Lower Passaic River, which has yet to begin,” the group said in a statement. “The surrounding communities have waited far too long for action, and objectors to the settlement should not be allowed to delay the river cleanup any further. We will strongly defend the settlement in court and encourage EPA to force these parties to begin to dredge and cap the lower eight miles of the river as called for in the remedial design that EPA approved over a year ago.”

OxyChem said the river contains “staggering amounts” of contaminants, including more than 3 million kilograms of lead, 2 million kilograms of copper, 400,000 kilograms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (“PAHs”), 42,000 kilograms of mercury, and 26,000 kilograms of polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”). The pollutants also include 38 kilograms of dioxins — by-products of Agent Orange, a notorious defoliant used by the U.S. military in the Vietnam War and made by Diamond Alkali at Lister Avenue in Newark’s Ironbound section.

Even before that, the contamination was so great that the federal government declared aquatic life destroyed in that section of the river in 1926. That was more than a decade before Diamond Alkali opened on the site, OxyChem said in the appeal.

The appeal recognized that Diamond Alkali contributed “significantly” to the dioxin contamination and OxyChem, as its corporate successor, has “long acknowledged” its responsibility to contribute to the cleanup.

What OxyChem wants

OxyChem reported it has already spent $260 million on designing and preparing for the cleanup of the lower river and expects to spend another $257 million on designing the cleanup of the upper nine miles of the Lower Passaic. It has offered to implement the cleanup work.

“All OxyChem has asked in return is to be allowed to pursue its statutory contribution rights to recover some of the costs of that massive undertaking from the dozens of other polluters of the Passaic River,” the company said in its appeal.

The district court ruling, issued by Judge Madeline Cox Arleo last December, said the EPA’s consent decree advances the goals of the Superfund law by requiring the other companies to pay a total of $150 million toward the cleanup.

“It is reasonable because it extracts $150 million from Settling Parties — a sum significantly more than their estimated liability for the decided upon remedial action — that will be immediately available for cleanup efforts,” Cox Arleo wrote for the district court in a 47-page opinion.

Legal considerations

Steven Miano, an environmental lawyer at Hangley Aronchick Segal Pudlin & Schiller in Philadelphia, predicted that the appeals court will hear the case, because it addresses what he called the important matter of EPA’s authority to reach a settlement in such cases.

But Miano said the appeals court is unlikely to overturn the district court ruling, because EPA has a record of acting within its authority in allocating financial responsibility.

“I would be surprised if the lower court will be found to have been wrong in approving the consent decree,” said Miano, who is not connected with the case. “EPA is typically fairly careful in taking positions on allocations in CDs [consent decrees]. It has a good track record on having such CDs approved. However, it remains to be seen how the Third Circuit analyzes this case and whether it will delve into the underlying facts.”

‘Superfund consent decrees historically have been treated extremely deferentially by the courts.’ –– Steve Gold, professor in environmental law, Rutgers Law School

If OxyChem loses the case, it could appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but it’s unlikely that court would take it because the case doesn’t have enough wide legal implications, Miano said. It’s more likely that the Third Circuit will send the case back to the district court with an instruction to take another look at whether the cost allocation in EPA’s consent decree is fair, he said.

“It’s possible the Third Circuit might say, ‘There’s not adequate evidence. We’re returning it to the District Court to do a better job of parsing out all of the elements here.’ That would be new and different, and create a lot of issues for those of us who routinely enter into these types of consent decrees,” Miano said.

Cleanup timeline?

Steve Gold, a professor in environmental law at Rutgers Law School, also said the odds are against the appeals court overturning the lower court’s approval of the EPA settlement. He said there is a long record of the courts upholding Superfund consent decrees.

“Superfund consent decrees historically have been treated extremely deferentially by the courts,” Gold said. “The trial court is deferential in the choices the government makes in how to settle its enforcement claims, and then the appellate court is typically extremely deferential to the district court’s judgment about what the government did.”

Gold said OxyChem appears to be expecting to lose at the Third Circuit and would then appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. But he predicted that the high court wouldn’t take the case because it has no constitutional significance, and there’s no “really dire” statutory question.

But whatever the legal machinations, they don’t necessarily signal more delays in the river’s cleanup because the EPA could simply order the work to proceed.

“I don’t know that the fate of this settlement has to delay the cleanup,” Gold said. “I could imagine EPA securing a cleanup for the river even if this settlement is voided.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2024/04/oxychem7.png,N,,2025-08-04 03:59:29.810311

The factory in Thoothukudi will initially make 50,000 electric vehicles annually, with room to triple output to 150,000 cars. Given its proximity to a major port in one of India’s most industrialized states, Vinfast hopes it will be a hub for future exports to the region. It says the factory will create more than 3,000 local jobs.

The Vietnamese company says it scouted 15 locations across six Indian states before choosing Tamil Nadu. It’s the center of India’s auto industry, with strong manufacturing, skilled workers, good infrastructure, and a reliable supply chain, according to Tamil Nadu’s Industries Minister T.R.B. Raaja.

“This investment will lead to an entirely new industrial cluster in south Tamil Nadu, and more clusters is what India needs to emerge as a global manufacturing hub,” he said.

A strategic pivot to Asia

Vinfast’s foray into India reflects a broader shift in strategy.

The company increasingly is focusing on Asian markets after struggling to gain traction in the U.S. and Europe. It broke ground last year on a $200 million EV assembly plant in Indonesia, where it plans to make 50,000 cars annually. It’s also expanding in Thailand and the Philippines.

Vinfast sold nearly 97,000 vehicles in 2024. That’s triple what it sold the year before, but only about 10% of those sales were outside Vietnam. As it eyes markets in Asia, it hopes the factory in India will be a base for exports to South Asian countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka and also to countries in the Middle East and Africa.

India is the world’s third-largest car market by number of vehicles sold. It presents an enticing mix: A fast growing economy, rising adoption of EVs, supportive government policies and a rare market where players have yet to completely dominate EV sales.

“It is a market that no automaker in the world can ignore,” said Ishan Raghav, managing editor of the Indian car magazine autoX. .

A growing EV market in India

EV growth in India has been led by two and three-wheelers that accounted for 86% of the over six million EVs sold last year.

Sales of four wheel passenger EVs made up only 2.5% of all car sales in India last year, but they have been surging, jumping to more than 110,000 in 2024 from just 1,841 in 2019. The government aims to have EVs account for a third of all passenger vehicle sales by 2030.

“The electric car story has started (in India) only three or four years ago,” said Charith Konda, an energy specialist who looks at India’s transport and clean energy sectors for the think-tank Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis or IEEFA. New cars that “look great on the road,” with better batteries, quick charging and longer driving ranges are driving the sector’s rapid growth, he said.

The shift to EVs is mostly powered by Indian automakers, but Vinfast plans to break into the market later this year with its VF6 and VF7 SUV models, which are designed for India..

Can Vinfast Succeed Where Chinese EVs Faltered?

Chinese EV brands that dominate in countries like Thailand and Brazil have found India more challenging.

After border clashes with China in 2020, India blocked companies like BYD from building their own factories. Some then turned to partnerships. China’s SAIC, owner of MG Motor, has joined with India’s JSW Group. Their MG Windsor, a five-seater, sold 30,000 units in just nine months, nibbling Tata Motors’ 70% EV market share down to about 50%.

Tata was the first local automaker to court mass-market consumers with EVs. Its 2020 launch of the electric Nexon, a small SUV, became India’s first major EV car success.

Vinfast lacks the geopolitical baggage of its larger Chinese rivals and will also benefit from incentives like lower land prices and tax breaks for building locally in India. That’s part of India’s policy of discouraging imports with high import duties to help encourage local manufacturing and create more jobs.

The push for onshore manufacturing is a concern also for Tesla, which launched its Model Y in India last month at a price of nearly $80,000, compared to about $44,990 in the U.S without a federal tax credit.

“India’s stand is very clear. We do not want to import manufactured cars, even Teslas. Whether it’s Tesla or Chinese cars, they are taxed heavily,” added Konda.

An uphill battle in a tough market

The road ahead remains daunting. India’s EV market is crowded with well-entrenched players like Tata Motors and Mahindra, which dominate the more affordable segment, while Hyundai, MG Motors and luxury brands like Mercedes-Benz and Audi compete at high price points.

Indians tend to purchase EVs as second cars used for driving within the city, since the infrastructure for charging elsewhere can be undependable. Vinfast will need to win over India’s cost-sensitive and conservative drivers with a reputation for quality batteries and services while keeping prices low, said Vivek Gulia, co-founder of JMK Research.

“Initially, people will be apprehensive,” he said.

Vinfast says it plans to set up showrooms and service centers across India, working with local companies for charging and repairs, and cutting costs by recycling batteries and making key parts like powertrains and battery packs in the country.

Scale will be key. VinFast has signed agreements to establish 32 dealerships across 27 Indian cities. Hyundai has 1,300 places for Indians to buy their cars. Building a brand in India takes time — Hyundai, for instance, pulled it off over decades, helped by an early endorsement from Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan.

VinFast can succeed if it can get its pricing right and earn the trust of customers, Gulia said, “Then they can actually do really good.”

Pierce, Sri Medicherla, The Regulatory Review",,,,,https://www.theregreview.org/2025/08/04/winston-recent-legislation-reveals-president-trumps-regulatory-approach/,"Several presidents before President Trump supported increasing market competition through legislation that deregulated U.S. industries and expanded free trade.

BYD Auto, a Chinese producer, has frequently surpassed Tesla in global electric vehicle sales—including both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

The entry of Chinese automobile firms could have a similar positive effect on the U.S. automobile market while helping to address an important social problem.","President Trump’s latest legislative victory reveals an inefficient approach to deregulating markets.

Efficient government policymaking recognizes when it is, and when it is not, socially desirable to intervene in markets. Thus, efficient policymakers would choose not to regulate non-government entities if market forces can produce a more efficient outcome than a prior government intervention. For example, when deregulating the airline industry in 1978, policymakers benefited air travelers by giving airlines the freedom to set fares and to enter routes they wanted to serve. The increase in competition led to lower fares and improved service.

Efficient policymakers reform, but do not withdraw, their policies to encourage certain behaviors by non-governmental entities when a government policy intervention would improve on market performance. For example, the Federal Trade Commission benefited the public by creating a National Do Not Call Registry and giving households the choice of whether to receive calls from telemarketers.

President Donald J. Trump’s recently enacted megalaw—or law—could have improved government efficiency both by withdrawing economic regulations from industries where market forces could produce more efficient outcomes than regulatory interventions and by reforming certain policies to improve their efficiency. However, the law does not attempt to accomplish either objective. This choice indicates that President Trump’s anti-government, but not pro-market, approach to policymaking is nihilistic and does not bode well for the nation’s material quality of life.

Several presidents before President Trump supported increasing market competition through legislation that deregulated U.S. industries and expanded free trade. President Gerald R. Ford supported initiatives leading to transportation deregulation. President Jimmy Carter signed legislation advancing deregulation of the airline, trucking, railroad, natural gas, and banking industries. President Ronald Reagan signed legislation deregulating interstate bus transportation, the savings and loan industry, and cable television. President Bill Clinton persuaded the U.S. Congress to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement and furthered deregulation of telecommunications, branch banking, and intrastate trucking. President Barack Obama spearheaded the Trans-Pacific Partnership with Asian countries, excluding China, and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union.

President Trump did not build on those deregulatory successes in his first term, and the law does not include economic deregulation initiatives. President Trump could have led the effort to deregulate, for instance, current prices, entry, and exit in the global airline industry by persuading countries to grant cabotage rights, which would allow any airline to serve any country’s domestic routes and to charge any fares they wanted. For example, United Airlines would be free to serve New York to Pisa, Italy, by offering non-stop flights from New York to Rome and its own connecting flights from Rome to Pisa, reducing travelers’ transfer-wait time in Rome. Foreign airlines would be free to serve any U.S. domestic and international route, which would increase competition, reduce fares, and improve service frequency in the United States and throughout the world.

But, despite the potential benefits to U.S. travelers from global airline deregulation, the law does not include it. It also does not include ocean shipping deregulation, which President Trump explored in his first term by considering whether to eliminate the Jones Act. President Trump subsequently decided against eliminating it for unknown reasons.

The law reveals that President Trump generally does not withdraw a government intervention because he envisions a superior market solution. Instead, he withdraws the intervention because he has little faith in government, especially his Democratic predecessors, which is consistent with his disinterest in government regulatory reform.

For example, the tax credits instituted under the Biden Administration for the purchase of new or used electric vehicles will be eliminated by the law on September 30, 2025. This elimination is a step in the right direction of regulatory reform because the tax credits are an inefficient approach to reducing pollution, relying on taxpayer-funded subsidies that benefit vehicle manufacturers and households with above-average incomes instead of relying on user charges paid by motorists who are polluting the environment. Replacing tax credits with efficient emissions taxes would be appropriate regulatory reform because it would incentivize all motorists to drive cleaner-burning gasoline vehicles and would spur some motorists to purchase electric vehicles. And, although tax credits add to the federal deficit, emissions tax revenues could be used to help reduce the federal deficit.

However, the law “deregulates” policies to reduce automobile emissions and eschews efficient regulatory reform. In other words, although motor vehicle emissions are widely recognized by conservative and liberal economists as a textbook example of a negative externality that causes adverse health effects, including neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, reproductive, and immune system damage, they are ignored by the law.

President Trump also forecloses a possible market approach to reducing automobile emissions. Currently, Chinese electric vehicle producers collectively possess the largest market share of electric vehicles in the world. BYD Auto, a Chinese producer, has frequently surpassed Tesla in global electric vehicle sales—including both battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids. High tariffs and stringent regulations combine, however, to create significant barriers for Chinese producers aiming to sell electric vehicles in the United States.

The United States could greatly spur domestic sales of electric vehicles to help improve the environment by allowing Chinese producers to sell their vehicles in the United States, provided they manufacture their electric vehicles in America to address concerns about job losses, not receive subsidies from the Chinese government to address concerns about competitive disadvantages, and address the U.S. government’s security concerns.

Japanese automobile firms transformed the U.S. automobile market by building manufacturing plants in the United States in the 1980s and selling high-quality, fuel-efficient vehicles. Consumers benefited from the improvement in vehicle price-quality offerings, and U.S. automobile firms were incentivized to improve the quality of their vehicles. The entry of Chinese automobile firms could have a similar positive effect on the U.S. automobile market while helping to address an important social problem.

Yet, because President Trump is not drawn to market solutions—nor does he believe it is the government’s responsibility to address a negative externality efficiently—he ignores the approach, as does the law. The law does, however, enable President Trump to fulfill his nihilistic vision.",https://www.theregreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Winston8.4.2025-170559099.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 01:59:45.038931

There has also been no information on how these small nuclear reactors dotted all over the place can be protected from attacks especially by armed drones.

The uranium fuel would have to be imported which is an added problem and is also unethical as it is mainly mined on indigenous peoples lands from Canada, Namibia, the Republic of the Congo, the southern states of the USA, Kazakhstan and Australia where for years the miners and their families have suffered from the resulting severe illnesses.

Planning delays were referenced as one of the biggest obstacles to clean energy investment in the NEM in a report released by advocacy and engagement platform Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) last month.
To address delays in energy infrastructure development, the report proposes the creation of an independent Clean Energy Coordinator-General.","According to the report, Australia should enhance incentives in the electricity, heavy industry, and transport sectors to facilitate an efficient transition to net zero emissions. Together, these sectors represent 79% of Australia’s total gross emissions.

The Productivity Commission is an Australian government research and advisory body focused on economic, social, and environmental issues.

Specifically, the report suggests implementing market-based incentives in the electricity sector to replace the Renewable Energy Target (RET) and the hugely successful Capacity Investment Scheme (CIS), with the PC stating that neither will support new investments in renewables after 2030.

The CIS aims to promote new investments in reliable clean energy generation, enhance system reliability, and mitigate the risk of price fluctuations in Australia’s evolving energy market. Its successes thus far recently saw the federal government upsize its 2030 target from 32GW to 40GW.

Successful projects in the CIS are offered long-term Commonwealth underwriting agreements with an agreed-upon revenue “floor” and “ceiling.”

Commissioner Barry Sterland said reaching net zero at the lowest possible cost is central to the PC’s productivity challenge.

“With the right policy settings, we can limit the costs of decarbonising and speed up our approvals to unlock the opportunities of lower-cost, more abundant clean energy. We can also boost our resilience to the effects of climate change and minimise their human and economic costs,” Sterland said.

Policy frameworks driving renewable energy expansion

Australia’s renewable energy sector has benefited from various supportive policies, and the report underscores the importance of maintaining and expanding these frameworks.

The Commission highlights the need for robust policy mechanisms to incentivise investment in clean technologies, particularly in regions with high renewable energy potential.

Renewable energy zones (REZs) have been identified as a critical tool for facilitating large-scale solar PV development, providing the infrastructure needed to connect new generation capacity to the grid.

The expansion of REZ across the National Electricity Market (NEM) is expected to reduce curtailment risks and improve energy distribution efficiency, making it a key enabler for solar PV growth. Developers and investors are advised to closely monitor the rollout of these zones, as they will dictate the geographic focus of future installations.

Additionally, the report calls for streamlined regulatory processes to accelerate project approvals and reduce barriers to entry for new market participants. Planning delays were referenced as one of the biggest obstacles to clean energy investment in the NEM in a report released by advocacy and engagement platform Clean Energy Investor Group (CEIG) last month.

To address delays in energy infrastructure development, the report proposes the creation of an independent Clean Energy Coordinator-General. This role would oversee priority renewable energy projects, ensuring they are assessed and approved more efficiently.

The Coordinator-General would be supported by a specialist “strike team” tasked with breaking through regulatory and logistical roadblocks. This initiative could significantly reduce project timelines, benefiting developers and investors in the renewable energy sector.

Market trends and investment opportunities

Australia’s solar PV market is poised for continued growth, with the report projecting a steady increase in installed capacity through 2030.

This expansion is driven by strong demand from residential, commercial, and utility-scale segments and supportive policies such as feed-in tariffs and renewable energy certificates.

However, the report cautions that grid constraints and regulatory bottlenecks could slow progress if not addressed promptly, echoing the CEIG’s thoughts.

The report highlights the importance of aligning capital allocation with emerging market trends for investors. The growing integration of solar PV with energy storage systems presents a lucrative opportunity, particularly as hybrid renewables-plus-storage solutions become the norm for new installations.

Additionally, the report points to the rising demand for distributed energy resources (DERs), including rooftop solar and community-scale storage, as a key growth area for the sector. The Australian Energy Market Commissioner (AEMC) has recently explored the role virtual power plants (VPPs) and DERs could play in the NEM, potentially enabling them to compete with large-scale generators.

A recurring theme in the report is the emphasis on technology-neutral policies. By avoiding favouritism toward specific technologies or regions, the Commission believes this will create a level playing field that encourages the adoption of the most efficient and cost-effective solutions.

Non-profit organisation Climate Council has welcomed the PC’s report on Australia’s net zero transition, emphasising the critical role of renewable energy in driving productivity growth and economic resilience.

“The report highlights that accelerating the roll out of renewable power, through faster approvals, will support productivity growth – lowering developers’ costs, attracting investment and making energy cheaper.

A few days ago, Chevrolet put out a press release about the new version of the Chevy Bolt. As press releases go, it was remarkably short. Here it is in its entirety:

The Chevrolet Bolt is back. Almost.

From its market introduction in 2017, the Chevrolet Bolt changed the game as the first long-range, mass-produced EV available to customers at a truly affordable price. Production ended in December 2023. But by popular demand, GM is bringing it back for the 2027 model year.

And it is better than ever.

More details will be revealed in a few months. For now, we can give you a quick preview of what’s to come. There will be updates to the front fascia and rear tail lamps, a NACS charging adapter port, and some other cool stuff that…we’ll show you later.

Hopscotching the automotive world for headlines, we came with a few details, but not many. InsideEVs reports that the new car will be much like the old car in appearance except for new headlight and taillight treatments. GM has previously said the Bolt 2.0 will be upgraded to use its latest suite of battery tech and software, similar to what it now deploys on cars like the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV, and Cadillac Lyriq.

We do know that the next generation car will have an LFP battery pack, which should be a big factor in keeping the starting price down while making the car profitable. “While it won’t be a completely clean-sheet design, it will be a thoroughly modern EV with newer safety equipment,” InsideEVs says.

Chevrolet has not announced prices for the Bolt 2.0, but it will have to be noticeably less money than the Equinox EV that lists for around $35,000. No doubt Chevrolet has a plan to deal with the discontinuance of the federal EV tax credit. While that is a setback for EV enthusiasts, such rebates have a way of keeping prices high, so once it disappears on September 30, 2025, we will see whether there will be any significant downward pressure on the price of new EVs.

“It’s going to be at a similar price point than the old one going out, which is very low,” GM President Mark Reuss told InsideEVs at the Detroit launch of the Silverado EV and Equinox EV last year. “We’re going to deliver it at a profitable point.”

GM Authority commented after seeing side by side photos of the old car and the new car that the latest version has a noticeable amount of extra bodywork — by about 6 inches — ahead of the front wheels. “While it may seem like a small design tweak, it could hint at broader changes under the skin,” it said.

“The 2027 Chevy Bolt EV is expected to ride on the GM BEV2 platform, which previously underpinned the now-discontinued Bolt EUV. In fact, spy shots suggest the overall proportions and silhouette remain quite similar between the different generations. And yet, the longer overhang suggests GM may be rethinking some elements of the front-end architecture.

“The new front overhang likely isn’t related to the battery pack or primary powertrain components, as those are typically integrated into the floor structure of BEV2 based vehicles. However, the extra forward length could serve several practical purposes. One possibility is more space for improved cooling systems, which may be necessary depending on the type of electric motor or thermal management system at work.

“Another possible consideration is crash safety. Extending the front overhang could allow for improved crumple zones, absorbing more energy in the event of a frontal impact. This would help the Bolt meet more stringent crash-test standards and possibly improve insurance safety ratings.

“There’s also the possibility that the added space up front will accommodate the latest driver-assistance hardware. Modern systems like Enhanced Automatic Emergency Braking, Front Pedestrian Braking, and Cyclist Detection often rely on large sensor arrays, including radar modules and forward facing cameras that require physical space and specific mounting geometry.”

According to Ward’s Auto, the original Bolt was equipped with a 200 hp electric motor that had 266 lb.-ft. of torque (361 Nm). The 2027 Bolt is likely to use the same motor used in front-wheel drive versions of the Equinox EV. That motor is rated at 213 hp and 236 lb.-ft of torque (320 Nm). While base models are likely to be FWD only, the Bolt 2.0 is expected to have a dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version available.

While Chevrolet has not released any technical specs for the new car — which is still about 8 months away from appearing in dealer showrooms — the motoring press is projecting a range of around 300 miles, which would be about 20 percent more than the original. In addition, the new car will come with a NACS charging port, which is raising hopes that charging speeds will be improved to between 125 and 150 kW — almost triple what the original was capable of. That will be a huge advantage for Bolt owners who want more than just a commuting car.

The Original Continues To Shine

My wife and I drive a 2017 Chevy Bolt with the upgraded battery in the summer. This is our third year with the car and it has been all over New England reliably and in complete comfort. We have put about 8,000 miles on the car and it just keeps getting better and better. Recently we saw 307 miles on the guess-o-meter after a full charge and the car consistently gets about 4.5 miles per kWh, which is stellar performance by anyone’s standards.

90 percent of our charging takes place using a standard wall outlet, but we have noticed there are more and more charging opportunities in New England today than there were when we first bought the car. We have purchased an adapter to allow us to use Tesla Supercharger locations but have not tried one yet, as many of the Superchargers in our area are V1 equipment that is not compatible with our Bolt. We do have a 10-day road trip coming up later this month, so maybe we will get a chance to Supercharge then.

All in all, it is a great little car — fast and comfortable. Although, it does tend to eat electrons at higher highway speeds, so we keep it between 65 and 70 mph and smile at the cement mixers and semis that pass us. EV drivers are less inclined to be the fastest cars on the road and we are comfortable taking our time, even if it adds 10 minutes to our trip.

If the Bolt 2.0 is a noticeable improvement over the original at an affordable price, it will be just what America needs to keep the EV revolution moving forward.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bolt-headlight.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 00:59:42.368889

Several Republican Senators are sending signals of unhappiness to the Trump administration. These politicians have basked in the glow of Inflation Reduction Act largess from the Biden administration, and now the Senators are nervous they won’t be able to salvage funding for renewables that are already earmarked for their states. Politico reports that the Republican advocacy “comes on the heels of the Interior Department’s new secretarial order calling for the identification of any ‘preferential treatment’ toward wind and solar facilities in current regulations, guidance, policies, and agency practices.”

Increased national productivity is a key ingredient of sustained growth. Nonetheless, while promising an all-of-the-above energy mix, Trump and his merry pranksters have done everything in their power to halt the exponential rise of solar and wind energy projects.

Fear among Republicans is that power demand failures will spark consumer scrutiny, which could have negative consequences for 2026 elections. “It will become very clear very quickly that our energy needs will outstrip our ability to produce energy unless we also include wind energy in the mix,” explains Senator Mike Rounds, who represents the large wind-producing state of South Dakota.

There is also the stark realization that more than half of clean energy projects since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act were located in red states. Oops. The loss of investment and jobs will hurt communities that voted for less government — or so they thought.

One barrier to Trump’s proclamation to “drill, baby, drill” is coming from an usual source: the oil and gas sector itself. Even with opportunities to drill on additional public lands at reduced royalty rates and limits on incentives for wind and solar, there’s been a relatively lackluster push for more fossil power.

“The industry is going to do what the industry is going to do,” Jenny Rowland-Shea, director for public lands at the Center for American Progress, told Wired.

The price of oil is the driving factor for its commercial production. Global demand and supply dynamics figure heavily into that equation — much more so than as a reaction to a White House prod. It might seem that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s vision to reduce new wind and solar would be making headway with energy speculation.

However, the appeal of solar and wind is getting harder and harder to deny. “Paradigm shifts like this don’t come along often,” climate activist Bill McKibben reminds us.

Last year, 96% of the global demand for new electricity was met by renewables.

In the US, during that time, 93% of new generating capacity came from solar, wind, and an ever-increasing variety of batteries to store that power.

In March 2025, for the first time, fossil fuels generated less than half the electricity in the US.

Texas is now installing renewable energy and batteries faster than California. The state has also set records for solar and wind production as well as for battery discharge.

A 2025 United Nations analysis concludes that “solar and wind are now almost always the least expensive — and the fastest — option for new electricity generation.” With costs falling far faster than originally predicted, solar and wind have become “the fastest growing sources of electricity in history, and growth in renewable energy is now outpacing that in fossil fuels in the power sector.”

Global Voices for a Wide-Ranging Energy Mix

Politicians who recognize the need for funding for renewables are speaking up around the world. Chancellor Rachel Reeves of Scotland rebuked Trump’s remarks that the North Sea is a “treasure chest,” saying that renewable and non-renewable energy sources are not an “either-or” equation.

Reeves acknowledged that oil and gas continue to be “incredibly important for the UK and our energy security.” The plan for energy production doesn’t stop there for Scotland, however. “At the same time, we’re investing in clean homegrown energy, including at Berwick Bank in Scotland, which will create thousands of new jobs and power millions of homes. And that’s what we need to do to make sure that our economy has this energy security that we need, that we bring down bills and bring more good jobs to Scotland.”

As example, a proposed wind farm, off the coast of East Lothian has the potential to add more than 4.1 gigawatts of capacity, which could power more than six million homes annually. Continually focusing on superficial perceptions of wind turbines, Trump reacted to Reeves’ remarks by saying, “When we go to Aberdeen, you’ll see some of the ugliest windmills you’ve ever seen, the height of a 50-story building.”

No Funding for Renewables for Security?

The US military consumes 80% of all of the energy that the federal government uses annually. The Biden administration had embarked on an ambitious campaign to drastically cut the US military’s carbon emissions as part of its broader climate strategy. Trump 2.o doesn’t have time for decarbonization — the Administration is busy with Coca Cola and renaming bodies of water.

Yet two projects designated for military applications demonstrate how funding for renewables and companies that support them makes sense.

One example is US firm NanoGraf, which announced last July that it held production-scale orders for its new silicon battery, with the US military in mind. Today’s electronic military gear requires batteries, and plenty of them, to power the increasing load of portable electronic gear carried by soldiers.

Another is Solar Ready Vets, which is a collection of initiatives designed to strengthen solar career pathways for veterans and support the industry’s efforts to invest in military talent. Funded by the US Department of Energy, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) is working alongside the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), solar businesses, and other partners to develop resources that help the solar and storage industry recruit and retain veterans and the broader military-connected community.

After years of seemingly unstoppable momentum, we’re now seeing what some are calling “the great EV pullback”. Even the mighty Tesla has revealed a significant drop in revenue, prompting a raft of deals to shift metal. Add in shifting political winds like the rollback of EV tax credits, and you have a recipe for uncertainty. But it seems Ford is looking to cut through the noise with a move of historical proportions.

In what he’s calling a “Model T moment,” Ford CEO Jim Farley has announced that the company is preparing to unveil a “breakthrough” electric vehicle and an entirely new platform on August 11th. It’s a bold claim, deliberately evoking the revolutionary car that put the world on wheels. But is it just clever marketing, or is Ford truly on the verge of redefining the affordable EV? The project is the brainchild of Ford’s “skunkworks” team, a clandestine group led by none other than former Tesla engineer Alan Clarke. For some time, this team has been working in the background, tasked with a single, crucial mission: to develop a genuinely affordable electric car without the compromises. According to Farley, this isn’t just about making a cheaper Mustang Mach-E. He envisions “a new family of vehicles to the world that offer incredible technology, efficiency, space, and features”.

This new, low-cost platform is the key. While Ford’s current EV business has taken a substantial $1.3 billion financial hit, this new architecture represents a ground-up rethink. The first vehicle built on this platform is slated to be a pickup truck, set for a 2027 release, with a range of other models to follow. This strategy mirrors the original Model T’s success, which became a versatile base for countless applications, not just a single car.Farley has been refreshingly direct about the primary target: low-cost EVs from Chinese automotive giants like BYD and Geely. He acknowledges that to be competitive on a global scale, Ford can’t just tweak its existing methods. “We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese… is to go and really push ourselves to radically reengineer and transform our engineering supply chain and manufacturing process,” Farley stated.

This “Model T moment” is more than just an announcement; it’s a high-stakes bet made in a challenging market. While competitors are navigating slumping sales and political pressures like tariffs that Ford expects will cost it $2 billion annually, the Blue Oval is doubling down. It’s a classic, bold Ford move, and one that could either secure its future in the electric age or prove to be a costly gamble.

It has not changed its policy yet, but Reuters reported that Indian oil refineries had paused purchases of Russian oil while matters are worked out.
India’s imports of Russian oil averaged 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of this year.","Energy was one of the most freely traded goods in the post-Second World War era, even behind the Iron Curtain. A flood of sanctions has eroded that in recent years. But are the latest EU-US trade deal and Donald Trump’s tariff threats an even greater danger?

Under Thursday’s trade pact, the EU has agreed to buy an extra $250 billion of US energy each year until 2027, and invest $600 billion in the US by 2028.

Separately, Mr Trump has proposed “secondary tariffs” on countries buying Russian oil, notably India. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told China that it would face 100 per cent tariffs if it continued to purchase Russian oil, for which it is the biggest customer.

The reality of the European deal can be dismissed in detail.

Impossible numbers

The bloc imported $76 billion of American coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil last year. The US exported $318 billion of energy to all its customers, and EU customers imported nearly $407 billion of energy from all suppliers. So, the US would have to divert all its energy exports to Europe, and Europe would in turn have to buy almost exclusively from America.

Yes, US LNG exports are set to rise substantially. Here are some easy gains in energy trade for the EU. The last remnants of the old Russian gas empire will be swept away, as Brussels plans to end imports from its hostile neighbour by 2027.

But prices are likely to fall as new supply comes online over the next five years, from Qatar, the UAE, Canada and elsewhere as well as the US. Japan and South Korea have also agreed to buy more American energy products. Meanwhile, the EU’s bulk energy buys will probably keep falling, as renewables and electric vehicles meet more of its needs.

“Europe” does not buy energy – its companies and consumers do. There is no way for Brussels to redirect energy trade on the massive scale required to meet these commitments. Big chunks of the imports are from Norway, Algeria and Azerbaijan, tied into the EU by gas pipelines. These are not going to be diverted elsewhere, whatever the White House tries to dictate.

Similarly, US companies decide whom to sell to on commercial, not political grounds. Here, admittedly, some combination of arm-twisting and subsidies might divert trade. But that is more likely to relate to large, visible, single inward investments such as Japan’s reported interest in the $44 billion Alaska LNG project.

One-trick trade pony

European companies would invest in renewable, hydrogen and electric vehicle projects in the US – but these are undercut by the current administration’s hostility. The withdrawal of tax incentives, increased barriers to receiving permits, and onerous rules on foreign content, make them unappealing. As Nippon Steel found out in its purchase of US Steel, sizeable foreign acquisitions of American companies are also likely to face unreasonable opposition and an opaque process of lobbying to win approval.

The reliance on energy sales shows the US to be a one-trick trade pony – or at best, three tricks, including agricultural goods and weapons. Its other goods are not very competitive – gas-guzzling cars and planes that fall out of the sky – and will become even less so as tariffs drive up input costs for key materials such as aluminium, steel and copper.

Ultimately, such trade commitments by Europe are not going to raise US oil and gas output. So, even if fulfilled, they just shuffle energy trade around.

Sanctions could be a different matter. Mr Trump could execute his threat of 100 per cent tariffs against India and China if they persist in buying Russian oil. This is a bizarre approach to defeating Moscow’s war against Ukraine, instead of imposing stronger sanctions on specific customers and shippers, which is the same approach used against Iran.

Beijing will not back down; it cannot allow its economic model, its foreign policy, its alignment with Moscow, to be dictated by Washington. It buys about two million barrels per day of Russian oil.

New Delhi might concede, though. It has not changed its policy yet, but Reuters reported that Indian oil refineries had paused purchases of Russian oil while matters are worked out. India’s imports of Russian oil averaged 1.8 million barrels per day in the first half of this year. The third major customer, Turkey, takes about 250,000 barrels daily.

If India and Turkey drop out, China would no doubt step up its purchases of Russian oil, but it would not take all the remainder. This is partly for logistical reasons, but also political. It would gain further leverage over its junior ally, and could extract generous discounts, as it does from Iran, where it is essentially the only customer.

So, there would probably be an overall reduction in Russian oil exports. The gap would be filled by Opec+, depending on its policy decisions, and potentially by higher US output. But US oil production will only increase if prices rise substantially. Mr Trump has shown himself acutely sensitive to inflation and to the concerns of American drivers, preferring lower rather than higher prices, to the discomfort of his supporters in Texas.

So how does this all tie together? Less Russian oil and gas means more room for Gulf suppliers. If they end up sending less to Europe to fill a gap in India, or if prices rise enough to boost American production, the US may then supply more to Europe, cosmetically satisfying part of the trade deal.

The inconsistency and volatile, contradictory messages emanating from the White House make all this very hard to evaluate. There’s a good chance that the impending “secondary tariffs” never materialise. Yet what is clear that a free and liquid energy market is being replaced by a constrained and politicised one.",https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/DUK36FR2PYRDAPX4N6MKLBS3HA.jpg?smart=true&auth=7d18195fef75f6b0130bb85a5a525383ba56988ec2ed1bc588fcc6da236c1bad&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-08-04 00:00:33.211210

The report predicts that by 2030, compared with the scenario where the production of EVs does not increase, sulfur dioxide emissions in various countries will increase by 79% in China and 19% in India...

After the 18th century, humanity achieved industrialization at the cost of causing many environmental hazards. People failed to anticipate the environmental pollution risks posed by technological innovations such as steam engines and the chemical industry, which brought harm to local residents. In the second half of the 20th century, environmental protection measures made progress. However, some scientific studies point out that if new technologies such as pure electric vehicles (EVs) and artificial intelligence (AI) become more widespread in the future, they may trigger new environmental problems, mainly in emerging market countries. Can we prevent potential problems by paying attention to the negative aspects of technological innovation?

Carbon dioxide produced by burning fossil fuels leads to global warming. A powerful means to curb carbon dioxide emissions is pure electric vehicles, which do not emit carbon dioxide during operation. The latest models of pure electric vehicles are also very popular at auto shows around the world.

Pure electric vehicles are highly anticipated as a means to reduce carbon dioxide emissions (Beijing, 2024)

According to data released by the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2023, if the world is to achieve net - zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, in the automotive sector, the annual sales of pure electric vehicles need to increase to seven times that of 2022, reaching 70 million units by 2030.

Many people regard pure electric vehicles as a symbol of environmental protection. However, a paper published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society by the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and Princeton University in 2024 pointed out that ""if the production of pure electric vehicles increases excessively, it may actually exacerbate environmental pollution."" What's going on?

The paper predicts the amount of air pollutants generated by the production of pure electric vehicles. It analyzes two scenarios: (1) continuing the current policies in the production of pure electric vehicles; (2) the popularization of pure electric vehicles and an increase in production in China and India. The results show that if the production of pure electric vehicles increases, the emissions of sulfur dioxide generated during the extraction of battery materials may also increase.

During the analysis, it is assumed that all pure electric vehicles are equipped with batteries using nickel, etc., and are produced in China and India. It is predicted that by 2030, compared with the scenario where the production of pure electric vehicles does not increase, sulfur dioxide emissions in various countries will increase by 79% in China and 19% in India. Pure electric vehicles do not emit sulfur oxides such as sulfur dioxide, which are mainly contained in the exhaust of diesel vehicles, during operation. However, more sulfur dioxide may be generated during battery manufacturing.

The World Health Organization (WHO) states that long - term exposure to high - concentration sulfur dioxide can easily exacerbate asthma or cause cardiovascular diseases. The research team from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay and others pointed out that ""it is crucial to re - evaluate the environmental burden of the entire supply chain (such as batteries).""

Looking back at history, innovative technologies in each era have promoted the development of civilization while also causing environmental hazards. Based on the reflection on the fact that environmental hazards have damaged the health of many people, countries have taken countermeasures. Currently, mainly in developed countries, people's focus has shifted from past environmental hazards to measures to address global warming.

However, modern new technologies may once again lead to environmental pollution that was previously overcome. Alongside pure electric vehicles, AI, which is rapidly spreading in work and life scenarios, is a prime example.

High - performance AI running on servers in data centers requires a large amount of electricity. If it relies on thermal power generation, in addition to carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides will also be emitted. During the manufacturing of semiconductor chips used in AI computing, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with a size of less than 2.5 microns is also generated in processes such as grinding.

A paper published in 2024 by the University of California, Riverside, and others estimated the amount of air pollutants generated throughout the process from chip manufacturing to high - performance AI development and data center operation.

The study shows that during the development of the large language model (LLM) ""Llama 3.1"" by Meta in the United States, up to 1.5 tons of PM2.5 and 13.5 tons of nitrogen oxides were generated. This is equivalent to the amount of exhaust emissions from a car traveling back and forth more than 10,000 times between Los Angeles and New York, which are about 4,000 kilometers apart in a straight line. The reason lies in the large amount of electricity and semiconductor chips used.

Some scientific studies show that technological innovation may lead to new environmental problems. Humanity has repeatedly experienced the benefits and environmental hazards brought by new technologies. Can we prevent potential problems this time? We need to use the wisdom of modern people who learn from historical lessons.",https://img.36krcdn.com/hsossms/20250804/v2_48c9f304424b4ba68941514a12857785@5888275@ai_oswg755048oswg1053oswg495_img_png~tplv-1marlgjv7f-ai-v3:600:400:600:400:q70.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 01:59:51.898159

The Productivity Commission has recommended that the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme should be overhauled to substantially reduce the size of the tax credits flowing through to big business.

Australian Unions are calling for capping the Fuel Tax Credit Scheme so that no company can claim more than $20 million a year in fuel tax credits. This would stop unnecessary billions in taxpayer dollars from flowing to big miners, while keeping the benefits in place for smaller operators.

This measure would generate at least $14 billion in revenue over the next three years, a part of which could be used to help heavy vehicle users decarbonise their fleet, through buying electric and low-carbon vehicles.

Australian Unions also support the Productivity Commission’s recommendation for a streamlined, accelerated development approvals system to speed up the approval of more renewable energy projects.

Unions will go into this month’s Economic Reform Roundtable advocating for a new national approvals system for renewable energy and transmission projects to progress them faster to a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’ determination, including by ensuring workers and communities get their fair share of the benefits.

The process would reduce the long periods of uncertainty regional communities face while waiting for new jobs in renewable energy, particularly those on the front line of the energy transition.

This reform is essential for meeting Australia’s climate goals under the Paris Agreement, and for powering burgeoning clean industries like green metals, critical minerals, and renewable manufacturing that have the potential to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.

Unions also support new production tax incentives for green iron and green alumina projects, more R&D support for Future Made in Australia industries, a network of regional industrial innovation precincts, and requiring the Government’s specialist investment vehicles to better support regional communities in transition.

Quotes attributable to ACTU President, Michele O’Neil:

“Australian Unions want to see living standards rise for everyone, and increasing productivity is one way to achieve this, if the gains are shared fairly.

“Good productivity measures will see everyone’s living standards rise through investing in people, research, innovation, skills and technology.

“A faster, fairer path towards a net zero economy, including an improved development approvals process, which guarantees shared benefits with workers and communities, can take us a long way down the road.

The decision, aimed at spurring demand across buses, cars, and trucks, is expected to be formally clarified soon, sources told TNN.

The proposal was among key action points discussed in a high-level meeting chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba and attended by senior officials from Niti Aayog, the road transport ministry, and the power ministry. The meeting was convened amid concerns over the country’s slow EV penetration — just 7.6 per cent in 2024 against a 2030 target of 30 per cent.

While EV adoption is relatively strong in the two- and three-wheeler segments and urban buses, progress in four-wheelers and electric trucks remains sluggish. A source said that Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam supported a proposal by road transport secretary V Umashankar that removing the EoL limit for EVs, particularly privately owned older buses, could stimulate fresh demand in the segment.

In parallel, the power ministry is expected to expedite the extension of Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) norms to cover urban freight vehicles, buses, and trucks — a move intended to tighten emissions control across commercial transportation.

Strategies for EV adoption

There was also consensus at the meeting to pivot away from incentives alone, and instead focus on mandates and disincentives to push EV adoption. One strategy under consideration is to saturate five major cities with electric buses, urban freight vehicles, and para-transit EVs, supported by rapid deployment of charging infrastructure and fast chargers.

Officials stressed the need to localise battery manufacturing, encourage new battery technologies, and address the high upfront cost of EVs — particularly for e-trucks and buses — by improving access to finance.

In a follow-up meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, public sector banks raised concerns about financing challenges. They sought standardisation of EV batteries, cost reductions, and incentives to offset the expense of battery replacements — typically required every 6-7 years and comprising 40-50 per cent of an EV’s cost.

With the EV ecosystem still maturing in many regions, the government’s shift in approach could prove pivotal in meeting its ambitious 2030 electrification targets.

There are two principal credits enacted in the IRA that benefit wind and solar projects – the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit.
The first principal credit is the clean electricity production credit in Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") Section 45Y.
Two IRS Notices, 2013-29 and 2018-59, had previously provided rules for determining the beginning of construction for applicable tax credits.
Notwithstanding that language in the Statute, project developers may now need to wait for the new guidance before beginning construction if the project economics are dependent on the availability of tax credits.","The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""OBBBA"") signed by President Trump on July 4, 2025, reflected the administration's policy decision to end incentives for clean and renewable energy enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act (the ""IRA"") during the previous administration. Tax credits for wind and solar projects in particular will face early termination.

There are two principal credits enacted in the IRA that benefit wind and solar projects – the clean electricity production credit and the clean electricity investment credit. Taxpayers cannot claim both credits for the same facility. Both these credits are transferable, thus allowing developers to monetize the credits to provide funding for projects. As an alternative to transferability, developers may form complex tax equity partnerships to obtain equity investment in return for allocations of credits.

The first principal credit is the clean electricity production credit in Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") Section 45Y. This new credit enacted under the IRA applies for facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024. This is available for electricity produced by the taxpayer at a qualified facility and sold to an unrelated person during the taxable year. The credit is also available where such electricity is consumed or stored by the taxpayer during the taxable year and there is no third-party sale, if the qualified facility is equipped with a metering device owned and operated by an unrelated person. The credit is available for electricity produced during the 10-year period beginning when the qualified facility is originally placed in service. The base credit rate is 0.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. This amount is increased to 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for facilities with a maximum output of less than one megawatt of electricity (as measured in alternating current) and for facilities that meet certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. The credit is increased by 10% for facilities located in energy communities (certain brownfield cites, communities that had significant employment in coal or gas extraction experiencing above average unemployment, or census tracts having closed coal mines or coal fired generating plants and adjoining census tracts to them). Additionally, the credit is increased by 10% if certain domestic content requirements are met. This credit is further adjusted for inflation after 2024. Under the IRA, this credit begins to phase out for projects the construction of which begins after the ""applicable year,"" which is defined as the later of 2032 or the calendar year in which Treasury determines that the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States are equal to or less than 25% of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States for calendar year 2022.

The other principal credit enacted by the IRA benefiting wind and solar projects is the clean electricity investment credit in IRC Section 48E. This credit enacted under the IRA applies to facilities placed in service after December 31, 2024. This credit applies to qualified investments for any taxable year with respect to qualified facilities and energy storage technology. The base rate is 6%. This base rate is increased to 30% (the ""alternative rate"") for facilities with a maximum output of less than one megawatt of electricity (as measured in alternating current) and for facilities that meet certain prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements (or for which construction began more than 60 days before Treasury publishes guidance with respect to such prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements). If energy property is placed in service in an ""energy community,"" the provision increases the base rate by two percentage points and the alternative rate by 10 percentage points. An additional credit amount is available for property that meets certain domestic content requirements. This credit was to phase out for projects the construction of which begins after the later of the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after 2032 or the calendar year in which Treasury determines that the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States are equal to or less than 25% of the annual greenhouse gas emissions from the production of electricity in the United States for calendar year 2022.

The OBBBA will terminate the production and investment tax credits for wind and solar facilities for which construction has not begun by July 5, 2026 and that are placed in service after December 31, 2027. The credits are terminated earlier for facilities for which construction includes ""material assistance"" from a ""prohibited foreign entity"" (both defined terms in the Statute). Those projects do not qualify for credits if construction begins after December 31, 2025. No credit is allowed for taxable years after enactment if the taxpayer claiming the credit is a prohibited foreign entity. The OBBBA also removes the ""later of"" rule and instead begins the phase-out for projects the construction of which begins after the taxpayer's first taxable year beginning after 2032 for qualified facilities other than wind or solar that generate electricity, such as hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal.

Developers of wind and solar projects may feel urgency to begin construction of contemplated projects before the July 5, 2026 (or December 31, 2025) deadline and to place such projects in service by December 31, 2027, in order to be eligible for the production or investment tax credits under the OBBBA.

However, on Monday, July 7, 2025, President Trump added uncertainty to such plans by issuing an Executive Order directing Treasury within 45 days following enactment of the OBBBA, to take all actions as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under IRC Sections 45Y and 48E for wind and solar facilities, including issuing new and revised guidance to ensure that policies concerning the ""beginning of construction"" are not circumvented. Two IRS Notices, 2013-29 and 2018-59, had previously provided rules for determining the beginning of construction for applicable tax credits. The OBBBA includes a provision requiring that rules similar to those in the Notices be used to determine when construction begins for purposes of the prohibited foreign entity restrictions. Notwithstanding that language in the Statute, project developers may now need to wait for the new guidance before beginning construction if the project economics are dependent on the availability of tax credits. Investors in transferable credits or tax equity that may be used to provide funding for projects may be unwilling to commit funding until there is more clarity.

As climate concerns mount and regulations tighten, companies producing everything from bowling green machinery to sophisticated turf management systems are reimagining their manufacturing processes.

Green Manufacturing Revolution

Sustainable manufacturing in grounds care extends far beyond simply creating eco-friendly products. It encompasses the entire production cycle, from sourcing raw materials to packaging and distribution. Leading manufacturers are investing heavily in renewable energy systems, with solar panels and wind turbines becoming common sights at production facilities. These initiatives not only reduce carbon footprints but often result in substantial long-term cost savings.

The industry’s commitment to sustainability can be seen at events like the GroundsFest landscaping show, where manufacturers discuss innovative sustainability measures alongside their latest equipment. Many exhibitors highlight their transition to water-based paint systems, elimination of harmful solvents, and implementation of closed-loop manufacturing processes that minimise waste.

Material Innovation and Circular Economy

Progressive manufacturers are revolutionising their approach to materials, prioritising recycled content and developing products designed for longevity. Cricket ground maintenance equipment now frequently incorporates recycled steel and aluminium components, whilst maintaining the durability standards that are essential for professional sports venues.

This shift towards circular economy principles means products are designed from the outset with end-of-life considerations in mind.

Some key sustainable material practices include:

Biodegradable lubricants and hydraulic fluids that reduce environmental impact during operation and maintenance

Recycled plastic components for non-structural elements, diverting waste from landfills whilst maintaining product integrity

Renewable material sourcing for components like handles and covers, often using sustainably harvested timber or bio-based plastics

Energy Efficiency and Clean Production

Modern manufacturing facilities are incorporating smart technologies to optimise energy consumption and reduce waste. Advanced monitoring systems track resource usage in real-time, enabling manufacturers to identify inefficiencies and implement corrective measures quickly. This approach is a central theme at lawn and landscape technology conferences, where industry leaders share best practices for sustainable production.

Innovation Through Collaboration

The industry’s sustainability journey benefits enormously from collaborative efforts between manufacturers, suppliers, and end-users. These partnerships promote innovation in areas such as:

Supply chain transparency ensuring responsible sourcing of materials and components

Shared research and development initiatives that pool resources to tackle common environmental challenges

Customer feedback integration helping manufacturers understand real-world sustainability needs and preferences

Future Outlook

The transition towards sustainable manufacturing practices represents more than an environmental imperative – it’s becoming a competitive advantage. Companies that embrace these changes early often find themselves better positioned to meet evolving customer expectations and regulatory requirements.

As the grounds care industry continues to professionalise, with venues demanding higher standards for both performance and environmental responsibility, sustainable manufacturing will likely become the norm rather than the exception.

This transformation requires ongoing investment and commitment, but the benefits extend well beyond regulatory compliance. Manufacturers adopting sustainable practices often experience improved efficiency, reduced operating costs, and enhanced brand reputation, creating a compelling business case for environmental responsibility in the grounds care sector.

,American Energy,2025-08-04 02:35:02+00:00,www.koreatimes.co.kr,Coal-powered AI robots are a dirty fantasy - The Korea Times,"Liam Denning, www.koreatimes.co.kr",,,,,https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/amp/opinion/20250804/coal-powered-ai-robots-are-a-dirty-fantasy,"This is a fantasy, and a bleak one at that, not just for the climate but also that AI plan.
It lost 31 percentage points of market share in U.S. power generation between 2005 and 2024, and natural gas picked up four-fifths of that.
The cheapest existing coal plants remain competitive, according to Lazard Inc.’s latest analysis of levelized costs.
But this won’t catalyze new ones, even when you consider the suddenly rising cost of new gas plants.
The whiplash of U.S. energy policy over the past decade demonstrates why a developer must think in terms of not the next three years but the next 30.","The same day President Donald Trump launched his AI Action Plan, his Energy Secretary Chris Wright pulled federal support for a power project with ties to renewable energy that could help that plan. Not coincidentally, Trump instructed Wright at his AI summit that he must say “clean, beautiful” before any mention of the word “coal” and that the U.S. must compete with China’s construction of new coal-fired plants.

Possibly the only thing more bizarre than Trump’s enforced catch-phrasing is his vision of 21st century robots running on a power technology that hasn’t been cutting-edge since the days of Thomas Edison. Coal has long been a political prop for Trump, but this has taken on greater significance in his second term, with a naked assault on both the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and zero-carbon technologies (nuclear power excepted). When coal isn’t being touted as beautiful or clean, it is pitched as reliable and cheap, and due for a comeback if freed from overbearing rules.

This is a fantasy, and a bleak one at that, not just for the climate but also that AI plan.

You don’t need a conspiracy theory to explain coal’s decline in the U.S. It lost 31 percentage points of market share in U.S. power generation between 2005 and 2024, and natural gas picked up four-fifths of that. Why? Gas got cheaper. Five times the cost of coal in 2005, on an energy-equivalent basis, that gap was all but erased by booming shale supply (which Trump also backs). Meanwhile, the cost of building new coal plants, already a multiple of that for gas, went up even as it went down for gas (and renewables). Coal’s decline was well established by 2015, when former President Barack Obama unveiled his Clean Power Plan — which was never implemented anyway.

The problem is straightforward: Coal-power is an old technology outmatched by newer ones. The average coal-plant running today began operating when Jimmy Carter was president. The youngest, Sandy Creek in Texas, came online in 2014. By 2020, its owners were reportedly in debt restructuring talks and the following year the plant tripped offline in Texas’ winter blackouts. Utilization, or the proportion of the year it actually runs, has slumped.

The cheapest existing coal plants remain competitive, according to Lazard Inc.’s latest analysis of levelized costs. Yet they are hardly a slam-dunk compared with gas or unsubsidized wind and solar. The latter are intermittent, of course, and securing firm power to back them up, such as contracting with a gas peaker-plant or battery, boosts their cost considerably. Even then, new coal is in a similar cost range — and that is only with the implicit subsidy of spewing unpriced carbon.

This shows why rising forecasts of power demand, stoking fears of dark datacenters or blackouts, offer a lifeline to some existing coal plants that would otherwise retire. But this won’t catalyze new ones, even when you consider the suddenly rising cost of new gas plants. Utility NextEra Energy Inc. recently cited a levelized cost for new gas-power of $90-$115 per megawatt-hour. That would put it closer to new coal, but there are reasons why there’s a backlog for turbines, not for boilers.

Gas plants are more efficient than coal, especially in ramping up and down to match shifting demand and output from renewables, and also emit about half as much carbon. The whiplash of U.S. energy policy over the past decade demonstrates why a developer must think in terms of not the next three years but the next 30. Similarly, AI hyperscalers are prioritizing sheer speed over net-zero now, but tethering their reputations to coal over the long term would be inadvisable.

This is why, for all of coal’s vaunted qualities, the Trump administration still tries to tilt the field so heavily toward it and away from renewable competitors. Wright has made extensive use of federal powers to keep coal plants running that might otherwise close or run minimally; roughly a fifth of all such emergency orders since 2000 have been issued this year.

Similarly, Wright’s decision to pull an agreed $4.9 billion federal loan-guarantee for the 800-mile Grain Belt Express transmission line reeks of politics, rather than the economic analysis his department claims. The project, bringing wind and solar power from the Great Plains to states further east, had secured approval from four states, partly due to expected cost savings, as well as court victories over opponents. However, Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a big coal-power state across which part of the line would stretch, has made a crusade out of the project’s eminent domain disputes with several dozen landowners. Recasting this as stopping a “green scam” in a conversation with Trump and Wright seems to have tipped the balance; Wright pulled the guarantee less than two weeks later.

This sort of rug-pull makes a mockery of Trump’s “national energy emergency.” Developers like renewables because they are quick to build and, twinned with batteries or gas, offer a path to a cleaner, more resilient and diversified grid. Wright’s own department forecasts wind and solar to account for virtually all additions to generating capacity this year. Trump’s call to compete with China’s coal-plant construction is laughably anachronistic. Even there, coal’s share of output has fallen over the past 20 years while wind and solar have risen from virtually zero to 18%. Last year alone, China added more solar capacity than America’s entire installations to date. Beijing presumably isn’t doing that to destroy its own grid. Rather, its clean-tech effort is driven by the new ESG: Economics, security and geopolitics.

The Republican project to protect fossil fuels and choke off the fastest-growing source of new capacity amid rising demand, meanwhile, will ultimately constrain the U.S. grid, raising costs and curtailing our AI ambitions. And it still won’t reverse decades of economic trends burying coal. Yet Trump and his cohort appear beyond such reasoning, preferring the blunt instruments of bureaucracy. If you are invested in the belief that renewables’ success owes everything to a woke conspiracy, you may well convince yourself that coal can simply be willed back to life.

NEW DELHI: In a bid to increase the penetration of electric buses, cars and trucks, and to spur their sales, government is likely to clarify soon that the 15-year 'End of Life' (EoL) regulation isn't applicable to EVs. The power ministry will also expedite extending the CAFE norms (regulations designed to reduce fuel consumption and CO2 emissions) to urban freight vehicles, trucks and buses. These were among the steps finalised at a recent high-level meeting chaired by Niti Aayog member Rajiv Gauba amid concerns over the slow progress of EV penetration in the country, which was barely 7.6% in 2024, as against the target of 30% by 2030. While EV penetration is higher for two- and three-wheelers and buses, it has been slow for four-wheelers, with e-trucks not having taken off so far. Sources said that responding to an observation from road transport secretary V Umashankar that most over 15-year-old buses are privately owned, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam suggested that if the 15-year EOL regulation is not applied to EVs, it may spur sales. Umashankar also held that a mandate for EV adoption works best at places where a certain level of penetration and ecosystem are in place. Sources said there was a consensus to move from incentives to mandates and disincentives for faster EV adoption and for strategies to have saturation in five cities for buses, para-transit and urban freight vehicles. A source said there was unanimous agreement on the need for fast expansion of charging infrastructure, deployment of fast chargers, development of new battery technologies to reduce import dependence and easier finance for e-buses and e-trucks. Days later, the finance ministry held talks with banks to address their reluctance to finance EVs and the issue of higher interest rates. At the meeting chaired by financial services secretary M Nagaraju, banks urged govt to standardise batteries, bring down vehicle costs and announce some incentive for purchase of new batteries, considering that batteries usually have to be replaced in 6-7 years and account for 40-50% of the cost of EVs.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin defended his decision to axe an Obama-era rule that allowed the agency to regulate vehicles, airplanes and coal plants in order to combat climate change, vowing he won’t regulate ""entire sectors of the economy"" out of existence.

The ""Endangerment Finding"" published by former President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency found that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and others threaten human life because they accelerate climate change. The EPA relied on the ""endangerment finding"" to install stringent regulations on a variety of industries, including auto, air travel and energy, that business leaders said threatened the viability of their companies.

Notably, the endangerment finding was part of the basis of the Biden administration’s so-called electric vehicle mandate which would have required over half of all cars sold to be EVs by 2032.

Zeldin announced that he was repealing the ""holy grail of the climate change religion"" during a speech at an Indianapolis auto dealership in July. He hailed the announcement as the ""largest deregulatory announcement in US history,"" and said he was ending over a decade of uncertainty for American automakers and consumers.

Zeldin told CNN Sunday that when the rule was passed, the administrators relied on optimistic and pessimistic predictions surrounding the future effects of climate change, and that the pessimistic predictions did not pan out. He said that his decision was relying on ""2025 facts rather than 2009 bad assumptions."" He also said the endangerment finding went beyond the EPA’s legal scope, by ""filling in gaps"" in the law and essentially legislating itself.

He said the agency couldn’t bend the law to meet its own goals, and that issues surrounding regulating ""mobile sources"" of pollution like cars would need to be handled by Congress. He accused the Obama-era bureaucrats of engaging in ""mental leaps"" in order to justify the endangerment finding.

This high-profile conclave aims for balanced regional growth by leveraging Thoothukudi’s key advantages, particularly its strategic port and vast green energy potential, to garner interest from global investors, industry leaders, policymakers, and sectoral experts.

In the electronics manufacturing sector, Tamil Nadu is signalling a major push to establish itself as a leading national and global hub. The state recently launched India’s first state-level electronics components manufacturing scheme, with a target of attracting ₹300 billion in investment and creating 60,000 new jobs over the next three years. With annual electronics exports already surpassing $14.65 billion and with the planned establishment of two large Electronics Manufacturing Clusters at Pillaipakkam and Manallur, the region is rapidly attracting major manufacturers and benefiting from a skilled local workforce. Recent investments, such as the new facility by Vietnamese EV maker VinFast and the expansion of local contract manufacturers, reinforce the state’s leadership in electronics hardware and advanced component production. This momentum is supported by robust government policies, including attractive incentives, strategic infrastructure development, and comprehensive skill training programs, all aimed at enhancing global supply chain integration.

Renewable energy is another pillar being highlighted at the summit. Thoothukudi and wider Tamil Nadu are poised to benefit from a surge of investments into green energy, with a focus on large-scale wind and solar power projects. The summit serves as a platform for new project launches and the signing of key agreements in the renewable sector, supporting both state and national sustainability goals. Tamil Nadu’s renewable energy production reached 33.17 billion units in 2023–24, and the state is actively pushing forward initiatives such as the National Green Hydrogen Mission and the creation of Green Energy Corridors to scale up renewables and introduce emerging clean technologies. The government has set ambitious targets, including a 24% reduction in emissions by 2030, a 50% reduction by 2050, and net-zero emissions by 2070, with the summit underscoring a clear roadmap toward climate resilience and sustainable industrialization.

Importantly, by hosting a significant event in Thoothukudi rather than the state capital, the government is driving economic development in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, thus promoting equitable job creation, MSME participation, and the emergence of regional industrial corridors. The summit also emphasizes the importance of collaboration with academia and industry to nurture and upskill local talent, ensuring that the local workforce is aligned with the future needs of high-tech manufacturing and renewable energy sectors.

In summary, the ‘TN Rising’ summit marks the beginning of a transformative phase for southern Tamil Nadu, steering the region towards inclusive, export-driven, and sustainable growth through leadership in electronics innovation and green energy.

Dan Meuser, R-Dallas, this week participated in a high-level roundtable discussion focused on energy, manufacturing and expanding opportunity in Pennsylvania’s rural communities.

The event was co-hosted by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, Pennsylvania College of Technology and the Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce and brought together Members of Congress, federal officials, energy leaders and workforce experts to chart a path forward for regional growth.

Held at the Pennsylvania College of Technology’s Thompson Professional Development Center, the roundtable served as a platform to discuss how federal policy can better align with regional success models — especially in workforce development, energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing.

“This roundtable underscored the incredible opportunity we have to grow Pennsylvania’s energy economy, support small businesses, and invest in workforce development programs that deliver results,” Meuser said. “We heard directly from job creators, educators, and innovators who are driving progress in our region. Whether it’s strengthening technical education pipelines, modernizing permitting to meet 21st-century demands, or scaling homegrown energy solutions, today’s discussion was about action — focused, practical, and rooted in what’s working right here in Pennsylvania.”

Meuser said Pennsylvania has the resources, the talent and the entrepreneurial spirit to lead the next chapter of America’s energy and manufacturing renaissance.

“From the classroom to the job site to the boardroom, our Commonwealth is positioned to lead,” Meuser said.

The conversation focused on several priorities that will be essential to sustaining Pennsylvania’s competitive edge, including expanding federal support for career and technical education through corporate tax credit models inspired by Pennsylvania’s EITC program; modernizing infrastructure and permitting processes to attract data centers and meet surging energy demands driven by AI and manufacturing reshoring; unlocking critical mineral recovery from produced water through targeted tax incentives and streamlined federal regulation; and strengthening coordination between federal, state and local partners to scale successful workforce pipelines and rural economic development strategies.

Meuser banking roundtable at Yuengling Brewery

Meuser welcomed Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman to Pennsylvania’s 9th Congressional District for a roundtable discussion with community and regional banking leaders.

Held at the historic Yuengling Brewery in Pottsville, the roundtable focused on promoting a regulatory environment that supports responsible lending, protects consumers, and encourages financial innovation without imposing unnecessary burdens on banks that serve Main Street.

“Pennsylvania’s banking sector reflects the strength and diversity of our national financial system—from rural community banks to regional institutions,” Meuser said. “Vice Chair Bowman brings valuable experience as both a former community banker and state regulator, and her visit today reinforces our shared commitment to getting regulation right. We need supervision that encourages innovation, supports local economies, and protects consumers—without driving small banks out of the market. That starts with streamlining bank applications, encouraging smart capital rules, and tailoring risk based on bank size and business activities. Not a one-size-fits-all approach. As well, consumer fraud is a top issue facing banks and their customers across the country. Congress will continue to work in coordination with the Administration to find real solutions to consumer fraud.”

The event concluded with a tour of Yuengling’s facility — America’s oldest operating brewery — and lunch with attendees.

Deluzio pushes utilities for more transparency

U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pittsburgh, this week sent a letter to the Bureau of Audits — a division of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission — requesting information about an independent audit of the agency.

The letter is the latest in Deluzio’s ongoing response to April’s widespread power outages and is part of his work to get utility companies and state and local governments to do better by people in the future. It comes amid rising energy costs that continue to hammer Pennsylvanians’ wallets and frustration about low power reliability around severe storms.

“Pennsylvanians should not be forced to accept week-long blackouts as normal when storms roll through,” Deluzio said. “I see it as my role as a member of House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to always fight for the strongest, best infrastructure possible for the people of Pennsylvania’s 17th Congressional District. A fuller understanding of the PUC’s audits and work will help as I continue to push utilities and governments to improve storm readiness and response.”

Deluzio’s letter to the Bureau of Audits is his latest move in his follow-up to this spring’s extensive power outages. He sent the letter in response to a constituent’s survey response.

Bresnahan leads legislation to put local food on local tables

U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, Jr., R-Dallas Township, this week led a bipartisan group of his colleagues in introducing the Local Farmers Feeding our Communities Act to boost the purchasing and distribution of local food.

The bill will help build stronger connections between local producers, and community food programs, expanding markets and improving access to healthy food for those in need.

“Far too often the discussion around alleviating hunger leaves out those who grow, raise, and produce food — our local farmers,” Bresnahan said. “Reducing the barriers between our communities and the farmers who produce our food is a commonsense approach to ensure everyone in Northeast Pennsylvania has access to the food they need. This bill recognizes the hard work that is needed to supply fresh and nutritious food like fruit, veggies, milk, and cheese, while also creating a clear path to putting this food on the plates of people who need it. This investment in our local farmers is an investment in stronger local food security and healthier communities.”

The Local Farmers Feeding our Communities Act will allow states, through USDA, to establish cooperative agreements connecting local farmers and producers with local food distribution organizations.

Through these agreements, funds will be used to purchase local, fresh, and minimally processed foods like seafood, meat, milk, cheese, eggs, fruit and poultry. The bill also sets aside a portion of these funds to purchase food specifically from small, mid-size, beginning and veteran farmers.

Piaggio Vehicles anticipates a 50% penetration of L5 electric three-wheelers in India by mid-2028, driven by a structural market shift despite reduced government incentives. The company emphasizes the need for clarity on incentive continuation as it launches new electric passenger models. Factors like improved infrastructure and lower costs are fueling EV adoption, particularly in the passenger segment.

Small commercial vehicle maker Piaggio Vehicles is expecting L5 electric three-wheeler segment penetration in the domestic market reaching 50 per cent at the most by mid-2028, owing to a structural shift and other factors, a top company official has said.

The company, which last month rolled out two new electric passenger three-wheelers -- the all-new Ape E-City Ultra and upgraded Ape FX Maxx- also said there is a need for the government to provide clarity on the issue of continuation of the incentives.

Piaggio Commercial Vehicles Pvt Ltd (PVPL) is the Indian subsidiary of Italian auto major Piaggio Group.

""There is a spike in the penetration of L5 category electric three wheelers in the country in the last one-and-a-half years. And this is when the government incentives under the FAME program have reduced to one-fourth in the same period,"" Diego Graffy, Chairman and Managing Director of PVPL, told PTI in an interaction.

He said that if the level of penetration continues at this pace, ""we expect this to reach 50 per cent by the end of 2027 or the beginning of mid-2028 even if the incentives are withdrawn, as there is a structural shift taking place in the market.""

Live Events

There are two categories-- L5 and L3-- in the electric three-wheeler segment. L5 Category refers to three-wheeler auto-rickshaws for carrying passengers or cargo while e-carts fall in L3 category.

Both the Central Government and state governments are promoting the faster adoption of EVs through various fiscal incentives to the EV buyers.

The second phase of the government's flagship scheme, Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME), launched in 2019 with an initial outlay of Rs 10,000 crore, later increased to Rs 11,500 crore, ended in March last year.

Subsequently, a new PM E-Drive Scheme with an outlay of Rs 10,900 crore for two years to boost EV sales, replacing FAME programme was announced in September 2024.

""The Government reducing the subsidy to one-fourth in the last one-and-a-half years could have definitely been a big disruption (in terms of demand) but instead of depressing the market, it has only kept on increasing. It means that the change or the shift that is happening now is structural and not anymore incidental. And this shift is happening for multiple reasons,"" Graffy said.

Apart from the structural shift, the factors for the higher penetration include improved charging infra, lower cost of acquisition and ease of financing and servicing.

""These challenges have largely been addressed in this period leading to increased penetration, particularly of the passenger segment,"" he said.

According to industry statistics, L5 passenger electric three-wheeler penetration accounted for 22.8 per cent in the total EV sales in FY 25 while the goods e-three-wheeler penetartion stood at 21.5 per cent in the same period.

Also, in the April-June quarter of this fiscal, as much as 32.4 per cent of the total ev penetration was recorded in the passenger e-three wheeler segment and 22.8 per cent in the cargo e-three-wheeler segment.

Graffy said that the adoption rate across Southern and Western parts of the country however, is still much lower, adding that, it is expected to increase in the next couple of years and when it happens, the overall penetration rate would go much higher than 50 per cent.""

He said that the e-commerce transition was leading to the demand for cargo e-three-wheelers, which is on the wane now while the passenger segment is picking up very rapidly due to the reason cited earlier.

Due to a structural transition that we see, now the passenger segment will have a much higher rate of adoption in the next few months, he stated.

He said that Piaggio Vehicles is ""maintaining"" more or less the pace at which the industry is growing, adding that the company keeps on renewing its product portfolio every two years since 2019 when it first introduced its e-three-wheeler in the country.

""We are not doing (renewing products) so frequently unlike many other players are doing in the space. We prefer to take our time. So, we are reviving our products every two years trying to introduce new features with innovation and technology,"" he said.

""We believe EVs are an opportunity to reshape urban transport and improve livelihoods. New ApA© E-City Ultra and ApA© E-City FX Maxx are being built with these realities in mind. They deliver what the Indian customer needs: best in class range, low battery degradation, strong performance, and minimal operating costs,"" Graffy said on the launch of the two models, which are priced at Rs 3.80-lakh and Rs 3.30 lakh, respectively.

""These vehicles are enablers of economic mobility, future-ready solutions that can scale across cities and small towns alike. Our focus is not only on innovation but also on contributing to a more inclusive and sustainable future,"" he said.

On the incentives, he said,"" uncertainty on (the continuation) of the incentives is definitely very disturbing and some clarity going forward is required."" ""Even if the government wants the incentives to discontinue from a particular date, declare it clearly so that every OEM can plan the strategy accordingly,"" Graffy said.

“That could be a weapon that can help us beat China.” Solid-state batteries are more powerful, durable, faster to charge and safer than the lithium-ion cells currently dominating the EV sector.","[SEOUL] SK Innovation’s battery unit plans to accelerate development of cutting-edge technologies in partnership with US and European carmakers, its R&D chief said, aiming to win back market share from peers in China and South Korea.

SK On is focused on honing its edge in thermal management technology, such as immersion cooling designed to boost the efficiency of batteries for AI data centres, energy storage systems and electric vehicles (EVs), Park Kisoo, head of the company’s research and development arm, said. The battery specialist already is in talks with Ford Motor and Hyundai Motor to collaborate on the cutting-edge tech, he said.

A representative for Ford declined to comment. Hyundai did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The push comes amid a broad reorganisation of the SK group, a leading South Korean conglomerate, which plans to merge money-losing SK On with more profitable sister company SK Enmove in a bid to stabilise its balance sheet. The move follows another in-group transaction by SK On’s parent company a year ago with a similar goal of shoring up finances as the battery unit pursues aggressive expansion overseas.

The South Korean company operates two standalone battery plants in Georgia, which supply Ford and Volkswagen, and is planning another facility in the state with Hyundai. SK On and Ford received a US$9.63 billion loan from the US government late last year to build two battery factories in Kentucky and another in neighbouring Tennessee. They have paused plans for a battery plant in Canada. SK On also has battery production facilities in China, Europe and at home in South Korea.

Park said that his R&D centre will spur internal efforts to diversify suppliers and strengthen supply chains to bolster the company’s US production and ramp up its energy storage business there.

EV demand is set to decline further with the looming end of US tax credits in September, but the R&D chief sees global sales rebounding as early as late 2027, if automakers can close the price gap between EVs and petrol-powered vehicles.

“For many EV drivers, there’s no going back, and the penetration rate is only set to grow in China and elsewhere,” Park said.

SK On is also targeting the development of solid-state batteries by the end of 2027 and mass production of them from 2029, he said. Semi solid-state batteries, a hybrid version of current and next-generation tech, could be commercialised even sooner.

American tech giants are increasingly turning to nuclear power to meet the growing demand for electricity driven by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). Companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft are building data centers near nuclear power plants, such as the Susquehanna plant in Pennsylvania, to power their AI operations. This strategic move underscores the critical need for reliable and sustainable energy sources to support the development and deployment of AI technologies.

The demand for AI has surged in recent years, with tech companies requiring immense amounts of power to run their data centers. Traditional power sources, including renewables and natural gas, are struggling to meet this growing demand. In response, tech firms are exploring nuclear power as a viable alternative. Nuclear energy offers several advantages, including the ability to provide round-the-clock electricity regardless of weather conditions and its low carbon footprint.

According to a report by the Nuclear Energy Institute, the nation's dwindling fleet of nuclear plants is being seized upon by tech firms as a foundation for their AI-infused future. Tech companies are striking deals with nuclear plant operators to secure long-term power contracts. For instance, Microsoft has agreed to restart a reactor next to the one at Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island plant that was shuttered in 1979, while Amazon has locked up power from a 42-year-old nuclear plant down the Susquehanna River [2].

The tech industry's interest in nuclear power is not without controversy. Critics argue that these deals could lead to electricity rate hikes or shortages for consumers, as the nation faces soaring demand for power. Moreover, the reliance on aging nuclear plants could extend the life of polluting coal and gas plants, potentially undermining climate goals.

Despite these concerns, nuclear industry officials maintain that the tech industry's interest in nuclear power is a springboard for the industry's resurgence. They argue that building more plants is the solution to meet the growing demand for power. However, even nuclear executives acknowledge that pulling zero-emission nuclear energy away from other customers will have an impact on the climate and can be out of sync with the ambitious commitments tech firms have made to reduce their carbon footprint.

In conclusion, the shift towards nuclear power by tech firms highlights the urgent need for sustainable and reliable energy sources to support the growth of AI. While this move presents both opportunities and challenges, it is clear that the energy landscape is evolving to meet the demands of the digital age.

The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Science and Technology, had proposed a policy to restrict solar panel imports in a bid to localise production, conserve forex, and create jobs.
But PwC said the plan, if not properly sequenced, risks stalling Nigeria’s clean energy momentum.
It added, “The goal should be to scale local manufacturing without compromising access to affordable solar energy.
“There is an urgent need for single-window applications, clearer eligibility criteria, and renewable energy desks in key MDAs,” PwC stated.","A new report by global consulting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, has cautioned the Federal Government against implementing an immediate restriction on solar panel imports, warning that such a move could disrupt Nigeria’s fragile energy access gains and dampen investor confidence in the renewable energy sector.

The report, titled “Rethinking Nigeria’s Proposed Solar Panel Import Policy”, and obtained by our correspondent on Friday, noted that while the push for local manufacturing and industrialisation is commendable, a measured and phased approach is necessary to avoid unintended consequences.

These recommendations came in response to the government’s announcement of a ban on solar panel importation, citing the influx of substandard products. The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Science and Technology, had proposed a policy to restrict solar panel imports in a bid to localise production, conserve forex, and create jobs.

But PwC said the plan, if not properly sequenced, risks stalling Nigeria’s clean energy momentum. In Q4 2024, Nigeria imported solar panels valued at approximately N237.3bn, but by Q1 2025, imports had dropped by about 89 per cent to N125.29bn.

“In 2023 alone, Nigeria imported over four million solar panels, valued at more than $200m. This is not just a reflection of our energy crisis, but also of the absence of adequate local manufacturing capacity,” the report said.

Rather than an outright restriction, PwC advised the government to implement a three- to five-year phased reduction in imports, giving room for local manufacturers to ramp up production capacity, meet demand, and establish quality control systems.

“The proposed import restriction policy reflects Nigeria’s ambition for energy security and industrial growth. A measured and strategic approach is needed to avoid unintended disruptions.

“A tiered strategy that includes import quotas, progressive tariffs, or blended procurement models would ensure supply continuity while attracting long-term investments under a stable regulatory framework,” the report recommended.

It added, “The goal should be to scale local manufacturing without compromising access to affordable solar energy. Rather than an instant restriction, Nigeria should adopt a three to five-year phased reduction in solar panel imports.”

The firm acknowledged that the Nigerian government already offers incentives such as the Pioneer Status Incentive, import duty waivers, VAT exemptions, and green finance instruments. However, these remain grossly underutilised due to bureaucratic red tape, fragmented application processes, and limited awareness.

“There is an urgent need for single-window applications, clearer eligibility criteria, and renewable energy desks in key MDAs,” PwC stated. It also called for dedicated renewable energy industrial zones, equipped with shared infrastructure, streamlined permitting processes, and proximity to ports and transport corridors to reduce logistics costs.

The report stressed that solar manufacturing isn’t just about equipment, but also about people. It urged the government to partner with universities, polytechnics, and vocational centres to create a national renewable energy skills framework.

“Manufacturing solar panels requires trained technicians, engineers, and quality assurance professionals. Without human capital development, local industry will struggle to compete,” PwC warned.

It also advocated for stronger enforcement of product standards, urging agencies such as the Standards Organisation of Nigeria and Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency to adopt and enforce International Electrotechnical Commission-aligned standards.

On finance, PwC noted that access to capital remains a major constraint for both manufacturers and consumers. It is recommended that the Bank of Industry and Central Bank of Nigeria provide long-term green financing and support Pay-As-You-Go models to deepen solar access for off-grid households.

PwC urged the government to engage the private sector, development partners like the World Bank and AfDB, and civil society to co-develop a coherent renewable energy roadmap.

“Establishing stakeholder feedback loops and publishing annual progress reports can drive transparency, track jobs created, cost reductions, and support mid-course corrections,” it said.

While acknowledging the government’s intent to spur industrialisation, PwC concluded that “a hasty restriction could stall momentum in Nigeria’s clean energy transition, reduce affordability, and shake investor confidence.”

“Nigeria must recalibrate its solar panel import policy with strategic sequencing, stakeholder alignment, and realism about the current state of local capacity,” the report stated.

It added, “Getting it right can help Nigeria meet its climate goals, boost local industry, and drive long-term economic growth. Getting it wrong could leave millions in the dark.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/02004258/PwC-e1706830978530.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 20:57:59.781950

The imposition of export restrictions by China on key rare earth magnets has resulted in supply chain bottlenecks, impacting the user industries, including the auto and electronics sectors.

The magnets are essential components across sectors like automobiles, household appliances, and renewable energy.

""Basis, all the actions we have taken, FY26 is more or less managed. We have to now work on some medium and long term actions,"" Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) Group Chief Financial Officer Amarjyoti Barua told PTI in an interaction.

The company has taken steps to build inventory through alternative sources to take care of the problem, he stated.

""It has panned out well for us so far and we do not foresee any major risk for the next nine months,"" Barua said.

""But considering the growth plans we have, we have to think about a much bigger play than what the tactical plays we have done, and that is going to require a lot more engineering effort,"" he added.

The company's engineers are working on various solutions to work out a solution, Barua said.

Last week, Maruti Suzuki stated that its engineers are working to mitigate the rare earth magnet shortage issue, noting that there has been no impact on its production so far.

Hyundai Motor India has also stated that it is not facing any production issues due to the shortage of rare earth magnets.

In June, rating agency ICRA had stated that inventories of rare-earth magnets used in critical automotive components, particularly electric vehicle (EV) traction motors and power steering systems, could run dry by mid-July this year. Crisil, another rating agency, had also flagged it as a significant risk to automotive supply chains.

The magnets in question, neodymium-iron-boron, are known for their strength and efficiency, used for high-performance automotive applications such as traction motors in electric vehicles and power steering in both electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles.

The company proposed a BESS project to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees and manages the electrical grid to serve most of the southern US state, said Issara Niropas, chief executive of Banpu Power.

He did not reveal the development cost, saying only that the project may be partially funded by a subsidy programme aimed at supporting BESS businesses.

""The global market for BESS is experiencing rapid growth, driven by increasing adoption of renewables and the need for grid stability and energy security,"" said Mr Issara.

The market growth is attributed to declining battery costs, technological advancements and supportive government policies, he said.

BESS plays an important role in storing electricity generated by the sun and wind, which are intermittent sources of energy generation dependent on weather conditions and seasons.

BESS can be developed via a battery farm to ensure a stable supply of clean energy.

Electricity demand in the US is rising, driven by the development of data centres and greater use of artificial intelligence technology.

BESS represents a new area of business for Banpu in the US after it embarked on on-shore gas production and distribution, as well as power generation businesses in the country.

Banpu Next, the energy technology arm of Banpu, said earlier it plans to expand the BESS business into Asia-Pacific nations.

Through its subsidiary Banpu Japan, Banpu Next operates a 58-megawatt-hour BESS farm in the city of Tono. The facility is designed to supply electricity to 5,800 houses.

Banpu owns 40 power plants, either in operation or under construction, both in and outside the US.

These plants have a combined electricity generation capacity of 3.6 gigawatts, based on the company's shareholding in energy firms developing these facilities.

Withdrawing the finding would give the Trump administration license to eliminate those regulations.
Although Texas remains the nation’s top producer of crude oil, it’s also become the top producer of solar power—and a hub for solar-equipment manufacturing, too.
And that’s to say nothing of the human impacts that first prompted the endangerment finding.
Regulatory changes like the proposed rescinding of the endangerment finding might not survive legal challenges.","IF YOU WANT TO UNDERSTAND how mindlessly destructive Donald Trump’s latest move on climate could be, just look at the response from the groups that you would expect to be cheering it most loudly.

The move came on Tuesday, when the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was preparing to smash the legal foundation for government limits on greenhouse gases. The plan is for EPA to revoke its “endangerment finding” that formally recognizes global warming as a threat to public health.

That finding—issued in 2009 under the Obama administration—gave EPA authority to regulate emissions from cars, power plants, factories, and other sources of pollution. Withdrawing the finding would give the Trump administration license to eliminate those regulations.

And while the process of revoking the endangerment finding will take at least a few months—like any other new rule, it first has to go through a period of public comment—the administration isn’t wasting any time. On the very same day it announced its intentions on the endangerment rule, the EPA also said it intends to get rid of the motor-vehicle emissions limits.

Speaking at an Indianapolis truck dealership, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin described the agency’s plans for the endangerment finding as “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.” That might not be an exaggeration. The New York Times, which broke the news of the announcement several days before, called it a “game-changing climate rollback.”

Get 30 day free trial

On first blush, it was also the ultimate wish fulfillment for an industry coalition that in 2009 had screamed about the finding and subsequently—and unsuccessfully—tried to stop it in court. Back then, trade organizations like the Edison Electric Institute (which represents power companies) and the National Association of Manufacturers were making many of the same arguments Trump officials made last week: that the EPA had overstepped its authority and relied on bad science, and that the resulting regulations would unleash all kinds of economic damage.

The finding could lead to “a top-down command-and-control regime that will choke off growth by adding new mandates to virtually every major construction and renovation project,” the then-head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce warned at the time.

But if you checked out the websites and social media feeds of those organizations last week, all you saw was the digital equivalent of crickets. Groups weren’t putting out public statements or dispatching officials to hail the move. They also weren’t answering reporter queries, at least based on those I sent to the Edison Institute and the Manufacturers, as well as the auto-industry lobby.

In fact, the only group that responded to me was the chamber, which provided a statement from Marty Durbin, who runs its Global Energy Institute. “We appreciate the Administration’s focus on economic growth and on providing the reliable, affordable energy needed to support our growth and competitiveness,” Durbin said. “While we did not call for this proposal, we are reviewing it and will consult with members so we can provide constructive feedback to the agency.”

That’s a conspicuously milquetoast reaction considering that the chamber knows as well as anybody in Washington how much Trump rewards public praise. But the chamber’s statement was actually pretty typical for how industry groups have greeted Trump’s climate agenda over the past few months.

That agenda has included everything from eliminating penalties for auto manufacturers whose cars don’t meet efficiency standards to gutting the rules on power-plant emissions. Sometimes the administration has simply acted on its own—by, for example, withdrawing permission for the development of offshore wind farms and canceling a $4.9 billion loan to build a critical cross-state transmission line. Other times it has worked with Congress, as it did most famously and consequentially on legislation shutting off hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies that were supporting the development of wind and solar power, and electric vehicles.

In each of these cases, the industry reaction has been just as ambivalent as it was to last week’s announcement on the endangerment finding, with a mix of muted praise and begrudging acceptance. There’s a reason for that. The organizations and people who work on these issues every day understand that the world has changed dramatically since 2009—in ways Trump and his hard-core supporters apparently cannot grasp, or maybe just don’t want to acknowledge.

THE 2009 ENDANGERMENT FINDING was a watershed moment in the campaign to slow global warming, which nearly the entire scientific community had long since concluded was the result of human activity. But slowing climate change meant reducing the production of greenhouse gases from cars, factories, and other sources. And, back then, there was no way to do that without highly expensive, politically toxic tradeoffs.

The most obvious and straightforward approach, putting some kind of financial penalty on carbon (a “carbon tax”), threatened to increase costs for consumers by raising electricity bills or jacking up the prices of cars. Penalizing carbon also threatened jobs in the fossil-fuel industry, which is a big reason why Obama’s proposal to create a scheme of tradeable emission permits (his “cap and trade” proposal) couldn’t get through the Senate.

It was in the wake of that legislative failure that Obama resorted to executive action, which was possible because the EPA already had well-established, widely supported authority to regulate harmful pollutants under the 1970 Clean Air Act. The law didn’t mention greenhouse gases specifically, but the EPA’s own scientists had spent years accumulating evidence of all the ways greenhouse gases were warming the planet, and then all the ways changing weather patterns and rising seas would cause human harm.

The George W. Bush administration had balked at letting the scientists issue that finding. That prompted a lawsuit and, eventually, a 2007 Supreme Court ruling (Massachusetts v. EPA) in which a 5–4 majority held that the EPA not only had the right to regulate greenhouse gases but an obligation to do so if it determined they threatened health. That set the stage for action by Obama’s EPA, which issued the finding and then its series of emissions regulations—which, in turn, the Biden administration made even more stringent.

But the Biden administration was able to do more than merely issue regulations. Working with a narrow Democratic majority in Congress, it was able to invest large sums of federal money in the development of cleaner energy. The primary vehicle for this was the Inflation Reduction Act, the 2022 law that subsidized everything from the construction of solar arrays to purchase of electric vehicles.

The result has been hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of carrots for businesses and consumers, to go with the sticks of regulation. And it has come at the same time that technological advances have made reducing carbon emissions a lot easier—and a lot cheaper too.

A prominent example: The price of electric vehicles has fallen, thanks to the development of more efficient batteries, which are their costliest component. And their ranges have increased—which, combined with advantages like whisper-quiet operation and lower lifetime maintenance costs, and the greater availability of charging stations in parts of the country, are increasingly making these vehicles more attractive to consumers.

The transformation of the energy sector has been even more dramatic. It used to be that renewables reliably cost more than fossil fuels. No more. Solar and wind today frequently cost less, depending on the circumstances. And at this particular moment they are also a lot easier to scale up, thanks to a worldwide shortage of the turbines it takes to generate electricity from petroleum.

“The fundamentals have shifted,” Sonia Aggarwal, CEO of Energy Innovation, a climate and energy think tank, told me. “Renewables are the cheapest, fastest way to get power online right now.”

That is especially important because of the surging demand for power from data centers, especially those dedicated to artificial intelligence. That is why the tech sector has been defending government support for renewables—as it did successfully at the state level earlier this year, when their objections helped defeat a proposal to slow the deployment of solar power in Texas.

The tech sector prevailed by winning over a significant chunk of Republican legislators, not because they’re tree huggers but because they like jobs. Although Texas remains the nation’s top producer of crude oil, it’s also become the top producer of solar power—and a hub for solar-equipment manufacturing, too.

THAT SAGA—WEAVING TOGETHER regulations and incentives so that the business community would buy in to the overall plan—was very much how the Biden administration and its supporters in Congress hoped the politics of their clean-energy push would play out at the national level. And in some ways, it has.

Clean-energy subsidies have disproportionately benefited Republican-leaning parts of the country—by underwriting wind farms across the blustery Great Plains and solar arrays across the sun-soaked Southwest, along with the “battery belt” of EV factories stretching from Kentucky to Georgia. When Trump and GOP leaders made clear they were serious about ending that federal support, a number of Republican lawmakers from those districts and states pushed back.

But Trump and his allies proceeded anyway, making only modest concessions. And now the rollbacks are beginning. The EV credits disappear in September. Support for wind and solar effectively ends next year. And that’s on top of the executive actions, which include not just the big, very public rescinding of regulations but also a much quieter set of cuts to funding for research into clean energy.

Investment in factory construction has already plummeted, as Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer documented last week, while clean-energy companies have started canceling projects and laying off workers.

For those who support the Trump agenda, this shift away from clean energy is proof that their original objections to Biden- and Obama-era policies were correct—that markets, always wiser than regulators, will steer America to a future with more coal and less solar, more gas-powered cars and fewer EVs.

And if that means less progress at reducing greenhouse gases, well, they can live with that too. Many simply don’t see climate change as a threat, if they acknowledge it all, and say efforts to slow it are part of a vast, freedom-crushing campaign by leftist elites. “Another great step in unwinding the Democrats’ radical climate agenda” is how Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) described last week’s EPA announcement.

But that’s not how the rest of the world (or, for that matter, many younger Republicans) see it. And it’s probably not where global markets are headed.

At this point, for instance, it’s hard to find an auto industry expert who thinks combustion engines are the future. “The industry is completely committed to electrification,” as Daniel Sperling, founding director of the Institute for Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, told me in a phone interview. “It’s really just a question of pacing and timing.”

With the Biden-era policies in place, U.S. companies were just starting to catch up to Chinese manufacturers, which have a big head start thanks to longstanding support from their government. Now those U.S. companies are in danger of falling farther behind, setting up a scenario where they hold on to an isolated, shrinking U.S. market for gas-powered cars while ceding worldwide EV sales to foreign competitors.

“There’s a learning curve—to the extent that you start delaying and you lower the launch volumes in like year two and year three, you’re not getting the experience that is going to help inform your next generation of vehicles,” Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, former chief economist at the Ford Motor Company now at the think tank Third Way, told me.

Falling behind on EVs has national security implications, insofar as it could leave American vehicle fleets more dependent on foreign oil. It’s the same story with power generation, too.

Yanking the support for wind and solar—while, simultaneously, dealing out new subsidies for fossil fuels—could leave the civilian power grid more dependent on either the foreign countries that produce oil or the ones that manufacture renewable energy machinery.

And in case you’re wondering, Chinese firms are also on their way to dominating that manufacturing sector.

“We are sacrificing so much opportunity that we had, ready and there for the taking,” Julia McNamara, associate policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told me. “We are at risk of losing hundreds of thousands of jobs, hundreds of billions of dollars in manufacturing investments and in clean energy projects, and ceding innovation on a global scale.”

HOW THIS ALL PLAYS OUT politically is hard to say. While some effects of Trump’s agenda will take years or even decades to materialize, others will not. Among the more immediate impacts could be rising electricity costs, because the gap between surging demand and increasing supply is likely to grow so quickly.

And that’s to say nothing of the human impacts that first prompted the endangerment finding. That includes extreme weather events, which (sadly and often tragically) come with regularity nowadays. Linking any one calamity to a warming planet is difficult. Linking the broad increase in frequency and intensity of deadly storms and other weather shifts isn’t.

The somewhat relatively good news—as climate experts Jesse Jenkins and Jane Flegal discussed on a recent episode of Ezra Klein’s podcast—is that the clean-energy transition is far enough along that it won’t stop altogether, despite Trump’s best efforts. And that assumes the entirety of Trump’s agenda comes to fruition, which it may not.

Regulatory changes like the proposed rescinding of the endangerment finding might not survive legal challenges. The cuts to wind and solar and EVs could be reversed or delayed, if Congress were so inclined to demand it of the president—although the chances of this Congress making those demands seem close to nil given how opposition to climate change has become yet another badge of right-wing political identity.

The best hope for change probably lies in a change of leadership, in Congress and eventually the White House. Neither will happen without political pressure, which is why the industry groups silent about Trump’s agenda might want to go one step further and speak out forcefully against it.

They have plenty of incentive. After all, it’s their money at stake.

And come to think of it, it’s their planet too.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!VTB8!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc74ed0ab-a35f-417c-8754-b7af248205ca_2100x1500.jpeg",N,,2025-08-03 20:00:51.514233

As California navigates the challenges of managing retired EV batteries, the rest of the nation observes closely.","The growing surplus of retired electric vehicle (EV) batteries is becoming an urgent issue for California. As the state increases its adoption of renewable energy, it faces a critical decision: how to manage the influx of spent EV batteries. A recent study by a trans-Atlantic research team highlights a potential solution. Reusing these batteries as grid-connected storage before recycling could significantly reduce carbon emissions. This approach, however, demands a robust infrastructure and strategic planning to maximize environmental benefits. The study’s findings not only hold implications for California but also serve as a cautionary tale for energy policies across the United States.

Reuse Delivers the Bigger Climate Dividend

California’s plan to manage retired EV batteries could result in substantial carbon savings. The study reveals that if every retired battery is recycled immediately, it could cover 61% of the state’s cumulative EV battery demand by 2050. This would prevent approximately 48 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions. However, adopting a “second-use first” strategy could amplify these benefits.

By repurposing batteries for energy storage, California could avoid up to 56 million tons of carbon emissions. This approach leverages the existing functionality of aged batteries, avoiding the need to manufacture new lithium-ion units. Manufacturing from primary raw materials is carbon-intensive, making the reuse of existing packs a more sustainable option. Extending the life of these batteries defers the environmental impact of new manufacturing, maximizing carbon savings.

Oversupply Looms, Making Early Recycling Infrastructure Critical

Despite the environmental benefits of reuse, researchers warn of an impending oversupply of retired EV batteries. By mid-century, the quantity of spent batteries will exceed the state’s stationary storage needs. Even if all second-life packs are used, the demand will not match the supply. This scenario highlights the necessity of a well-developed recycling infrastructure.

Building large-scale recycling facilities is essential to handle the surplus efficiently. Delaying investment in these facilities could lead to bottlenecks, impeding the recovery of valuable materials like lithium, nickel, and cobalt. These materials are crucial for the production of next-generation EVs. Establishing comprehensive collection networks and efficient recycling processes will ensure a steady supply of these resources, supporting the growth of the EV industry.

Three Scenarios Illuminate Trade-Offs

The research team explored three scenarios to evaluate the potential outcomes. The baseline scenario represents the current state, where only 2.5% of retired batteries are reused. The recycling scenario focuses on 100% material recovery, while the second-use scenario prioritizes reuse until storage needs are satisfied annually.

Each scenario emphasizes the importance of recycling to close the loop on raw materials. However, the second-use strategy offers the most significant carbon savings while still contributing to future recycling streams. This approach allows batteries to provide additional service years, maximizing their utility before recycling.

Implications for U.S. Energy Policy

Although the study centers on California, its implications resonate nationwide. As federal incentives drive EV adoption and renewable energy growth, states with ambitious clean-energy goals can benefit from these findings. Pairing solar and wind farms with repurposed EV batteries can enhance climate gains.

Holistic, regional planning is crucial to realizing the full potential of a circular battery economy. By coordinating production, reuse, and recycling efforts, jurisdictions can strengthen supply-chain resilience, reduce reliance on mined materials, and achieve deeper emissions reductions. Early action will be key to securing these benefits and leading the transition to sustainable energy practices.

As California navigates the challenges of managing retired EV batteries, the rest of the nation observes closely. The decisions made today will shape the future of energy policy and environmental sustainability. How will states balance the need for immediate recycling with the potential benefits of battery reuse?

The Korean automaker sold 79,543 vehicles in the U.S. last month, marking a 15% jump from the previous year and the company's strongest July performance since launching its first American vehicle in 1986. Leading this charge was the IONIQ 5, which saw sales rocket 71% with 5,818 units sold, proving that building quality EVs in America is the recipe for success.

The numbers tell a compelling story about shifting consumer preferences in the EV market. Electrified vehicles now account for nearly one-third of Hyundai's retail sales mix, representing a dramatic 50% increase compared to July 2024. This surge comes at a critical time as the federal $7,500 EV tax credit faces its September 30 deadline, creating urgency among buyers to secure these substantial savings before they disappear.

What Makes the IONIQ 5 a Tesla Model Y Killer

The IONIQ 5's success stems from addressing real-world consumer pain points that Tesla has struggled with. Built at Hyundai's Georgia manufacturing facility, the updated 2025 model delivers up to 318 miles of range while featuring an industry-leading 800-volt electrical architecture that enables ultra-fast charging. This technical advantage allows the IONIQ 5 to charge from 10% to 80% in just 18 minutes at compatible 350kW stations, compared to Tesla's slower 400-volt system requiring around 40 minutes.

Recent independent testing has shown the IONIQ 5 matching or exceeding the Tesla Model Y in key areas like ride comfort, interior space, and user-friendly controls. The Korean crossover offers nearly four more inches of rear shoulder room and includes physical buttons for essential functions, addressing common Tesla owner complaints about everything being buried in touchscreen menus. Recent automotive reviews have positioned the IONIQ 5 as Tesla's most formidable competitor, with Edmunds calling the comparison a tie between the two vehicles.

The Perfect Storm for EV Adoption

Hyundai's aggressive pricing strategy has made electric vehicle ownership accessible to mainstream buyers. The IONIQ 5 is currently available for lease starting at just $179 per month, undercutting many gas-powered SUVs while including a complimentary home charging station. This pricing approach, combined with the vehicle's Georgia production qualifying it for federal tax credits, creates compelling value that's hard to ignore.",https://static1.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2025/06/img_6626-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 20:00:10.560633

Among the most impressive are results from a run at the United Kingdom's vaunted Shelsley Walsh hill climb. Porsche Formula E development driver Gabriela Jílková took the prototype battery-powered SUV up the 2,998-foot course — with a gradient of up to 16.7% in places — in under 32 seconds. The mark bested the SUV record by four ticks, according to InsideEVs.

The publication credits the model's special suspension for the showing, which could have it competing in the sports car category, as well. It looks the part of both, judging by a photo shared by Car and Driver. It has a clean, low-profile design with the attitude of a sports car on the front half. The report listed the starting price at between $80,000 and $120,000. It's intended to replace the gas-burning Cayennes, but Car and Driver's Frankie Cruz didn't know when the complete shift to the cleaner version would happen, per his article.

News about Porsche's EV commitment has been mixed. It was reported last year that the luxury brand was cutting back on battery-powered investments with demand for its Taycan slowing, though other stories describe the ride as a boon for the EV sports car segment.

The Porsche models are evidence of how advanced EV performance is becoming, as more brands are competing with Tesla's popular models. Last year, a Mercedes-Benz CLA traveled 2,309 miles in 24 hours, requiring just 40 charges. The Chinese-made Xiaomi SU7 Ultra prototype has set lap records that contend with dirty-fueled rides.

The high-performance marks are reflected in better charge, range, and planet-friendly performance for models that end up on Main Street, too. Each EV that replaces a gas guzzler prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution annually, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The tailpipe exhaust includes known carcinogens and is associated with a variety of health risks, according to more government-cited studies.

A report from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology drives home EVs' planet-friendlier attributes. Gas-burning vehicles emit more than 350 grams of carbon dioxide per mile during their lives. An EV's lifetime CO2 burden is 200 grams per mile. If the region where it charges has cleaner energy to power it, the pollution contribution is lower.

Charging the ride with a household solar panel setup can increase the benefits by providing free solar-based electricity. EnergySage is a vetted resource that can help you land applicable incentives and find the right installer, saving thousands on upfront panel costs. Action is important, as President Donald Trump's spending bill ends solar incentives early on Dec. 31.

As for EVs, owners typically save up to $1,500 a year in gas and service costs, as there are no fluids to change. But EV tax credits expire early on Sept. 30, thanks to the bill, per NPR. Fortunately, states still offer certain incentives for clean energy projects.

Back on the proving grounds, former Top Gear host Richard Hammond tested the prototype Cayenne's towing capacity. It ""effortlessly"" handled a nearly 4,000-pound load, and will likely be able to pull more than 7,700 pounds. It's expected to have 729 horsepower or more, setting it apart from other Cayennes on the market, per ArenaEV.

The report said the new version will likely be available stateside in 2027.

In a sweeping deregulatory move, the Trump administration has proposed scrapping the Endangerment Finding, a foundation of U.S. climate policy that enabled federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants, by setting emissions standards.

First established in 2009 by Barack Obama’s government, the Endangerment Finding declared that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare. The ruling, based on a 2007 Supreme Court decision, gave the EPA legal authority to regulate emissions from cars, power plants, and industrial sources under the Clean Air Act.

Now, under EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the agency is seeking to overturn the finding. Calling it “the largest deregulatory action in the history of America” on a recent conservative podcast, Zeldin characterised the move as a rejection of “the holy grail of the climate change religion.”

If finalised, the repeal would gut the federal government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including the rollback of vehicle emissions standards and methane limits on oil and gas operations. It would also severely restrict future administrations from enacting similar protections. The finding was a key justification behind the Biden Administration’s electric vehicle (EV) mandate which has been a key issue of opposition for Trump.

The administration argues that the Clean Air Act was never intended to regulate global climate pollutants, suggesting instead that EPA authority should be limited to pollution with local or regional health impacts. This interpretation, however, has been widely dismissed by legal scholars and environmental experts.

Critics warn the proposal could have catastrophic environmental and legal consequences. Former EPA officials, including Republicans, have condemned the move as a betrayal of the agency’s mission. Climate scientists emphasise that eliminating the Endangerment Finding undermines decades of research linking emissions to rising global temperatures, extreme weather, and public health risks.

Whilst the proposal is expected to face significant legal challenges, experts caution that the mere attempt could delay climate action and weaken existing protections. A public comment period is now underway whereby the public can issue their thoughts on the proposal, before any final decision is made.",https://www.environewsnigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lee-Zeldin.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 20:01:26.550827

Lucid Motors Stock (NASDAQ:LCID)

Lucid stock has risen more than 19% over the past month, driven mainly by the announcement of a recent deal, under which ride-sharing giant Uber Technologies (UBER) aims to deploy 20,000 or more Lucid vehicles equipped with the Nuro Driver technology over a six-year period. Moreover, Uber will invest $300 million in Lucid as part of the robotaxi deal.

Investors also cheered the news that all Lucid Air sedan models will have the ability to charge utilizing Tesla’s (TSLA) Supercharger network beginning July 31. Despite the rise in LCID stock price over the past month, shares are still down about 20% year-to-date, as investors remain concerned about the company missing production and delivery expectations. Lucid is seeing softer demand for its pricier luxury EVs, as consumers are shifting to cheaper hybrid and gasoline-powered cars amid an elevated interest rate environment.

Lucid is scheduled to announce its results for the second quarter of 2025 on August 5. Wall Street expects the company to report a narrower loss per share of $0.21 compared to $0.34 in the prior-year quarter. Revenue is expected to rise by about 30% year-over-year to $261.26 million.

Is LCID Stock a Buy?

Following the Uber partnership news, Benchmark analyst Mickey Legg reiterated a Buy rating on Lucid stock and increased the price target to $7 from $5. Legg sees this collaboration as a clear strategic win, which “infuses capital and two world-class partners,” while expanding Lucid’s presence into autonomous ride-hailing. The analyst recommended buying LCID stock ahead of the Q2 earnings, as he expects continued positive momentum.

With seven Holds, one Buy, and one Sell recommendation, Wall Street has a Hold consensus rating on Lucid stock. The average LCID stock price target of $3.19 indicates 32% upside potential from current levels.

Nio Stock (NYSE:NIO)

Nio stock has rallied about 43% over the past month and is up about 15% year-to-date. Optimism about the company’s Onvo L90 SUV and resilient deliveries in the highly competitive Chinese EV market have helped drive the stock higher. Launched under Nio’s mass-market Onvo brand, the L90 SUV is expected to boost the company’s top line.

Last week, Nio reported a 2.5% year-over-year growth in its July deliveries to 21,017 vehicles. The company’s August deliveries are expected to be boosted by Onvo L90 sales. Overall, Nio’s Q2 deliveries jumped by about 26% year-over-year to 72,056 vehicles.

Is NIO a Buy, Sell, or Hold?

Last week, Macquarie analyst Eugene Hsiao upgraded NIO stock from Hold to Buy with a price target of $5.50. The 5-star analyst believes that the L90, priced at RMB 265.8k, is poised to be NIO’s most competitive offering. He noted that the L90 is a six-seat large SUV near the price of the five-seat Tesla Model Y.

Hsiao added that the L90 appears to be a better value for money compared to Li Auto’s (LI) recent i8 at a 17% lower entry price, but offering many similar features. Consequently, he raised his 2025 and 2026 volume estimates to 347,000 and 500,000, respectively.

However, several analysts don’t share Hsiao’s optimism. Overall, Wall Street has a Hold consensus rating on Nio stock based on five Holds, three Buys, and one Sell recommendation. The average NIO stock price target of $4.68 indicates a downside risk of 6.6% from current levels.

This brings XPeng’s Q2 deliveries to 103,181 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 242%.

The company’s expansion into Europe and launch of new models, including the updated G6 and G9 SUVs and P7+ sedan, drove higher demand in the first half. Overall, XPeng expects to double its deliveries in 2025 from 190,068 units last year. Expectations are high that the company will turn profitable in the fourth quarter of 2025.

Is XPEV a Good Stock to Buy?

Recently, Goldman Sachs analyst Tina Hou upgraded XPeng stock to Buy from Hold and raised the price target to $24 from $18.60, citing improving cost structure and new product strategies. The 4-star analyst stated that the company’s organizational and supply chain restructuring efforts are beginning to show results, supporting its expectations for more sustainable volume growth and better profit margins.

Hou noted that XPeng’s recent models, including the Mona M03 and P7+, have ranked among the top-selling cars in their segments. She added that the company is also accelerating its product rollout, planning to launch around 10 new or refreshed models annually, up from one to two in previous years, helping it maintain visibility in a crowded market.

Turning to Wall Street, XPeng stock scores a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buys, two Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average XPEV stock price target of $24.78 indicates 37.3% upside potential.

How can a car charge while it’s moving?

The key lies in a compact wind generator that turns moving air into electricity. But don’t picture a giant turbine stuck to the car. This system was designed to work with very light winds, which makes it perfect for city driving or for those days when you don’t go over 30 km/h.

Thanks to that, the vehicle’s battery receives energy in real time, whether you’re on the open road, driving through the city, or waiting at a traffic light.

Advantages over traditional electric cars

One of the biggest headaches with electric cars is still charging. Not enough stations, too slow, risk of getting stranded… With this system, all of that disappears. Literally.

Unlimited range: Since the car charges as it moves, you don’t need to think about how much battery you have left or look for the next plug.

Lower costs: No more paying to recharge. The energy is generated on the go, so usage costs drop instantly.

Almost zero environmental impact: No fuel, no external power. Just air and movement. So the carbon footprint is kept to a minimum.

An invention born in India (and that’s no coincidence)

Ok, let’s explain this. This project didn’t come out of a big innovation centre or of a big brand as we have said before, and of course, it doesn’t have either the investment backing of an important company.

It was created by a physicist in Maharashtra, with the help of his wife, Preeti Jha. Both, working side by side for a better future. Together, they want to change the world by turning a practical idea into real life.

And that is exactly what makes this experiment so powerful: this technology could make a difference in cities, but, think for a moment in those rural areas or places where electricity is more than a problem, this is a realistic solution for those who need it most, don’t you think?

What now?

Ok, lets go part by part, it is still in the process of commercial expansion (for the moment), its creators are looking for partners who want to take the idea further. Investors, manufacturers, governments… whoever wants to join this revolution is welcome…

As Jha himself said “We’re on the edge of an energy revolution. This innovation is not an experiment, it’s a solution ready to change industries and lives”

A new era of transport?

Could be, don’t? This self-charging car could be the start of something much incredible and bigger: a truly autonomous form of mobility, with no plugs, no cables and no external dependence! If the system scales up and is applied to more vehicles, we might be looking at a new category of transport.

Can you imagine never having to plug in your car again? What a dream! But maybe that’s no longer just imagining. It’s already happening in India!",https://mitechnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/EVPluggedIn.jpeg,N,,2025-08-03 19:00:18.872573

Massachusetts faces a statutory deadline to lock in contracts for at least 5.6 GW of offshore wind by 2027 but only one project–Vineyard Wind 1—is under under construction.
Two-thirds of Canadians want the federal government to prioritize clean energy development, said a study released last month by Clean Energy Canada.","Nova Scotia announced plans in late July to jumpstart Canada’s offshore wind industry, revealing four designated areas for development—the first in the country—located off the province's coast, with a goal to produce 5 GW by decade's end. Province Premier Tim Houston also noted more ambitious plans for the “Wind West"" megaproject aimed to produce 40 GW of offshore wind power for potential export across the country and into the U.S.

The offshore wind push comes as part of a larger effort by Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney, elected earlier year, to build the country's ""energy dominance"" by reducing its dependence on power imports from the U.S. and other nations, including both fossil fuel and renewables

“Canada’s new government is ready to fast-track major projects across the country that will make [it] an energy superpower,” Carney posted on social media following a meeting with oil and gas executives in May. “We all agree: it’s time to build,” he added.

Carney is seen as a clean energy proponent from past roles as chairman of infrastructure investor Brookfield Asset Management and head of its transition investing, and as UN special envoy for climate action and finance. But he is pledging to develop all forms of energy, “It’s time to build Canada into an energy superpower in both clean and conventional energy,” he said in backing construction of an “energy corridor,” although with few details yet as to projects in the ""national interest"" to be included.

Clean Energy Boost

But related to offshore wind, Nova Scotia said the province plans to issue a call for bids before year end on select parcels within the development area, in a process being managed by the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator. It aims to license development of up to 5 GW—double Nova Scotia’s current peak energy use—by 2030, with proposals for both floating and fixed-bottom wind projects to be considered.

“With some of the top wind speeds in the world, Nova Scotia has the potential to become a clean energy superpower,” said Houston on July 29, contending that Wind West would produce 27% of Canada’s energy needs but would require construction of infrastructure to deliver power westward. He said a combination of provincial, private and federal investment would be needed, citing a preliminary cost estimate of $5 billion to $6 billion but that could reach $10 billion, according to news reports.

Elsewhere on Canada's east coast, Newfoundland and Labrador announced in June that legislation passed to allow the province to also develop offshore wind. Other uses for offshore wind include supplying Canada's nascent green hydrogen industry, with a $4.45-billion Nova Scotia plant receiving environmental approvals last year and former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signing a supply agreement in 2022 with Germany.

Nova Scotia wind construction, as well as fossil fuel project development, could also receive a boost from federal legislation taking effect June 26 that allows the national government to fast-track development of certain “nation-building” projects. A new Major Federal Projects Office set to open in September is intended to meet a stated goal to generate project approvals within two years, with Canada's CBC News listing some projects that could gain fast track approval status.

US Connection?

Potential offshore wind export to New England states now is gaining momentum, as they face a gap in expected domestic production from Trump administration actions to limit US offshore wind growth—most recently cancellation of planned federal ocean lease sales in Maine, New York and central Atlantic states

The Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs could seek to procure electricity from planned offshore wind farms in Canada, according to a report by Canada’s National Observer, an online news publication focused on investigative reporting.

Massachusetts faces a statutory deadline to lock in contracts for at least 5.6 GW of offshore wind by 2027 but only one project–Vineyard Wind 1—is under under construction. It is set to add about 800 MW to the grid by the end of 2025. Other planned state projects have been halted or face delays. A spokesperson for the energy office said it is considering partnerships to leverage “significant opportunities to construct new onshore and offshore wind projects across Canada and the Northeast region.”

Similarly, Maine is ""closely tracking development of offshore wind in Canada and considering how regional efforts may deliver reliable, affordable power, modern infrastructure and broad economic benefits,"" the Governor’s Energy Office said in a statement. Workers who are citizens of tribal nations or members of international labor unions could theoretically work on projects in Canada, Grant Provost, business agent for Ironworkers international union Local 7 and Maine AFL-CIO vice president, told the Maine Morning Star. But he noted potential complications from current trade tensions.

Two-thirds of Canadians want the federal government to prioritize clean energy development, said a study released last month by Clean Energy Canada. But clean-economy tax credits introduced by the previous Liberal government remain slow moving. A spokesperson for Finance Canada said it now “is in the process of finalizing"" clean electricity and EV supply chain tax credits.

Meanwhile, market observers are awaiting possible impacts of what is termed as a ""landmark opinion"" July 23 by the UN's highest court that nations could be in violation of international law if they fail to take measures to mitigate climate change. While non-binding, the International Court of Justice ruling could boost legal arguments in suits against countries and companies seeking reparations.

The court said climate change was an ""urgent and existential threat"" to humanity and countries had a ""duty to cooperate"" on addressing it.",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/08/01/Nova-Scotia-cost.webp?height=635&t=1754254086&width=1200,N,,2025-08-03 18:00:43.670775

The shift from nuclear to renewable energy storage reflects a broader commitment to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security.","The global transition to renewable energy sources has sparked innovative solutions to balance electricity supply and demand. In Germany, a transformative project is underway at the former nuclear site in Philippsburg. The energy firm EnBW plans to construct one of the country’s largest battery storage facilities, leveraging the site’s strategic location. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to stabilize the power grid, accommodating the fluctuating output from renewable sources. As the world moves away from fossil fuels, the integration of such large-scale battery systems is crucial to ensure consistent power delivery, especially during periods of low renewable energy production.

Balancing the Grid

As the reliance on renewable energy sources like wind and solar power increases, the challenge of balancing the grid becomes more pronounced. Peter Heydecker, a board member at EnBW, emphasized the critical role of large-scale batteries in this new energy landscape. These batteries are pivotal in reconciling the variable generation capacity of renewable sources with actual electricity demand. The Philippsburg project is designed to capture excess electricity generated during periods of high renewable output and release it when demand surpasses supply, thus maintaining grid stability.

Heydecker highlighted a dual strategy involving both batteries and hydrogen-ready gas power plants. While batteries manage short-term fluctuations, these advanced gas plants are intended to provide backup during extended periods of insufficient renewable generation. Together, they form a flexible system capable of adapting to varying energy conditions.

“These Simulators Are Unlike Anything You’ve Seen” Trak Racer and Airbus Join Forces to Redefine Flight Training for a New Generation of American Pilots

“In the energy system of the future, the task of large-scale battery storage systems will be to reconcile two factors in the short term: The weather-dependent generation capacity of renewable energy sources on the one hand, and the actual electricity demand of households, businesses, and industry on the other,” Heydecker explained.

Energy Site is Tactical

The selection of the Philippsburg site is strategic, given its proximity to a significant substation constructed by TransnetBW, a major transmission system operator. This substation links to the Ultranet power line, which channels wind-generated electricity from northern Germany to its industrial southern regions. By situating an 800 MWh storage facility at this location, EnBW aims to optimize the capture and redistribution of surplus wind energy.

“Germany Is Betting Everything on This” as $3.2 Billion Offshore Wind Farm Promises Power for 1.6 Million Homes but Sparks Fierce Backlash Over Costs and Impact

Mayor Stefan Martus of Philippsburg underscored the town’s historical significance in Germany’s energy landscape. He expressed optimism about continuing its legacy as a central hub for sustainable energy storage and distribution. However, the project’s success hinges on EnBW’s final investment decisions and the acquisition of necessary permits. If these hurdles are cleared, the battery storage system is expected to be operational by mid-2027.

“Philippsburg has been one of the most important energy locations in the whole of Germany for half a century – and our town is set to continue to play this outstanding role as an anchor point and huge storage facility for sustainable power generation,” concluded Martus.

Repurposing Nuclear Sites

The transition from a nuclear power generation site to a battery storage facility marks a significant shift in energy policy and infrastructure use. The development is planned on land separate from the existing nuclear plant infrastructure, allowing for an independent timeline. This separation is crucial, as the decommissioning of the site’s nuclear reactors is a complex process that will continue for several more years.

By repurposing sites like Philippsburg, Germany is not only addressing the immediate needs of its power grid but also setting a precedent for sustainable development. The shift from nuclear to renewable energy storage reflects a broader commitment to reducing carbon emissions and enhancing energy security. This model could serve as an example for other countries grappling with similar transitions.

Future Implications for Energy Security

The Philippsburg project highlights the importance of innovative solutions in the global energy transition. As nations strive to meet climate goals and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, ensuring energy security becomes paramount. Large-scale battery systems, coupled with other renewable energy technologies, offer a path toward a more resilient and sustainable grid.

However, the successful integration of these technologies requires careful planning, substantial investment, and regulatory support. As the world continues to innovate in renewable energy, the question remains: How can countries best balance technological advancements with the need for reliable and affordable power for all?

Sebastian Hunte, investment director at AlbionVC

AlbionVC is a London-based VC backing companies from seed to Series A.

Nexos.ai – Lithuania

“Nexos helps businesses to reduce wasteful compute by intelligently routing across over 200 models based on context and task. Smarter orchestration means less unnecessary inference, and far better energy efficiency at scale.”

Flower – Sweden

“Much of the talk around greener AI focuses on efficiency gains, but I think that is the wrong way to think of it. Efficiency often leads to more usage, not less energy consumption. The real levers for sustainable AI are upstream: how we orchestrate workloads, where we run them and how green the energy powering them is.

That’s why Flower is such a compelling company: by combining grid-scale batteries with AI-powered trading and forecasting, they’re enabling a more stable, dispatchable supply of clean energy at scale. Their ‘green baseload’ platform could play a pivotal role in aligning AI’s rising energy demands with genuinely sustainable infrastructure.”

Many rigorous scientific findings since 2009 have showed both climate pollution and its warming effects are not just harming public health but killing people outright.
But for people who want to sum up the 2009 endangerment finding as if they study carbon dioxide as an endangerment on human health, they did not do that,” Zeldin told CNN.
So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion.","(CNN) — Lee Zeldin, a former Republican Congressman from New York and now the Trump Administration’s head of the Environmental Protection Agency on Sunday defended the Trump Administration’s move to repeal the so-called endangerment finding that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health.

“To reach the 2009 endangerment finding, they relied on the most pessimistic views of the science. The great news is that a lot of the pessimistic views of the science in 2009 that was being assumed ended up not panning out,” Zeldin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”

The 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety, which has served as EPA’s basis for many of its significant regulations aiming to protect the environment and decrease climate pollution. If successful, the repeal could strip away the federal government’s most powerful way to control the country’s planet-warming pollution and fight climate change.

The text of the administration’s proposal to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding said that while greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the atmosphere, that rise has been “driven primarily by increased emissions from foreign sources,” and has happened “without producing the degree of adverse impacts to public health and welfare in the United States that the EPA anticipated in the 2009 Endangerment Finding.”

The US is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and historically has emitted more planet-warming pollution than any other country. Many rigorous scientific findings since 2009 have showed both climate pollution and its warming effects are not just harming public health but killing people outright.

In the nearly 16 years since the EPA first issued the Supreme Court-ordered endangerment finding, the world has warmed an additional 0.45 degrees Celsius (or 0.81 degrees Fahrenheit) to 1.4 degrees Celsius, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather.

“Both the scientific certainty around climate change and evidence of the dangers it is causing have grown stronger since 2009,” Hausfather said in an email. “There is no evidence that has emerged or been published in the scientific literature in the past 16 years that would in any way challenge the scientific basis of the 2009 endangerment finding.”

Pressed on whether he’s skeptical of the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are the overwhelming driver of man-made climate change, Zeldin said, “That might be your way to try to twist my words.”

The EPA is in a public comment period on its proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles, since they stem from the 2009 finding.

“We’re going through a public comment period. We want to make the right decision afterwards. But for people who want to sum up the 2009 endangerment finding as if they study carbon dioxide as an endangerment on human health, they did not do that,” Zeldin told CNN.

Asked whether the EPA should have a role in trying to combat climate change, Zeldin said that the Supreme Court “made it very clear that I have to follow the law.”

“I have to follow the plain language of the law, and I can’t get creative. So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion. The Supreme Court has made it very clear that that is not what is a power that I have,” he said, adding that drawing up such a regulation should be left to Congress.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm Solar energy is also boosting farm finances.
The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits.
Renewable energy also powers rural economies Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.
On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.","ONLINE — Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics – dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries – and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.",https://www.morningagclips.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/johanna-montoya-OZ-r0tEnW6M-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 16:00:47.996840

It is expected to produce 1.1 GW of solar power and be fitted with 200 MWh of battery storage once complete.","Egypt has been steadily increasing its renewable energy capacity in recent years in a bid to enhance its energy security. By 2024, Egypt had a total installed capacity of renewable energy of almost 7.8 GW. While its hydropower segment has remained stable at around 2.8 GW since 2018, it has significantly expanded its wind and solar energy sectors. Egypt’s solar energy capacity increased from 35 MW in 2012 to almost 2.6 GW in 2024, with several more large-scale solar projects currently under development. The North African country has also invested significantly in enhancing energy access in rural areas by expanding its off-grid renewable capacity.

Egypt has contended with severe energy shortages in recent years, as it has fallen short on its natural gas production targets, particularly at its giant Zohr offshore gas field, which has hit its economy hard. This has led the government to pursue a more diversified energy mix to boost the country’s energy security. To do this, Egypt has opened its doors to international investment in the energy sector.

Egypt’s government aims to mobilise more than $10 billion in private investment for renewable energy, including wind and solar power production, to source 42 percent of the country’s energy from renewables by 2030. However, it is currently a long way from achieving this target, having attracted a reported $4 billion in investment to date. To encourage greater investment in its green energy sector, the government is now offering tax breaks, free land, cash rebates, and other incentives to investors. However, greater efforts to improve the country’s investment and energy policies could spur investment in the sector.

In May, Egypt’s Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy selected four companies to operate under the country’s newly adopted private-to-private (P2P) power agreement model. This will allow private energy producers to generate and sell electricity directly to industrial consumers. The selected projects have a combined power capacity of 400 MW and an investment total of $388 million.

Each company will now be permitted to construct its own green energy power plant to supply industry with power, while paying a transmission fee to the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC). The awardees are Neptune Energy, AMEA Power, TAQA PV and ENARA. Egypt’s Energy Minister Mahmoud Esmat said the move aligns with the government’s Electricity Law, which aims to open the market to competition, enhance efficiency, and attract private investment.

Also in May, Egypt and Germany signed a $138.7 million financial cooperation agreement to boost wind energy development and inclusive technical education. The deal includes $101 million for the interconnection of the ACWA Power 1 and 2 wind farms and $37.6 million in grants to establish 25 training centres across Egypt. ACWA Power 1 and 2 are expected to produce 1.1 GW of clean electricity as part of Egypt’s Noufi green investment initiative, while the education centres will provide training to improve workforce skills in line with the government’s economic priorities.

Then, in July, the U.K. development bank British International Investment (BII) announced an investment of more than $300 million to support the development of two renewable energy projects in Egypt – a new 1.1 GW Gulf of Suez Wind Farm and the 1.1 GW Obelisk integrated solar and battery storage project with Scatec. The $1.2 billion Gulf of Suez Wind Farm is Africa’s biggest onshore wind development to date, and is expected to generate 4,500 GWh of clean power annually, helping to reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tonnes a year. Egypt has agreed on a total of $704 million in debt financing with a consortium of development finance institutions to fund the project.

Meanwhile, Obelisk, Egypt’s first integrated solar PV and battery energy storage system, which is expected to cost $479.1 million, will receive financial support from Norway’s Scatec, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the African Development Bank (AfDB). It is expected to produce 1.1 GW of solar power and be fitted with 200 MWh of battery storage once complete.

Egypt’s Minister of Planning, Economic Development and International Cooperation, Rania Al-Mashat, said, “the Obelisk solar project is another important milestone for Egypt under the energy pillar of the Nexus of Water, Food, and Energy programme, which has since its launch in November 2022 at COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh delivered 4.2 GW of privately financed renewable energy investments, worth about $4 billion.” Al-Mashat added, “The goal of NWFE’s energy pillar is to add 10 GW of renewable energy capacity with investments of approximately $10 billion, and phase out 5 GW of fossil fuel power generation by 2030.”

After several years of severe energy shortages, Egypt is working with private and international partners to develop a strong renewable energy sector that will boost the North African country’s energy security for years to come. New solar and wind capacity, as well as its well-established hydropower sector, will help Egypt to transition away from a reliance on fossil fuels to move to green alternatives, as well as expand energy access across the country.

As the world pivots toward electric vehicles (EVs), Ford's 2025–2030 strategy is a masterclass in balancing bold electrification with pragmatic financial discipline. For patient investors, the company's progress in EV innovation, cost optimization, and regulatory alignment presents a compelling case for long-term value creation.

Strategic Reinvention: Ford's EV Pivot and Operational Overhaul

Ford's recent investments in EV infrastructure and battery technology are reshaping its competitive position. The company's $50 billion EV investment through 2026—a sum equivalent to 40% of its current market cap—is not just a bet on the future; it's a recalibration of its entire business model. Key initiatives include:

- Battery Production Leadership: With the BlueOval Battery Park in Marshall, Michigan, set to produce LFP batteries starting in 2026, Ford is securing access to one of the most cost-effective and durable battery chemistries. This move qualifies the company for Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits while reducing dependency on global supply chains.

- Product Streamlining: By consolidating body styles per platform and prioritizing high-volume models like the F-150 Lightning and E-Transit, Ford is optimizing costs. A new electric commercial van (2026) and two advanced EV pickups (2027) will further diversify its portfolio without overextending R&D budgets.

- Partnerships for Resilience: Collaborations with Google's Team Upshift and Jiangling Motors are accelerating software-driven services (e.g., predictive maintenance) and global EV architecture development. Meanwhile, the BlueOval SK joint venture ensures a steady supply of battery cells for critical models.

Financial Turnaround: From Breakeven to Profitability

Ford's EV division, while still unprofitable, is on a clear path to breakeven. In Q1 2025, losses narrowed to $849 million, down from $1.3 billion in Q1 2024. Analysts project margins will improve from -12% today to breakeven by 2026, driven by scaling production of the F-150 Lightning (150,000 units/year) and Mustang Mach-E (100,000 units/year).

The company's overall debt-to-EBITDA ratio (3.6x) remains elevated, but Ford is aggressively reducing leverage. By 2025, it aims to cut this to below 3.0x, supported by $1 billion in annual cost savings from operational efficiencies and inventory management. Meanwhile, its traditional ICE segment—anchored by the F-Series (52% of profits and 37% market share)—provides a stable cash flow buffer during the EV transition.

Technical Indicators and Price Projections: A Cautious Bull Case

While Ford's stock has faced short-term volatility (3.68% 30-day volatility, RSI at 44.32), longer-term technical indicators suggest a golden cross formation. The 50-week moving average ($13.65) and 200-week moving average ($14.10) are converging, historically signaling a 23% average gain over 12 months. Key resistance levels at $16.45 and $20.25 could become catalysts if the company meets production targets or secures IRA credits.

Analyst price targets are mixed but increasingly bullish. 24/7 Wall Street projects $13.23 in 2025 (17% upside) and $15.75 by 2030 (56% upside). These forecasts hinge on Ford's ability to scale EV production, reduce battery costs, and capitalize on hybrid demand—a strategy that has already boosted hybrid sales by 27% in Q2 2025.

Risk Mitigation: Navigating Volatility with Resilience

Ford's risk management strategies are equally robust. By shifting battery production to the U.S., it's insulating itself from geopolitical supply chain shocks and maximizing IRA tax credits. Hybrid models (e.g., F-150 Hybrid) act as a transitional revenue stream, ensuring profitability even as EV infrastructure lags. Additionally, tariff rerouting and domestic production investments (e.g., BlueOval City in Tennessee) are reducing exposure to inflation and trade wars.

Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Buy with Caution

For investors with a 5–10 year horizon, Ford offers a rare combination of:

1. Strategic Momentum: A clear, executable plan to dominate the U.S. EV market with high-volume, high-margin products.

2. Financial Prudence: Aggressive cost-cutting and debt reduction to balance the risks of R&D overruns.

3. Regulatory Tailwinds: IRA tax credits and domestic production incentives that could boost margins by 5–7% post-2026.

However, risks remain. Delays in EV production, supply chain bottlenecks, or underwhelming consumer adoption of hybrids could extend breakeven timelines. Investors should monitor Ford's Q3 2025 earnings and the August 11, 2025, product launch for signals of momentum.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 15:59:39.332824

Critics may argue that the Model 3's depreciation and insurance costs undermine its value.","The Tesla Model 3 has long been a symbol of the electric vehicle (EV) revolution. But as the federal EV tax credit—a cornerstone of its affordability—nears its end, investors and consumers alike face a pressing question: Is this once-ubiquitous EV still a prudent purchase in 2025? The answer lies in a careful analysis of total cost of ownership (TCO) and strategic timing before the tax credit vanishes on September 30, 2025.

The Vanishing Incentive: A Race Against Time

The federal tax credit, part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), has been a lifeline for EV adoption. For the Model 3, it offers up to $7,500 in savings—translatable to an immediate price reduction if the buyer meets income thresholds and the vehicle is assembled in North America. However, this incentive is set to expire under the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), a 2025 tax reform bill championed by President Donald Trump. The deadline is concrete: vehicles delivered after September 30, 2025, will no longer qualify.

For buyers, this creates a narrow window of opportunity. Tesla's pricing strategy has historically adapted to such transitions—lowering costs post-credit expiration to offset losses. Yet with margins already tightening and competition from rivals like Rivian and Hyundai intensifying, there is no guarantee of further discounts. Acting before the end of September 2025 is not just advisable; it is imperative for those seeking to lock in the maximum financial benefit.

Total Cost of Ownership: The Long Game

While the tax credit's expiration is urgent, it is not the only factor. The Model 3's TCO remains compelling, even after the credit phases out. Here's how it stacks up against traditional gasoline vehicles:

Fuel Savings: At $0.05 per mile for home charging (vs. $0.13 for gas), the Model 3 costs just $518 annually for 15,000 miles driven. Even with public charging, the cost per mile remains 38–58% lower.

Maintenance Costs: Over five years, the Model 3 requires just $1,200 in maintenance—compared to $4,200 for a gasoline sedan. EVs have fewer moving parts, and regenerative braking minimizes wear on critical components.

Insurance: At $1,712 annually, Model 3 premiums are 15% higher than those for comparable gas cars. However, insurers are beginning to offer EV-specific discounts, which could narrow this gap.

Depreciation: The Model 3 retains 41% of its value after five years, a middling performance in the luxury segment but still better than most gas-powered competitors.

When combined with the tax credit, the Model 3's net savings over seven years reach $8,200, with a break-even point of just 3.2 years for the Long Range variant. Post-credit, the break-even period extends to 4.8 years, yet the savings remain robust—especially in regions with low electricity rates, such as Washington (up to $12,000 in seven years).

Strategic Timing and Market Dynamics

The Model 3's future is intertwined with broader market forces. Tesla's share price, which has fluctuated wildly over the past three years, reflects investor concerns about profitability and competition. A chart would reveal a pattern of volatility, with dips during supply chain disruptions and rallies when production targets are met.

However, the stock's performance is not the only metric. Tesla's ability to innovate—such as its recent advancements in battery technology and AI-driven Autopilot—suggests long-term resilience. For investors, the Model 3's enduring appeal lies in its role as a gateway product for Tesla's ecosystem, which includes software subscriptions, charging networks, and home energy solutions.

Investment Advice: Act Now, But Think Ahead

For consumers, the calculus is clear: purchase a Model 3 before the tax credit expires to maximize savings. Even if Tesla's pricing strategy shifts post-September 2025, the upfront discount secured now will be difficult to replicate. For investors, the Model 3's continued dominance in the EV market—despite slowing growth—signals a durable product line. However, the sector's long-term success depends on Tesla's ability to maintain its lead in software and battery technology.

Critics may argue that the Model 3's depreciation and insurance costs undermine its value. Yet these are mitigated by the vehicle's low fuel and maintenance expenses. In a world increasingly focused on sustainability and cost efficiency, the Model 3 remains a compelling proposition—provided buyers act swiftly.

— Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia

BANGOR, ME, UNITED STATES, August 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Suncovia, a leading advocate for equitable clean energy solutions, has expressed deep concern over the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on July 4, 2025. With its passing, the federal 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D) is officially ending on December 31, 2025. The legislation abruptly stops the long-standing tax credit without a phase-out period — creating a narrow and urgent window for homeowners to take advantage of this historic incentive.

Suncovia, a leading force in solar project development and clean energy financing, is calling on homeowners, contractors, and developers to move quickly. This tax credit sunset is one of the most consequential energy policy shifts in over a decade.

“This change dramatically shortens the planning horizon for families considering solar,” said Craig Mattson, CEO of Suncovia. “If you're thinking about going solar, the time to act is now — not next year.”

WHAT HOMEOWNERS NEED TO KNOW:

DECEMBER 31, 2025 IS A HARD DEADLINE

To qualify for the 30% Residential Clean Energy Credit, solar systems must be fully installed and operational by the end of 2025 — no extensions, no carryovers.

THERE IS NO PHASE-DOWN — NO GRACE PERIOD

Contrary to the Inflation Reduction Act’s original plan for a gradual wind-down through 2034, this legislation cuts the credit off entirely after 2025.

COMMERCIAL SOLAR CREDIT REMAINS, BUT WITH NEW DATES

The 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for commercial and utility-scale projects still stands but now includes new rules: projects must start by July 4, 2026, and be operational by December 31, 2027, to remain eligible.

IMPACTS FOR HOMEOWNERS AND THE INDUSTRY:

The end of the federal residential solar tax credit could significantly impact both consumers and the broader solar market. For homeowners, the loss of the 30% credit may result in noticeably higher upfront costs for solar installations. Without the federal incentive, many may experience longer return-on-investment timelines beginning in 2026, which could dampen enthusiasm and delay decision-making.

Additionally, the compressed deadline is expected to create logistical challenges. As the end-of-year deadline approaches, installers may become overbooked, and material availability could tighten. These bottlenecks could prevent some homeowners from completing their installations in time to qualify for the credit.

From an industry perspective, the sudden removal of the residential incentive is likely to cause market disruption. The reduced demand could lead to job losses, particularly among smaller solar contractors and residential-focused providers. This shift may also slow the overall pace of solar adoption, just as the U.S. seeks to solidify its leadership in the global clean energy transition.

Suncovia remains committed to making clean energy accessible. In response to these changes, the company is expanding its support for residential installations through Q4 2025. The company is also closely monitoring legislative activity and working with industry partners and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) to advocate for long-term policies that support clean energy adoption and economic resilience.

Suncovia strongly encourages homeowners to act now, before it’s too late. Homeowners should schedule their solar evaluations, secure permits, and finalize installations well before year-end to ensure eligibility for the 30% tax credit.

“This is the last full year for homeowners to take advantage of the most generous solar incentive in U.S. history,” added Craig Mattson. “We don’t want anyone to miss out due to delays or misinformation.”

The Westminster-based utility is in the process of joining the Southwest Power Pool’s regional transmission organization.","Despite concerns from its staff, consumer and conservation groups, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission has endorsed a plan by Xcel Energy to join a new regional marketplace for wholesale electricity.

Two of the three PUC members voiced support in a hearing Wednesday for Xcel’s application to join the Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+, a so-called day-ahead market being formed by the Arkansas-based transmission organization and about 30 organizations.

The commission will issue a written order.

The new marketplace will allow Xcel and other utilities to buy power a day ahead, aimed at keeping electricity flowing more efficiently and cost-effectively. Xcel’s joining a day-ahead market is considered a step toward moving to an organized wholesale market, which a state law requires Colorado transmission utilities to do by 2030. The motivation is to coordinate resources across the region, get more renewable energy on the grid to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet growing demands for electricity.

However, Megan Gilman, the commissioner who opposed Xcel’s application, contended the utility failed to show, as required by PUC rules, that the benefits of joining Markets+ outweighed the costs. She voiced concerns that the cost of joining the day-ahead market, seen as a temporary step, could delay or derail Xcel’s move to an organized wholesale market.

An organized wholesale market is a centrally managed organization that facilitates the buying and selling of electricity and other services across a region. A 2021 PUC report said utilities’ full participation in that kind of market or a regional transmission organization could produce savings of $230 million annually.

About 60% of the nation’s electric power supply is managed by regional organizations, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, most of that is in the East.

PUC Chairman Eric Blank said he is focused on the potential of saving millions of dollars per year as the purchase and transmission of power become more coordinated across the region.

“For me, incurring these small losses in the near term potentially creates an opportunity to save orders of magnitude more per year,” Blank said. “Although we’re a long, long way from realizing this level of savings, it seems worth trying to me.”

But Gilman noted the law requiring transmission utilities to eventually join a more centralized market allows for waivers. She said Xcel could cite the costs of joining the day-ahead market as a reason for seeking a waiver.

“The company expressed intent to hold that against the economics of joining a (regional transmission organization),” Gilman said.

Xcel, Colorado’s largest electricity provider, said in documents filed with the PUC that the costs of participating in Markets+ will include $2 million for the first phase of starting the organization; $14 million annually for operations for the first five years, then $10 million per year; and an estimated $13 million to $15 million for Xcel to integrate its systems with the marketplace.

The conservation group Western Resource Advocates said in a statement filed in the case that testimony showed Xcel’s costs would exceed net benefits by $30 million through 2032 and cumulative benefits wouldn’t surpass cumulative costs until 2039. For the company’s customers to reap any benefits, Xcel would have to stay in Markets+ through 2038, the group said.

“This means the company would also presumably have to delay the 2030 requirement to join an (organized wholesale market) by nine years,” Western Resource Advocates said.

The PUC staff said Xcel’s application didn’t meet the requirement that joining the marketplace is in the public interest because the company couldn’t show that the expected benefits would outweigh the costs. The staff noted that Xcel witnesses conceded during a hearing that joining Markets+ and recovering the costs for technology upgrades “will result in increased production costs through at least 2038.”

Considering the costs, staffers said it would be reasonable for the commission to deny the application. If the application is approved, the staff recommended monitoring the costs, reliability of the market and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to determine whether Xcel’s continued participation in the marketplace would be warranted.

In the public interest?

“We believe this decision was not in the best interests of ratepayers, grid reliability, or the state’s clean energy goals. And legally, the decision does not appear to be based on the law or the Commission’s own rules, and we will be asking the Commission to reconsider,” Brian Turner, regulatory director at Advanced Energy United, said in an email.

The industry group believes a better path for Xcel Energy would be to join Extended Day-Ahead Market, or EDAM, which is operated by the California Independent System Operator. The organization manages the operation of the electricity transmission grid across California and is also involved in a marketplace across 11 Western states.

The extended day-ahead market is set to launch in 2026, according to the California operator’s website. A report by the Environmental Defense Fund in June said Xcel Energy could save an average of $13.2 million a year if it joined EDAM instead of the Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+. One reason is more availability of renewable energy.

Turner said a bill is moving through the California legislature that would transfer the governing structure of the California Independent System Operator to a separate organization. The current board of directors is appointed by the California governor, but that would change if the legislation passes.

Joining forces with the California operator would give Xcel Energy broader access to cleaner forms of energy, Turner added.

Blank said the push by some parties to steer Xcel Energy to EDAM rather than the other marketplace would make integrating systems across Colorado difficult. Others suggested that Xcel forego participating in a day-ahead market altogether and plan for joining a regional organization.

Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association is Colorado’s second-largest electricity provider. The Westminster-based utility is in the process of joining the Southwest Power Pool’s regional transmission organization.

While solar energy is by far more mainstream and accessible as a source of renewable power — it's much more practical to install a solar panel in your home than a turbine — setting aside land and resources for wind farms can stabilize regional power grids and drive down home energy costs while reducing the carbon pollution generated by the energy sector.

Since human-induced carbon pollution is the leading cause of our planet's rising temperatures, implementing more clean energy solutions is key to mitigating some of the repercussions of climate change, from unstable weather patterns to food and water scarcities.

Coal Mine Solar Conversion Could Unlock 300GW of Clean Energy by 2030

A new report from Global Energy Monitor (GEM) highlights a powerful opportunity: coal mine solar conversion. Specifically, by turning closed or soon-to-close coal mines into solar energy parks, the world could gain up to 300 GW of new solar capacity by 2030. To put that into perspective, that’s enough electricity to power a country the size of Germany, according to The Guardian.

Why coal mine solar conversion makes sense

First and foremost, there’s no land-use conflict. Coal mines are already cleared, flat, and often close to grid connections. Therefore, they are ideal for renewable energy projects without competing with agriculture or protected areas.

In addition, the clean energy boost is substantial. If fully developed, these sites could increase global solar power capacity by 15%, making a major contribution to global climate goals. (source: pv-magazine.com)

Moreover, this transition presents major employment opportunities. It could create 260,000 permanent jobs and another 320,000 construction jobs – far surpassing the number of coal jobs expected to be lost by 2035 (source: The Guardian).

Notably, countries like China, the United States, Australia, India, and Indonesia are especially well-positioned to benefit from this shift (source: renewableinstitute.org), thanks to their large coal mine footprints and strong solar potential.

Where coal mine solar conversion is already underway

Importantly, the idea isn’t just theoretical. In China, over 90 solar projects are already up and running on former coal mine sites, with a combined capacity of 14 GW – and another 9 GW in the pipeline (source: euronews.com). This demonstrates the viability of large-scale coal-to-solar transformation.

Europe is moving in a similar direction. Projects are under development in countries like Greece, Germany, and across the Western Balkans, where former lignite mines are being repurposed for solar (source: Balkan Green Energy News).

What are the challenges?

However, transforming old coal mines isn’t always simple. Issues such as soil pollution, land instability, and unclear land rights can delay progress or increase costs (source: Green Ubuntu). These obstacles, while real, are not insurmountable. Nonetheless, experts believe that the long-term benefits – clean energy, land recovery, and jobs – far outweigh the risks (source: renewableinstitute.org). As a result, many stakeholders continue to advocate for these conversions.

Why coal mine solar conversion is a win-win

This solution offers a rare triple win:

Restores land damaged by coal extraction.

Generates clean energy at large scale.

Creates new green jobs in affected regions.

As Global Energy Monitor puts it, this is a “perfect match” between land restoration, renewable energy expansion, and economic recovery (source: Ecowatch).

The global energy transition is seen as a race toward renewables, batteries, and smart grids. Yet even the best technologies can fail without scalable delivery systems. Projects often stall due to execution issues — blown budgets, unrealistic timelines, logistical gaps, or geopolitical hurdles — not faulty technology.

In this mission-critical space between innovation and implementation lies a discipline that rarely makes headlines: planning engineering. Valentin George Cretu has built a career with the help of this approach.

With over two decades of global experience in mechanical engineering, project controls, and portfolio planning, he has managed infrastructure and energy megaprojects from bid to commissioning in some of the most complex environments on the planet. A Certified Cost Engineer and a member of AACE International and the Association of Planning Engineers, Valentin has led projects across Russia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Argentina, the U.S., and France. He is also the author of Planning Engineering: Principles and Memories, a professional reflection on the human and technical dimensions of his field.

But what does that mean for the future of energy? In Cretu’s view, planning isn’t just a supporting function — it’s a form of infrastructure itself. One that determines whether energy innovations reach the grid, the refinery, or the export terminal.

When Energy Projects Fail, Planning Is Often the Missing Piece

Breakthroughs in renewables and smart grids grab headlines and funding, but energy transitions fail without disciplined execution. Without risk awareness, realistic timelines, and cost control, even the most ambitious projects stall or collapse.

As he reflected in his book, “Planning in engineering is the conceptual journey from nothing to something. At its core, it blends art and science—art to envision the goal, and science to transform that vision into a structured plan that convinces you, and others, it can be achieved.”

During his work as Planning Manager on the TotalEnergies-led Mozambique LNG project, he coordinated the integrated project schedule across international contractors, multiple time zones, and unpredictable local conditions. To do it successfully, he designed and maintained risk-adjusted progress measurement systems and cost control mechanisms that allowed the project to stay aligned with budget expectations, even amid volatility.

This strategic groundwork resulted in securing the Final Investment Decision, which unlocked a $5 billion U.S. export contract and led to the creation of over 30,000 jobs globally, including more than 16,000 in the United States. He also served as a crucial liaison with high-level stakeholders, from government ministries to LNG buyers and lenders, translating complex technical realities into actionable decisions.

How Planning Future-Proofs Complex Projects

Energy infrastructure must last decades. True resilience comes from rigorous planning, ensuring systems endure long after the original teams move on.

At TotalEnergies’ Mozambique LNG project, Cretu didn’t just build schedules. He built systems that would sustain execution through volatility — and continue supporting performance long after the initial handover. His framework included risk-adjusted progress measurement, integrated cost tracking, and scenario-based scheduling — tools designed not just for day-to-day control, but for long-term clarity.

“You can’t manage a project of that scale by reacting,” says Cretu. “You need to build in the ability to self-correct — like setting the right autopilot before turbulence hits.”

The planning structure he implemented made it possible to onboard new contractors, adjust to evolving regulatory frameworks, and maintain alignment across stakeholders — even amid geopolitical uncertainty. It wasn’t a single act of recovery, but a sustained operational rhythm grounded in foresight.

Planning Synchronizes Global Execution

Modern energy projects don’t happen in one place. They are global undertakings engineered in one region, fabricated in another, and assembled in a third. Without careful coordination, complexity quickly turns into chaos.

Cretu saw this as Project Controls Lead on ExxonMobil’s Sakhalin-2, managing work across three continents. As one of the largest and most logistically complex offshore oil and gas developments in the Russian Far East, the project involved massive modular construction and coordination between global teams. Engineering was based in Houston, fabrication occurred at the DSME yard in South Korea, and the final hook-up took place in Russia’s remote Far East.

“I felt like a conductor,” he says, “bringing together engineers in Texas, welders in South Korea, and offshore crews in the middle of nowhere in Russia — people with completely different ways of working, thinking, even seeing time. My job was to create a rhythm everyone could move to. And when you see these different worlds align around a shared outcome, it’s an incredible feeling.”

Managing this required Cretu to build and maintain detailed execution plans that factored in intercontinental logistics, seasonal weather constraints, shipping timelines, and contractor coordination across languages and legal systems.

Thanks to this planning framework, massive offshore modules were fabricated and delivered on time and within scope — a rare achievement for projects of this scale and complexity. His work enabled smooth commissioning and helped the project meet its key production targets.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/8943001.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 16:59:28.987635

This plant was once known for its relentless solar generation activity. In the secret location, Mojave was recently repurposed to explore better ways of generating solar energy. In this article, we’ll discuss how this transformation came to be, the legacy, and the future goals of this intuitive plant.

Overview of Ivanpah: the idea that brought the solar factory to life

If you grab a piece of a world map and search for the location of the Ivanpah solar plant, you will find that the prestigious company used to be associated with heavy solar generation. It is found in San Bernardino County, near the California-Nevada border. The idea was simple: utilizing the power of concentrated solar power (CSP) technology to concentrate sunlight and generate huge amounts of heat energy.

In the year 2014, when the solar plant fully resumed operations, it was the largest solar thermal plant in the world, carving its name into the fabric of solar infrastructural ingenuity. A project of this scale piqued the interest of several private individuals but also caught the attention of the Department of Energy (DOE). This led to an investment of $1.6 billion in loan agreements with the department. A major key player here is the NRG group, who also contributed about $300 million to the initiative.

Ivanpah solar plant: solar energy generation on steroids

The picture behind this solar plant is simple; it involves utilizing heliostats to generate solar energy on a massive scale. To get a clearer picture, these heliostats are not miniature in size or weight; in fact, their size can be compared to a weighted gate. Getting heliostats of this size and positioning them at the best angle for solar energy generation results in large amounts of heat energy being generated toward tall structures. These tall structures have instruments within them capable of converting water into steam and eventually generating electricity.

The direct beneficiaries of such an innovative initiative are the larger community and rural areas. About 130,000+ homes, to be exact. A direct implication of the initiative is the reduction or complete elimination of carbon emissions into the atmosphere, which causes all sorts of problems for our ozone layer. This problem is much more prominent when it comes to fossil fuel extraction.

The transition from fossil to renewable: how feasible is it?

Regardless of the huge efficiency upgrade while working with CSP systems, a predictable bottleneck the technology faces is the need for an uninterrupted supply of sunlight. While technology can be quite perfect when it’s being worked upon, in the real world, weather conditions are subject to fluctuations. With time, the push for a better solar system became evident because of a growing need to iterate and satisfy.

The Ivanpah solar plant also sparked environmental debate. While it reduced reliance on fossil fuels, the plant caused unintended harm to local wildlife. Birds flying into the concentrated beams were reportedly scorched mid-air—earning the nickname “streamers”—and local desert tortoise populations were disrupted during construction.

Still, Ivanpah’s solar plant legacy is complex. It pushed boundaries, raised critical questions about energy trade-offs, and served as a testing ground for large-scale renewable infrastructure.

The idea behind Ivanpah’s subtle transformation to more efficient methods of solar energy generation is quite simple: bridging the gap between traditional solar energy conversion and rural implementation.

Ivanpah’s story is not just one of innovation but of transformation—of land, technology, and intention. What began as a photovoltaic exploration project evolved into a shimmering beacon of solar potential. And now, as it prepares for partial closure and reinvention, the plant reflects something deeper than sunlight: our changing relationship with the earth beneath us and the energy above.

Hired in May, Hannah Davis will help provide and connect residents to clean energy resources.
“This grant is really unique in that we are working to support renters, landlords, income-qualified folks — anyone who hasn’t taken advantage of Mass Save energy incentives,” said Davis.
In 2024, Mass Save installed 40,000 heat pumps and weatherized more than 55,000 homes in Massachusetts, according to its 2024 annual report.
Additionally, energy-efficient programs implemented by the sponsors of Mass Save provided customers with more than $961 million in program incentives in the same year.","Northampton, Easthampton and Westhampton have joined forces by hiring an energy advocate through grant funding who will help bolster options and resources for homeowners, business owners and landlords hoping to install clean energy systems.

Hired in May, Hannah Davis will help provide and connect residents to clean energy resources. The three communities are among 58 in the state that were selected to join the 2025 to 2027 Mass Save Community First Partnership, which aims to bring expanded energy services through the help of grant funding.

The three-year, $146,200 grant will fund the position and costs associated with it.

“This grant is really unique in that we are working to support renters, landlords, income-qualified folks — anyone who hasn’t taken advantage of Mass Save energy incentives,” said Davis. “A lot of people tend to think this program is only for high-earning homeowners and that’s not true at all. We’re really trying to get the word out.”

Mass Save is a program that represents the services and resources provided by multiple energy companies with the goal of saving energy for Massachusetts residents, businesses and communities. The collective mission is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The new hire is a part of the local communities’ larger effort to reduce energy use, lower costs, and improve the comfort and health of homes and buildings by offering community members no-cost energy assessments. The assessments identify opportunities for energy savings through insulation, weatherization, and high-efficiency heating and cooling upgrades, including heat pumps.

Davis explained there are three components to a home energy assessment. They assess the need for energy-saving devices, health and safety of heating systems, and potential for weatherization and heating improvements.

“It takes some organizing, convincing and connecting people to all of these resources,” said Ben Weil, director of Climate Action & Project Administration in Northampton. “That is some intensive work that we’re asking Hannah to do, but the payoff is really big because once you do it, you serve a lot of people.”

Davis will work with Mass Save sponsors Berkshire Gas, Eversource and National Grid, who will focus on reaching renters, landlords, non-English speakers, low- and moderate-income households, and small businesses.

In 2024, Mass Save installed 40,000 heat pumps and weatherized more than 55,000 homes in Massachusetts, according to its 2024 annual report. Additionally, energy-efficient programs implemented by the sponsors of Mass Save provided customers with more than $961 million in program incentives in the same year. Homeowners can save an average of 15% on heating and cooling costs, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

“The value of this role is it will provide outreach to the residents of the three towns with the value of saving energy and potential to save money through the Mass Save grant,” said Westhampton Town Coordinator Douglas Finn.

Davis will host drop-in hours for residents on the second Tuesday of each month at the Easthampton Public Library, 9 Park St., from 6 to 7 p.m.

On Thursday at 6 p.m., there will be a tabling at Brewster Court in Northampton, between the E.J. Gare Parking Garage and Northampton Brewery. Additionally, Davis will attend and host more events for each town in the coming months.

“The program is layered with a bunch of other services we are trying to put together so that residents of our cities have good access to all the resources they need to make good decisions,” said Weil. “They can find the heat pump and weatherization services that are right for their house.”

Davis graduated from Smith College in 2020 with a degree in environmental science, working in municipal government since. They emphasized how exciting it is to be able to work in a position that combines their education with the ability to do community outreach.

“I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to reach out to the community and build those connections,” said Davis. “I’m going to be working to build partnerships, and expand outreach and access to energy efficiency programs.”

So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion.","(CNN) — Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin on Sunday defended the Trump administration’s move to repeal the so-called endangerment finding that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health.

“To reach the 2009 endangerment finding, they relied on the most pessimistic views of the science. The great news is that a lot of the pessimistic views of the science in 2009 that was being assumed ended up not panning out,” Zeldin said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We can rely on 2025 facts as opposed to 2009 bad assumptions.”

The 2009 scientific finding that human-caused climate change endangers human health and safety, which has served as EPA’s basis for many of its significant regulations aiming to protect the environment and decrease climate pollution. If successful, the repeal could strip away the federal government’s most powerful way to control the country’s planet-warming pollution and fight climate change.

The text of the administration’s proposal to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding said that while greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise in the atmosphere, that rise has been “driven primarily by increased emissions from foreign sources,” and has happened “without producing the degree of adverse impacts to public health and welfare in the United States that the EPA anticipated in the 2009 Endangerment Finding.”

The US is the world’s second largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and historically has emitted more planet-warming pollution than any other country. Many rigorous scientific findings since 2009 have showed both climate pollution and its warming effects are not just harming public health but killing people outright.

In the nearly 16 years since the EPA first issued the Supreme Court-ordered endangerment finding, the world has warmed an additional 0.45 degrees Celsius (or 0.81 degrees Fahrenheit) to 1.4 degrees Celsius, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather.

“Both the scientific certainty around climate change and evidence of the dangers it is causing have grown stronger since 2009,” Hausfather said in an email. “There is no evidence that has emerged or been published in the scientific literature in the past 16 years that would in any way challenge the scientific basis of the 2009 endangerment finding.”

Pressed on whether he’s skeptical of the scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions are the overwhelming driver of man-made climate change, Zeldin said, “That might be your way to try to twist my words.”

The EPA is in a public comment period on its proposal to repeal all greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles, since they stem from the 2009 finding.

“We’re going through a public comment period. We want to make the right decision afterwards. But for people who want to sum up the 2009 endangerment finding as if they study carbon dioxide as an endangerment on human health, they did not do that,” Zeldin told CNN.

Asked whether the EPA should have a role in trying to combat climate change, Zeldin said that the Supreme Court “made it very clear that I have to follow the law.”

“I have to follow the plain language of the law, and I can’t get creative. So when you read through the 2009 endangerment finding, they say that where there’s silence in the law, there’s gaps that I should just be interpreting that as my own discretion. The Supreme Court has made it very clear that that is not what is a power that I have,” he said, adding that drawing up such a regulation should be left to Congress.",https://CNNWIRE.images.worldnow.com/images/26672871_G.jpg?lastEditedDate=1754226044000,N,,2025-08-03 16:00:00.596051

For decades, the public perception of nuclear power has been extremely poor in the U.S, following three nuclear disasters at Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island.
These incidents have led international and national nuclear regulators to employ stringent safety standards and assess new nuclear projects thoroughly before approval.
In recent years, largely thanks to the strict regulations and the safe running of nuclear power plants around the world for several decades, public perception has once again shifted in favour of nuclear power.
The NRC has since responded to Trump’s recent executive orders concerning nuclear power.","The President of the United States, Donald Trump, is betting big on nuclear power and aims to fast-track projects to prepare for the massive increase in electricity demand over the next decade. However, experts fear that his plans to accelerate project development could compromise safety standards, particularly as the independent U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission comes under threat.

In May, the Trump administration announced a target to deploy 300 GW of net new nuclear capacity by 2050 to quadruple domestic nuclear power, as well as to begin construction on 10 large reactors by 2030 and expand domestic nuclear fuel production. Trump signed three executive orders to support these aims: Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; Deployment of Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security; and Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy.

Trump’s orders establish arbitrary deadlines for decisions on construction permits and operating licenses, even for new designs that have not yet been assessed; demand a review of all NRC regulations within 18 months; and allow for the construction of nuclear reactors on federal lands without NRC review.

While deploying more nuclear power could help the U.S. respond to the rising domestic electricity demand, there are widespread concerns that President Trump’s rapid approval of new nuclear projects threatens to weaken the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), which assesses projects for health and safety and ensures reactors operate securely. The objective of Trump’s executive orders is to reduce regulations and accelerate the approval of nuclear plants by overhauling the NRC.

Trump has said that he believes the NRC is too risk-averse and has blamed the agency for the how few nuclear plants have been constructed in the U.S. over the last 30 years. He stated in one executive order that the NRC is overly focused on protecting the public from “the most remote risks,” suggesting that such a cautious approach to approving nuclear facilities limits access to reliable electricity. During one press conference in July, Trump said, “We’ll be very safe, but we’ll be fast and safe,” about nuclear plant development. He added that his administration will get a “whole different group of people” to regulate the industry.

However, several former chairs from the NRC have told reporters that the prohibitive cost of building new nuclear plants is to blame for the slow sectoral development, rather than the strict safety standards of the agency. Just two new reactors have been constructed in the U.S. in the last three decades, both of which are at Plant Vogtle in Georgia. Building these reactors cost $18 billion more than originally anticipated and took seven years longer. Meanwhile, two reactors in South Carolina were cancelled in 2017 due to the higher-than-expected price of construction. The nuclear company Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy following several failings in the development of these projects.

For decades, the public perception of nuclear power has been extremely poor in the U.S, following three nuclear disasters at Chernobyl, Fukushima, and Three Mile Island. These incidents have led international and national nuclear regulators to employ stringent safety standards and assess new nuclear projects thoroughly before approval.

The NRC has overseen the sector for 50 years without a single civilian reactor radiation-related death. In recent years, largely thanks to the strict regulations and the safe running of nuclear power plants around the world for several decades, public perception has once again shifted in favour of nuclear power.

However, reducing the powers of the independent nuclear regulatory commission in the U.S. could undermine the safety standards of the industry and spur greater public backlash when developing new projects. In June, Trump fired the NRC chairman, Christopher Hanson, as part of his bid to take away authority from the agency. Hanson said that Trump terminated his role as chairman without cause, contrary to existing law and longstanding precedent regarding the removal of independent agency appointees.”

As part of the shake-up, Adam Blake, a Department of Government Efficiency representative, reportedly told the NRC’s chair that the agency will be expected to give “rubber-stamp” approval to new reactors tested by the departments of Energy or Defence, during a meeting in May.

The NRC has since responded to Trump’s recent executive orders concerning nuclear power. “The NRC is working quickly to implement the executive orders reforming the agency and modernising our regulatory and licensing processes,” said NRC spokesperson Maureen Conley. “We look forward to continuing to work with the administration, Department of Energy and Department of Defence on future nuclear programmes.”

Weakening the powers of the independent NRC to give greater control to the government’s Department of Energy and Defence undermines the stringent safety standards that were previously enforced for the development and running of nuclear plants. At worst, this could lead to another nuclear disaster, which could jeopardise the health, or even lives, of people across the U.S.

(Excerpts of United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ remarks on Climate Action ‘A Moment of Opportunity: Supercharging the Clean Energy Age’ on 22 July 2025.)","The headlines are dominated by a world in trouble. By conflict and climate chaos. By rising human suffering. By growing geo-political divides. But amid the turmoil, another story is being written. And its implications will be profound.

Throughout history, energy has shaped the destiny of humankind — from mastering fire, to harnessing steam, to splitting the atom. Now, we are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age.

Just follow the money. $2 trillion went into clean energy last year — that’s $800 billion more than fossil fuels, and up almost 70 percent in ten years. And new data released today from the International Renewable Energy Agency shows that solar — not so long ago four times the cost of fossil fuels — is now 41 percent cheaper. Offshore wind — 53 percent. And over 90 percent of new renewables worldwide produced electricity for less than the cheapest new fossil fuel alternative.

This is not just a shift in power. This is a shift in possibility. Yes, in repairing our relationship with the climate.

Already, the carbon emissions saved by solar and wind globally are almost equivalent to what the whole European Union produces in a year. But this transformation is fundamentally about energy security and people’s security. It’s about smart economics. Decent jobs, public health, advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. And delivering clean and affordable energy to everyone, everywhere.

Today, we are releasing a special report with the support of UN agencies and partners — the International Energy Agency, the IMF, IRENA, the OECD and the World Bank. The report shows how far we have come in the decade since the Paris Agreement sparked a clean energy revolution. And it highlights the vast benefits — and actions needed — to accelerate a just transition globally.

Renewables already nearly match fossil fuels in global installed power capacity. And that’s just the beginning. Last year, almost all the new power capacity built came from renewables. And every continent on Earth added more renewables capacity than fossil fuels. The clean energy future is no longer a promise. It’s a fact. No government. No industry. No special interest can stop it.

Of course, the fossil fuel lobby of some fossil fuel companies will try — and we know the lengths to which they will go. But I have never been more confident that they will fail — because we have passed the point of no return. For three powerful reasons.

First, market economics.

For decades, emissions and economic growth rose together. No more. In many advanced economies, emissions have peaked, but growth continues.

In 2023 alone, clean energy sectors drove 10 percent of global GDP growth. In India, 5 percent. The United States, 6 percent. China — a leader in the energy transition — 20 percent. And in the European Union, nearly 33 percent.

And clean energy sector jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs — employing almost 35 million people worldwide.

Even Texas — the heart of the American fossil fuel industry — now leads the US in renewables. Why? Because it makes economic sense.

And yet fossil fuels still enjoy a 9 to 1 advantage in consumption subsidies globally — a clear market distortion. Add to that the unaccounted costs of climate damages on people and planet — and the distortion is even greater. Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies — they are sabotaging them. Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking-in stranded assets. And missing the greatest economic opportunity of the 21st century.

Second — renewables are here to stay because they are the foundation of energy security and sovereignty.

Let’s be clear: The greatest threat to energy security today is in fossil fuels. They leave economies and people at the mercy of price shocks, supply disruptions, and geopolitical turmoil. Just look at Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. A war in Europe led to a global energy crisis. Oil and gas prices soared. Electricity and food bills followed.

In 2022, average households around the world saw energy costs jump 20 percent.

Modern and competitive economies need stable, affordable energy. Renewables offer both. There are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind. Renewables can put power — literally and figuratively — in the hands of people and governments. And almost every nation has enough sun, wind, or water to become energy self-sufficient.

Renewables mean real energy security. Real energy sovereignty. And real freedom from fossil-fuel volatility.

The third and final reason why there is no going back on renewables: Easy access.

You can’t build a coal plant in someone’s backyard. But you can deliver solar panels to the most remote village on earth. Solar and wind can be deployed faster, cheaper and more flexibly than fossil fuels ever could. And while nuclear will be part of the global energy mix, it can never fill the access gaps.

All of this is a game-changer for the hundreds of millions of people still living without electricity — most of them in Africa, a continent bursting with renewable potential. By 2040, Africa could generate 10 times more electricity than it needs — entirely from renewables. We are already seeing small-scale and off-grid renewable technologies lighting homes, and powering schools and businesses in remote areas.

And in places like Pakistan for example, people-power is fueling a solar surge — consumers are driving the clean energy boom.

The energy transition is unstoppable. But the transition is not yet fast enough or fair enough.

OECD countries and China account for 80 percent of renewable power capacity installed worldwide. Brazil and India make up nearly 10 percent. Africa — just 1.5 percent.

Fermi America has signed a memorandum of understanding with Hyundai Engineering & Construction (Hyundai E&C) to design and build the nuclear portion of a large-scale private energy infrastructure project aimed at powering next-generation artificial intelligence in Texas. The facility, called HyperGrid, will be built near Amarillo and developed in collaboration with the Texas Tech University system.

According to the plan, HyperGrid will be the first private campus in the United States to combine multiple energy sources simultaneously: the largest private nuclear complex in the country, the most powerful combined-cycle gas turbine power plant, plus solar panels, batteries, and an external power grid. Almost all of the electricity produced, approximately 1 GW, will be consumed directly on the data centers’ premises, without being fed into the general power grid.

The key component of the project is four Westinghouse AP1000 pressurized water reactors. On June 17, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a combined construction and operation license, which Fermi America called a record-breaking decision. Construction of the nuclear “island” is scheduled to begin next year, with the first reactor expected to be operational in 2032.

The memorandum provides for Hyundai E&C’s participation in all phases of the life cycle, from design and engineering planning to the signing of the equipment supply and construction (EPC) contract. The parties plan to complete the development of all work packages and sign the EPC agreement by the end of 2025. Fermi America co-founder Toby Neugebauer noted, “America can’t afford to be a hands-on player: we need experienced partners, and Hyundai has already proven it can build safe and clean nuclear power plants.”

For Hyundai E&C, this project represents a strategic entry into the US energy market, which is currently experiencing a surge in interest in nuclear generation. Company representatives emphasized that participation in HyperGrid gives them access to promising early-stage projects and creates the conditions to participate in the creation of the world’s largest integrated power and computing complex using multiple energy sources.

Looking ahead, Hyundai intends to use this collaboration as a springboard to expand its presence in the nuclear power segment. new energy solutions not only in the United States, but also in other countries, while strengthening its technological and competitive base.

The architecture chosen for the complex, which combines baseload nuclear generation, flexible gas turbines, and intermittent renewable energy sources, is becoming increasingly relevant for industrial customers with 24/7 consumption. This solution helps offset the volatility of wholesale energy market prices and reduces dependence on regulatory restrictions on carbon emissions.

The investment in HyperGrid reflects a broader trend: a structural shift in US energy consumption. For the first time in two decades, rising industrial production, data center growth, and infrastructure electrification have reversed the trend, with annual demand growth now exceeding 3% and expected to continue through 2040, according to McKinsey’s Energy Report 2025.

But in his second term, President Donald Trump isn’t merely questioning climate science; his administration is actively working to dismantle the federal government’s ability to respond to climate change at all.

These efforts go far beyond Trump’s familiar opposition to renewable energy and his push for more oil drilling, as put forward by a recent CNN article. Despite the US already being the world’s top oil producer, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) this week announced a plan to revoke the ""endangerment finding""—a foundational declaration made in 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions threaten human health.

As the paper points out, eliminating this finding would strip the EPA of its authority to regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act, undermining nearly all climate-related regulations. It’s a sweeping move—one of many. Other actions include:

-Reversing previous efforts to move away from coal. Trump has signed executive orders to support the coal industry and directed the EPA to lift limits on pollution from coal and gas plants.

-Ending federal tax credits for electric vehicles, which had survived during Trump’s first term and were later expanded under President Joe Biden. Republicans now plan to terminate them as early as next month.

-Dismantling Biden-era incentives that promoted renewable energy projects—ironically driving up electricity costs.

-Stripping California of its authority to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars starting in 2035, through legislation passed by Trump and congressional Republicans.

-Preparing to overturn federal tailpipe emissions standards set by Biden’s EPA, while also targeting California’s ability to set its own emissions rules.

-Firing the authors of the National Climate Assessment, a congressionally mandated climate report, and scrubbing past versions from federal websites.

-Declining to participate in a major international climate summit later this year in Brazil, forgoing any leadership role in global climate talks.

-Cutting federal staff focused on climate policy and science.

While all of the above are already cause for concern, the article warns that the attempt to undo the endangerment finding that may prove the most consequential. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin—a former congressman with no significant environmental background and a strong loyalty to Trump—called it the “largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

To climate skeptics, that’s a cause for celebration. To others, it’s alarming. Zeldin has openly framed his mission not as environmental protection but as freeing businesses from regulation.

The justification for the EPA's move is a climate report commissioned by the administration and authored by five known climate skeptics. Titled "" Titled ""A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the US Climate"" and published on July 23, it was commissioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who generated his wealth in the fracking industry.

In the report’s preface, Wright concedes that climate change is real but downplays its urgency: “It is not the greatest threat facing humanity. That distinction belongs to global energy poverty.” In other words, he argues that cutting emissions may do more harm than good—an outlier view in the scientific community.

Mainstream science, including reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), presents overwhelming peer-reviewed evidence of the dangers posed by unchecked emissions. The Trump administration has barred US government scientists from contributing to the next IPCC report, due in 2029.

Climate impacts are already visible

Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said the effects of climate change are no longer theoretical.

“The impacts have become part of everyday life,” Dykes explained. “They’re happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.”

By declaring that greenhouse gas emissions are not a danger to human health, the administration is essentially shifting the burden of climate change onto local governments and communities.

“This is abandoning our residents to bear the full cost of climate change—health risks, infrastructure damage, and increasingly extreme weather,” Dykes said, noting rising threats like heatwaves, drought, wildfires, and flooding.

Andrew Dessler, director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M University, dismissed the EPA’s new climate report as a legal argument—not a scientific one.

“The goal is not to evaluate the evidence fairly, but to make the strongest possible case for carbon dioxide’s innocence,” he said. “That’s not science.”

Phil Duffy, chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, warned that the move could reverse decades of public health gains. “Tens of thousands of Americans die each year from particulate pollution. That number has dropped as we’ve moved away from coal—but the Trump administration is set to reverse that trend.”

Michael Mann, director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media, described the situation in stark terms: “Not since Stalin’s Soviet Union and Lysenkoism have we seen such an overt effort to distort science for ideological ends,” referring to disastrous effects that the Moscow administration’s political interference in the scientific process had across the Union.

PwC argued that without sufficient local manufacturing capacity, an abrupt ban could severely disrupt off-grid electrification programmes and reverse gains in expanding energy access to underserved communities.
To ensure a smooth transition to local manufacturing, PwC recommended a comprehensive package of fiscal and infrastructure incentives.

In a recent policy analysis, the advisory firm recommended a phased reduction in imports over a three to five-year period instead of a sudden restriction. PwC argued that without sufficient local manufacturing capacity, an abrupt ban could severely disrupt off-grid electrification programmes and reverse gains in expanding energy access to underserved communities.

“An abrupt policy shift risks triggering severe supply constraints, escalating the cost of solar technologies, and making clean energy inaccessible for many Nigerians,” said Bimbola Banjo, Partner, Energy, Utilities and Resources at PwC Nigeria. “A phased approach, involving import quotas, progressive tariffs, and blended procurement models, offers a more sustainable pathway to industrialisation.”

The import restriction policy—proposed by the Ministry of Science and Technology—aims to encourage local production, reduce reliance on foreign technology, and boost job creation in the manufacturing sector.

However, PwC warned that Nigeria’s current manufacturing infrastructure lacks the scale, technological capacity, and quality control systems necessary to replace imports in the short term.

The report also highlighted the urgent need for workforce development. PwC called for the creation of a national renewable energy skills framework, supported through partnerships with universities, technical institutions, and research bodies, to ensure a skilled labour pool capable of driving a local manufacturing ecosystem.

Investor confidence, the firm added, could also be jeopardised by unclear policy timelines, standards, and exemption rules. PwC noted that such uncertainty may undermine the business models of mini-grid developers and clean energy startups, threatening much-needed capital inflows into the sector.

“A sudden restriction without a parallel support mechanism will disrupt supply chains, stall project deployments, and deter investment in Nigeria’s renewable energy sector,” said Godson Ikiebey, Senior Manager, Sustainability and Climate Change at PwC Nigeria.

To ensure a smooth transition to local manufacturing, PwC recommended a comprehensive package of fiscal and infrastructure incentives. These include expanded tax holidays, customs waivers, concessional finance facilities, and the development of renewable energy industrial zones to provide manufacturers with access to shared infrastructure and efficient transport logistics.

“Beyond fiscal incentives, Nigeria must streamline regulatory approvals, strengthen inter-agency coordination, and address infrastructural bottlenecks that currently hinder industrial growth,” said Emeka Chime, Associate Director, Tax and Regulatory Services at PwC Nigeria.

Quality assurance was also highlighted as a priority. PwC urged the Standards Organisation of Nigeria, Nigeria Electricity Management Service Agency, and Nigeria Electricity Regulatory Commission to adopt internationally aligned certification standards to protect consumers and build trust in locally manufactured solar products.

To monitor policy outcomes and ensure transparency, PwC recommended the establishment of a robust monitoring and evaluation framework. Key indicators such as local production volumes, job creation, and cost reductions should be tracked regularly to guide policy adjustments and maintain alignment with Nigeria’s clean energy goals.

“Industrialisation and energy access must be pursued in tandem. A phased approach, backed by strategic incentives and rigorous quality standards, will enable Nigeria to develop a robust solar manufacturing ecosystem without compromising its electrification ambitions,” Banjo added.

PwC concluded that while the Federal Government’s objective of localising solar panel production is laudable, a carefully sequenced and stakeholder-aligned implementation plan is critical to ensuring the policy does not inadvertently hinder Nigeria’s energy transition efforts.",https://thenationonlineng.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pricewaterhousecoopers-pwc.png,N,,2025-08-03 14:01:22.940567

Overweight Energy Equipment & Services: Position in companies with expertise in refinery maintenance, offshore drilling, and carbon capture technologies.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a seismic shift in the energy landscape in June 2025, as gasoline production plummeted by 491,000 barrels per day—its largest decline since the 2020 pandemic. This abrupt drop, driven by Hurricane Idella's devastation of Texas and Louisiana refineries, has created a stark divide between two critical sectors: Energy Equipment & Services and Automobiles. For investors, the fallout offers a textbook example of how supply-side shocks reshape market dynamics and underscore the importance of sector rotation.

The Energy Equipment & Services Surge

The collapse in gasoline production has directly fueled demand for infrastructure repair and modernization. Refineries like ExxonMobil's Baton Rouge and Shell's Deer Park, which operated at 20% capacity post-storm, require urgent maintenance and retrofitting. This has boosted Energy Equipment & Services firms such as Schlumberger (SLB) and Baker Hughes (BKR), whose shares rose 4–6% in the aftermath. The 1.2% jump in crude oil prices to $68 per barrel further amplifies this trend, as higher oil prices incentivize investment in drilling and refining technologies.

Historical backtests confirm this pattern. During past gasoline production shocks, Energy Equipment & Services stocks have consistently outperformed, with gains sustained over a 57-day period. For example, reveals a clear upward trajectory, reflecting their role in addressing supply chain bottlenecks. This sector's resilience stems from its direct alignment with crisis-driven demand: aging infrastructure, rising oil prices, and geopolitical risks all create a tailwind for companies that service the energy sector.

The Automobile Sector's Struggle

Conversely, the Automobile sector has borne the brunt of the gasoline crisis. As fuel prices surged—U.S. regular gasoline hit $3.123 per gallon in mid-July—consumer spending on fuel-intensive vehicles has waned. Ford (F) and Toyota (TM) saw their shares decline by 2–3%, mirroring broader industry concerns. The backtest data reinforces this: Automobiles experienced negative returns over 25 days following a production shock, with illustrating the sector's vulnerability.

The link between fuel costs and auto sales is well-documented. Higher gasoline prices tighten household budgets, reducing discretionary spending on new vehicles. This dynamic is compounded by the sector's long-term exposure to electric vehicle (EV) adoption and regulatory pressures, which further erode margins in a high-cost environment.

Macro Implications and Investment Strategy

The gasoline production collapse has broader macroeconomic ramifications. While the Federal Reserve may remain cautious—given the supply-driven nature of the disruption—investors must navigate the resulting sectoral divergence. Energy Equipment & Services firms benefit from a virtuous cycle: higher oil prices → increased demand for drilling and refining equipment → stronger earnings. Meanwhile, Automobiles face a double whammy: elevated fuel costs and shifting consumer preferences toward EVs.

For actionable strategies, consider the following:

1. Overweight Energy Equipment & Services: Position in companies with expertise in refinery maintenance, offshore drilling, and carbon capture technologies. These firms are poised to capitalize on infrastructure upgrades and rising oil prices.

2. Underweight Automobiles: Until gasoline prices stabilize, automakers remain exposed to demand volatility. However, EV-focused subsectors (e.g., battery manufacturers) may offer partial insulation.

3. Monitor EIA and Geopolitical Developments: The August EIA reports will be critical in assessing production recovery. Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions could extend the tailwinds for Energy Equipment.

Conclusion

The June 2025 gasoline production shock is a microcosm of how energy market volatility reshapes industry fortunes. Energy Equipment & Services, with its crisis-driven growth, contrasts sharply with the Automobile sector's fuel-cost sensitivity. Investors who recognize this divide and act accordingly—leveraging backtest insights and sectoral trends—can navigate the current landscape with strategic clarity. As the EIA's next reports roll in, the key will be balancing short-term volatility with long-term sectoral realignment.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 13:03:20.191734

UK-based tidal energy company, Proteus Marine Renewables’ (PMR) 1.1 MW tidal energy turbine, the AR1100, has received certification from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), confirming the system meets national standards for grid-connected power generation. The turbine is now operational and delivering electricity to the Japanese national grid.

A 1 kW system lands in the ocean

Proteus Marine Renewables has deployed the AR1100 tidal turbine in Japan, which became the country’s first ever megawatt-scale grid connected tidal energy system.

Installed in the Naru Strait, the turbine will generate 1.1 MW of clean energy, accelerating the decarbonization of the Goto Islands’ electricity supply and advancing Japan’s renewable energy transition.

Building on the success of the AR500 pilot project in 2021, where a 500 kW device operated in the Naru Strait maintaining a 97% turbine availability, Proteus signed an equipment supply and works contract with Kyuden Mirai Energy (KME) in November 2022 to upgrade the device to 1.1 MW capacity.

Leveraging its modular architecture, Proteus enhanced its existing turbine’s performance and efficiency by integrating advanced pitch and yaw systems, along with other improvements to achieve a 1.1 MW rating.

The deployment, carried out by local vessels and resources under the supervision of the Proteus Offshore Services team, was made possible through the collaboration and expertise of key partners and suppliers in Japan.

Proteus was established following a 2022 management buyout of Simec Atlantis Energy’s tidal energy division.

According to Philip Archer, Managing Director of Proteus Operations Japan: “Deploying the AR1100 in Japan is a testament to the dedication and expertise of our team working in collaboration with local professionals. The result reinforces tidal energy’s potential as a dependable renewable source in Japan. Our next immediate focus is the commissioning of the turbine, Japan’s first ever MW-scale grid connected tidal system, and the subsequent testing and accreditation phase.”

Drew Blaxland, CEO of Proteus added: “With operational turbines in both the United Kingdom and Japan, we are proving the scalability of tidal energy as a viable power source for coastal communities. As Japan expands its renewable energy mix and reduces reliance on fossil fuels, predictable sources like tidal energy will be essential in securing a stable, sustainable energy future. Proteus remains at the forefront of this transition, bringing proven solutions to new markets.”

A system which is designed for optimal efficiency in tidal currents

The AR1100 tidal turbine features a horizontal-axis rotor with three advanced composite blades, designed for optimal efficiency in tidal currents. The blade angles are independently controlled by electromechanical pitch systems housed in the turbine hub, allowing for real-time control for maximum energy capture and to minimize hydrodynamic loads.

The device incorporates a drivetrain which transmits the mechanical power extracted at the rotor through to a permanent magnet generator.

A state of the art electrically actuated, hydraulic locking yaw mechanism is used to rotate the nacelle so that the rotor faces the oncoming tidal flow as it reverses direction four times a day.

The tidal turbine is mounted on a gravity-based support structure and connected to shore via a subsea cable, transmitting power directly to an onshore station, where it is converted for grid distribution.

Receiving approval from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)

According to Drew Blaxland: “Receiving METI certification is a major milestone – not only for Proteus, but for tidal energy in Japan. It confirms the AR1100 series 2’s compliance with Japan’s rigorous safety and technical standards and demonstrates that tidal power is now a viable, scalable solution for clean electricity generation.”

The project was carried out in partnership with Kyuden Mirai Energy (KME), the representative firm behind the deployment. Proteus and KME are now assessing further tidal energy deployment opportunities in Japan. Philip Archer, adds: “We’ve operated in Japanese waters before, so we know just how demanding the conditions can be.”

On July 29, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced a formal proposal to rescind the greenhouse gas endangerment finding.
Zeldin claimed that measures aimed at curbing emissions are more harmful than the climate change impacts stemming from these emissions.
The US is currently the world’s second-largest emitter of climate pollution and the largest historical emitter.
Along with rescinding the endangerment finding, the EPA is also proposing to eliminate greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles.","The Environmental Protection Agency under President Donald Trump is following through on a plan that will revoke its primary authority to control the greenhouse gas emissions that endanger human health and welfare. The move, if it succeeds, represents a major blow to the global effort to act on runaway climate change just as rates of extreme weather, biodiversity loss, and glacier melting accelerate.

On July 29, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced a formal proposal to rescind the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. Zeldin claimed that measures aimed at curbing emissions are more harmful than the climate change impacts stemming from these emissions. The rollback proposal also cites a new Department of Energy report authored by climate contrarians who question the scientific consensus on the causes and dangers of unchecked global heating.

“As if any doubt remained, the Trump administration has formalized climate denial as the official policy of the United States government,” Sierra Club acting executive director Loren Blackford said in a statement. “If approved, rescinding the endangerment finding would strike a decisive blow to the EPA’s authority to limit deadly greenhouse gas emissions and protect our people and our planet from the very worst of the climate crisis.”

The endangerment finding was issued under the Obama administration in 2009 and serves as the legal underpinning for the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are pollutants under the Clean Air Act, which then triggered the EPA’s obligation to make a science-based determination as to whether they endanger public health and welfare. The finding was the result of an exhaustive examination of peer-reviewed studies and scientific literature going back decades.

Now, the EPA under Trump is arguing that the finding lacks legal and scientific justification. When the finding was made in 2009, the EPA “unreasonably analyzed the scientific record,” Zeldin’s proposal asserts. It also claims that the EPA does not have the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions based on concerns about global climate change, arguing that the US contribution to the problem is minimal. The US is currently the world’s second-largest emitter of climate pollution and the largest historical emitter.

Along with rescinding the endangerment finding, the EPA is also proposing to eliminate greenhouse gas emission standards for motor vehicles. The transportation sector is the biggest source of these planet-warming emissions in the US. Last year, the Biden administration finalized the strongest-ever rules to curb climate pollution from vehicles—an action that was expected to slash more than 7 billion tons of carbon emissions by 2055, avoid thousands of premature deaths, and yield nearly $100 billion in annual net benefits through reduced fuel and maintenance costs and public health cost savings.

“If EPA dismantles essential standards to clean up vehicle pollution, the agency is giving its blessing to more pollution that will lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths that could have been prevented.""

Republican politicians and industry critics have characterized the regulations as an electric vehicle mandate, though the rules do not impose technology mandates on any particular vehicle sales. The American Petroleum Institute cheered the agency’s proposal to eliminate vehicle emissions standards, calling the Biden administration’s tailpipe rules “costly and unrealistic.”

But public health and environmental advocates say the rollbacks will sicken and kill more Americans and amount to political favors bestowed upon the oil industry.

“If EPA dismantles essential standards to clean up vehicle pollution, the agency is giving its blessing to more pollution that will lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths that could have been prevented,” said Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association.

“This proposal to get rid of all greenhouse gas standards will mean more pollution that Americans experience,” Peter Zalzal, associate vice president for clean air strategies at Environmental Defense Fund, said during a teleconference. An EDF analysis of the impacts of the proposed rollbacks found that it would lead to at least 10 billion tons of additional climate pollution through 2055, at least 12,000 more premature deaths, and 8.5 million more asthma attacks.

Repealing the motor vehicle emissions standards will also cede US leadership in the $10 trillion global clean transportation market and will lead to higher prices for consumers in terms of vehicle fuel costs, experts say. “In the regulatory impact analysis that accompanied the proposal, EPA reveals that their proposal will increase gas prices by nearly 75 cents a gallon,” Josh Berman, a senior attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, told Sierra.

Back in March, Zeldin announced his intention to rescind the endangerment finding, along with all EPA regulations that have followed from that finding—including limits on greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and power plants—plus other rules pertaining to air and water pollution. In that announcement, Zeldin said that the EPA will “follow the science, the law, and common sense wherever it leads, and we will do so while advancing our commitment towards helping to deliver cleaner, healthier, and safer air, land, and water.”

Scientific analysis going back decades has unambiguously shown that greenhouse gas emissions from human activity are heating up the earth’s climate systems, resulting in severe and widespread impacts such as more extreme weather disasters, species extinction, adverse health effects, and damage to ecosystems, infrastructure, and properties. The US Fifth National Climate Assessment report states, “Without rapid and deep reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, the risks of accelerating sea level rise, intensifying extreme weather, and other harmful climate impacts will continue to grow. Each additional increment of warming is expected to lead to more damage and greater economic losses compared to previous increments of warming, while the risk of catastrophic or unforeseen consequences also increases.”

To help support the EPA’s actions, the Department of Energy issued a report attempting to contest the underlying science of climate change. Energy Secretary Chris Wright handpicked the five scientific and economic experts who authored the report.

“I can’t think of anymore more qualified to present antiscientific climate denial propaganda than these five,” climate scientist Michael Mann, distinguished professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Science at the University of Pennsylvania, said in a social media post. “And I can't think of anyone more likely to seek out these fossil fuel apologists than Christopher Wright.”

Critics of the EPA’s proposal to revoke the endangerment finding say that the move is completely contrary to science, law, and reality.",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-03 13:02:40.800549

When completed, the project will overtake the Three Gorges Dam as the world’s largest hydropower dam.
The Yarlung Tsangpo flows south into India, where it becomes the Brahmaputra River, then flows into Bangladesh.
India fears the potential weaponisation of water by China, which could use the dam to cause floods or induce droughts.","China breaks ground on what Premier Li Qiang has called the “project of the century”, but some fear a water conflict and ecological effects.

On the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau, China envisions a future powered by the roaring waters of the Yarlung Tsangpo, also known as the Brahmaputra. The river will be the site of a mega dam — the world’s most ambitious to date — that promises to bring clean energy, jobs, infrastructure and prosperity to the region.

Construction on the world’s largest hydropower dam began on Saturday, according to Premier Li Qiang, who called it the “project of the century”.

But the project is not just about electricity and economic benefits – the stakes are far higher. Regional security, ecological stability and the future of one of Asia’s great rivers all hang in the balance.

How big is the mega dam?

The dam will be situated in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo, where a section drops 2000 metres (6562 feet) over a 50km (31 miles) stretch, creating immense hydropower potential. The dam is reportedly located in Medog, a remote county in the city of Nyingchi in the Tibet autonomous region.

When completed, the project will overtake the Three Gorges Dam as the world’s largest hydropower dam. It could generate three times more energy with five cascade hydropower stations – an estimated annual capacity of 300 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity, more than Britain’s total annual power output.

It is estimated to cost about 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion), dwarfing many of the biggest infrastructure undertakings in modern history at about five times the cost of the Three Gorges Dam and even more expensive than the International Space Station.

Why is it important?

The project was first announced in 2020 under China’s five-year plan as part of a broader strategy to exploit the hydropower potential of the Tibetan Plateau, with feasibility studies dating back to the 1980s. Beijing authorised the dam’s construction in December 2024.

China is the world’s top hydropower producer, but it “is fast running out of rivers to dam”, which makes the Yarlung Tsangpo “the final frontier” for large-scale expansion, according to Trivium China, a China-focused research firm.

The Chinese Government sees the project as a national strategy with major significance for Tibet’s development and China’s clean energy targets.

By tapping into the river’s vast hydropower potential and integrating surrounding solar and wind resources, China aims to establish a clean energy hub in the region, stabilising the grid while reducing reliance on coal. This aligns with Beijing’s green energy goals and 2060 carbon neutrality targets, according to state media.

The project is also expected to boost local employment, infrastructure and livelihoods in Tibet while prioritising ecological protection through rigorous geological surveys and environmental monitoring, according to official media.

“Beyond energy security, policymakers likely also have state-building on the mind. The mega dam will anchor an unprecedented wave of industrial and infrastructure investment in Tibet – deepening Beijing’s control over the politically sensitive region,” Trivium China said on its website on Monday.

What is at stake, and why is India anxious?

The Yarlung Tsangpo flows south into India, where it becomes the Brahmaputra River, then flows into Bangladesh. Both South Asian nations have raised concerns about downstream implications of a water conflict, which could potentially affect millions of people who depend on the river for agriculture, fisheries and daily consumption.

The river flows through Arunachal Pradesh, known in China as Zangnan – a territory claimed by both China and India. New Delhi views the project as a possible means for Beijing to project power and exert control over water resources for strategic and economic advantage. India fears the potential weaponisation of water by China, which could use the dam to cause floods or induce droughts.

Earlier this month, Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu described the mega dam project as a ticking “water bomb” and said downstream Indian waters could “dry up considerably” once the dam was completed.

Observers have also raised concerns about population displacement and risks to one of the richest and most diverse environments on the plateau. Chinese authorities did not disclose how many people were likely to be displaced.

Tibetan groups have reportedly noted the presence of sacred sites along the river.

China asserts that the project has undergone rigorous scientific evaluation and will not adversely affect the environment, geological stability, or water resource rights of downstream countries. Beijing has also emphasised that it will not try to benefit at the “expense of its neighbours”.

The area where the dam is being built sits atop the Indian-Eurasian tectonic boundary, a seismically active zone, making it prone to earthquakes and leaving little margin for engineering error. Experts said it could take at least a decade to build the dam because of the technical challenges. The dam is expected to begin operations in the 2030s.

And, in a 2024 global assessment by the German Climate Change Performance Index, Sweden’s “climate policy rating” dropped to 41st after being ranked 4th in 2021 (it fell from 1st to 11th for its overall response to climate change).
An Early Leader on Climate Sweden’s tale of climate engagement dates back to 1896, when Uppsala physicist Svante Arrhenius was first to quantify the role of carbon emissions in warming the planet.
Two years later, seven of the nation’s eight national political parties negotiated a Climate Policy Framework that included long-term goals, reporting mechanisms and a scientific Climate Policy Council in a national law.
Sweden’s carbon emissions rose by 7 percent last year, breaking a long trend, largely due to the government’s dropping of regulations requiring biofuel blending in gasoline.","Five years after the European Union vowed to lead the creation of the “first climate neutral continent” by 2050, and pledged at least a trillion euros to that effort, a long list of organizations, companies and agencies are accusing the EU of rolling back its European Green Deal with deregulation. Controversial proposals also include carbon offsets,loopholes in its emissions targets and delays of important efforts to reduce deforestation and make cleaner cars. Some critics have gone so far as to argue that the 27-nation union, the world’s third-largest carbon emitter, is now starting to mirror, rather than counter, the dismantling of climate efforts in the U.S.

Part of the explanation for the EU’s retreat on climate can be found in Sweden. For decades the small northern country pushed Europe’s climate ambitions upward, but today, Sweden is falling back from its environmental progress. Last year, its fossil fuel emissions saw their biggest increase in 15 years. During that time period, carbon uptake by its vast forests have halved. And since the country swung to the right in its last general election, the government has slashed its investments in climate action. Researchers say Sweden’s policy shifts, and its evolving role as a frontrunner, is now contributing to the weakening of Europe’s climate agenda.

In recent months, numerous institutions have criticized Sweden’s environmental retreat. In March, The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a once-in-a-decade environmental performance review of the country that stated “recent policy shifts have created an uncertain environment for climate action.”

OECD projected Sweden would safely hit only one of its 16 national environmental targets by 2030, succeeding in protecting the ozone layer, but failing on objectives such as “sustainable forests” and “reduced climate impact.” Almost simultaneously, the Swedish Climate Policy Council declared that the nation’s climate policies were “insufficient” and rely on “optimistic assumptions.” In April, Sweden’s Environmental Protection Agency predicted the country will miss all of its national climate targets for the next 20 years, including its goal of reaching net zero emissions by 2045. And, in a 2024 global assessment by the German Climate Change Performance Index, Sweden’s “climate policy rating” dropped to 41st after being ranked 4th in 2021 (it fell from 1st to 11th for its overall response to climate change). The independent monitor quoted its experts saying that “Sweden is backtracking from being a frontrunner in international climate policy” and they demanded that “the government maintain progressive climate policies.”

“We can say with some confidence that Sweden no longer pushes the European Union to higher ambitions,” said Naghmeh Nasiritousi, a senior research fellow at the Swedish Institute for International Affairs and co-director of the Centre for Climate Science and Policy Research at Linköping University.

Roots of Progress and Retreat in a Swedish Forest

In an old woodland in Sweden’s southwest Dalsland province, a group of amateur conservationists examine decomposing tree trunks hoping to find rare lichens and wood-decaying fungus. Around them grow gnarly spruces, stately, 90-foot-tall pines and scattered birches and aspens. Dead logs spread like pickup sticks on a bed of knee-deep bilberry shrub.

If the group finds certain rare species, they might be able to save this forest. But the odds are slim. Timber prices have doubled since Russian imports stopped after the invasion of Ukraine, and many landowners are eager to sell wood quickly, usually after they clearcut a forest.

“It’s always very aggressive,” said Martin Sjöberg, a board member in the local branch of the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation who organized the event.

In a country where less than 2 percent of primary forests remain, protecting old-growth woodlands is an existential matter, both for biodiversity, where Sweden has failed to meet its international commitments, and for the sequestration of carbon to mitigate climate change.

Fifteen years ago, Sweden’s 87 billion trees, soils and wetlands absorbed almost 62 million tons of carbon each year—more than the country’s total fossil fuel emissions. But by last year, that number had halved to 31 million tons. The steep drop indicates that forests are disturbed by increased clearcutting as well as years of droughts, fires, beetle infections and insufficient soil nutrition, which hinders tree growth. It also means that Sweden risks being in violation of a range of EU agreements, including the union’s Nature Restoration Law, Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) Regulation. LULUCF is part of the EU’s Climate and Energy Framework, which demands a much higher uptake of carbon. If Sweden is found in violation of these agreements, the EU could impose steep fines on the country. In a related estimate for Ireland, its potential climate related EU fines were assessed at between 8 and 26 billion euros ($9.4 billion to $30.5 billion). But rather than redouble efforts to sequester carbon, Sweden has instead spent years aggressively negotiating to weaken EU’s forest-related biodiversity and climate regulations.

“If they wanted, Swedish politicians could also regulate tree felling and invest in closer-to-nature forestry methods, but there is little interest,” said Thomas Hahn, an ecological economist and Associate Professor at Stockholm Resilience Centre.

An Early Leader on Climate

Sweden’s tale of climate engagement dates back to 1896, when Uppsala physicist Svante Arrhenius was first to quantify the role of carbon emissions in warming the planet. The Stockholm Conference held in the country in 1972—officially the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment—paved the way for international environmental collaboration. By 1991, Sweden was taxing carbon emissions, making it one of the first nations to do so. Environmentalists argued against the nation joining the EU in 1994 fearing that Europe’s soft regulations would reduce Swedish ambitions. Once it was a member, the country became part of a “green sextet” of nations that strengthened EU commitments.

In 2015, Sweden pledged $550 million to the Green Climate Fund created by the Paris Agreement that was adopted that year. Two years later, seven of the nation’s eight national political parties negotiated a Climate Policy Framework that included long-term goals, reporting mechanisms and a scientific Climate Policy Council in a national law.

But even then, some Swedes demanded much more. In 2018, a young Greta Thunberg started weekly demonstrations outside Sweden’s parliament. Her ensuing global campaign included the Fridays for Future events in which students around the world would skip school to advocate for climate action. The movement built political momentum for the European Green Deal, which was approved by the European Commission in 2020 and aimed to launch the EU out of the pandemic with investments in clean technologies and innovation.

For many observers, one of Sweden’s most important contributions to climate action was showing how economic growth can be decoupled from fossil fuels. Since 1979, its year of peak emissions, the nation’s release of carbon has fallen over 50 percent while GDP per person has more than doubled.

But since the country’s general elections in 2022, Sweden has taken distinct steps away from its environmental legacy. A conservative coalition, supported by the far-right Sweden Democrats, focused their campaign on cheap fuel and public safety. In office, they have prioritized building up the military, being tough on crime and sharply reducing immigration. Funding for climate action has plummeted.

The government halted investments in high-speed rail; cancelled subsidies for electric vehicles; stopped its support for undersea cables, leading private companies to stop offshore wind projects; increased taxes on solar electricity; and cut its investments in several green innovation funds, making the funding available to municipalities unpredictable for things like more efficient heating systems and charging infrastructure for electric cars. At the same time, subsidies for fossil fuels and aviation have increased and gasoline prices have fallen by almost half. Sweden’s carbon emissions rose by 7 percent last year, breaking a long trend, largely due to the government’s dropping of regulations requiring biofuel blending in gasoline.

Sweden’s government, however, maintains lofty rhetoric about fighting climate change, and highlights its spending on two areas: carbon credits that pay for emission reductions in other, usually less-developed countries, to allow Sweden to maintain higher emissions, and new nuclear power plants to generate emissions-free electricity. Critics argue that credits have neocolonial implications as the programs effectively export both the blame and the consequences of emissions from rich nations to poorer ones. Other critics note that nuclear power is an economic gamble that will take decades to implement, with uranium mines and waste that can spread deadly radiation and reactors that can pose strategic risks if the country were to go to war.

A Trend Across Europe

Research into the history of Sweden’s policy shift by Nasiritousi at the Swedish Institute for International Affairs and Linköping University shows that the nation’s decarbonization effort was originally unrelated to climate. The country lacks fossil fuel deposits, so relying on coal, fossil gas and oil made little sense, especially after the oil crisis of the 1970s. The nation instead chose to generate its electricity with its strong hydropower sector complemented with an ambitious nuclear power program. Those two sources still account for 70 percent of Sweden’s electricity production; another 28 percent is also “fossil-free,” most of it generated with wind and biofuels.

Today, however, reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement requires more profound efforts across more sectors, including some with elevated social costs such as transportation, forestry, agriculture and lifestyle-related consumption. The wide-ranging efforts that reaching the U.N.’s climate goals require of the public has provided an opportunity for populist politicians, who can tell a simpler story and don’t have to explain complex, interconnected systems, said Nasiritousi. For Sweden’s government, building even more nuclear power capacity has become that story, which she said distracts from the more expansive efforts needed to achieve climate targets.

Sweden is following a European trend, said Rudi Wurzel, professor of comparative European politics at the University of Hull in England. Wurzel developed the concept of an ambitious “green sextet” of nations driving the EU’s climate agenda, but while following ongoing negotiations and statements, he saw five of those countries—Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Austria—all appear to reduce their once-bold climate policies. All of these countries have also shifted to the political right. Only Denmark, a leader in offshore wind, largely seems to be maintaining its aspirations to cut emissions and fight climate change, he said.

The Climate Change Performance Index confirmed his analysis, with its scores for all five nations dramatically falling between 2021 and 2024, while Denmark moved upwards. And Denmark, which currently holds the influential and rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union ahead of a range of important EU negotiations and decisions in the fall, might have room to sustain some European climate ambitions, even as priorities shift in other countries.

Precarious geopolitics might help to maintain some EU environmental goals, Wurzel added, because in Europe, unlike the U.S., renewables offer immediate security benefits by decreasing dependence on Russian energy imports.

“Security considerations may save EU’s climate efforts for now, and we never know where politics goes next,” said Wurzel.

Sweden’s chief climate negotiator, Ambassador Mattias Frumerie, said he is “aware of the debate inside Sweden” but noted that local issues rarely reach international negotiations. Generally, Sweden’s message that the urgent need to confront climate change presents a business opportunity is attracting growing interest, he said. As for the claims that Sweden is backtracking on its environmental ambition, he stressed the importance of being transparent about “bumps in the road” of climate action.

Sweden’s Minister for Climate and Environment, Romina Pourmokhtari, declined to make herself available for an interview for this story.

Back in the old-growth forest of Dalsland, the amateur conservationists haven’t found any rare lichens or wood-decaying fungus. The most exciting discovery was a rather common coral slime. It is neither plant, animal or fungus and resembles white frost on black soil.

But, while they didn’t find anything rare enough to keep the forest from being logged, just being out in the woods is a step toward stopping Sweden’s retreat on climate action, said Sjöberg, the organizer of the event.

“All it takes is more people caring about our future,” he said, “and that we get them out here doing something.”

A professional artist who has produced several exhibitions about threats to the forest, he said his abstract and emotional art is intended to invoke action.

The city awarded $1.2 million through its Environmental Justice Fund to grassroots organizations confronting climate change on the frontlines — communities facing sea level rise, storm surge, and intensifying heat. The money, raised through a payroll tax on high-income employers, is flowing directly to communities of color, immigrants, the elderly, and low-income residents — people hit first and worst by climate impacts.

It’s not just Seattle. Across the country, cities are stepping up, even as federal support for climate resilience and environmental justice collapses.

Since returning to office, President Donald Trump has wasted no time dismantling climate justice programs. His “Day One” executive orders terminated all federal environmental justice offices and staff, scrapped the Justice40 initiative, and reopened large swaths of the U.S. coast to offshore drilling. His administration has revoked a decades-old executive order requiring agencies to prioritize environmental justice in their missions, taken key tools — like the Environmental Protection Agency’s EJScreen — offline, and cut core funding programs, including disaster preparedness grants. And through the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Trump has gutted the Inflation Reduction Act’s environmental and climate justice program — slashing billions once earmarked for clean air, clean water, and green jobs in overburdened communities.

These rollbacks are not just performative political retribution. They are already threatening lives and livelihoods in communities across the country.

This is especially true in coastal cities, home to more than 47 million people, where rising seas and stronger storms are colliding with long-standing patterns of inequality, nearly 60 percent of coastal city residents are people of color — compared to 37 percent nationally. These cities also have higher rates of poverty, unemployment, rent burden, and non-citizenship. That means when disaster strikes — whether from hurricanes in the Gulf or nor’easters in New York — the communities with the fewest resources to recover are often the ones hardest hit.

In these cities, climate justice is more than a policy priority – it’s a survival strategy.

At Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank for the future of coastal cities, we spoke with local officials nationwide about how they’re navigating this new reality. Our new report shares what we learned — and what’s still possible.

Despite a hostile federal landscape, cities are forging ahead. They’re creating local funding streams, investing in community-led planning, and embedding justice into their governments and operational DNA.

In Oakland, every strategy in the Equitable Climate Action Plan is evaluated for its racial equity impact. In Seattle, the Race and Social Justice Initiative — now law — requires all city departments to review budgets and programs through an equity lens. This is real institutional change.

While the federal government wipes crucial data resources, cities recognize information is integral. In San Diego, the Climate Equity Index maps where environmental risks overlap with socioeconomic vulnerability, guiding city investments in stormwater upgrades, green space, and climate infrastructure. In New York City, the EJNYC Mapping Tool brings together over 100 datasets to highlight environmental burdens in places like the Rockaways and South Bronx — both low-lying areas with aging infrastructure and long histories of disinvestment. These tools help cities steer investments to the neighborhoods that need them most.

As federal funding evaporates, many cities are strengthening ties with frontline organizations — the local experts who’ve been leading the fight for decades. In New Orleans, the Climate Action Equity Project brings community leaders from every city district to co-design resilience strategies, from flood protection to coastal restoration. In Providence, Rhode Island, the Green Justice Zones initiative puts neighborhood groups in charge of planning for flooding and extreme heat in the city’s most vulnerable areas.

And where national workforce programs are shrinking, cities are building their own pipelines of green jobs. Cleveland is equipping youth from frontline communities with skills to restore urban forests and protect neighborhoods from flooding and water pollution. In New Orleans, programs like Ground CREW and Thrive prepare BIPOC and low-income residents to lead neighborhood-scale stormwater and flood resilience projects.

This is what climate justice looks like: tactical, community-rooted, and relentless. It’s also what real leadership looks like — in sharp contrast to the political theater playing out in Washington.

While Trump stages press conferences and bill signings to celebrate the dismantling of hard-won protections, local governments are doing the real work of protecting lives, preparing for future storms, and closing the equity gap. The stakes aren’t theoretical. They’re physical — crashing into coastal communities and people’s lives. And they’re growing more urgent every year.

We don’t need to wait for the Trump administration to get its act together. But we also can’t let cities do this work alone.

As part of a Republican-led budget package, the administration has fast-tracked the phase-out of 30% tax credits for wind and solar projects—credits that previously ran through 2032. Projects must now begin construction within a year or be in service by the end of 2027 to qualify.

In a further blow, Trump directed the Treasury Department to rewrite the rules on what counts as “beginning construction.” For years, developers could claim credits by spending just 5% of project costs and had up to four years to complete construction. That longstanding practice is now under review, with Treasury given 45 days to propose new guidelines—leaving project financing in limbo.

Industry in Disarray

The impact has been immediate. Singapore-based Bila Solar has paused a $20 million expansion at its Indianapolis plant that would have created 75 jobs.

Heliene, a Canadian manufacturer, is reevaluating a $350 million solar cell facility in Minnesota. Norwegian solar wafer producer NorSun is reconsidering its $620 million Tulsa factory. Meanwhile, two fully permitted offshore wind farms—US Wind’s 300 MW Maryland project and Iberdrola’s 791 MW New England Wind project—are now at risk of never breaking ground.

“This is a troubling level of uncertainty,” said Mick McDaniel, Bila Solar’s general manager. Heliene CEO Martin Pochtaruk added, “With so many moving parts, financing of projects, financing of manufacturing is difficult, if not impossible.”

Billions at Stake and Competing Narratives

Analysts are sounding alarms over the broader fallout.

Rhodium Group estimates the new policy endangers $263 billion in planned renewable energy projects and $110 billion in manufacturing investments.

Consulting firm ICF projects a 25% increase in U.S. electricity demand by 2030, driven largely by AI and cloud computing. A restricted pipeline of renewable projects could lead to tighter power supplies and push household electricity bills up by $280 annually by 2035, according to Princeton’s REPEAT Project.

The Trump administration argues that rapid adoption of renewables has destabilized the grid and increased consumer costs—a claim widely contested by energy experts, who point to states like Texas, where renewables have helped reduce wholesale power prices.

Yet, with U.S. energy demand surging, even industry representatives supportive of fossil fuels warn against curbing clean energy growth. “All new generation—renewables and fossil—must be encouraged to meet the coming demand,” one power sector official told Bloomberg.

Shrinking Window

Wood Mackenzie forecasts a 17% drop in solar installations and 20% decline in wind projects over the next decade. The consultancy also warns that offshore wind, already grappling with inflation and supply chain disruptions, may not recover without substantial policy support.

For now, developers are scrambling to break ground before incentives vanish. But the uncertainty surrounding Treasury’s revised rules may make even that strategy unviable.

Perspective

The clean energy sector has been one of the fastest-growing parts of the U.S. economy, buoyed by tax credits designed to attract billions in private capital and create thousands of jobs. Gutting these incentives risks stalling that momentum at a critical time—just as demand for electricity is set to soar.

If the U.S. intends to remain competitive in AI, advanced manufacturing, and grid modernization, policymakers may need to rethink whether a sharp retreat from renewable subsidies aligns with long-term economic and energy security goals.",https://pvbuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Industry-Update.png,N,,2025-08-03 13:02:58.948267

The Trump administration has targeted the renewable energy industry for massive cutbacks in 2025’s One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB). According to NPR, the bill, signed into law on July 4, eliminates tax incentives for solar and wind projects across the United States. As a result, electricity bills throughout the country are expected to increase, according to nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation.

Here’s a look at exactly how and why power bills may be on the rise, with a specific look at the four states expected to suffer the most.

What’s in the New Legislation?

As with any large piece of legislation, there’s a bit of complexity attached to the elimination of wind and solar subsidies in the OBBB. Thanks to negotiation from some Republican senators, tax incentives will remain for companies that start construction on projects by July 4, 2026, and that place them in service by the end of 2027.

However, as Norton Rose Fulbright points out, even this provision has been muddied by proclamations from the Trump administration. An executive order issued by President Trump just three days after the legislation was signed directs the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” within 45 days “restricting the use of broad safe harbors [to treat projects as under construction] unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

This confusion prompted Ryan Sweezey, director of North America power and renewables at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, to say, “I would characterize this as a high degree of volatility expected over the next year. I mean, the policy situation is still not clear.”

For renewable energy companies, this means they are being prompted to rush new projects while at the same time being uncertain if they will actually receive the tax incentives they seek. This type of stalemate puts renewables in a state of limbo for the time being, which isn’t good for business.

It seems unlikely that Trump will backpedal on his campaign against renewables, as he called wind and solar energy “a blight” on the country during a Cabinet meeting, according to NPR. “They hurt our country very badly,” he said. “And smart countries don’t use it.”

How Will the Legislation Affect Energy Prices?

The bottom line is that even a reduction in subsidies and incentives for the renewable energy market — let alone an elimination — will drive up energy prices across the country. According to NPR, energy demand is likely to increase significantly over the next few years, and renewable energy plants were being counted on to produce relatively cheap energy for new data centers and factories.

Energy Innovation predicts that national energy rates will increase for consumers by an average of 9% to 18% by 2035. On a wholesale basis, prices are expected to rise 25% by 2030 and a whopping 74% by 2035. Additionally, it will cost the U.S. economy thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in planned investment.

Which States Are Most Vulnerable, and Why?

The states hardest-hit by the new legislation may dream of a 10-year increase of “only” 9% to 18% in energy costs. This is because some states rely completely on the federal government for renewable energy development. According to Dan O’Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, the firm anticipates that costs will rise the most in these four states:

Oklahoma

Kentucky

Missouri

Kansas

In Oklahoma, rates are expected to skyrocket by between 60% and 350% by 2035. Kentucky, Missouri and Kansas are projected to see rate increases of at least 48%, 39% and 30% over the next decade, respectively.

When factoring in job losses in addition to energy price increases, Energy Innovation sees these five states as the biggest losers:

South Carolina

Florida

Texas

Kentucky

This proposal outlines a project aimed at implementing solar-powered clean water systems in underserved communities. By harnessing renewable energy, we can provide sustainable and reliable access to clean water, improving health outcomes and enhancing the quality of life for residents.

This initiative not only addresses immediate water needs but also promotes environmental sustainability and resilience against climate change. The project seeks to empower local communities by involving them in the design, implementation, and maintenance of these systems. By integrating community participation, we aim to foster a sense of ownership and responsibility, ensuring the long-term success of the initiative.

This proposal will detail the background and rationale for the project, outline specific objectives and goals, identify target beneficiaries, and describe the methodology and approach we will take to achieve our aims.

Background and Rationale for the Project

Globally, approximately 2 billion people live in water-stressed areas, with many relying on unsafe sources for their daily needs. Contaminated water is a leading cause of disease, contributing to high rates of morbidity and mortality, particularly among children. In many regions, traditional water supply systems are either non-existent or unreliable, exacerbating the challenges faced by vulnerable populations.

The need for innovative solutions that can provide safe drinking water is more pressing than ever. Solar energy presents a viable solution to this crisis. With abundant sunlight in many regions, solar-powered systems can be deployed to pump, filter, and purify water efficiently.

This approach not only reduces dependence on fossil fuels but also minimizes operational costs associated with traditional water supply methods. By utilizing solar technology, we can create a sustainable model that addresses both water scarcity and energy needs while promoting environmental stewardship.

Objectives and Goals of the Proposal

The primary objective of this proposal is to establish solar-powered clean water systems in targeted communities to ensure access to safe drinking water. Specifically, we aim to install a minimum of five solar-powered water purification units within the first year of the project. Each unit will be designed to serve approximately 500 individuals, significantly improving access to clean water for thousands of residents.

In addition to providing immediate access to clean water, we aim to educate community members about the importance of water hygiene and conservation practices. Our goal is to conduct workshops and training sessions that will empower residents with knowledge about maintaining the systems and understanding the health benefits of clean water. Ultimately, we envision a future where communities are self-sufficient in managing their water resources sustainably.

Target Communities and Beneficiaries

The project will focus on rural communities that are currently facing significant challenges in accessing clean water. These areas often lack infrastructure and resources, making it difficult for residents to obtain safe drinking water. By targeting these underserved populations, we aim to make a meaningful impact on their health and well-being.

Our primary beneficiaries will be families living in these communities, particularly women and children who are often responsible for collecting water. Access to clean water will reduce the time spent fetching water from distant sources, allowing children to attend school and women to engage in income-generating activities. Additionally, we will work closely with local leaders and organizations to ensure that our efforts align with community needs and priorities.

Methodology and Approach

To implement this project effectively, we will adopt a participatory approach that involves community members at every stage. Initially, we will conduct assessments to identify specific needs and preferences regarding water access. This will include surveys and focus group discussions with residents to gather insights on their experiences and expectations.

Once we have gathered sufficient data, we will collaborate with local engineers and technicians to design solar-powered clean water systems tailored to the community’s unique context. The installation process will involve training local workers to ensure that they have the skills necessary for ongoing maintenance and operation of the systems. This approach not only builds local capacity but also fosters a sense of ownership among community members.

Solar-Powered Clean Water Systems Design

Advanced Filtration Technology

Each system consists of solar panels that harness sunlight to power pumps and filtration units. The design incorporates advanced filtration technologies capable of removing contaminants while ensuring that the water remains safe for consumption.

Reliable Storage and Monitoring

In addition to purification capabilities, the systems are equipped with storage tanks to ensure a steady supply of clean water even during periods of low sunlight. We will also implement monitoring systems that allow for real-time tracking of water quality and system performance.

Optimal Performance

This data will be invaluable for making necessary adjustments and ensuring that the systems operate optimally over time.

Project Implementation Plan

The implementation plan will unfold in several phases over a two-year period. The first phase will involve community engagement and needs assessment, followed by the design and procurement of materials for the solar-powered systems. Once materials are secured, we will move into the installation phase, where local workers will be trained alongside our technical team.

After installation, we will conduct a series of workshops focused on maintenance and hygiene education. These sessions will empower community members with the knowledge they need to care for their new systems effectively. Throughout the project, we will maintain open lines of communication with community leaders to address any challenges that arise promptly.

Capacity Building and Training Components

Capacity building is a critical component of our project. We believe that empowering local residents with skills and knowledge is essential for ensuring the sustainability of the solar-powered clean water systems. Training sessions will cover various topics, including system maintenance, basic plumbing skills, and best practices for water hygiene.

We will also establish a community management committee responsible for overseeing the operation of the systems. This committee will be trained in financial management to ensure that funds generated from any potential user fees are reinvested into system maintenance and future improvements. By fostering leadership within the community, we aim to create a model that can be replicated in other areas facing similar challenges.

Monitoring and Evaluation Plan

To assess the effectiveness of our project, we will implement a robust monitoring and evaluation plan. This plan will include baseline assessments conducted before system installation to establish key indicators related to water quality, access rates, and health outcomes. Regular follow-up surveys will track changes over time.

We will also gather qualitative feedback from community members through interviews and focus groups to understand their experiences with the new systems. This feedback will inform any necessary adjustments and improvements throughout the project lifecycle. By maintaining transparency in our evaluation process, we aim to build trust with community members and stakeholders.

Budget and Financial Plan

A detailed budget has been developed to outline the financial requirements for this project. The budget includes costs associated with materials procurement, installation labor, training sessions, monitoring activities, and administrative expenses. We anticipate funding from various sources, including grants from foundations focused on clean water initiatives, corporate sponsorships, and community contributions.

To ensure financial sustainability beyond the initial funding period, we plan to explore options for generating revenue through small user fees or partnerships with local businesses. This approach will help cover ongoing maintenance costs while reinforcing community ownership of the systems.

Conclusion and Potential Impact of the Proposal

In conclusion, this proposal presents a comprehensive plan for implementing solar-powered clean water systems in underserved communities.

Chris Bowen, the climate change and energy minister, last week announced an increase in taxpayer subsidies available for green energy projects under its successful capacity investment scheme (CIS).

The CIS and the government’s other clean energy subsidy scheme, the renewable energy target, do not extend beyond 2030, and the commission argued that the two programs should be replaced with “market-based incentives in the electricity sector”.

The commission also said the implementation of the new vehicle efficiency standard meant federal and state governments should phase out specific concessions for electric vehicles, including on fringe benefits tax, stamp duties and registration fees.

A new emissions-reduction incentive for heavy vehicles should also be introduced, the commission said.

The commission said it takes too long to develop green energy infrastructure and there are deep concerns that the government will not reach its 2030 climate targets, which include 82% of energy production from renewable sources.

The report called for an overhaul of how green energy projects are assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, to allow decision-makers to consider whether a project is important to Australia’s clean energy transition.

Martin Stokie, a commissioner who is leading the inquiry alongside Sterland, said Australia’s “sluggish and uncertain approval processes are not up to the task” of delivering the huge amount of clean energy infrastructure needed to meet national climate targets.

“Overdue reforms to the EPBC Act would both speed up approvals and better protect the environment,” he said.

The environment minister, Murray Watt, is reviewing the act as part of a new package of federal nature laws, which were shelved before the election after lobbying from mining companies and the Western Australian government.

The commission also made a series of recommendations to build the country’s resilience to the effects of climate change.

The interim report called on the commonwealth to lead development of a public database of all climate hazards, and a series of goals and policies to improve the resilience of houses.

Notably, the commission backed a climate resilience star-rating system that would reflect the potential damage from climate change.

“People’s experience of climate change will depend on the resilience of their home, but most lack the information they need to invest in upgrades,” Sterland said.

“As climate risks intensify, boosting our resilience can lower the costs of disaster recovery and create a healthier, safer and more productive Australia.”

The commission will now consult on its draft recommendations before the final report due at the end of this year.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0b6e6a7f81a5122689bb36af40e5406c0a552a2/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1aa9177d883187fbca80de9099e74bc7",N,,2025-08-03 10:59:26.465343

“Wildfire emissions in 2020 essentially negate 18 years of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.” In that year, wildfires released an estimated 127 million metric tons of CO₂—twice the amount produced by California’s entire power sector.
The consequences of ignoring wildfire emissions are no longer just ecological—they’re economic.
The USDA Forest Service and EPA have begun integrating wildfire emissions into national inventories.
But wildfire emissions are still excluded from the state’s formal climate goals.","When wildfires ravaged Los Angeles County earlier this year, they destroyed thousands of homes and caused exorbitant insurance claims. But a less obvious disaster also occurred: satellites detected massive plumes of CO₂, rivaling the yearly emissions of some small countries. In just days, the fires released more carbon pollution than all of California’s passenger vehicles emit in a month.

Yet none of it counts toward the state’s official climate ledger.

Despite California’s ambitious climate laws and sophisticated carbon accounting, emissions from wildfires are treated as natural disasters—uncontrollable and, therefore, unaccountable. But with wildfires now exacerbated by fossil fuel combustion, hotter weather, and poor forest management, experts say this blind spot is no longer defensible. Fires are both a consequence and a contributing factor to the climate crisis.

“Wildfires in California have become a major and growing source of greenhouse gas emissions,” said Michael Jerrett, professor at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health, in a study. “Wildfire emissions in 2020 essentially negate 18 years of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.”

In that year, wildfires released an estimated 127 million metric tons of CO₂—twice the amount produced by California’s entire power sector. Because these emissions originate from trees rather than smokestacks, they are often excluded from climate inventories due to a technicality known as the “fast carbon cycle.” The idea is that forests will eventually reabsorb the carbon they release. However, with longer fire seasons and declining ecosystems, that reabsorption is no longer assured.

Today’s wildfires burn hotter, spread faster, and start more easily than those of decades past. Rising global temperatures, prolonged drought, earlier snowmelt, and increasingly dry vegetation are all part of the equation. So is human encroachment into fire-prone areas, which increases ignition sources—from cars to power lines—and puts more lives and infrastructure at risk.

""In a warmer world, we’re already seeing more extreme wildfires that put both people and nature at risk,"" said Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for The Nature Conservancy’s publication. ”More than a century of fuel build-up, past land and fire management, fire exclusion, and expansion into the wildland-urban interface all play a part.”

Carbon Risk Is Becoming A Financial Liability

The Global Wildfire Information System estimates that wildfires release between 5 and 8 billion tons of CO₂ each year—roughly one-fifth of the total emissions from the entire cement industry, one of the world’s biggest polluters. These fire-related emissions are often viewed as byproducts of global warming. But that’s changing.

The consequences of ignoring wildfire emissions are no longer just ecological—they’re economic. Wildfires disrupt everything from supply chains and insurance premiums to asset valuations. Companies with fire exposure may experience a decline in their valuations, particularly as investors scrutinize climate-related risks.

A McKinsey study found that 83% of Fortune Global 500 companies have climate-related targets; however, far fewer address nature-based threats, such as wildfires, drought, or land degradation. This leaves firms vulnerable not only to physical damage but also to shareholder lawsuits and director liability.

Some institutions are responding. The USDA Forest Service and EPA have begun integrating wildfire emissions into national inventories. Platforms like Climate TRACE, which use satellites to monitor pollution in real-time, reveal that we underreport carbon sources, including wildfires. Meanwhile, reinsurers and insurers—who shoulder billions in wildfire losses—are calling for climate-adjusted pricing.

And S&P Global Ratings and Moody’s warn that utilities with wildfire exposure face mounting credit risks unless they invest in prevention, resilience, and emergency planning. The real-world results and the remedies?

Few examples illustrate the financial fallout of fire-driven climate risk better than PG&E. The utility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2019, overwhelmed by $30 billion in liabilities linked to fires between 2015 and 2018. Investigators determined that PG&E’s equipment caused several major blazes, including the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most destructive in California history.

The company emerged from bankruptcy in 2020 after agreeing to a $13.5 billion settlement with fire victims and pledging billions toward safety upgrades. The utility has become a case study in the cost of ignoring climate exposure. PG&E now routinely shuts down power during high-risk conditions. While controversial, Hawaiian Electric and PacifiCorp employ similar tactics.

Climate Leadership Requires Carbon Accountability

The bankruptcy also changed how the entire utility sector views risk. Companies now invest in vegetation management, grid modernization, and predictive analytics. But even these steps only address the triggers and technical solutions—not the obvious disconnect centered on carbon math.

California continues to lead the nation in climate policy, with ambitious targets for zero-emission energy and net-zero emissions by 2045. Governor Gavin Newsom has invested in forest thinning, prescribed burns, and firefighting capacity. But wildfire emissions are still excluded from the state’s formal climate goals.

“The debate is over around climate. Just come to the state of California. Observe it with your own eyes,” Newsom said in 2020, surveying wildfire damage.

That line captured both the urgency and irony. While California acts boldly on decarbonization, it still underestimates one of its largest and fastest-growing sources of CO₂. The result is a policy blind spot with global implications.

When California’s fires take out the forests and emit more CO₂ in a single season than the state’s power sector, we are not addressing the climate crisis—we are just greenwashing it.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6882405ba76b1047490137e0/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-08-03 11:00:41.606345

The world’s first factory designed to make green jet fuel from ethanol is expected to start operations before the end of the year after several delays, according to owner LanzaJet Inc.

The $200 million facility in rural Georgia, initially scheduled to start commercial production last year, is now expected to begin operating by the end of September, LanzaJet Chief Executive Officer Jimmy Samartzis said in an interview. The latest delay was the result of equipment issues, he said.

LanzaJet, which received US government funds to build the facility, is being closely watched as a barometer for the success of the nascent ethanol-to-jet industry. The company imported Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol last year to pilot production, but more than a year later, it hasn’t been able to sell its green jet fuel in the open market.

“My hope is that by the end of the third quarter we are fully operating,” Samartzis said. “The modifications we made to the equipment that was hindering us, unrelated to the technology itself, should satisfy what we need.”

A flurry of deals among airlines, fuel makers and agriculture companies have been announced since 2021, when then President Joe Biden called for 3 billion gallons of annual domestic sustainable aviation fuel production by the end of this decade. The market has since soared more than sevenfold to 38.7 million gallons last year, according to US government data.

Green jet fuel, or SAF, can be made from a range of raw materials. But most American corn-ethanol isn’t low-carbon enough to qualify for a tax credit aimed at boosting production of domestic renewable fuels, known as 45Z.

The new law also states that the tax credit only applies to producers of SAF made using ingredients from North America. That’s freezing out the very sugar cane ethanol from Brazil that LanzaJet plans to use.

Still, Samartzis said production at the Soperton, Georgia, facility will start with Brazilian ethanol even if the company can’t benefit from the credit. That’s because only a scant amount of US product meets the required threshold of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 50%.

LanzaJet said it plans to switch to American feedstocks as soon as possible, with Samartzis now advocating for a threshold on emissions reduction of as low as 30%. The company’s factory in Georgia will produce 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel a year when operations eventually start.

As Maxine Joselow and Lisa Friedman explain in the New York Times, the finding established that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health. “The Obama and Biden administrations used that determination to set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions from cars, power plants and other industrial sources of pollution.”

Without the endangerment finding, the E.P.A. would be left with no authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions that are accumulating in the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels.

New York’s newly announced Clean Mobility Program will provide funding for scalable, community-led demonstration projects highlighting micro mobility, ride sharing, and community-managed “on-demand shared transportation” options.

The Governor’s office believes these solutions could help lower air pollution in the state while offering residents affordable connections to services, jobs, and transit. Objectively needed wins, in other words – and even more needed in traditionally underserved communities.

Governor Hochul gets it

“Even as the federal government walks away from clean air and energy standards, New York continues to invest in modern, flexible and efficient electric transportation options that improve air quality and expand affordable consumer choices,” explains Governor Hochul. “Our priority is linking communities, including areas that have been historically marginalized, with resources that provide residents with a variety of flexible transportation options that allow them to conduct their daily business uninterrupted.”

The program is the latest of the state’s recent EV funding initiatives, and the official release (on the New York State website) announced more details about The Clean Mobility Program:

The Clean Mobility program offers up to $21.6 million for projects across New York State and will award up to $3 million per project, with priority given to projects in disadvantaged communities, as defined by the Climate Justice Working Group.

Additionally, up to $8 million is set aside to fund demonstration projects located in specific areas of the state, including those served by the upstate investor-owned utilities. This includes a total of up to $5 million for micro mobility projects in the Central Hudson, National Grid, New York State Electric & Gas, and Rochester Electric & Gas region and up to $3 million for any type of eligible demonstration projects located in the Bronx.

Proposals for demonstration projects must include a completed planning document that includes community engagement, site identification and operations, project partner identification, technical feasibility assessment, and a policy and regulatory feasibility assessment. Any e-bikes or e-scooters deployed in these projects must meet industry and state safety standards to be eligible.

Proposals are due on September 25, 2025 by 3:00 PM EST. For more information on this funding opportunity please visit the NYSERDA’s website.

Electrek’s Take

Times Square banned cars in 2009 and New York City implemented congestion pricing earlier this year, angering exactly the right people in exactly the right way for exactly the right reasons. In both cases, the plans worked, the problems were solved for, and the lives of the people of New York improved. Governor Hochul’s latest plan is sure to be the latest in an ever-growing line of green success stories.

NBC Connecticut's Mike Hydeck spoke with DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, who gave an explanation on how Connecticut is going to press ahead.
Mike Hydeck: So the offshore wind projects coming and going, right?
So one of the things that's been happening previous, up until now, some people are fighting back against solar projects.
Katie Dykes: That's definitely a huge concern, not just here in Connecticut, but across the country.","Piece by piece, the Trump administration is changing the way the federal government considers clean energy projects. Subsidies are going away for electric vehicles.

Wind and solar projects are losing federal funding that were in place during the Biden administration.

So how is all this going to affect Connecticut?

NBC Connecticut's Mike Hydeck spoke with DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes, who gave an explanation on how Connecticut is going to press ahead.

Mike Hydeck: So first thing, zero emissions goal for our state is 2050. With all the changes in federal funding, is that still possible? I mean, it's still a while away.

Katie Dykes: Actually 2040. It's just around the corner, but that said, we've been investing for many years in zero emission resources, including investing in keeping the Millstone nuclear facility around. That's an enormous contributor to helping us meet that 100% clean supply.

Mike Hydeck: That was a controversial deal. Some people weren't very happy about that.

Face the Facts

Face the Facts with NBC Connecticut goes beyond the headlines, asking newsmakers the tough questions, giving an in-depth analysis of the big stories.

Katie Dykes: That's true, but we saved more than $2 billion by ensuring that that facility could keep going so we wouldn't have to replace it with other possibly dirtier sources of power. So in the long run, it's been a really good investment. But in addition, we know that investments in offshore wind and solar and energy efficiency have really been contributing to help keep keep our grid affordable and help to achieve that zero carbon supply.

Mike Hydeck: So the offshore wind projects coming and going, right? So we have the one in Bridgeport that disappeared. We have the, you know, the other one, it's great that we still have.

Katie Dykes: So we actually have the Revolution Wind project and also a Vineyard Wind project that's backstopped by Massachusetts are under construction right now. If you go down to New London, the state pier is busy as they're deploying turbines. Together those projects, which are expected to come online next year, at pretty affordable prices, because we locked in those prices before the pandemic. They're going to be supplying about a 5% additional supply of energy to New England.

Mike Hydeck: So it's clean energy, but people are concerned about prices, and the concern of wind power in the beginning and because it's a nascent industry by comparison, that it's going to be more expensive.

Katie Dykes: Sure. These are projects that, again, we locked in this pricing before the pandemic, so it's pretty competitive. It was more for newer projects coming online recently that we were seeing those prices starting to go up. But at the same time, we've been investing in solar. That's been another really important resource. We see the importance of solar from an affordability and reliability perspective, helping our grid. Just this summer, as we've seen, you know, really hot, hot weather conditions, we've seen, you know, like 2,000 megawatts of solar operating at those hot peak afternoon times when everybody's AC is cranking. And that's really provided a lot of benefit in terms of avoiding having to turn on more expensive generation resources that produce air pollution.

Mike Hydeck: So let's jump into solar. So one of the things that's been happening previous, up until now, some people are fighting back against solar projects. There's one in Ansonia that's in a lawsuit. Farmers protested in another town because they didn't want their solar field expanded. You unveiled a new tool on how to try to be more transparent about how these projects are considered, what is it?

Katie Dykes: Right. So we have debuted this tool called the Community Renewable Energy Eiting Tool, or CREST. And this is a GIS map based tool to help us locate…

Mike Hydeck: And GIS stands for?

Katie Dykes: Geographic Information Systems. But think of it as your Google Maps or Google Earth for really being able to drill down and help developers who want to propose these projects, but also municipalities and stakeholders try to figure out where is the best place to put more solar that will minimize the types of conflicts with other things we care about, like protecting core forests and protecting farmland, but also making sure that the facility is in a location where it's going to be able to plug in the grid relatively inexpensively. It's the sweet spot that we're looking for and and certainly we've seen, you know, that some projects have encountered some resistance. I think there have been a lot of lessons learned over time, but every developer I talk to, they want to avoid conflict as much as possible, because conflict adds to delay and adds to cost, and so we are excited about having this tool. So from the very beginning, we can help developers identify those places where they're going to be most welcomed and encounter the least amount of challenges.

Mike Hydeck: Now with credits going away, are you going to have a hard time finding developers to do these projects? Because if federal money goes away, then the state money starts to dwindle faster. Then what?

Katie Dykes: You bet. I mean, it's no secret the Trump administration has been singling out renewables like solar and wind to prevent them from being able to access federal tax credits that can help them, helping them maintain cost competitiveness. So DEEP has been working, you know, urgently to try to make sure we're doing everything that we can to help those projects that are already in the pipeline, make sure that they have the best chance to qualify before the tax credits go away. We hosted a webinar a week and a half ago to explore whether we should do a rapid RFP to contract for resources that may be eligible, as well as look at how we can streamline, make sure that those who are waiting on permits, that we can expedite the permitting process and just do everything we can, because that helps get these projects that were already under construction not be impacted by the whiplash that's occurring at the federal level.

Mike Hydeck: At least, gets finished, right?

Katie Dykes: You bet, and then in the longer term, of course, once the tax credits are going away, reducing some of those costs that are added when you have conflict at the local level and opposition, you know, from a project that's sited in a poorly chosen location. You know, if we can minimize those conflicts, we can actually save on the cost of the project,

Mike Hydeck: Right, because it's not spending more money just to try to get the project finished. So last question, moving forward, if all this federal money goes away, you know, we pay some of the highest rates for electric in the country. Do you expect that rate payers are gonna have to pick up part of the tab if that federal money goes away and the state money dwindles?

Katie Dykes: That's definitely a huge concern, not just here in Connecticut, but across the country. Look, we're, right now, not unique to New England, we're seeing states in every region are struggling with how to, we're seeing the demand for electricity is really increasing from data centers.

Mike Hydeck: AI data centers. Charging stations if we build that out.",https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/2025/03/Solar-Panels.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-08-03 13:01:45.702456

According to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the UK’s green economy grew by more than 10% last year, supporting 951,000 jobs and contributing more than £83bn of GVA. And, crucially, Britain has built not just a green industrial base but a global financial ecosystem, centred on London, capable of deploying capital into decarbonisation efforts in more than 60 countries.

This race for investment is one in which the UK should aim to finish on the podium. To achieve this, government and finance need to work in partnership and it’s here that fractured politics poses maximum danger.

The geopolitical consensus that delivered the Paris Agreement is broken. Financial institutions are stepping back or deferring their net zero commitments. But the reason for such moves is important. It is not because investors no longer believe in the economic opportunity. HSBC, which has deferred its net zero commitment to 2050, cited “the present lag in policy measures and the overall slower pace of the transition”. In other words, finance is going more slowly because governments are. Instead of partnership, we risk creating a vicious circle of political backsliding and the deferring or cancellation of transformative investment.

This creates an opportunity for the UK. Even as geopolitics fractures, Britain can become the investment destination of choice for the next wave of transition technologies. Much of the $2.1tn invested in 2024 went into mature sectors such as renewables, grids, electric vehicles and storage. In addition to continuing to scale up these 21st-century industries, the opportunity also lies in developing the next wave of climate solutions: hydrogen, sustainable fuels, electrified heat, carbon dioxide removal and nature restoration. It is here that the UK can seek to lead.

These sectors are currently underfunded because they are less mature and harder to finance. That’s where government needs to step in with clear policy and the provision of public capital through institutions such as the National Wealth Fund – to help “de-risk” investment and bring in private capital.

The UK has previously led the world on climate-related governance, with the 2008 Climate Change Act creating legally binding targets. It now needs to lead on the next challenge: delivery. Every UK government since the Climate Change Act has accepted the science and set ambitious goals. Finance and business must rise to meet them – and they need policy clarity, predictability and investable pipelines to do so. The upshot will be an economic imperative set as much by investors as by government.

Claims from politicians that wind power is too expensive are not supported by evidence. Besides being clean, it’s the cheapest energy source after solar. Long-term renewables are an economic opportunity that will defy the political cycle, setting a long-term investment agenda that will deliver growth, jobs and resilience in the face of our changing climate.

#2 Tesla Model 3 — The electric sedan scored 10,807 registrations in June.
* My name suggestion for this cheaper and more spartan version of the crossover is the Tesla Model Y Leonidas.
Still, these are necessary steps to help the EV market to become more diversified and less stereotypically crossover-heavy.
It is now at 27.8% share, a market share that is comparable to BYD’s in China and Tesla’s in the USA.","EVs are picking up in Europe, with some 361,000 plugin vehicles being registered in Europe in June. That’s up 23% year over year (YoY).

This is a particularly positive sign when considering that the overall market (currently at ~6.8 million units YTD) does not look good this year (5% decline in June, -1% YTD).

Interestingly, while BEVs seem to be slowing down, growing just 16% YoY in June to 242,000 units, PHEVs are picking up the pace, jumping 40% YoY in June. They were spearheaded by the #3 BYD Seal U PHEV (aka euro-spec BYD Song PHEV), but other Chinese makes are also helping out, like Chery’s Jaecoo and Geely’s Lynk & Co. PHEVs scored close to 120,000 sales in June, and their YTD numbers are now up 24% to close to 600,000 units.

As such, June saw the plugin vehicle share of the overall European auto market grow to 29% (20% full electrics/BEVs), keeping the year-to-date numbers at 26% (18% for BEVs).

Comparing the EV best sellers in each size category with their respective ICE best sellers, one can see that there is still a lot to be done.

Generally speaking, the EV best seller in each size category is still far from reaching the overall podium, with the exception being the midsize category, where the Tesla Model Y reigns supreme. But even here, things looked better a few months ago when the Tesla Model 3 was 3rd.

Now that the US sedan is in decline (more on this down below), it’s been replaced on the podium by the Volvo XC60. The model is heavily electrified, with two out of three XC60 sales come from the PHEV version, but it is still better to have a 100% BEV model on the podium than a two-thirds PHEV.

But let’s get back to June’s EV sales. The big highlight this month was Tesla’s #1 plus #2 win, maybe one of their last in Europe. Here’s a more detailed analysis on the top 5 EVs this month:

#1 Tesla Model Y — Tesla’s crossover retained its Best Seller status in June, thanks to 24,073 registrations. This is a slight 1% increase over its sales in June 2024. With the German-made EV profiting from its recent refresh, the crossover is looking to at least get close to its sales levels of 2023 and 2024. Considering all the hubris around the Texan brand, this result is welcome good news in a company where everything else seems to be falling apart…. Basically, Tesla is still floating thanks to the Model Y.

#2 Tesla Model 3 — The electric sedan scored 10,807 registrations in June. That represented exponential growth month over month (MoM), but a horrible 48% drop YoY. With the brand focussing on the refreshed Model Y, which is benefitting from higher discounts than its sedan sibling(!), and developments of new versions, like the Tesla Model Y L and a more decontented and cheaper version*, the Model 3 is being left out in the cold. This means that the sedan should continue to lose sales and podium presences will become more rare.

* My name suggestion for this cheaper and more spartan version of the crossover is the Tesla Model Y Leonidas. You are welcome, Tesla….

#3 Skoda Elroq — The recently introduced Elroq scored another record performance, 9,825 registrations in June. Will we see it go north of the 10,000-unit mark in September? Volkswagen Group has struck gold with this one. Despite minimum effort (basically, it slightly shortened its successful Enyaq), Skoda won a top three presence AND did it without significantly hurting the Enyaq’s sales. The longer crossover actually increased its sales by 8% YoY in June. Although not as spacious as its bigger sibling, it compensates for that with a competitive price, starting at 34,000 euros, which makes it one of the cheapest compact crossovers on the market, Chinese included. Could this be the new value-for-money king? This great performance allowed Skoda to score some 16,000 BEVs in June, a great result for the Czech brand.

#4 Renault 5 / Alpine A290 — The sporty hatchbacks won another top 5 presence in June, with the French duo scoring 7,788 deliveries. The EV enthusiasts’ choice, for a number of reasons, starting with its dropdead gorgeous looks and ending in the hot hatch–like handling, the 5/A290 has enough going for it to attract a wide audience, even if it is not as wide as their ICE siblings, the Renault Clio and Dacia Sandero. Then again, that’s not their responsibility, as both the Sandero and Clio will receive their own EV versions a couple of years from now.

#5 BYD Seal U (BEV+PHEV) — BYD’s star player delivered a record 7,182 sales (720 of them being of the BEV variety), with the model staying on the best sellers list in Europe. While the Seal U, the euro-spec version of the veteran Song, isn’t class leading specs-wise, it compensates for that with competitive pricing, which is especially appealing in the PHEV version that starts just below 40,000 euros, a killer price for a midsize SUV. Just for an idea, the value-for-money minded Skoda Kodiaq midsize SUV starts at 45,000 euros, with a 1.5 MHEV engine and 150 hp, while the cheapest Seal U PHEV costs 5,000 euros less, is more powerful, has a combined power of 217 hp, AND, as a cherry on top, still offers 80 km of electric WLTP range. Not bad, eh?

Outside the top 5, the highlight comes from Volkswagen, which saw the new Tiguan PHEV beat the Volvo XC60 PHEV and take the plugin hybrid category title, thanks to a record 5,234 units. With over 100 km electric range, and DC charging, the German crossover specs make it a decent PHEV effort, so I wouldn’t be surprised if it started to win the category title more often.

Another model shining was the #8 BMW iX1. With 6,499 sales, it had its best result in 18 months, comfortably outselling its direct rivals, the #19 Mercedes EQA and #13 Audi Q4.

Outside the top 20, the big highlights were the Polestar 4 hitting a record 2,966 units, helping the Sino-Swedish brand to get much needed sales volumes, and the VW ID.Buzz scoring another record performance, 2,757 sales.

Speaking of VW’s neo-retro Hippy Van, the German-made EV is helping MPVs to have something of a resurgence. This family-friendly vehicle category is seeing its sales jump 99% YoY this year, well above the 24% average, allowing MPVs to have 3% of the market. Sure, it is still a small portion of the market, but sales are going in the right direction. MPV segment growth beat almost every other vehicle category, with the exception being the even more niche sports cars/coupés/convertibles category, which we could call Sports Specialties. That segment grew 209% YoY, gaining a grand total share of … 0.3%.

Still, these are necessary steps to help the EV market to become more diversified and less stereotypically crossover-heavy.

And as I have been saying for years — MPVs will rise again!… [Editor’s note: Knowing José for about 10 years, I can confirm that he has been on this bandwagon for a long time, and his heart is fully in it. —Zach]

Looking at the 2025 ranking, there were plenty of changes. The Tesla Model 3 had its expected end-of-quarter surge, but this time it wasn’t enough to recover the #2 spot from the VW ID.4, giving strength to the idea that, after three (2022/23/24) consecutive #1 plus #2 wins by Tesla in the model table in Europe, 2025 will be the year that this kind of domination will start to fade.

Even the 3rd spot is all but guaranteed for the Tesla sedan, as plenty of models (Renault 5, VW ID.7 & ID.3…) are dangerously close and could surpass it. The rising #8 Skoda Elroq could especially become an adversary too strong to contain in Q4.

And with the Tesla Model 3 in a seemingly downward spiral (it is down 35% YoY this year, while in June it fell by 48% YoY), 2015 could see the US sedan stay below the European EV podium for the first time since 2018!

The remaining changes allowed the #15 VW Tiguan PHEV, #16 Ford Kuga PHEV, and #17 Volvo EX30 to climb a position each, benefitting from another disappointing performance from the Citroen e-C3.

Finally, the BMW i4 surpassed the Toyota C-HR PHEV and is now #19, with the Japanese crossover now feeling the heat from the #21 Cupra Born, which is only some 200 units behind.

Looking at the plugin auto brand ranking, this time the leader, Volkswagen, has lost share (11.2% in June vs. 11.5% in May), but it still holds a comfortable 2.2% share lead over #2 BMW.

This means that the German make is on its way to finishing a three-year Tesla reign (2022/23/24) in Europe, winning its first manufacturer title since 2021.

Speaking of Tesla, the Texan automaker profited from its end-of-quarter push, raising its share by 0.9% from 5.2% to 6.1%, and thus climbing into … 4th. Not bad, but … we are talking about the trophy holder. Tesla’s 2024 title was its 3rd in a row. And now it is fighting for a spot in the top 5.

The end of an era?

Below the top 5, growing #7 Skoda rose from 5% in May to its current 5.1% share. The Czech brand is probably the best candidate for a top 5 presence, and also a welcome addition to the table, as Volkswagen is the single mainstream brand in the top 5, followed by four premium makes.

Having Skoda on the best sellers table will be a good sign of EVs going mainstream. Fingers crossed….

A deserving mention also goes to BYD, which is already appearing on the radar with 4.1% share, a 0.1% increase over May.

Arranging things by automotive group, Volkswagen Group is firmly in the lead, despite losing 0.3% share in June. It is now at 27.8% share, a market share that is comparable to BYD’s in China and Tesla’s in the USA. This is an important metric for the German conglomerate if it wants to stay relevant in a fully electrified global automotive market.

If you can’t win at home….

BMW Group (10.5%, down from 10.6% in May) remained in the runner-up position in June, while #3 Stellantis is in its long hard road to hell (9.2% in June vs. 9.5% in May). With too many brands and too little money to develop them, maybe it would be good to sell a couple of them? Say, Lancia and Maserati? Both storied makes need attention and lots of money in order for them to develop and flourish, and right now, these two items are in short supply at Stellantis….

And do something about DS. Either reintegrate it into Citroen, or make it a proper premium brand. But for that, you will need patience and money. After all, making a successful French premium brand is something for decades, not years. Just look at what Renault is doing with Alpine.

But back to the top 5, Hyundai–Kia (7.9%, down from 8.1% in May) remained in 4th, but has seen Geely (7.8%, up 0.1%) get closer, and might threaten the Korean’s 4th position.

Despite seeing Volvo lose sales, Lynk & Co, Zeekr, and Polestar are compensating for the Swedish brand’s falling sales, thus keeping Geely on a growth path.

Finally, a note on the recent USA-EU tariff agreement.

Regarding EVs, it’s not as bad as it seems. Here’s how it works:

The EU didn’t want to impose tariffs on US-made cars because the biggest US exporters to the EU are … German brands. (BMW X5, Mercedes GLE, etc. are made in the US and exported here.) So it didn’t make sense to do that.

Regarding Tesla, things won’t change much. The Model Y is already made here in Germany. The Model 3 is cheaper to make in China than in the US, even with the tariffs on China as they stand.

Regarding the Cybertruck and Semi, the most important question isn’t the tariff or the price, but the regulations, which are different here in Europe. Thus, this difference in tariffs doesn’t make much difference to the viability of selling both in Europe.

The Model S and X could see their prices reduced, but it doesn’t solve their main problem: they are models that are more than 10 years old, and as such, not very competitive.

In conclusion, there will be a little more competition at the top end of the market, but the rest will be the same.

As for US buyers, there will be less choice. Cheaper models will probably be canceled, and the ones that stay will cost more. Still, most best selling European models in the USA are already made there, so … it’s not as bad as it seems.

And I am talking about the EV niche. Regarding the larger agreement, I am not an expert on trade, but personally, both options (going to a trade war or trying to reach an agreement) were worse than what was there before. You can choose one or the other; I’m not a politician, so I don’t have to choose. 😄

But have no doubt, neither of the two options are better than what was there before. Whoever says otherwise either doesn’t know, or is a politician looking for easy votes.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-06-Europe-OG-Image-1600x890-1.png,N,,2025-08-03 12:05:10.615220

Political realignments in state regulatory bodies, particularly public utility commissions (PUCs) and energy agencies, are redefining the rules of the game for clean energy investors. These changes are not just policy tweaks; they are strategic recalibrations that could either accelerate the clean energy transition or create a patchwork of regulatory hurdles. For investors, understanding this evolving landscape is critical to navigating opportunities and mitigating risks.

The Rise of Performance-Based Regulation: A Game Changer

State PUCs are increasingly adopting performance-based regulation (PBR), a framework that ties utility profits to metrics like renewable energy deployment, grid resilience, and energy efficiency. This marks a departure from traditional cost-of-service models, which rewarded utilities for building more infrastructure regardless of environmental impact.

In 2025, 30+ states are piloting or expanding PBR programs, with jurisdictions like Hawaii, Illinois, and New York leading the charge. These models incentivize utilities to invest in solar, storage, and grid modernization while penalizing reliance on fossil fuels. For example, Hawaii's PBR framework rewards utilities for achieving 100% renewable energy targets, while New York's PBR includes penalties for grid failures during extreme weather events.

Investors in companies like NextEra Energy (NEE) and Enphase Energy (ENPH)—which provide grid modernization and renewable infrastructure—stand to benefit from PBR-driven demand for clean tech. However, this shift also creates risks for traditional utility stocks tied to legacy infrastructure.

Federal Rollbacks and State-Level Pushback

While the federal government has rolled back climate policies under Executive Orders like Unleashing American Energy, state energy agencies are doubling down on clean energy in response. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has provided a lifeline, offering $369 billion in clean energy incentives that states are now leveraging to offset federal inaction.

For instance, California and New York have used IRA funding to fast-track offshore wind projects and EV charging networks, while states like Colorado and Minnesota are expanding community solar programs. These efforts are supported by PBR frameworks that align utility profits with decarbonization goals.

Yet, the patchwork of state policies introduces complexity. A clean energy project approved in New York might face delays in Texas due to differing regulatory priorities. Investors must now evaluate opportunities on a state-by-state basis, factoring in local PUC dynamics and political climates.

The Deregulation Dilemma: Risks for Renewable Energy

The Trump administration's 2025 executive orders—such as eliminating subsidies for wind and solar, imposing tariffs on imported energy components, and streamlining fossil fuel permitting—pose significant risks. These policies are mirrored at the state level in conservative-leaning regions, where agencies are prioritizing domestic oil and gas over renewables.

For example, the administration's “zero-based regulatory budgeting” approach has led to the expiration of long-term clean energy incentives in states like Wyoming and North Dakota. Meanwhile, tariffs on solar panels and wind turbine parts have increased project costs, making renewables less competitive against natural gas.

Investors in solar and wind companies must now weigh the potential of states like California and New York against the regulatory headwinds in others. Companies like First Solar (FSLR) and Vestas Wind Systems (ENR.DC) are seeing mixed performance, with growth in progressive states offsetting declines elsewhere.

Strategic Investment Opportunities in a Fragmented Landscape

Despite the challenges, state-level policy shifts are creating new avenues for innovation. Here's how investors can position themselves:

Grid Modernization and Energy Storage:

PBR frameworks prioritize grid resilience and flexibility, driving demand for companies like Tesla (TSLA) (via its Powerwall and Megapack) and Fluence (FLOU). Investors should monitor PBR adoption rates in their target states.

State-Specific ETFs and Funds:

Diversify across regions by investing in state-focused ETFs like the iShares MSCI New York Index (EWN) or iShares MSCI California Index (EZUC), which capture exposure to states with aggressive clean energy agendas.

Environmental Justice and Equity-Focused Projects:

States like Illinois and New Mexico are using IRA funds to subsidize low-income electrification programs and community solar. Companies like Sunrun (RUN) and SunPower (SPWR) are well-positioned to benefit.

Hybrid Energy Models:

In deregulated states, companies that combine renewables with fossil fuels (e.g., Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD) investing in carbon capture) may gain regulatory favor.

Navigating the Risks

The biggest risk lies in overexposure to states with anti-clean energy policies. For example, the Department of the Interior's centralized permitting process under Secretary Doug Burgum has stalled solar projects in Utah and Nevada. Investors should avoid companies reliant on federal permitting in conservative states and instead focus on states with stable regulatory frameworks.

The EV sector also faces headwinds. With federal subsidies for EVs eliminated, companies like Tesla may see slower adoption in states that haven't stepped in to fill the gap. However, states like California and Massachusetts are offering their own incentives, creating a split in market potential.

Conclusion: The State of the Future

The clean energy transition is no longer a monolithic federal initiative—it's a mosaic of state-level experiments. While federal rollbacks create uncertainty, state PUCs and energy agencies are stepping up to fill the void. For investors, this means both opportunities and risks, depending on where they choose to allocate capital.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 19:00:22.880459

Here are five e-bike brands you can shop that prioritize U.S.-based manufacturing.
Electric Bike Company is an incredibly transparent e-bike company, with a whole video outlining exactly how each bike is crafted and detailing the behind-the-scenes action.
Hi Power Cycles is another fantastic e-bike brand to look into if you're prioritizing goods from America.
When you take the time to find an e-bike manufactured in America, like Co-Motion Cycles e-bikes, you're making life easier on your future self when you potentially need to fix or replace parts to extend the life of your e-bike.","Finding an item that's fully made in America can be like trying to find a needle in a haystack. If you look closely at most of the major e-bike brands in the U.S., you'll see that a lot of the companies assemble their e-bikes in the United States, but the parts used to assemble them are often manufactured in other countries.

E-bikes from these major retailers aren't necessarily bad bikes — many of them are among the best electric bikes you can buy right now. However, if you're looking to support the American economy by investing in an e-bike that's both manufactured and assembled in America, you should steer clear of most big-name brands.

Meanwhile, other brands have prioritized keeping the manufacturing process within the States. This doesn't mean that certain raw materials needed to craft an e-bike aren't imported from other countries — the U.S. simply doesn't have access to all the raw materials needed — but instead, it means that as much of the manufacturing and assembly process as possible is completed in America. Here are five e-bike brands you can shop that prioritize U.S.-based manufacturing.

According to Electric Bike Company, every e-bike is built to order in Southern California, from the frame to the fenders, to the coats of paint, and almost everything in between. In addition to making sure everything is customized just the way you want it, the company says it prioritizes building in America to ensure the e-bikes don't receive any unnecessary markups due to importation, and also to allow the team to ""cherry-pick materials and accessories from suppliers around the world.""

After the bike is assembled by Electric Bike Company in the U.S., it's then inspected and tested in America as well before finally being delivered to the customer's door. Electric Bike Company is an incredibly transparent e-bike company, with a whole video outlining exactly how each bike is crafted and detailing the behind-the-scenes action.

The fenders and chain guards used in Electric Bike Company's e-bikes are made with real walnut and maple wood. Each rim is hand-spoked and then run through a machine to ensure each individual spoke is at the perfect tension, allowing for even wear on the tires. Even the e-bike batteries are assembled in America, too.

Bike Friday has manufactured its e-bikes in America for over 33 years, and the company doesn't have any plans to change this strategy in the future. According to Bike Friday, ""over 95% of the bike industry has moved production overseas,"" making its commitment to stay in the U.S. even more impressive.

The company is required to source some parts from other countries because there's no manufacturer or raw materials available in America right now. This includes parts like tires, chains, and shifters, but nearly everything else is made or assembled in the U.S., specifically in Eugene, Oregon.

American-made e-bikes like these may never earn the title of best budget e-bike, as materials and wages tend to be higher in the U.S. compared to many of the Asian countries that other big e-bike brands use to outsource manufacturing. But if you're looking to support the American economy and help fund living wages for local jobs, Bike Friday is certainly worth that premium.

Hi Power Cycles is another fantastic e-bike brand to look into if you're prioritizing goods from America. The company was founded in 2008 by two brothers, Chris and Derek Hunt, and despite adding multiple new team members since its founding, Hi Power Cycles has always crafted each bike from scratch in a Los Angeles warehouse. The company writes, ""We take great pride in our company, our commitment to customer service, [and] our commitment to manufacturing in the USA, and it shows in the products we sell.""

In a Reddit comment from Chris with Hi Power Cycles, he specifies that as much as possible is done in the U.S., which includes mitering, welding, heat treating, powder coating, and otherwise creating the aluminum frames. He goes on to explain that the battery systems are welded and packaged in America, and the wheel spokes are hand-cut and cold-rolled to size here, too.

Unfortunately, not all components can be sourced in America, but Hi Power Cycles doesn't try to hide this. Chris explains that the e-bike motors come from China, only because ""no one makes any bike motors we have access to in the USA."" That said, Hi Power Cycles is currently ""looking for a potential grant ... to manufacture [its] own motors,"" so this could be another component to add to the American-made list in the future.

There are many things you should know before buying an e-bike, but perhaps one that's not mentioned as frequently as it should be is knowing where your e-bike is made. Of course, the holy grail for supporting your local economy is finding a company that manufactures and assembles its e-bikes in America.

While this is a positive choice in its own right, there's an added perk to American-made bikes: They're often easier to source replacement parts for. When you take the time to find an e-bike manufactured in America, like Co-Motion Cycles e-bikes, you're making life easier on your future self when you potentially need to fix or replace parts to extend the life of your e-bike.

Co-Motion Cycles has been making e-bikes in America for the last 30 years, with a factory nestled in Eugene, Oregon. The company prides itself on hand-crafting high-quality results, saying, ""Every bike we make is for an important person who has cast their vote for quality. For American manufacturing. ... For a real human touch from start to finish."" That said, an e-bike from Co-Motion Cycles will cost you a pretty penny. For example, the Metolius e-tandem bike starts at $18,495.

Another company with a proud ""Made in the USA"" title is Detroit Bikes. The company makes both traditional bikes and e-bikes, and the entire U.S. Chromoly line of bikes is crafted in America. Detroit Bikes does sell a few entry-level bikes that are largely manufactured in China, and then assembled in the company's factory. However, frames in the U.S. Chromoly line utilize a high-end steel material called chromoly and are all made in America.

In a large 50,000-square-foot factory in Detroit, the company does ""complete assembly and wheel building on [its] US Assembly bikes,"" ultimately producing up to 150 frames and assembling up to 400 bikes every single day. At the factory, bikes made with chromoly are ""cut, coped, bent, welded, painted, assembled, and packaged."" If you're ever in Detroit, you can even visit the factory to see how bikes are made and potentially view all the production stages for yourself.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/5-e-bike-brands-that-are-manufactured-in-america/l-intro-1753786505.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 12:04:33.626713

Their comments were part of an EnergySage report that highlighted optimism in the industry — shared among large companies and family-owned businesses alike — despite federal policy changes that will sunset tax incentives early.

""It's kind of the American dream,"" Gold Path Solar co-founder Alex Hay told EnergySage.

The leader of the Ohio-based company said that ""going solar"" is now akin to home ownership. The constantly improving, high-tech panels that convert sunrays into electricity are part of a job-creating sector that can reduce or eliminate household utility bills.

EnergySage is a trusted resource that can help you navigate all the incentives — local, state, and federal — to ensure you get the best price for adding panels to your property. The experts can even help you compare quotes from pro installers. Savings can reach up to $10,000 off the upfront costs.

The expert advice is timely, as the so-called ""Big Beautiful Bill"" ends 30% federal tax credits early on Dec. 31, according to NPR. But the sun will come out tomorrow, the experts interviewed by EnergySage reported.

""All the things that people tend to associate with American values — that's what solar is,"" Hay said in the story, referencing the free market and solar's ability to provide energy independence.

QCell, with American headquarters in California, is the country's second-largest solar manufacturer behind First Solar. The company added production sites in Georgia to meet demand, company official Scott Moskowitz told EnergySage.

""Slowly but surely, this stuff is getting reshored. And in some cases, there's incentive to do it directly. Ideally, there will be solar factories all over the country,"" the vice president of marketing strategy and industry affairs said.

The report noted that the United States has risen from 14th to third on the list of global solar manufacturers. It's a sector that has created more than 263,000 jobs nationwide. Solar accounted for about 7% of all U.S. electricity generation last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association and S&P Global.

EnergySage offers a mapping tool that allows customers to view the average cost of systems by capacity in each state. It's not uncommon for sizable setups to be priced at more than $30,000. That's why action to lock in rebates before they expire is paramount. Investments from foreign companies to manufacture panels in America, combined with breakthrough technology from around the world that improves efficiency and longevity, can help lower costs.

Solar panels have multiple benefits in addition to reducing electricity expenses. If the power is stored in a battery such as Tesla's Powerwall, homeowners can use it later, serving as outage protection. Panel owners participating in virtual power plants can sell the extra energy back to the grid. What's more, you can use free solar power to charge your electric vehicle, too.

Renewable energy is produced without heat-trapping air pollution, which, according to NASA's experts, is linked to increased risks of blackout-causing severe weather, heatwaves, and floods. Some places may even become uninhabitable due to the high temperatures, per the researchers.

By investing in solar, you can take control of your electricity source and reduce the amount of planet-warming gases being released from dirty fuels.

“The company expressed intent to hold that against the economics of joining a (regional transmission organization),” Gilman said.
Joining forces with the California operator would give Xcel Energy broader access to cleaner forms of energy, Turner added.
Blank said the push by some parties to steer Xcel Energy to EDAM rather than the other marketplace would make integrating systems across Colorado difficult.
The Westminster-based utility is in the process of joining the Southwest Power Pool’s regional transmission organization.","Despite concerns from its staff, consumer and conservation groups, the Colorado Public Utilities Commission has endorsed a plan by Xcel Energy to join a new regional marketplace for wholesale electricity.

Two of the three PUC members voiced support in a hearing Wednesday for Xcel’s application to join the Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+, a so-called day-ahead market being formed by the Arkansas-based transmission organization and about 30 organizations.

The commission will issue a written order.

The new marketplace will allow Xcel and other utilities to buy power a day ahead, aimed at keeping electricity flowing more efficiently and cost-effectively. Xcel’s joining a day-ahead market is considered a step toward moving to an organized wholesale market, which a state law requires Colorado transmission utilities to do by 2030. The motivation is to coordinate resources across the region, get more renewable energy on the grid to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet growing demands for electricity.

However, Megan Gilman, the commissioner who opposed Xcel’s application, contended the utility failed to show, as required by PUC rules, that the benefits of joining Markets+ outweighed the costs. She voiced concerns that the cost of joining the day-ahead market, seen as a temporary step, could delay or derail Xcel’s move to an organized wholesale market.

An organized wholesale market is a centrally managed organization that facilitates the buying and selling of electricity and other services across a region. A 2021 PUC report said utilities’ full participation in that kind of market or a regional transmission organization could produce savings of $230 million annually.

About 60% of the nation’s electric power supply is managed by regional organizations, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However, most of that is in the East.

PUC Chairman Eric Blank said he is focused on the potential of saving millions of dollars per year as the purchase and transmission of power become more coordinated across the region.

“For me, incurring these small losses in the near term potentially creates an opportunity to save orders of magnitude more per year,” Blank said. “Although we’re a long, long way from realizing this level of savings, it seems worth trying to me.”

But Gilman noted the law requiring transmission utilities to eventually join a more centralized market allows for waivers. She said Xcel could cite the costs of joining the day-ahead market as a reason for seeking a waiver.

“The company expressed intent to hold that against the economics of joining a (regional transmission organization),” Gilman said.

Xcel, Colorado’s largest electricity provider, said in documents filed with the PUC that the costs of participating in Markets+ will include $2 million for the first phase of starting the organization; $14 million annually for operations for the first five years, then $10 million per year; and an estimated $13 million to $15 million for Xcel to integrate its systems with the marketplace.

The conservation group Western Resource Advocates said in a statement filed in the case that testimony showed Xcel’s costs would exceed net benefits by $30 million through 2032 and cumulative benefits wouldn’t surpass cumulative costs until 2039. For the company’s customers to reap any benefits, Xcel would have to stay in Markets+ through 2038, the group said.

“This means the company would also presumably have to delay the 2030 requirement to join an (organized wholesale market) by nine years,” Western Resource Advocates said.

The PUC staff said Xcel’s application didn’t meet the requirement that joining the marketplace is in the public interest because the company couldn’t show that the expected benefits would outweigh the costs. The staff noted that Xcel witnesses conceded during a hearing that joining Markets+ and recovering the costs for technology upgrades “will result in increased production costs through at least 2038.”

Considering the costs, staffers said it would be reasonable for the commission to deny the application. If the application is approved, the staff recommended monitoring the costs, reliability of the market and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to determine whether Xcel’s continued participation in the marketplace would be warranted.

In the public interest?

“We believe this decision was not in the best interests of ratepayers, grid reliability, or the state’s clean energy goals. And legally, the decision does not appear to be based on the law or the Commission’s own rules, and we will be asking the Commission to reconsider,” Brian Turner, regulatory director at Advanced Energy United, said in an email.

The industry group believes a better path for Xcel Energy would be to join Extended Day-Ahead Market, or EDAM, which is operated by the California Independent System Operator. The organization manages the operation of the electricity transmission grid across California and is also involved in a marketplace across 11 Western states.

The extended day-ahead market is set to launch in 2026, according to the California operator’s website. A report by the Environmental Defense Fund in June said Xcel Energy could save an average of $13.2 million a year if it joined EDAM instead of the Southwest Power Pool’s Markets+. One reason is more availability of renewable energy.

Turner said a bill is moving through the California legislature that would transfer the governing structure of the California Independent System Operator to a separate organization. The current board of directors is appointed by the California governor, but that would change if the legislation passes.

Joining forces with the California operator would give Xcel Energy broader access to cleaner forms of energy, Turner added.

Blank said the push by some parties to steer Xcel Energy to EDAM rather than the other marketplace would make integrating systems across Colorado difficult. Others suggested that Xcel forego participating in a day-ahead market altogether and plan for joining a regional organization.

It is the third renewable power generation facility built and operated by Ameren Illinois in the last 28 years.

“At a time when the demand for electricity is outpacing supply in Downstate Illinois, more energy needs to be generated and connected to the grid faster to provide reliability and cost saving benefits for our customers,” said Lenny Singh, Chairman and President of Ameren Illinois. “Thanks to a provision in the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, the Peoria Solar Energy Center – alongside our two other solar facilities in East St. Louis – will produce clean, reliable, and equitable energy in the community, for the community.

The facility will be constructed on a 37-acre site on Prichard Road in northwest Peoria and feature nearly 5,000 solar panels which will harness energy from the sun and feed clean power onto Ameren Illinois’ distribution system.

The Peoria Solar Energy Center is a continuation of Ameren Illinois’ commitment to powering a stronger regional economy. In the last 7 years, the company has invested $112.4 million to improve reliability in the Peoria Metro area, including high voltage transmission infrastructure, new substations, and automation to detect outages and restore power faster.

Imagine waking up every day and being told your very existence is a threat — your pickup, your tractor, your job, your way of life. For the past 15 years, that’s exactly what Washington’s climate elite have been selling to the American people. And now, finally, someone had the guts to tear up the script.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to reverse its 2009 “Endangerment Finding” is more than a policy change. It’s a moment of truth. It’s a line in the sand where fear-mongering ends and common sense begins.

This so-called finding claimed that carbon dioxide — the gas we exhale, the same one that feeds the crops we grow — was a dangerous pollutant. And with that one bureaucratic ruling, Washington handed itself the power to regulate nearly every corner of the American economy. Farms. Trucks. Factories. Power plants. All under the guise of “saving the planet.”

Let me put it this way: It’s like declaring water a hazard because someone once slipped in a puddle. It gave the government an excuse to micromanage how much water you use, when you use it, and how much you’ll pay for it.

That’s exactly what happened with carbon.

We weren’t fighting pollution. We were fighting a narrative. A doomsday narrative wrapped in scientific jargon, funded by taxpayer dollars, and peddled by people who’ve never had to fill a diesel tank or check a thermostat during a polar vortex. While they held conferences and got awards, we got mandates, fines and higher bills.

But this reversal? It’s the sound of sanity returning.

This doesn’t mean we’re throwing trash in rivers or going backward on clean air. Quite the opposite. America already leads the world in emissions reductions without draconian controls. Our air is cleaner not because of fear-driven policies, but because of real innovation by real people.

Scrapping the Endangerment Finding says loud and clear: Carbon is not the enemy. Tyranny wrapped in lab coats is.

Let’s talk about what this means for real people:

For farmers, it means no longer being painted as climate villains for growing food.

For truckers and factory workers, it means fewer senseless rules designed by people who couldn’t change a tire if their life depended on it.

For families, it means maybe affording to keep the lights on and gas in the tank without choosing between dinner and heat.

And for all of us, it means reclaiming our right to debate, to question, and to stop being ruled by worst-case scenarios disguised as settled science.

The fear peddlers will scream. They’ll say we’re anti-science, reckless, even dangerous. But here’s the truth they don’t want to admit: When everything is an emergency, nothing is.

Science is a tool, not a weapon. It’s not supposed to be used to scare people into submission. It’s supposed to inform, to guide, and to help us weigh costs and consequences. And when science becomes dogma, that’s not progress. It’s just a fancier form of tyranny.

The EPA’s move is a win for the working class, for rural America, for anyone who’s tired of being lectured by people who’ve never set foot in the real world. It’s a long-overdue shift from feelings back to facts.

Thomas Sowell wrote: “When you want to help people, you tell them the truth. When you want to help yourself, you tell them what they want to hear.”

We’ve had enough of being told what we want to hear. It’s time we start telling the truth again. America works best when it trusts its people.

It concludes, at odds with the scientific mainstream, that policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions risk doing more harm than good.

Released on July 28, the report is part of an effort by the Trump administration to try to end the US government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases. It is the output of scientists known for contradicting the consensus embodied in volumes of research by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose work is approved by virtually every nation.

Publishing an alternate approach to the science of global warming on the same day that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said it

plans to revoke the endangerment finding

– a determination that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare – marks a step-up in the administration’s war on regulations.

Since its adoption in 2009, the endangerment finding has become the bedrock of many US environmental rules.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said repealing the finding would “end US$1 trillion (S$1.3 trillion) or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families”.

Climate experts say it will hobble the country’s efforts to rein in rising temperatures and lessen the impacts, such as more intense storms, droughts and wildfires. The federal government’s own research shows

climate-fuelled extreme weather

is already causing US$150 billion in losses a year in the US.

In its proposed rule to nix the finding, the EPA references the Energy Department’s report more than two dozen times. Energy Secretary Chris Wright wrote in the report’s foreword that he had commissioned it and selected the authors to form a working group.

The agency’s support for the contrarian research stands in contrast to the broad rollback of other climate work under US President Donald Trump.

Since his inauguration in January 2025, hundreds of scientists

have been dismissed from agencies

, including some who had focused on climate change. The EPA recently moved to shutter its main scientific research arm, which has been a crucial tool for policymaking.

The US

cancelled a landmark climate change report

, the sixth National Climate Assessment, and has taken down numerous webpages on climate science. Some of those were related to previous National Climate Assessments – studies that hundreds of researchers spent years painstakingly compiling.

The new report’s authors include Dr Steven Koonin, a fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution who has argued that climate science is “unsettled”; Dr Roy Spencer, a University of Alabama in Huntsville scientist and senior fellow at the climate-denying group Cornwall Alliance; and Dr Judith Curry, a climatologist formerly of Georgia Tech who testified to a Senate committee in 2023 that climate change has been mischaracterised as a crisis.

An Energy Department spokesman said the report’s authors “represent diverse viewpoints and political backgrounds and are all well-respected and highly credentialed individuals”.

The spokesman added that the report “was reviewed internally by a group of Energy Department scientific researchers and policy experts from the Office of Science and National Labs”, and that there will be a 30-day comment period for the public to weigh in.

Professor Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles, said the report presents a series of arguments the administration can draw on to contend “public health and welfare is not endangered by emissions that come from the auto sector, from the trucking sector, from the electricity sector”.

Rather than denying climate change is occurring, Prof Carlson said: “What they’re trying to say instead is, ‘Well, it’s not so bad. It’s really expensive to mitigate. And that expense actually harms people more than anything we could do to slow it down.’”

That is in keeping with past comments by members of Mr Trump’s Cabinet that have downplayed global warming or public concern about it.

Prof Carlson said the report is “a wholesale assault” on climate science and previous policy.

Dr Zeke Hausfather, the climate lead at Stripe and a research scientist at non-profit Berkeley Earth, has contributed to major US and international climate reports. He described the Energy Department publication as “scattershot” and said it “would not pass muster in any traditional scientific peer review process”.

That the administration released it after taking down webpages hosting “the actual, congressionally mandated National Climate Assessments”, he said, is “a farce”.

The report is a “package of punches” against the scientific consensus that previously grounded US climate policy, and against that policy itself, said Dr Jennifer Jacquet, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami. “It’s really surreal to think that’s where we are in 2025.”

The EPA will have to go through the lengthy federal rulemaking process to try to abolish the endangerment finding. If the proposed rule is finalised, legal challenges are inevitable. The issue could end up before the Supreme Court, which ruled in 2007’s Massachusetts v EPA that greenhouse gases were pollutants the EPA could regulate under the Clean Air Act.

Getting the court, which now has a conservative supermajority, to overturn the 2007 decision may be the endgame, said Prof Carlson. The effort would be risky but could succeed, she said.

“I think on every front, the arguments that the (EPA) administrator is going to make – based on the Energy Department report – are extremely weak,” said Prof Carlson. “But we also have a court that’s very hostile to environmental regulation.” BLOOMBERG",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/fe7e295a640a39689de6dab66b35ecbf16f28f3a12cdceede6a721ce9e0f87c2,N,,2025-08-03 12:04:25.184874

Appointing someone with industry ties to a board that is supposed to protect the public from utility wrongdoing “reflects incredibly poorly on Governor Whitmer”, said Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy associate with the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition non-profit.
Whitmer appointed Carreon to the MPSC board in July 2023 to fill a partial term.
Environmental groups in June lambasted the decision, which they alleged came amid pressure from DTE and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s second largest utility monopoly.
“We need an MPSC that’s willing to say no to the utilities, otherwise we mess things up for decades,” Gilmer-Hill said.","Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has effectively ousted a clean energy advocate from serving on a board that regulates the state’s energy utilities monopoly, and replaced her with someone who environmental groups charge is an “industry ally”, campaigners say.

The groups allege the move was made at utility giant DTE Energy’s behest because it was unhappy with Michigan public services commission (MPSC) board member Alessandra Carreon’s position on clean energy and opposition to rate increases, among other issues.

Each MPSC board vote is important because the commission is made up of three gubernatorial appointees, and Whitmer’s decision amid a debate over rate increases could slow the state’s ambitious clean energy transition and lead to higher energy bills, opponents warn.

The decision marks the latest in a series of environmental controversies for Whitmer, a Democrat whose name has been discussed as a potential leading candidate for the party’s nominee for president in 2028, but now faces increasing scrutiny over her record.

Appointing someone with industry ties to a board that is supposed to protect the public from utility wrongdoing “reflects incredibly poorly on Governor Whitmer”, said Chris Gilmer-Hill, policy associate with the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition non-profit.

“This is part of this pattern of this administration being very quick to give utilities what they want and not giving Michiganders what they need,” Gilmer-Hill added.

Whitmer appointed Carreon to the MPSC board in July 2023 to fill a partial term. Among other causes, Carreon was an advocate for greater public involvement in and transparency around the arcane regulatory process for utilities at a time when public frustration over DTE’s poor service and high rates has steadily mounted.

In a highly unusual move, the governor announced in June that she would not renew Carreon’s appointment. Environmental groups in June lambasted the decision, which they alleged came amid pressure from DTE and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s second largest utility monopoly.

“My understanding is that DTE and Consumers were very unhappy with recent decisions the commission has made around the utilities’ profit margin,” Charlotte Jameson, chief policy officer of the Michigan Environmental Council, told the Detroit News at the time.

Many of the state’s top environmental groups signed an 18 June letter to Whitmer that stated they were “deeply concerned” with the decision not to renew Carreon’s appointment and potentially replace her with someone who has “clear conflicts of interest or strong industry allegiances”. They urged the governor to reconsider.

Whitmer did not. In mid-July, she appointed Shaquila Myers, who, during the 2023-2024 legislative session, was chief of staff for former Michigan House speaker Joe Tate, a pro-business Democrat. He faced a stunning revolt from his own party in December because he generally refused to allow votes on legislation opposed by big business, and was seen by many as hostile towards environmental causes.

Despite a chorus of calls for change, Tate did not allow multiple utility reform bills to move through the legislature.

“There was a quiet, steady refusal to do anything but ignore [utility] bills,” said Rachel Hood, a former Democratic state representative who served with Tate last session, and has worked on energy policy in Michigan for nearly 20 years.

Hood characterized Myers as “not just an industry ally”, but also “deeply enmeshed in the governor’s policy agenda”.

“And it’s clear that the governor is pushing DTE’s agenda to the best of her ability,” Hood said.

DTE and Consumers are among the state’s powerful political forces. The former, either via the company, its employees or its affiliated dark money non-profit, has given millions of dollars in campaign donations to Whitmer or the state Democratic party over her two terms.

Meanwhile, a 2022 analysis found DTE had donated to all but 10 of 148 state legislators the previous session. Amid furor over prolonged power outages that left hundreds of thousands of people in Michigan without power for days in late 2023, DTE’s affiliated dark money non-profit gave Tate $100,000. Tate would not let a 2023 reform bill aimed at improving accountability and affordability be introduced in committee.

“This is Michigan’s powerful political entities acting to maintain their way of life and their balance sheets,” said Hood.

Meanwhile, Tate and Whitmer ushered through a datacenter bill that may derail Michigan’s climate goals.

Whitmer’s office did not comment, but a Whitmer spokesperson sent statements on behalf of DTE and Consumers. The utilities separately sent their own statements in which they both denied involvement in the process.

In its statement, a DTE spokesperson said: “Our team at DTE works collaboratively with the MPSC commissioners and staff to ensure we’re providing safe, reliable, cleaner and affordable energy to our customers and the state of Michigan.”

The move comes at a particularly critical juncture. The MPSC is weighing over $1bn in proposed rate increases between the two companies, and each are slated to deliver to the MPSC formal long-term plans for delivering power. Commissioners have the power to shape those proposals with decisions about billions of dollars in infrastructure.

The MPSC has not allowed a DTE proposal to build a methane plant, and advocates fear that decision could be reversed with Myers on the board, Gilmer-Hill said.

Meanwhile, the utilities are negotiating datacenter deals that could result in dramatic cost increases to customers and take a toll on the environment if they are not checked by the MPSC, Gilmer-Hill added.

“We need an MPSC that’s willing to say no to the utilities, otherwise we mess things up for decades,” Gilmer-Hill said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f58ef0e0619a1269c21d9833633ff2df42907861/1431_222_4156_3324/master/4156.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=50e0ce0fc6ea9fa97e20b507363e5d7e",N,,2025-08-03 08:02:28.661825

Of the $2.8 billion in funding initially available for the environmental and climate justice program, about $500 million has not yet been obligated.","A coalition of nonprofits, tribes, and local governments is suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) over the termination of $2.8 billion in environmental and climate justice grants for disadvantaged communities.

One member of that coalition is located a few miles off the coast of the Bering Sea. The Native Village of Kipnuk (Qipneq), Alaska, is built on thawing permafrost. Qipneq means ‘bend’ in the Native Yup’ik language, referring to the village’s location along the meandering Kugkaktlik River.

In recent years, high water has become a common phenomenon in Kipnuk, as the riverbanks become destabilized by melting permafrost, flooding, and erosion. Stronger storms in the region exacerbate damage to the village’s infrastructure.

The Native Village of Kipnuk is a federally recognized Tribe with around 1,700 members, including about 800 members who live along the river in Kipnuk. The Tribe relies on the surrounding land for subsistence living, and historically, members moved around the region following a nomadic lifestyle. But after the government built a school along the Kugkaktlik River in the 1930s, many families moved to the village of Kipnuk.

Today, erosion rates along the riverbank are between 10–28 feet a year, according to Rayna Paul, the village’s environmental director. And despite a number of assessments having been conducted in Kipnuk by the state and federal government over the past 15 years, the Tribe has yet to see any action to protect their community from high water.

“There’s been so many assessments that our tribe is getting tired of them,” said Paul. “They just want some action done.”

Earlier this year, it appeared that action might be on the horizon. Kipnuk was awarded a $20 million Community Change Grant under a $3 billion program from the EPA to carry out environmental and climate justice projects across the country. That program made $2.8 billion available for direct financial assistance to communities, local governments, and tribes. Kipnuk would use the money to address erosion along a stretch of riverbank that houses the community’s critical infrastructure, including the wind turbines that generate power, fuel tanks, several buildings, and the boardwalk connecting them.

The award was finalized in early January 2025, and Kipnuk’s project start date was set for March 1 of 2025. When the funds were made available in early March, Paul hired a bookkeeper to keep track of grant spending and posted a job vacancy for a project manager. But a few days later, the project’s funding flow was turned off as part of President Donald Trump’s federal funding freeze. By May, the Trump administration had terminated the EPA’s environmental and climate justice grant program altogether.

For Paul, who also worked to put together the grant application in 2024, receiving the termination letter less than two months into starting the project was a significant blow. Amidst frozen funds and the grant cancellation, Paul has still not been compensated for her time, including the months she put in leading up to the award. Relaying the news about the grant cancellation to the rest of the community has been “discouraging,” Paul said.

“Everyone I’ve spoken to was like, ‘Oh man, what are we gonna do now?’ Their hopes fell,” Paul said.

Since May, the Native Village of Kipnuk and more than twenty others who have had their grants canceled have signed onto a class action lawsuit against the EPA and the Trump-appointed administrator, Lee Zeldin. The lawsuit, which was filed June 25, will be heard in the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia August 5.

Broken Promises

The town of Clinchco, Virginia, is at the heart of Dickenson County along the McClure River in the southwest corner of the state. It’s among a number of former coal camps in the region dealing with the economic impact of the coal industry’s decline: the town’s poverty rate was over 40 percent at the last U.S. Census. For the population of around 300, building resiliency is made more complicated by floodwaters from increasingly intense storms, including Hurricane Helene.

During a series of listening sessions over the past several months, Clinchco residents dreamed up a multifaceted approach to economic and disaster resilience. They envisioned a new green space along the McClure River that would mitigate flooding and serve as a local dog park. They also started designing a resiliency hub equipped with backup power and emergency supplies for shelter in times of need.

Clinchco is one of five rural communities in southwest Virginia included in a $500,000 grant to the nonprofit advocacy group Appalachian Voices, which hosted the listening sessions.

The grant money comes from the EPA’s now-canceled environmental and climate justice program, the same pool of funding as for the grant awarded to Kipnuk.

Appalachian Voices held more than a dozen listening sessions with residents across the region to plan community-level projects that would be paid for by the EPA grant. Clinchco had requested approximately $40,000 for start-up costs associated with engineering designs, surveys, and permitting to pursue the resiliency projects.

Like others in the region, those projects are now “dead in the water,” according to Tina Deel, Clinchco Clerk of Council.

“It’s just heartbreaking,” said Deel. Without the grant money, Clinchco cannot afford to build the green space and resiliency hub on its own. Appalachian Voices’ new economy program manager Emma Kelly said that even with the help of state and private funding, projects like the one in Clinchco have been set back years.

“It was a lot of effort to get this initial application in, and now that’s all gone, and there’s not a lot of time and energy left to do that again,” said Kelly. “This promise has been broken.”

In towns like Clinchco that voted heavily for Trump, Kelly described a “widespread sense of betrayal and confusion,” particularly among former coal miners and their families who had believed the administration would support their interests. Deel said that she and others in the town were shocked that the funding had been withdrawn. She said it’s not an action by the Trump administration that she or others support.

A Power of the Purse Argument

When the hearing begins on August 5, much of the plaintiffs’ case will rest on the separation of powers between the three branches of government. Under the U.S. Constitution, the plaintiffs will argue that the executive branch does not have the authority to make decisions over programs that have been authorized and funded by the legislative branch.

Hana Vizcarra is a senior attorney at Earthjustice, one of the firms representing plaintiffs in Appalachian Voices et al. v. EPA. She said plaintiffs will argue that the EPA, an agency under Trump’s executive branch, violated the legislative branch’s “power of the purse” by canceling its environmental and climate justice program, which Congress created in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and section 138 of the Clean Air Act.

“This administration is trying to take power it doesn’t have,” said Vizcarra.

Last month, a Maryland federal district court ruled on another lawsuitagainst the EPA concerning canceled environmental justice grants. Vizcarra said attorneys will cite that case, Green & Healthy Homes Initiatives, Inc., et al. v. EPA as part of their argument on August 5.

There, the court found that the federal government violated the law by canceling grants made to regional grantmaking organizations selected to administer smaller grants to tribes, local governments, and community-based organizations. The Green & Healthy Homes ruling, which has been appealed by the EPA, did not go so far as to mandate the reinstatement of canceled funding for the three grantees involved, but it did make clear that the EPA cannot lawfully cancel grants on the grounds that environmental justice isn’t a priority of the current administration.

Rebecca Kaduru is the president of the Institute for Sustainable Communities, a plaintiff in Appalachian Voices.

The Institute for Sustainable Communities was selected as a national grantmaker for a portfolio of community-level grants ranging from $75,000 to $350,000 under the environmental and climate justice program. Kaduru said she believes the Green & Healthy Homes ruling sets up her organization’s case because it re-establishes grantmakers in some regions while organizations in others, like hers, are facing grant cancellations.

“There’s no reason why some Americans should have access and others not,” said Kaduru. “All Americans should have access to small grants for clean air and clean water.”

While there are similarities between the cases, Vizcarra stressed the two lawsuits differ in scope. Appalachian Voices is a class action lawsuit seeking a reinstatement of grant funding for all awardees impacted by the EPA’s cancellation of the environmental and climate justice program, not just the plaintiffs listed on the case.

The EPA filed a motion to dismiss the Appalachian Voices on July 14, arguing that the case is moot due to Congress’s recent passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). The EPA did not respond to the Daily Yonder’s request for comment for this story.

Attorney Ben Grillot with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is also representing plaintiffs in the case, said the OBBB does not amend any laws, like the Clean Air Act, to retroactively bar money from being spent on environmental and climate justice projects.

“The big beautiful bill did not change that language. What it did do was rescind any unobligated funds, but all the grants that have been awarded are in fact still obligated,” said Grillot.

Of the $2.8 billion in funding initially available for the environmental and climate justice program, about $500 million has not yet been obligated. Approximately $2.3 billion has been obligated in the form of awards made to grantees across the country.

Among the plaintiffs living or working in rural communities, there are mixed emotions leading up to the August 5 hearing. While some are cautiously optimistic about the funding being restored, for others, the damage has already been done.

In Kipnuk, the construction season is limited by Alaska’s long winter. If funds were to turn back on after the hearing in August, the village would have about a month to begin working on the riverbank before having to pause until next spring. In the meantime, community members continue to grapple with the impacts of riverine erosion, thawing permafrost, and flooding from storms that can take up to an acre of land at a time.

When asked whether there was hope the funding would be restored after the court case, Tina Deel of Clinchco said, “We’re not holding our breaths.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-08-03 13:02:33.074319

Investment Thesis For investors seeking exposure to the industrial renaissance, Ingersoll Rand offers a compelling mix of strategic agility and financial resilience.
Its EBITDA guidance, while conservative, is underpinned by a 1.7x leverage ratio and a disciplined approach to capital allocation.","In the shadow of a global manufacturing sector clawing its way out of a prolonged slump, Ingersoll Rand (NYSE: IR) has emerged as a standout industrial player, leveraging strategic acquisitions and operational discipline to position itself as a high-conviction growth story. With its 2025 EBITDA guidance lifted to $2,100 million to $2,160 million—a 4% to 7% increase year-over-year—and an aggressive M&A pipeline targeting life sciences and renewable energy, the company is betting big on the industrial renaissance. But is this momentum sustainable, and what does it mean for investors?

Strategic Momentum: M&A as a Catalyst for Growth

Ingersoll Rand's recent acquisitions—Lead Fluid, a Chinese fluid handling specialist, and Termomeccanica Industrial Compressor S.p.A. (TMIC), an Italian RNG compressor maker—underscore its focus on high-growth niches. These deals, part of a $47 million M&A push in Q2 2025, align with the company's “Economic Growth Engine” and “Execution Excellence (IRX)” strategies. The acquisitions not only diversify revenue streams but also plug gaps in its industrial technologies and life sciences portfolios, sectors poised to benefit from decarbonization and healthcare innovation.

The results are already materializing. The Industrial Technologies and Services (IT&S) segment reported a 7% year-over-year rise in orders, while the Precision and Science Technologies (P&ST) segment saw a 13% increase, despite organic order declines. These figures, coupled with a 16% growth in total backlog since 2024, suggest Ingersoll Rand is capturing market share in critical areas.

Financial Strength: Liquidity and Guidance Revisions

The company's financials tell a story of cautious optimism. With $3.9 billion in liquidity—$1.3 billion in cash and $2.6 billion in undrawn credit facilities—Ingersoll Rand is well-capitalized to fund its M&A ambitions and weather macroeconomic headwinds. Its 2025 EBITDA guidance, while modest, reflects confidence in its ability to offset margin pressures from integration costs and organic volume declines.

Notably, the company raised its full-year revenue outlook to a 4–6% growth range, up from 2–4%, citing strong order momentum and M&A synergies. This upward revision is significant in a sector where many peers are grappling with flat or declining demand.

Risks and Realities

No story is without shadows. Ingersoll Rand's adjusted EBITDA margin dipped to 27.0% in Q2 2025, down 0.4 percentage points year-over-year, due to lower organic volumes and acquisition-related dilution. The company also reported a GAAP net loss of $115 million, driven by non-cash impairments totaling $265.8 million. These losses, while non-recurring, highlight the risks of relying heavily on inorganic growth.

Moreover, the industrial equipment sector's PEG ratio of 83.4x suggests the market may be pricing in aggressive earnings growth. Investors must ask: Can Ingersoll Rand sustain margin expansion and justify its valuation premium? The answer lies in its ability to integrate acquisitions efficiently and maintain pricing power in a competitive landscape.

The Bigger Picture: Manufacturing's Quiet Revolution

The broader manufacturing sector is undergoing a transformation. Digital tools, AI-driven supply chains, and clean energy technologies are reshaping demand dynamics. Over 78% of manufacturers are investing in supply chain software, while hydrogen and electrification projects are accelerating. Ingersoll Rand's focus on RNG compressors and life sciences fluid handling positions it at the intersection of these trends.

Investment Thesis

For investors seeking exposure to the industrial renaissance, Ingersoll Rand offers a compelling mix of strategic agility and financial resilience. Its EBITDA guidance, while conservative, is underpinned by a 1.7x leverage ratio and a disciplined approach to capital allocation. The company's ability to navigate margin pressures while expanding its M&A pipeline—now more than halfway toward its annualized inorganic growth target—demonstrates operational rigor.

However, the path forward is not without challenges. Tariff uncertainties, supply chain bottlenecks, and macroeconomic volatility could test the company's resilience. For now, though, the fundamentals are in its favor.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 11:00:29.231866

Government policy on electric vehicles has reversed since Mr. Trump was elected.
U.S. electric vehicle sales rose just 1.5 percent in the first six months, according to Cox Automotive.
Republican aversion to electric vehicles rose again after Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump fell out.
Fear of not being able to charge is a big reason many people hesitate to buy electric vehicles.","Sales of Teslas are plunging. General Motors and other automakers are increasing production of big pickups and sport utility vehicles. Republicans have killed incentives for electric vehicle purchases.

Electric vehicles have clearly lost momentum in the United States. And combustion engine cars and trucks are enjoying a renaissance to the dismay of environmentalists who worry about air pollution and greenhouse gases.

But there’s reason to believe that electric vehicles will remain a significant part of the U.S. car market and that sales of these models will eventually grow again in the coming months.

Electric vehicles from Tesla and some other automakers are less vulnerable to President Trump’s tariffs than many conventional cars because more of their parts are made in the United States. Advocacy groups are conducting marketing campaigns to emphasize the lower fuel costs and other advantages of electric vehicles. And automakers appear to realize that they cannot give up on electric cars if they hope to remain competitive globally.

Washington has become hostile to electric cars.

Government policy on electric vehicles has reversed since Mr. Trump was elected. For consumers, the most visible change is the elimination of tax credits of up to $7,500 for electric vehicle purchases and leases.

The credits, which Democrats put in place when Joseph R. Biden Jr. was president, will now expire at the end of September under the big policy and tax law that Mr. Trump signed in July.

The president in June described the federal incentives for electric vehicles as a “mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody wanted.” The Biden administration’s goal was for half of new car sales to be electric by the beginning of the next decade, meaning it would still have been easy to buy a gasoline car.

Analysts expect a spike in electric vehicle sales as people rush to take advantage of the credit, but a sharp decline afterward. By 2030, there will be 8.3 million fewer electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids on U.S. roads than there would have been if incentives had remained in place, according to a study led by Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor at Princeton University.

Republicans have also abolished penalties for violations of clean air standards, which had pushed carmakers to produce electric vehicles. That has given carmakers a green light to produce more big pickups and sport utility vehicles that tend to be very profitable.

G.M. is among companies exploiting such policy changes. The carmaker, American’s largest, is investing $900 million to manufacture V-8 engines near Buffalo. Vehicles that run on gasoline or diesel now have “a longer runway,” Mary T. Barra, G.M.’s chief executive, said last month.

But carmakers cannot give up on electric models.

U.S. electric vehicle sales rose just 1.5 percent in the first six months, according to Cox Automotive. But globally sales rose 28 percent to 9.1 million vehicles, according to Rho Motion, another research firm. That figure includes the United States and Canada as well as China and the European Union.

Carmakers that ignore this fast-growing market may not be in business 10 years from now. Ms. Barra acknowledged as much. “Despite slower E.V. industry growth, we believe the long-term future is profitable electric vehicle production,” she said.

The growth of autonomous driving technology favors electric vehicles because it is much easier to integrate self-driving software into a car where all the systems are electronic.

“If you don’t electrify fast enough you’re also losing out on the autonomous transition, whenever that happens,” said Anil Khurana, a professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.

The quandary for G.M. and other automakers is that they do not yet make money from electric vehicles. Development costs are high, and sales volumes are too low to achieve the cost savings that come from mass production.

Ford said this week that it lost $1.3 billion on sales of electric cars during the second quarter, although it edged closer to profitability. Now that U.S. government policy has shifted in favor of fossil fuels, it will take longer for carmakers to turn a profit on electric vehicles.

Many groups remain committed to electric vehicles.

The ad highlights the easy maintenance of electric vehicles, which don’t require oil changes. “E.V.’s have fewer parts, fewer repairs and are less expensive to drive,” Mr. Offerman says. The ad is part of a $43.5 million marketing campaign funded by Electrify America, a subsidiary of Volkswagen that operates fast chargers in the United States and Canada.

Many states still offer rebates of several thousand dollars on electric vehicle purchases, as do some utilities. Residents of California, one of the most generous states, can receive up to $12,000 toward the purchase of an electric vehicle or plug-in hybrid if they scrap an older vehicle with a combustion engine and meet certain income limits.

But electric vehicle bashing by Mr. Trump, who has called them “lunacy” and a “hoax,” could be pushing some Republicans away from the technology, said Mike Murphy, the chief executive of the EV Politics Project, a group that seeks to end what it calls “the needless partisan divide over E.V.s.”

Republicans have long been skeptical of electric vehicles, but some showed more openness to the technology after Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, spent hundreds of millions of dollars to help elect Mr. Trump, Mr. Murphy said, citing survey data. Republican aversion to electric vehicles rose again after Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump fell out.

“The bashing does have an effect on Republican consumers,” said Mr. Murphy, who previously worked as a Republican consultant.

E.V.’s are getting better and cheaper.

Tesla’s sales have been declining since last year, falling 14 percent in the April to June quarter. But the decline stems, in part, from the company’s reliance on two older designs, the Model 3 and Model Y.

It is pretty clear that there is strong demand for electric vehicles if they are affordable, stylish and able to travel 300 miles or more between charges. G.M. more than doubled its sales of electric vehicles in the second quarter, helped by the Chevrolet Equinox, which has a starting price of around $35,000.

Tesla’s decline creates an opening for other carmakers to convince buyers to try electric models.

Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive, describes herself as an “E.V. skeptic,” but was impressed by a Hyundai Ioniq 9, a large electric sport utility vehicle, that she drove recently. “It looks familiar to me,” she said. “I’m not looking at it like it’s a spaceship.”

Ms. Keating said she expected sales of electric vehicles to grow gradually as more people like her become comfortable with the technology.

Electric vehicles typically cost thousands of dollars more than cars fueled by gasoline, but the tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on imported vehicles and parts could narrow the gap. Six of the ten most American-made cars are electric, according to Cars.com, an online car buying site. The top four are Teslas. Volkswagen’s ID.4 and Kia’s EV6, which roll out of U.S. factories, also made the list.

“Certainly the more that a vehicle uses U.S. parts, the less impacted they are by tariffs,” said David Greene, an industry analyst at Cars.com. But he added that retail prices would depend on how carmakers spread the cost of tariffs among different models.

The number of public chargers is growing even though the Trump administration has blocked federal funds that cover some of the cost. Nearly 17,000 new fast charging ports, which can recharge an electric vehicle in half an hour or less, will go into operation this year, the most in a single year, according to Paren, a research firm. Fear of not being able to charge is a big reason many people hesitate to buy electric vehicles.

Robert Barrosa, the chief executive of Electrify America, said that some of its stations were in almost constant use, and there are still not enough chargers. That provides a strong incentive to keep building more.

“When you look at this more from a global perspective, the E.V. space is taking off,” he said. “As much as people may try to push back against it, it’s coming.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/31/multimedia/00biz-evmarket-cpmt/00biz-evmarket-cpmt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 08:02:01.028736

China recognizes that rapidly and completely shifting to renewable energy production. Short and long-term energy storage provides the only path to a livable planetary future. Yearly, China installs about 60% of the world’s new wind and solar energy-based electrical power and is positioned to dominate the global market for these new technologies.

In contrast to old fossil fuel technology, renewables use virtually no water, produce no heat, toxic air pollutants and reconnect rich and poor societies, alike, with the unlimited inexpensive source of energy for our planet, the sun. How to make the transition to renewable solar energy quickly is a prime example of a multi-faceted, real world, wicked problem. Consider We Energies’ plan to produce electricity solely with net-zero carbon (greenhouse gas) emissions by 2050. Between 2005 and 2023, its emissions declined 54% as coal was replaced by natural gas. Renewable energy infrastructure would be built between 2023 and 2030 that reduced total carbon emissions another 26%.

Data centers, like Port Washington, present a 'wicked' problem

Something unexpected, something wicked, happened between 2023 and 2025. New energy demand nationwide shot up with the appearance of artificial intelligence applications or “AI” that use energy devouring, large language model computer programs like ChatGPT. In the next 5 years, data centers that house the hardware for such programs are projected to require 20-50% of all the new energy output of the U.S.

Locally, We Energies’ plan must now accommodate the Microsoft data centers under construction or planned in Mount Pleasant and Kenosha WI, which will utilize more energy than all the homes in the city of Madison. A much larger data center envisioned for 1900 acres of farmland west of Port Washington will eventually require as much energy as all the homes in the state of Wisconsin! Together, these data centers will impose at least a huge 40% increase in the production of base-load power during the next 5 years.

How would such a precipitous increase in energy generation impact the fundamental objective to make energy production carbon-free by 2050? There is little clarity about modes of energy generation for these data centers. Cloverleaf in Port Washington will only commit to employing 30-40% renewable energy for the first part of its gigantic facility.

With two other data centers in Beaver Dam and Wisconsin Rapids also being planned, Wisconsinites are facing the likelihood that carbon dioxide emissions will increase substantially not decrease in the future. In turn, efforts to get to net-zero carbon emissions, will be significantly slowed, if not thwarted.

Wisconsin leaders seem oblivious to impacts of data centers

The state legislature and executive branch seem oblivious to the outsized impacts that huge data centers will have on state-wide energy demand, availability, and cost, let alone their deleterious impact on bottom-line climate goals. It appears that legislators have not considered the environmental consequences of the enormous need for water to cool data centers.

Moreover, after construction, new sprawling data centers will provide few on-site jobs; most profits from their operations will be made almost entirely outside Wisconsin. Exactly, how will Wisconsin benefit from a plethora of data centers?

Finally, no one is talking about the gorilla in the room: A Chinese company, DeepSeek, has developed a generative AI program of comparable sophistication to American versions that operates with about 10% of the energy of its US counterparts. Its computer code is open-sourced so that anyone can use it and compete with big tech. Why do we need all of these voracious data centers when 10% of them will do?

We are faced with a wicked knot of interconnected problems and issues. Currently, requests for new energy infrastructure are considered independently by the Public Service Commission without evident recognition of the intertwined concerns of environment, human health, and the common good.

Collectively, we got ourselves into the existential climate change dilemma by not understanding and establishing policy based broadly on planetary limits not simply economic considerations. We can amend our ways by adopting “Integrated Resource Planning” to coordinate and integrate education, evaluation and decision-making about all facets of energy production and use. The “wicked knot” of climate change and data centers demands it.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.","Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics– dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries– and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com/?uuid=0959B351-6305-46AB-BCCF-836D537B7EB4&type=preview&q=75&width=1200&height=800,N,,2025-08-03 06:58:07.048828

Devastating extreme weather events are our new reality, no matter what state you live in.","Less than a month after I moved to Durham for graduate school, Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Helene, the deadliest storm to ever hit the state, took 108 lives and caused an estimated $48.8 billion in damage. Less than a year later, Tropical Storm Chantal killed six North Carolinians and did more than $56 million in damage to Orange County. This is just one of the 13 counties for which Governor Stein declared a state of emergency. The physical and emotional trauma being felt during this time reminds me of watching my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana struggle to overcome tragic extreme weather events.

As a Gulf Coast native, I’ve felt the presence of natural disasters my entire life. When I was three, I evacuated New Orleans with my mother and younger sister ahead of Hurricane Katrina. When the levees broke, my dad watched the water rise up, filling our street and submerging our front lawn, creeping up the steps to the top lip of our front porch. We were lucky the water began to drain before it could make it into the house.

As I grew older, I felt Katrina’s legacy in New Orleans. Many people were not as fortunate as my family – some lost their homes and others their lives. Some who made it out during evacuations or in the storm’s aftermath never returned to New Orleans. I worry for my family that still lives there.

Throughout my childhood and adolescence, we experienced other large storms. None were as seriously damaging as Katrina, but it was common to wake up to felled tree branches and flooded streets. In 2021, Category 4 Hurricane Ida whipped through New Orleans, leaving the city without power for over three weeks at the hottest time of the year. Unfortunately, such extreme weather experiences were not limited to my time in New Orleans.

The morning after Chantal hit Durham, my coworkers and I watched live news reports of the 130 casualties caused by flash flooding in Texas. Twenty-seven young girls were killed by the floods while attending a sleepaway camp similar to the one I attended for seven summers.

While watching these reports in shock and horror, I listened to people calling the disaster an unavoidable “act of God.” Of course, we should dedicate thoughts and prayers to the families suffering during this tragedy, but the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather is not random. It is directly attributable to human-induced climate change. To prevent future tragedies, we need accurate forecasts and warnings, timely federal relief programs, more resilient infrastructure, and climate action plans.

It is mystifying to me that the president claimed that he is investing in technology to protect people from extreme weather events on the same weekend he slashed support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and renewable energy. We need to be proactive, not reactive, and that means investing in climate adaptation.

Devastating extreme weather events are our new reality, no matter what state you live in. If it’s not a hurricane, it’ll be a tornado like the one that hit St. Louis in May of this year. Or wildfires like those that burned through Los Angeles in January. Or an extreme heat wave like the heat dome that is triggering heat alerts from Nebraska to Florida this past week.

As someone just starting to establish a career and life as a young professional, I fear the upcoming years during which extreme weather will become an even more powerful and disastrous force. Flooding from Chantal in Durham wiped out an entire suspension bridge in the Eno River State Park, where I frequently hike and recreate with friends. This is reality for my lifetime, and I want to do something about it.

We need to get serious about climate action. Without concerted environmental efforts, communities will continue to suffer, and people will needlessly die. We need to make our voices heard.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182574-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 08:02:31.915523

TL;DR:

Qatar has installed over 300 fast EV chargers nationwide as of 1 August 2025 under its green mobility initiative.

These DC fast chargers deliver high-power, rapid charging, often bringing EV batteries from 20% to 80% in under 30 minutes.

This infrastructure supports Qatar National Vision 2030 by promoting clean transport, reducing emissions, and enhancing convenience through digital tools.

On 1 August 2025, Kahramaa, Qatar General Electricity and Water Corporation, announced that Qatar has surpassed 300 fast electric vehicle (EV) chargers, a major milestone in building a robust EV ecosystem aligned with its sustainability goals. During a community engagement event at Al Thumama's Kahramaa Awareness Park, engineers and EV users gathered to assess charger performance, usability, and discuss future expansions. The mobile app showcased allows users to track charging sessions, receive real‑time updates, and report issues, increasing transparency and control for EV drivers. Kahramaa officials emphasised that public feedback will shape further infrastructure enhancements. Looking ahead, plans include expanding charger availability in residential areas, shopping malls, and public parking zones to meet growing demand from EV owners.

What are EV chargers and what makes them “fast”?

EV chargers, also known as electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE), come in two major types: AC chargers and DC chargers.

AC chargers (Level 1 & 2) supply alternating current which is converted within the vehicle’s onboard charger before entering the battery, these are slower and typically used at homes or offices.

DC fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter and feed direct current straight to the battery—offering power outputs ranging from 50 kW to over 350 kW and enabling rapid charging.

Charging speeds are categorized as:

Level 1 (trickle charging): Adds about 2–5 miles of range per hour.

Level 2: Delivers 10–30 miles of range per hour, suitable for overnight residential charging.

Level 3 (DC fast charging): Adds 20–60+ miles in just 15–30 minutes; ultra-fast chargers can deliver over 150 kW for even quicker fill-ups.

These fast chargers installed in Qatar fall under Level 3: high-voltage DC units capable of charging most EVs to 80% in under 30 minutes, ideal for roadside use, malls, and strategic hubs.

Why this expansion is important for Qatar

Supporting National Vision 2030

The EV charging rollout aligns with Qatar’s broader strategy to diversify energy use, lower carbon emissions, and nurture sustainable mobility avenues.

Enhancing Convenience and Reliability

Fast DC chargers reduce range anxiety, making EV ownership more practical, especially given that most users rely on public infrastructure while apartment charging remains limited.

Smart Infrastructure and User Engagement

Kahramaa’s mobile app, data tracking, and community dialogue models reinforce a user-centric approach, ensuring charger performance evolves with feedback.

Broader context: EV charging explained

EVSE devices support various connector standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, Type 2, and Tesla’s proprietary plugs, which differ regionally.

Smart chargers can optimise grid load, schedule charging during lower-tariff hours, and monitor performance, all of which are essential for modern EV networks).

The global EV charging landscape still navigates challenges like standardizing connectors and ensuring equitable access—a concern highlighted by users in Qatar living in apartments where charging access remains sparse.

Future outlook for Qatar’s EV ecosystem

Continued rollout of fast chargers in high-density and public zones to keep pace with rising EV adoption.

Broader integration of smart payment and scheduling tools, possibly incorporating Plug & Charge features like ISO 15118 for automatic billing and authentication.

Strategic planning to avoid grid strain as ultra-fast chargers proliferate, balancing speed and sustainability goals.

Qatar’s surpassing of 300 fast EV chargers marks a significant stride toward electrified transport under its Vision 2030 blueprint. These high-speed DC chargers offer rapid refueling, increased convenience, and drive cleaner mobility choices. Supported by smart apps, infrastructure engagement, and expansion plans, Qatar is accelerating into a greener transport future.

At the forefront of this effort is a groundbreaking development in battery technology. Researchers at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin have unveiled a novel approach to creating high-performance anodes for lithium and sodium-ion batteries. These advancements promise not only to enhance the efficiency of energy storage systems but also to provide safer and longer-lasting solutions. By challenging conventional norms, the scientists have opened new possibilities for rapid charging electric vehicles and other critical applications, marking a significant milestone in the energy sector.

Rethinking Battery Design with Targeted Disorder

Traditionally, battery materials have relied heavily on highly ordered crystal structures. This order was believed to enable predictable pathways for ion transport. However, this approach often results in structural rigidity and limited ion mobility, hindering performance at high charge rates. In a bold departure from this norm, researchers have discovered that targeted disorder can significantly enhance ionic conductivity.

In two studies published in Nature Communications and Advanced Materials, the team demonstrated that introducing imperfections in the atomic structure could increase cycling stability and unlock novel storage mechanisms. “Our results show that targeted imperfection can be a powerful tool in material design,” stated Professor Nicola Pinna. This approach could redefine material design strategies across the field, potentially leading to more sustainable high-performance batteries.

The researchers employed structural disorder in niobium-tungsten oxides and controlled amorphisation in iron niobate. This innovative strategy has produced particularly durable materials for lithium-ion batteries, offering new hope for the future of energy storage.

Prolonged Service Life and Enhanced Capacity

The benefits of these new materials extend beyond increased charge rates. Tests have shown that even after 1,000 charging cycles, these batteries retain a large portion of their original performance. The implications for consumer electronics and electric vehicles are profound, as these technologies demand reliable and long-lasting power sources.

Additionally, the team has developed a new material for sodium-ion batteries, which are considered an environmentally friendly alternative to lithium-based systems. This material undergoes significant changes upon its first charge but retains essential structures, resulting in exceptional storage capacity. Remarkably, it maintains a long service life of over 2,600 charging cycles with almost no loss in performance.

The introduction of an iron niobate with a columbite structure as a high-performance sodium storage anode is a significant breakthrough. This innovation offers a sustainable pathway for future battery technologies, addressing both environmental and resource concerns.

Big bill trickle

Trump’s big, beautiful bill cast a cloud over the budget work facing the General Assembly. Surely, North Carolina will get a trickle-down effect. It may require taking some state rainy day funds to clear the air and brighten the days for many of our affected residents.

Cooper support

With Congress seemingly determined to help billionaires at the expense of everyday Americans, slashing funding for healthcare, SNAP, FEMA, and public broadcasting, Roy Cooper stands in stark contrast. Throughout his tenure as governor, Cooper fought for the rights of every North Carolinian.

Whether adding hundreds of thousands of jobs, expanding access to healthcare or providing assistance to those hit by natural disasters, he has always put us first. North Carolina’s first competitive Senate race in over a decade comes with high stakes, being one of the only pick-up opportunities for the Democrats.

Cooper disdain

In the statement announcing he’s running for senate, Cooper said he had “prayed about it”. Progressives need not be alarmed by this language. Cooper still supports gay rights, open borders, transgender surgery for minors, men in women’s sports, anti-ICE protests and public funding for Planned Parenthood.

When he said he prayed about it he was only appealing to old-school Democrats who were raised in the Bible Belt. So take his aw shucks Mayberry prayer with a grain of salt.

Dunn on Cooper

Andrew Dunn paints himself “conservative,” and modern conservatism frequently recasts America’s liberal Enlightenment origins as conservative, emphasizing order, tradition and religion while downplaying secularism, pluralism and radical egalitarian ideals. This is less a direct continuation of founding ideology than a strategic reinterpretation. His assessment of Roy Cooper in his July 28 column continues that.

I am furious at Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd’s votes to confirm Emil Bove to a lifetime federal judgeship on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. This was no routine confirmation. Bove’s nomination was plagued by serious whistleblower allegations, including claims he suggested ignoring judicial orders and an alleged audio recording contradicting his sworn testimony. For a position demanding unwavering commitment to the rule of law, these concerns are disqualifying.

Sen. Tillis’s argument about last-minute information was a hollow excuse. The gravity of a lifetime appointment demands that all credible information, regardless of when it surfaces, be investigated. Dismissing concerns on procedural grounds, not substance, is an abdication of senatorial duty. Senator Ted Budd’s apparent disinterest in this critical issue is unacceptable. I expect scrutiny from my senators with priority on our courts’ integrity.

By voting “yea,” Sens. Tillis and Budd chose partisan loyalty over fundamental principles of judicial independence and accountability.

The move follows voter approval in February and marks a major milestone for the town’s sustainability goals.

The 26-kilowatt system, installed by Hampton-based Harmony Energy Works, was fully funded through a competitive Energy Efficiency Conservation Block Grant awarded to the Kensington Energy Committee last year. With no tax impact on residents, the project is expected to offset up to 70% of the town’s annual electric costs. It will offset 72% of the town hall’s electricity load— saving an estimated $7,000 each year. Additionally, the system is projected to generate approximately 35 Renewable Energy Credits, which are expected to yield roughly $1,000 annually.

Beyond its financial impact, the project sets a precedent throughout the state. It is the first system to be funded through the NH Department of Energy’s Municipal Solar Grant Program and the first to be aesthetically approved for installation on a historic town hall in New Hampshire.

To celebrate the launch, town officials and partners gathered for a community event, including representatives from Clean Energy NH, the Community Power Coalition of NH, the NH Department of Energy, and Harmony Energy Works, as well as members of the Kensington Heritage Commission and Energy Committee.

Designing the solar array for the historic building required close collaboration between the town’s Heritage Commission and Board of Selectmen to meet aesthetic and structural criteria. Both bodies voted unanimously in support of the effort, which was also backed by multiple state representatives and clean energy advocates.

The solar array is expected to serve the town for the next 30 years.

administrator and helped establish the power-plant rules based on the endangerment finding.","Ever since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson’s science advisory committee warned of the dangers of unchecked global warming, the United States has taken steps to protect people from these risks.

Now, however, the Trump administration appears to be essentially abandoning this principle, claiming that the costs of addressing climate change outweigh the benefits. The effect is to shift more of the risk and responsibility onto states and, ultimately, individual Americans, even as rising temperatures fuel more extreme and costly weather disasters nationwide, experts say.

“It’s a radical transformation of government’s role, in terms of its intervention into the economy to try to promote the health and safety of citizens,” said Donald Kettl, a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland’s School of Public Policy.

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, this week proposed to repeal the landmark scientific finding that enables the federal government to regulate the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet. In effect, the E.P.A. will eliminate its own authority to combat climate change.

Speaking at a truck dealership in Indianapolis, Mr. Zeldin said the E.P.A. would reverse a 2009 scientific conclusion, known as the endangerment finding, that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health. He said the agency would also rescind Biden-era regulations designed to reduce planet-warming emissions from automobile tailpipes.

While few people have heard of the endangerment finding, it has had a profound effect on society. Its establishment cleared the way for the Obama administration to set the country’s first limits on greenhouse gases from cars and power plants, with the goal of putting more electric vehicles on the roads and adding more renewable energy to the electric grid.

But Mr. Zeldin’s announcement was only the latest in a rapid-fire series of actions to weaken or eliminate protections against climate change.

In April the Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists and experts who had been compiling the federal government’s flagship analysis of how climate change is affecting the country. In May, Mr. Trump proposed to stop collecting key measurements of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as part of his 2026 budget plan. And since January he has called for eliminating or overhauling the Federal Emergency Management Agency to shift disaster response to the states.

“It’s never been the role of government to completely take care of people,” said Sarah Pralle, a professor of political science at Syracuse University. “But this conservative, anti-regulatory, anti-welfare-state ideology all comes together in kind of shifting risks back to individuals.”

The government has a track record of tackling environmental problems under both Democratic and Republican administrations. The E.P.A. itself was created more than a half-century ago by a Republican president, Richard M. Nixon. Environmental action “has to be done on a bipartisan basis and it also has to be on a bigger-than-federal-government basis,” Nixon said in 1970 before signing a law that required federal agencies to study the environmental consequences of major infrastructure projects.

Mr. Zeldin has struck a different tone.

This year, he essentially reoriented the E.P.A.’s mission away from environmental stewardship, saying the mission would now be to “lower the cost of buying a car, heating a home and running a business.” Building on that message this week, he said the endangerment finding had led to costly new regulations that burdened households and businesses. “We’re strangulating our own economy,” he said, adding that past administrations had found “new ways to put trillions of dollars of new handcuffs around the American family.”

Joe Aldy, a professor of environmental policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, said that by repealing the endangerment finding, the Trump administration was relinquishing the country’s historical role as a protector of public health. “The concern here isn’t just the attack on regulation,” he said. “There is this much bigger question of what does it mean to promote the general welfare?”

In response to questions, an E.P.A. spokeswoman, Brigit Hirsch, said in an email, referring to the 2009 endangerment finding: “How does a partisan policy from the mid-2000s qualify as a ‘time-honored American tradition’? E.P.A. is bound by the laws established by Congress and Congress never explicitly gave E.P.A. authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.”

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said that the endangerment finding had been misused to justify excessive regulation and that the administration was “putting everyday Americans First by restoring consumer choice and sidestepping the left’s out-of-touch climate policies.”

Governments have taken steps to protect citizens from environmental hazards for centuries. After cholera outbreaks in the mid-1800s, England worked to improve sanitation and water quality. In the United States, research into contaminated drinking water in the early 20th century led to investments in sanitation. And the Clean Air Act, enacted in 1963 and amended in 1990, helped solve issues including smog in Los Angeles, acid rain in New England and the depletion of the ozone layer high in the atmosphere.

“This is a real retreat from the social compact that I think has been dominant in the U.S. for some time,” said Margaret Levi, a professor of political science at Stanford University. “Part of government’s responsibility is to protect the health and well-being of its citizens to the extent that it can, and that does require some regulation.”

The Trump administration’s approach has supporters. Several conservative scholars and politicians applauded the imminent end of the endangerment finding, saying it had empowered the E.P.A. to restrict Americans’ choices of how to heat their homes and what kinds of cars to drive.

“The endangerment finding became a pretext for the agency, without congressional authorization, to impose centralized economic planning on the U.S. transportation and electric power sectors,” said Marlo Lewis Jr., a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a right-wing research organization.

Suzanne Jaworowski, Indiana’s secretary of energy and natural resources, said at the event in Indianapolis that the proposal was “a reaffirmation of common-sense government and moving away from years of regulatory overreach that I think we’ve all seen and felt, whether it was at the grocery store or the gas pump.”

The endangerment finding has sparked fierce legal and political battles in Washington for nearly three decades.

In 1999, several states and environmental groups filed a petition urging the Clinton administration to limit greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide from motor vehicles. In 2003, the Bush administration denied the petition, saying the Clean Air Act did not authorize the E.P.A. to regulate greenhouse gases.

Massachusetts challenged the denial in federal court, and the case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which issued a landmark 2007 decision affirming the E.P.A.’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases. The justices, emphasized, however, that the agency needed to demonstrate that those emissions threatened public health and welfare.

That’s what led to the E.P.A.’s 2009 endangerment finding, which concluded that, based on the scientific evidence, greenhouse gases do, in fact, endanger public health and welfare. In more than 200 pages, the agency outlined the science and detailed how increasingly severe heat waves, storms and droughts were expected to contribute to higher rates of death and disease.

“For so long at E.P.A., Republicans and Democrats have understood that they had a job to do, and that their job was dictated by the law, and they did not toss the science aside,” said Gina McCarthy, who served as Mr. Obama’s second E.P.A. administrator and helped establish the power-plant rules based on the endangerment finding.

“There may have been differences of opinion over what that science meant and how to do the regulations in accordance with what we understood the science said, but I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ms. McCarthy said. “They are basically just disowning their responsibilities entirely at E.P.A.”

Mr. Zeldin has rejected such allegations.

“Conservatives love the environment, want to be good stewards of the environment,” Mr. Zeldin said on Tuesday on a conservative podcast titled Ruthless. “There are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country.”

After the proposal to repeal the endangerment finding is published in the Federal Register, the E.P.A. will solicit public comments for 45 days. The agency will then finalize the rule, most likely within the next year.

The debate over the proper use of the government’s regulatory hand has been going on for centuries. Adam Smith, the 18th century philosopher and economist, argued that governments should play a limited role, emphasizing the importance of free markets and individual rights. A century later the philosopher John Stuart Mill contended that governments should promote the common good.

“What this government is doing is going outside the frame of that debate,” Ms. Levi said. “It’s not talking about what are the cost to citizens. It’s only really focusing on what are the costs to business, and denying the science that demonstrates there is a cost to the public.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/01/multimedia/00cli-climate-protection-01-tgcf/00cli-climate-protection-01-tgcf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 06:01:16.945480

Some of them, it’s renewable energy.
Those industries should be right here in Virginia,” Spanberger said.
Dominion Energy, which is working to launch a natural gas plant in Chesterfield County and considering how to ease emission controls for coal-powered plants, is proposing a suite of renewable energy sources.
Under that law, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, which serves Southwest Virginia, are required to add solar to their energy portfolios.","Former Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger is campaigning for Virginia’s governor’s race on an energy platform that supports robust renewable development and continued use, as needed, of natural gas. The former Democratic lawmaker also aims to make energy-reliant data centers pay for upgrades to the electrical grid.

Spanberger represented the 7th Congressional District outside Washington, D.C., from 2019 to 2025. Now, she believes she is positioned to make her home state a “dominant” player in developing a multi-faceted energy landscape.

Spanberger said that her years on Capitol Hill helped frame climate change as an opportunity and challenge for Virginia, and energy use and conservation will be key issues in her bid for the governor’s mansion. “Virginia’s on a path to really be dominant and strong in the renewable energy space,” Spanberger said in an interview.

Spanberger is facing Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears on Nov. 4 and polls give her an early lead. So far, Spanberger has raised $27 million in political donations and Earle-Sears, $11.5 million, according to the Virginia Public Access Project.

Last month, Spanberger released a game plan for energy that focused on six priorities, including increasing local generation, all efforts she said will help the state avoid an energy crisis. “Some of these new opportunities, it’s in new technology. Some of them, it’s renewable energy. Some of it, the pitch is jobs. Some of it is the pitch is affordability,” she said.

Spanberger, a University of Virginia graduate who was a CIA case officer early in her career, faces widely divergent interests across the state and has represented a politically split constituency. Her former district is described as “purple” for its close voter margins between Democrats and Republicans, and an economy that benefits from Capitol Hill interests.

Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a former chief executive at The Carlyle Group private equity firm, won in 2022 with strong business support. He has aligned himself with President Donald Trump and, in recent weeks, has supported the administration’s effort to shift federal workers and agencies from the District into Virginia. Youngkin, who is term-limited, has encouraged robust data center development in the state.

Such growth will be challenging. Virginia faces skyrocketing energy demands from proposed and existing data centers with some estimates showing that electricity needs will triple over the next 15 years from about 10,000 gigawatt hours in 2023 to just over 30,000 gigawatt hours. The state also depends on PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States and which has been roundly criticized for slow expansion and connection to its grid, notably for renewable energy projects.

Spanberger, in a series of recent interviews and policy statements, has said she wants communities to be better informed about the benefits and costs of growth.

She said Virginia will need a reliable portfolio of energy to stay competitive. Solar projects must be encouraged, she said, as well as an ongoing offshore wind project by Dominion Energy, the pivotal utility based in Richmond. Spanberger said she wants to pursue energy saving measures that make sense for residents and businesses, and she acknowledged that natural gas will be a key component for economic growth, for now.

“At this juncture, natural gas is going to be part of the energy mix into the future,” Spanberger said.

“However, I think when it comes to new natural gas infrastructure, that’s where we really need to be focused and sort of thinking carefully about the lifespan of those projects and whether indeed they are the most cost-effective solution.”

In an interview with Cardinal News, Spanberger said the state government could better research how and where to select sites for solar projects, including assessing formerly mined land and the use of rooftops. The state saw a boom in solar development after 2014 when local governments approved 100 percent of proposals for solar panel projects. Concerns over protecting farmland dented that approval rate in recent years. Half of all proposed projects were approved in 2024.

Spanberger also supports the state’s broader offshore wind development plans. Dominion is now constructing a $10.7 billion Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project about 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach. That project is expected to produce 2.6 gigawatts of electricity for more than 2.5 million households and businesses in Virginia.

Dominion has two other wind lease areas available for development, but any potential work has stalled because the Trump administration in January temporarily withdrew all lease rights in order to review permitting practices for wind projects. The move has widely been seen as a way to slow such renewable development.

Spanberger said she wants to see energy storage developed as an industry in Virginia—a job creation opportunity she said that acknowledges that there are some limitations to when and how renewables can be used. “Wind and solar are not 24-hour kind of constant production,” she said. But businesses can innovate to blend energy sources and reliable storage methods.

“Whether it’s in the construction and manufacturing installation, those jobs should be right here in Virginia. Those industries should be right here in Virginia,” Spanberger said. “Expanding the type of generation and source of generation that we have in Virginia also meets that goal of contending with rising prices.”

Spanberger’s plan calls for Virginia to “work collaboratively” with other governors to add new generation sources to PJM’s grid. A bipartisan group of nine governors, including Youngkin, sent a letter to PJM on July 17 to express frustration over its performance, noting continued long delays in reviewing applications for interconnection.

Spanberger also said in her plan that she wants to explore greater energy efficiency programs, ratepayer project programs, and the use of virtual power plants. A virtual power plant is a system made up of residents and businesses who agree to reduce their electricity demand and share energy to the grid when needed. The system is controlled by the utility, which can activate notices to the groups. Participants are compensated for their efforts.

Spanberger’s proposals are emerging as utility companies that serve Virginians are attempting to expand the energy arsenal. Dominion Energy, which is working to launch a natural gas plant in Chesterfield County and considering how to ease emission controls for coal-powered plants, is proposing a suite of renewable energy sources.

Dominion has said it is examining and attempting changes that will help maintain grid reliability, particularly during peak demand periods.

The Clean Economy Act

The Virginia Clean Economy Act, passed in 2020, aims to decarbonize the electric grid by reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

The law mandates utilities serving Virginia reduce carbon-emitting generation sources by 2045 unless there’s a concern over grid reliability. Under that law, Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, which serves Southwest Virginia, are required to add solar to their energy portfolios. Dominion must create a renewable energy credit portfolio–which sustains 100 percent of the electricity through renewables–by 2045 and Appalachian Power must do the same by 2050.

For Dominion, that means the utility must petition regulators, by the end of 2035, to approve proposals for solar projects that will produce a total of 16,100 megawatts, offshore wind projects that will produce a total of 5.2 gigawatts, and battery storage that can accommodate 2,700 megawatts. Appalachian Power must prepare to build 600 megawatts of solar by the end of 2030 and 400 megawatts of battery storage by the end of 2035.

In an interview, Spanberger said she is “committed to the long-term goals” of the Virginia Clean Economy Act. She noted that 2045 is “a long way away” but “the landscape in Virginia has changed in the last few years.” There are “some opportunities” for more small-scale distributed generation at certain locations, such as shopping centers, which could alleviate demand. Small-scale energy production could help ease the strain on large centralized energy sources, she said.

“How can we be more aggressive in our pursuit of other types of clean energy generation?” Spanberger said. “I don’t think the immediate response should be, ‘Okay, we’re not 100 percent on pace with where we thought we should be, therefore, let’s just throw up our hands and walk away.’”

Dominion has nuclear plants at North Anna and Surry in the central and tidewater regions, which together can produce about 3.6 gigawatts of electricity, equal to powering 870,000 homes or about 30 percent of the state’s current electricity demand.

Smaller modular reactors or SMRs are increasingly showing promise as complementary energy sources—and Dominion is actively considering if one could be added to the North Anna units. The modular reactors can produce 300 megawatts of electricity compared to the 1,000-watt capacity of older nuclear units, and they may well be a model way for Virginia to meet its renewable target, Spanberger said.

“We have a potential to really be a global leader in new technologies, given the offshore wind project, the SMR project in North Anna and then the fusion project, which is admittedly a little bit further off, but that one is planned to go in Chesterfield County,” Spanberger said.

Data Center Growth

Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Meta all have invested in data centers in Virginia and may expand their operations in artificial intelligence, which will increase energy demand. Spanberger thinks that sort of growth can be managed to benefit all Virginians.

“(Data centers) are going to need to go somewhere, and Virginia can benefit from having them here,” Spanberger said, adding she wants to have a statewide plan to help communities understand and deal with siting proposals as well as energy and water consumption forecasts.

“Some localities just don’t necessarily know the things they should be asking,” she said. Local communities and governments need to have a “best practices standard” to know what “they should be able to ask for as it relates to the actual rates.”

Clean Virginia, an advocacy group that has long criticized Dominion Energy’s policies, is supporting Spanberger. The group, founded by hedge fund executive Michael Bills who lives in Charlottesville, has pumped millions of dollars into legislative races.

Clean Virginia has pushed for more stringent reviews of data center development proposals at Virginia’s utility regulators, the State Corporation Commission (SCC). The group advocates for utilities to be required to source electricity from clean technologies, and it has called for data centers to pay for the grid upgrades that will be needed to operate their for-profit businesses.

Dominion Energy’s latest rate review is a chance to gauge cost allocations, and Spanberger said she is studying that issue to ensure electricity rates, for residents and other businesses, are affordable.

“I am looking very closely at the rate case that’s before the SCC,” she said. “I want to ensure that (data centers) are paying their fair share, but also as generation needs continue to increase, I want Virginians to have the clarity that they are not impacted by the type of data center choices that their localities are making.”

Virginia’s energy and political debates are gaining pace as the Trump administration rolls back clean air and water protections, weakens drinking water standards and dismantles the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) tasked with supporting disaster response.

Virginia in 2024 experienced $4.4 billion in damages from Hurricane Helene, and Spanberger said the federal cuts–notably in FEMA–are worrisome.

“I’m watching it closely, because there presumably will be things to react to or to plan for in recognizing what’s happening at the federal level,” Spanberger said. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act has slashed money for energy transition efforts and that will hurt Virginia’s momentum to cope with rising energy demands, she said.

That’s “a problem for a state that’s doing so well in this space,” Spanberger said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2220489974-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 05:59:44.963024

What's at stake Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables.
Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.
However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.","President Donald Trump's plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the United States could speed up a building boom that already was expected to strain the nation's ability to power it.

The White House released its AI Action Plan on July 23, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others pour billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Environmental concerns

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are increasingly severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Big Tech moves

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most power plants in the U.S. still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

Tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables. Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

In recent days, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world's largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means ""relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,"" Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear, power generation.

What's ahead

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for.

""In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,"" said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

""They're planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that's projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.""

This milestone, highlighted in the Environmental Defense Fund's newsletter, is detailed in a new report by the International Energy Agency. The IEA's World Energy Investment 2025 outlook reveals that solar, wind, battery storage, and electric vehicles are seeing booming investment globally.

Despite ongoing opposition to green climate policy from U.S. conservative leaders, clean energy is charging ahead. According to the IEA, clean technology will account for two-thirds of total energy investment worldwide in 2025, up from 40% in 2020.

Much of this momentum is driven by China, the European Union, and emerging economies like India and Brazil, but the U.S. still plays a crucial role, with $400 billion in clean energy investments outstripping the $187 billion put into fossil fuels.

The investment surge could lead to cheaper energy bills, more local clean energy jobs, and cleaner air. And it is already working: the IEA reported that the cost of solar panels has fallen by 30% over the past two years alone.

Significant infrastructure upgrades, expanded battery storage, and smarter electric grids are facilitating the transition to cleaner energy, helping protect communities from rising energy costs and worsening pollution.

This shift toward renewables is expected to prevent billions of tons of heat-trapping pollution and reduce the risk of oil and gas price shocks.

The clean energy boom was first covered in the EDF's Vital Signs newsletter, which shares inspiring good news stories on environmental solutions, clean tech breakthroughs, and actions individuals can take.

Many online were relieved with the optimistic outlook.

""This is great news,"" one Reddit commenter in r/energy said.

""If Trump wants energy dominance, maybe we should be investing in the sectors that are growing?"" another asked. ""Seems like basic common sense.""

This follows many recent clean energy advancements in the U.S., from investments in EV charging technology to community-focused solar and nuclear fusion.

Everyday people are beginning to see the benefits and are switching to options like home solar through companies like EnergySage, which offers a free service to compare quotes and save up to $10,000 on solar installation that could bring your energy costs toward $0.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/clean-energy-investmentimage-recZSrIk3oIkOvnmC.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 05:59:51.986118

This latest government-backed financing marks the third such agreement between Ford and UK Export Finance in just four years.
Previous support packages included a £625 million loan for global R&D work in Essex and a £750 million facility to scale up production of EV power units.
Looking further ahead, the government has pledged £2 billion in capital and R&D support for the EV sector through 2030.
This reduction is expected to save UK manufacturers hundreds of millions of pounds annually and could play a crucial role in making British EVs more competitive abroad.","The UK Government has unveiled plans to support a £1 billion loan to Ford UK as part of a broader effort to accelerate the company’s transition to electric vehicle production and secure thousands of jobs across its British operations. The funding will be backed by an export development guarantee, with UK Export Finance agreeing to cover 80% of the total facility. That amounts to £800 million underwritten by the government.

Citi is leading the deal along with a syndicate of commercial lenders. The funds will be used to bolster Ford’s engineering and manufacturing capabilities for electric and connected vehicles. This includes continued investment in the company’s Halewood facility, which is being retooled to produce electric motors, as well as expanded support for its research and development centre in Essex.

Ford employs more than 5,500 people across the UK and has already committed over £450 million toward EV-related upgrades since 2020. This latest government-backed financing marks the third such agreement between Ford and UK Export Finance in just four years. Combined, the total value of these loans now reaches nearly £2.4 billion. Previous support packages included a £625 million loan for global R&D work in Essex and a £750 million facility to scale up production of EV power units.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said: “Ford has been the pride of Essex since 1911, over a century of innovation and industry. The R&D centre in Basildon employs thousands of people in well-paid, highly skilled jobs.

“This £1bn loan guarantee is a major boost for Britain’s auto sector. It will help develop world-leading products, open new export markets, and secure jobs. This is our Plan for Change in action – delivering growth and putting more money in people’s pockets.”

Ford Britain’s chair Lisa Brankin added: “Recent investments in the UK have proved crucial to our European operations and have expanded our UK export capability, on top of supporting Ford’s investment in an all-electric product line-for Europe.

“This new UKEF facility will play an important role in supporting our UK exporting footprint, especially amid the continued uncertainty in the trade landscape and the disconnect between EV targets and customer demand.”

The timing of this new loan coincides with the mounting challenges facing the UK automotive sector. While regulations continue to push toward electrification, consumer demand has been softening. Rising costs, infrastructure delays, and shifting government incentives have further complicated the landscape.

Even major manufacturers are adjusting their expectations. Volvo recently revised its goal of becoming fully electric by 2030, now allowing for up to 10 per cent of its sales to come from plug-in hybrids. The company cited slow progress in public charging availability and a reduction in incentive programmes as major factors behind the pivot.

In response to industry concerns, the UK Government has rolled out new initiatives aimed at encouraging both production and adoption. These include the Electric Car Grant and updates to the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, which requires manufacturers to steadily increase the proportion of zero-emission vehicles in their total sales.

Last year, Nissan warned the Government that the market shift to EVs is not keeping pace with expectations, citing weak consumer demand and increasing regulatory burdens. “The reality is that the customer is not moving at the same pace as we had expected,” the company said.

Looking further ahead, the government has pledged £2 billion in capital and R&D support for the EV sector through 2030. An additional £500 million has been earmarked to extend that support window to 2035.

The push to transform the UK’s automotive sector is not limited to domestic policy. Officials have also been working to improve international market access for British-made vehicles. A recent trade agreement with the United States has significantly lowered tariffs on UK car exports, cutting them from 27.5 per cent to just 10 per cent.

This reduction is expected to save UK manufacturers hundreds of millions of pounds annually and could play a crucial role in making British EVs more competitive abroad.

Together, these developments paint a picture of a sector in flux. The UK is navigating a difficult transition, balancing the urgency of climate targets with the economic realities facing manufacturers. Ford’s new loan package is just one example of how the public and private sectors are collaborating to build a greener, more resilient automotive industry for the years ahead.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/c2a2be60ae6e1e97e231ddde94d28e16.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_667,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/c2a2be60ae6e1e97e231ddde94d28e16.jpg",N,,2025-08-03 05:59:56.260383

But while the market moves to make electric vehicles more accessible, state policies may inadvertently create new barriers.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly seen as the future of transportation, cleaner, quieter, and less reliant on fossil fuels. Yet for many American drivers, the shift to electric mobility comes with a hidden financial sting: annual fees that states are imposing on EV owners, often with little warning.

At least 18 states now charge additional registration fees for electric vehicles, ranging anywhere from $50 to over $200 per year. California, a long-standing champion of green transportation, sets its annual fee at $100 for zero-emission vehicles. But some states are less modest. Georgia charges $200, and Indiana asks EV owners to pay $150. In Michigan, the fee can reach $235 depending on vehicle weight. Even states with relatively few EVs on the road are adopting these measures, compounding costs for environmentally conscious drivers.

Illinois offers one of the most dramatic examples. In 2019, lawmakers proposed raising the state’s annual EV registration fee from just $17.50 to an eye-popping $1,000. The stated goal: recoup lost gas tax revenue that traditionally funds road maintenance. After public backlash, the proposal was scaled back, but EV owners still now pay $100 annually on top of the $158 standard vehicle registration.

The rationale behind these fees stems from a shrinking pool of gas tax revenue. Since EVs don’t rely on gasoline, their drivers don’t contribute to highway maintenance in the same way as conventional motorists. With roads and bridges in need of repair and no federal gas tax increase since 1993, states are looking for new revenue streams. That search has led directly to EV owners’ wallets.

However, this added cost raises concerns. On one hand, several states, including California and Colorado, still offer rebates and tax incentives to encourage EV purchases. On the other, they penalize those same drivers with recurring fees, creating a financial and policy contradiction that can confuse potential buyers.

Some states have explored mileage-based fees as a fairer alternative, charging drivers by how much they use public roads rather than what kind of fuel they use. These systems, though, face resistance due to privacy concerns and logistical hurdles.

As EV adoption continues to grow and vehicle prices trend downward thanks to cheaper batteries and rising competition, affordability remains a central issue. But while the market moves to make electric vehicles more accessible, state policies may inadvertently create new barriers.

What is clear is that while EVs promise long-term savings in fuel and maintenance, many owners are discovering that going electric may come with an unexpected price tag, and not just at the dealership.",https://www.explica.me/__export/1754185110389/sites/debate/img/2023/08/02/tesla_nuevas_vacantes_remotas_y_presenciales_en_mxxico_xagosto_2023x_trabaja_para_elon_musk.jpg_673822677.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 08:02:56.353658

Melanie Oldham, founder and director of environmental justice organization Better Brazoria, lives a few kilometers from the Freeport LNG export facility in Freeport, Texas.","Nestled among the bold characters of headlines about freshly signed U.S. trade deals are equally bold numbers: $550 billion, $250 billion, $100 billion. These are some of the eye-watering figures that countries have promised to invest in or buy from the United States’ energy sector — primarily its fossil fuel industry — as part of the agreements.

Whether such large amounts of money will actually be pumped into the U.S. economy is yet to be seen, but in the meantime, U.S. President Donald Trump is living up to his promise to “drill, baby, drill” by aggressively promoting America’s energy resources, especially natural gas.

Increasing the United States’ oil and gas production means it can rely on these as cheap energy sources domestically while also selling them abroad to reduce its trade deficit with other countries — so the MAGA argument goes.

Major environmental concerns about boosting this industry aside — particularly given the country’s status as the top emitter of methane from oil and gas production — the economic case is also far from clear.

Increased American gas exports, most of which are traded abroad via ship as liquefied natural gas (LNG), could push up domestic energy prices at a time when households are already feeling the pain of high living costs.

Plus, as the world gears up for an unprecedented increase in LNG export capacity, many believe that global supply will outstrip demand, which is falling in major markets such as Japan and Europe and may not grow as much as the industry hopes in emerging economies such as China and India.

With its LNG export capacity set to triple, accounting for one-third of the global total by 2030, the U.S. needs buyers. This is where Trump’s leverage tactics come in handy as Washington pushes America’s trading partners — including Japan — to buy more U.S. gas in exchange for more lenient tariffs.

In February, Trump said Japan would start importing “record numbers” of American LNG. While the president’s hyperboles should be taken with a comparably large grain of salt, Japanese companies have indeed been buying more of the fuel this year, on top of already sizable contracts and investments. Japanese banks are the top three financiers of LNG export projects in the U.S.

Jera, Japan’s largest power generator and one of the biggest LNG importers globally, has increased the U.S. share of its gas mix from 10% to nearly 30%. On July 22, as the ink on the U.S.-Japan trade deal was still drying, Trump said Japan had agreed to form a joint venture to develop an LNG project in Alaska, without specifying which project. The details of any potential venture remain unclear.

But the reality for those living at the heart of the American LNG buildout, in the coastal communities of Texas and Louisiana that look out on to the Gulf of Mexico, is one of diminishing returns.

Having already suffered the brunt of decades of oil, gas and petrochemical development — including a boom in LNG export facilities in the wake of the 2016 U.S. shale gas revolution that transformed the country from a net gas importer into the world’s No. 1 exporter — their health, livelihoods and environment are at stake as more facilities are due to come online.

“Paying for, financing, funding and insuring these projects is ensuring my children’s deaths,” says Roishetta Ozane, founder of the Vessel Project of Louisiana, a disaster relief and environmental justice organization, and co-director of the Gulf South Fossil Finance Hub, who lives in Sulphur, Louisiana. Ozane’s six children suffer from ailments including skin, respiratory and neurological disorders.

Near where her family lives, CP2 LNG, a planned LNG export facility, reached a final investment decision — a key milestone for large energy projects — last month, thanks in part to a political and regulatory environment that is proving to be as accommodating to fossil fuel development as it is hostile to climate policies and renewable energy.

Redrawing the energy map

The U.S. government is doing everything in its power to move gas projects ahead, with Trump kicking off a wave of environmental deregulation and oil and gas permitting.

On his first day back in office, the president signed an executive order called Unleashing American Energy, undoing predecessor Joe Biden’s investments in clean energy and electric vehicles and boosting production of oil and gas — the “liquid gold under our feet,” as Trump called it in his inaugural address.

Soon after, Washington established the National Energy Dominance Council, headed by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a fracking millionaire. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the gargantuan Republican spending legislation adopted in July, incentivizes oil and gas leasing, including by lowering federal royalties rates, and repeals a fee on methane emissions.

Trump also lifted a moratorium on permits for new LNG export facilities that was adopted by Biden in January 2024. Among such facilities, CP2 LNG, located in the Calcasieu Ship Channel in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, has received federal approval; if constructed, it would put the company that owns the project, Venture Global, in the lead as the United States’ biggest LNG exporter.

LNG has also become a major bargaining chip in Trump’s trade wars.

While this isn’t the first U.S. administration to use the fuel as a geopolitical tool, “Trump has taken a sticks, not a carrot approach” like others before him, says Sam Reynolds, a research lead at the U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). This push “has been largely successful” as Asian, European and Middle Eastern buyers sign on to purchase more American gas.

“The administration is trying to redraw the map of energy dependence,” says Reynolds, though the growing competitiveness of renewable energy globally “will challenge what the U.S. can feasibly achieve by doubling down on fossil fuels.”

Footing the bill

On an early morning in mid-July, Ray Mallet is on his boat in the Calcasieu Ship Channel, where CP2 LNG is being built, on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico — waters he knows well, having worked there as a commercial fisher all his life.

But on this day, Mallet isn’t casting his nets and lines as usual. Together with other fishers, as well as scientists and local environmentalists, he’s deploying hydrophones in the water to test whether noise pollution from the Calcasieu Pass LNG export terminal, which sits where the channel meets the gulf, is causing a severe decline in seafood catch rates.

The hydrophones are being used to scientifically verify what local fisherfolk already “know and see,” says Alyssa Portaro, founder of the Habitat Recovery Project, a Louisiana-based conservation nonprofit that is running the data collection project: Since Calcasieu Pass LNG started production in 2022, catches of shrimp, crabs and fish have decreased dramatically year after year.

“I’ve had to go fish elsewhere to try to support my family,” Mallet says.

Anthony Theriot, known as “Tad,” who lives a little over 1.5 kilometers from Calcasieu Pass LNG, has also been fishing here his whole life. Shrimpers and fishers used to make a good living, he says, but income has declined sharply since the plant started.

“This was the No. 1 seafood capital of the U.S. and now it’s the world capital of LNG exports,” says Portaro.

What is happening in Cameron Parish mirrors conditions across the Gulf Coast. Existing socioeconomic disparities are being exacerbated as American LNG facilities “tend to be sited in areas that are disproportionately home to communities of color and low-income communities,” according to a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) study on the impacts of U.S. LNG exports that was mandated by the Biden-era moratorium.

But the consequences may be felt further afield: The U.S. Energy Information Administration expects domestic gas prices to more than double through 2026 compared with last year and the DOE study finds that increasing LNG exports will lead to higher electric bills. Rising prices are also a concern for the industry as the cost of building LNG plants has soared, compounded by 50% U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.

Among those caught in the fallout is a major Japanese engineering, procurement and construction contractor, Chiyoda Corp., which in July stated that it will stop pursuing large-scale LNG projects overseas due to losses incurred from some U.S. facilities.

Ultimately, international buyers will foot at least part of the bill.

“U.S. LNG prices abroad are based on that domestic gas price as well as the capital expenditure of the facilities and both of those are rising,” says IEEFA’s Reynolds. In signing up for more American gas, Japan is “essentially committing over the long term to pay more for LNG.”

Unleashing a carbon bomb?

The world’s top LNG players, including Japan, are predicting high prices and high demand for the fuel, especially in Asia, over the next couple of decades. Yet many others foresee a glut in the market, with expected amounts of additional LNG supply above the level of demand in developing parts of Asia, according to Anne-Sophie Corbeau, global research scholar at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.

“There is a reasonable question about where all this LNG is going to go,” Corbeau says.

Reynolds points, for example, to the industry’s overly optimistic predictions about China. While it is the world’s largest buyer of LNG, having surpassed Japan in 2021, its imports haven’t grown significantly since then, in part due to a record-breaking adoption of renewable energy.

In Japan, gas demand is declining year after year, though according to the economy ministry, predicting future trends is difficult given the advent of new industries and technologies.

This means preparing for several scenarios, including one in which electricity demand increases due to the growth of artificial intelligence, among other factors, but energy sources such as renewables are deployed slowly. The government envisions a significant reduction of thermal power — including coal and gas — in Japan’s energy mix, but continues to set high targets for how much LNG its companies should contract.

What LNG isn’t needed domestically is increasingly being resold to countries in South and Southeast Asia.

The question of Asia’s gas needs also hangs over what Trump hopes will become the crown jewel of American energy dominance: Alaska LNG.

The project entails building a 1,300-kilometer north-south pipeline to transport gas across the largest U.S. state. From the south coast, LNG would be shipped to Asia via a much shorter route than that from the Gulf Coast — for example, gas would reach Japan in around 10 days rather than the typical 30 to 40 days.

Despite being under discussion for decades, Alaska LNG has never been developed due to the huge cost of building and operating a pipeline in the state’s harsh geographic and climatic conditions. In 2016, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie called it “one of the least competitive” LNG projects in the world.

Estimated to cost $44 billion — proportionally double the price of LNG export projects in the Gulf Coast — additional expenses, such as those incurred from the new tariff regime, haven’t even been factored in yet, Reynolds points out.

Alaska LNG has signed a nonbinding agreement with a Thai buyer and received interest from Indian, Taiwanese and South Korean players as well as Japanese companies such as Jera, Tokyo Gas and Mitsui. In contrast, the president of Japan Petroleum Exploration told Reuters in February that Alaska LNG “is not a realistic investment proposition due to its unclear economics and large scale.”

“If it has not taken a final investment decision, there is a very simple reason for that — economics,” Corbeau says.

Climate concerns also loom large when it comes to Alaska LNG — labeled a “carbon bomb” by environmental groups — and other such developments.

As global demand for oil collapses, gas is the fossil fuel industry’s last frontier. To some, this is good news, as gas emits less carbon dioxide than coal and oil when burned and can keep the lights on as societies transition to less carbon-intensive energy systems.

Others are concerned that investments in gas compete with those in renewables — a fact also highlighted by the DOE study — while experts note that lower carbon dioxide emissions does not mean it is a clean alternative, particularly because of the significant amount of methane emitted along the value chain.

“It’s like you’re trying to eat a healthier diet and instead of eating cookies, you’re going to eat candy,” says Allie Rosenbluth, U.S. campaign manager at U.S.-based nonprofit Oil Change International. Why not “try an apple”?

Some Gulf Coast communities are taking matters into their own hands. Melanie Oldham, founder and director of environmental justice organization Better Brazoria, lives a few kilometers from the Freeport LNG export facility in Freeport, Texas. Her community has started recording methane emissions from the plant using an optical gas imaging camera so that “people can see that we’re telling the truth” about LNG pollution, Oldham says.

While climate skeptics such as Wright — Trump’s energy secretary, who has described concerns about climate change as a “mania” — are too vocal a contingent in the U.S. government, Oldham urges “decision-makers in Europe and Asia (to) take a look at the whole picture.”

“People know that these projects are not a done deal,” says Rosenbluth. “They need local and state permits. They need financiers, they need actual buyers, and many of these projects do not have all of those things.”",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/08/03/485027.jpeg?v=3.1,N,,2025-08-03 04:59:54.738756

In New York, 10% of households don’t have AC, but that percentage doubles in many Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods.
As it gets hotter, though, free home cooling programs are becoming more common.
“Low-income households are about one-third as likely to receive an energy-efficiency incentive.” Atalla underscored that programs that can help cover the costs of energy bills — which low-income households spend a disproportionate amount of income in — can also help make free air conditioner programs more effective.","With heat advisories blanketing the eastern half of the US, air conditioners are once again working over time as essential resources to keep millions cool. But they’re unevenly distributed: Many poor households are unable to afford them.

To reduce the gap between the air conditioning haves and have nots, a growing number of programs are giving them out for free with waiting lists numbering in the thousands. And they view them as means to protect public health and reduce poverty.

Heat-related deaths have doubled over the last quarter century, and more people will be at risk as the planet warms. Temperature increases are correlated with higher disease risk and mortality rates. Extreme heat can reduce productivity, impact children’s cognitive development and lower overall wellbeing.

“Each individual heat-related death is preventable,” said Kai Chen, a researcher of environmental health at Yale University, “and in the past 20 years, air conditioning use has drastically reduced heat-related mortality.”

He added that without ACs, the amount of heat-related deaths in the US would likely double, especially for older adults.

There are 14 million households without air conditioning in the US, but lack of access is more acute in some communities. In New York, 10% of households don’t have AC, but that percentage doubles in many Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods. Over 500 people die from heat in New York City each summer, mostly at home with a broken or underpowered air conditioner, according to the city’s most recent report on heat mortality. The top reason for the lack of cooling: cost.

The state’s Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) provides ACs to low-income households with members over 65 or under 6, and Governor Kathy Hochul launched a program in June that makes units available to any low-income adult with asthma, which is exacerbated by heat.

The new program, which distributes the ACs through enrollment in the state’s Essentials Healthcare Plan, focuses on ages that HEAP does not cover.

“We think this is really important as extreme weather events are happening more and more and with a lower-income population with health needs, this is absolutely a meaningful way we can help them manage their health,” said Danielle Holahan, executive director at New York State of Health, the state’s marketplace for affordable health insurance, which administers the program.

But the program and others like it face challenges due to funding cuts. Federal money for many state-level heating and cooling relief programs is in peril, and energy-efficiency tax credits, which help households afford better cooling appliances, have been cut as part of President Donald Trump’s recently signed tax law.

The bedrock of New York’s program, the Essentials Healthcare Plan, was implemented under the Affordable Care Act. According to Holahan, the program has funding for the next five years, but cuts to the ACA in the new law could remove eligibility for about 730,000 enrollees, especially lawfully present immigrants.

Local, non-governmental groups run similar programs and have found strong demand. In Cincinnati, which will see a run of extreme heat break by the end of the week, there's a waiting list of more than 2,700 people for a program that gives out free air conditioners.

The program, run by the anti-homelessness charity St. Vincent de Paul, provides ACs to anyone 65 and older or with a medical need. Their waiting list grew by 700 in the last few weeks alone.

While St. Vincent de Paul Cincinnati’s program initially gave out fans, that felt like a “band-aid” for a persistent problem, said Kaytlynd Leinhart, who leads the organization’s development and marketing. The group switched to ACs in 2019. It is funded by local donors, businesses and foundations.

Leinhart said nonprofits carry more responsibility after pandemic-era support tapered off. She emphasized how cooling can be a stepping stone out of a crisis by providing something as simple as good night’s sleep.

“If you're a single mom on one income, imagine that that's how you're starting your day every day, with your baby having not slept, you've not slept, you've been severely uncomfortable all night,” she said.

Providing a free AC can help individuals cope with heat stress and better attend to pressing challenges.

Demand is especially high this year. The Cincinnati program gave out over 700 ACs in both 2023 and 2024 while in 2022, it provided 980 units. This year, it expects to exceed 1,000 units.

However, providing that many will cost $110,000, and the group only has $75,000 in funding this year. With such a long waitlist, many won’t receive relief.

Climate change is making summers hotter in New York and Cincinnati, places that already regularly experience temperatures above 90F (32C). Traditionally cool cities where air conditioning is less prevalent are also seeing temperatures rise. As it gets hotter, though, free home cooling programs are becoming more common.

“Cooling is going from being a luxury or a ‘nice to have’ in many places to being essential for health and safety,” said Laila Atalla, a building decarbonization expert at clean energy nonprofit RMI.

In the wake of a 2021 heat dome that killed hundreds across the US Pacific Northwest and Canada, the city of Portland, Oregon, formed Cooling Portland with the nonprofit Earth Advantage to install energy-efficient heat pumps in households at high risk of heat-related illness.

Using heat pumps is the ideal solution because of their reliability, smaller environmental footprint and affordability, reducing cooling costs by about 20%, Atalla said.

In 2022, Cooling Portland set a target of installing 15,000 units by 2027, but it reached that goal earlier this summer and plans to install 5,000 units this year alone. In a city that is 70% white, the program is helping close the racial cooling disparity: Of those served, about a third are Black and 14% Hispanic or Latino.

Portland funds its work through a 1% surcharge on local billion-dollar corporations, passed via a 2018 ballot measure. The fund — which has raised $1.2 billion — can only be used for climate justice initiatives.

Amidst the Trump administration’s cuts to social welfare and climate programs, Atalla said that local governments and utilities can do more to improve cooling access using money they already have. They noted that the US spends $9 billion a year on energy efficiency programs that only 3% of households take advantage of because of complex applications, inconsistent eligibility requirements and income verification hurdles.

“There’s an equity dimension here too,” Atalla said. “Low-income households are about one-third as likely to receive an energy-efficiency incentive.”

Atalla underscored that programs that can help cover the costs of energy bills — which low-income households spend a disproportionate amount of income in — can also help make free air conditioner programs more effective. They also pointed to a Colorado bill that would prevent utilities from disconnecting power for nonpayment during extreme heat events as another means to keep people safe.

As the state adds over 3 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale solar capacity annually—surpassing even California—Florida is quietly cementing itself as a national leader in renewable energy. But beneath the surface of this surge lies a complex investment landscape, shaped by legislative shifts, supply chain dynamics, and the urgency of federal tax credit deadlines. For investors, the question is not just whether Florida's solar boom is real, but whether it is sustainable—and how to position for both its opportunities and risks.

The Policy Catalyst: Streamlining Permitting and Accelerating Deployment

Florida's 2025 solar legislation, HB 683, has emerged as a game-changer. By mandating five-day permitting timelines for single-trade solar projects and allowing private and virtual inspections, the law cuts through decades of bureaucratic bottlenecks. This reform is particularly timely as the 30% federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for residential solar projects expires at year-end 2025. For developers, the law slashes “soft costs”—administrative and permitting expenses—by up to 30%, making Florida a more attractive market.

However, the same year saw the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA), a federal policy that accelerates the phase-out of solar tax credits. While the ITC remains at 30% for projects starting construction by July 2026, it drops to 80% by 2029 and vanishes by 2032. This creates a “use-it-or-lose-it” scenario for developers, particularly those reliant on tax equity financing. Florida Power & Light (FPL), the state's largest utility, has capitalized on these dynamics, accounting for 70% of new solar installations in 2024 and planning 4 GW of battery storage by 2033.

The Investment Playbook: Timing, Arbitrage, and Resilience

For investors, the key to Florida's solar market lies in timing. Projects that can begin construction by July 2026 are eligible for the full 30% ITC, creating a window for tax credit arbitrage. This has triggered a “rush to file” among developers, with larger firms leveraging capital to meet tight deadlines. Smaller companies, however, face existential risks due to limited liquidity and supply chain constraints—tariffs on Chinese solar equipment have inflated costs by 15–20%, squeezing margins.

Meanwhile, grid infrastructure and energy storage present underappreciated opportunities. FPL's $300 million investment in battery storage by 2026 reflects a broader trend toward hybrid systems that pair solar with backup power. Babcock Ranch, a solar-powered town that maintained energy independence during Hurricane Ian, is piloting microgrid technology—a model likely to gain traction as climate risks intensify. For investors, companies specializing in smart inverters, grid modernization, and decentralized energy solutions (e.g., Enphase Energy, Sunrun) could outperform the broader sector.

Corporate Demand and Market Resilience

Corporate clean energy procurement is another tailwind. Tech giants like Meta and Amazon have secured long-term solar contracts in Florida, drawn by the state's low levelized cost of energy ($25/MWh) and abundant sunlight. These agreements provide stable cash flows for developers and insulate projects from market volatility. Additionally, Florida's solar industry now employs 14,108 people, with 447 active solar companies, creating a robust ecosystem of suppliers and service providers.

Yet challenges persist. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) warns that Florida could lose 21,800 solar jobs if the OBBBA's accelerated tax credit phase-out remains unaltered. Moreover, the state's lack of a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) means long-term growth depends on market forces rather than regulatory mandates.

Risk Mitigation and Strategic Diversification

Investors should hedge against policy uncertainty by diversifying geographically. While Florida remains a solar hotbed, states like Texas and Georgia offer more stable regulatory environments. Additionally, focusing on storage and grid infrastructure—sectors less sensitive to ITC fluctuations—can provide downside protection. For example, companies like Tesla and SunPower, which integrate solar with battery solutions, are well-positioned to capitalize on Florida's resilience-driven demand.

Conclusion: A Solar Frontier with Nuanced Opportunities

Florida's solar surge is not just a story of sun and silicon—it's a case study in policy agility and market adaptability. For investors, the path to returns lies in capitalizing on the 2026 ITC deadline, embracing storage and grid infrastructure, and navigating the risks of a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. While the OBBBA introduces headwinds, Florida's combination of economic incentives, corporate demand, and innovation in resilience makes it a compelling frontier for solar investment. The key is to act decisively—and to look beyond the panels themselves to the systems that will power the state's future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 12:04:49.007268

India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia are among the most prominent proponents of the Global South, spearheading substantial reforms in climate action within the global governance architecture through platforms such as the G20, the India, Brazil, and South Africa initiative (IBSA), BRICS+, and multilateral development banks (MDBs). The energy transitions of these countries and their partners are critical to global emissions reductions. Collectively, these countries represent nearly 25 percent of the global population and 12 percent of the global emissions. Despite diverse contexts, these countries share similar challenges that can be effectively addressed collectively.

This special report outlines the challenges posed by legacy fossil fuel infrastructure, inadequate financial commitments, and reliance on concentrated supply chains. Together, these countries can strengthen their collective bargaining power, fortify institutional capacity to absorb climate finance, harmonize climate finance taxonomies, implement comprehensive strategies to phase out fossil fuels, create channels for sharing knowledge of best practices in climate finance deployment, and maintain long-term competitive advantage through clean industrial strategies.

I. Introduction

India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia are regarded as the emerging powers in the developing world, or what some have termed the Global South. Founded in 2003, the India-Brazil-South Africa, or IBSA, initiative provided a forum to promote development cooperation and knowledge sharing among the three largest democratic developing economies across Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The four countries are members of the G20, where they have held consecutive presidencies starting with Indonesia in 2022, leveraging the opportunity to put energy transition as a key priority for the G20. In 2025, Indonesia joined the expanded BRICS as a full member, providing another platform where the four countries can collaborate to advance the goals of energy transition, building on the lessons from their G20 presidencies.

This special report explores how an IBSA+Indonesia framework could alleviate constraints and address the shared challenges of energy transitions. Together, IBSA and Indonesia represent nearly 25 percent of the global population and 12 percent of global emissions. These countries have set ambitious targets to transition away from fossil fuels, but they face both distinct and common challenges in their energy transition strategies. Electricity demand is expected to increase by 38 to 55 percent by 2035 across the four countries, further complicating the challenge of reducing reliance on fossil fuels without compromising universal energy access. The diversity in energy profiles shapes each country’s energy transition pathways and constraints. Brazil’s relatively clean power sector (nearly 90 percent renewables) creates a strong foundation for renewables, but it is increasingly dependent on fossil fuels for transportation and other hard-to-abate sectors, such as steel. On the other hand, South Africa remains heavily dependent on coal, which accounts for over 70 percent of its total energy supply and faces the challenge of transitioning coal-dependent communities while maintaining energy security. India and Indonesia are gradually increasing renewable capacity, but must strike a balance between rapidly growing energy demand and efforts to decarbonize.

Despite their differences, all four countries share common challenges, including political and economic sensitivities, infrastructure gaps, and social equity concerns. They encounter significant climate finance gaps: developing countries, excluding China, will need an estimated $2.4 trillion annually by 2030 to achieve climate and development goals. Additionally, fragmented regulatory systems and reliance on foreign supply chains, especially China, which controls up to 90 percent of global clean tech manufacturing, create structural risks to energy security and long-term competitiveness. Effective energy transition strategies require coordinated, locally adapted policies, informed by the shared experiences of the Global South.

To identify areas of cooperation, Section II provides a brief overview of how IBSA and Indonesia are advancing their energy transition ambitions into practice. These countries are at different stages of integrating renewable energy into the energy mix, phasing out fossil fuels, and implementing industry-specific shifts. The phase-out of coal and oil from the energy mix touches sensitive issues surrounding countries’ employment footprint and is further deterred by steep increases in projected energy demand. Despite ambitious emissions reduction targets, these countries struggle to achieve cross-ministerial alignment that embodies whole-of-government efforts. This is crucial for ensuring clean energy access across diverse social groups and geographies, and more broadly, for achieving the dual goals of development and energy transitions.

In Section III, the discussion on climate finance highlights the twin crises of insufficient climate finance and insufficient institutional capacity to absorb funds. Additionally, inspite of the deployment of various climate finance instruments, there is a lack of coherence in the investment environment for both domestic and international participants. To solve these crises cooperatively, IBSA and Indonesia have a significant opportunity to harmonize climate finance taxonomies, share lessons learned from the deployment of climate finance instruments in similar environments, jointly strengthen the political and financial fluency of institutions, and elevate similar local initiatives for greater investor visibility.

All four countries heavily rely on external manufacturers, principally China and Europe, for key clean energy inputs. Section IV explains how access to critical minerals, grid modernization, storage, and emerging fuels (like green hydrogen) are becoming bottlenecks in energy transitions, especially as Global North countries pursue aggressive industrial strategies that disadvantage developing countries with limited capabilities to decarbonize. IBSA and Indonesia must limit their reliance on concentrated supply chains by adopting strategic clean industrial policies, as well as co-developing clean technologies of the future made by and for the Global South.

The final section recommends an IBSA and Indonesia framework that addresses the shared constraints of the energy transitions and foster long term competitiveness through alignment: facilitating collective bargaining of capital, developing clean technologies, building institutional capacity, enabling workforce transitions away from fossil fuels, and establishing effective clean industrial strategies.

II. Energy Transitions Strategies

IBSA, the tripartite cooperative framework between India, Brazil, and South Africa, has had some success in poverty and hunger alleviation, access to life-saving medications, education, safe drinking water, and the development of biofuels. The initiative has also focused on funding projects led and driven by the Global South, and concurrently called for reforms in the international financial architecture. Indonesia shares in the legacy of ensuring Global South priorities remain a part of the global governance agenda, beginning with its founding membership in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and its role in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As of 2023, together IBSA+Indonesia represent nearly 25 percent of the global population, just over 7 percent of the global gross domestic product (GDP), and about 12 percent of global emissions (Figure 1), with expected increases in emissions till 2030 and a decline thereafter (Table 1).

Despite these successes, IBSA's role and impact have been eroded recently due to the emergence of competing groupings, most notably BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). Indonesia became a full member in January 2025, and along with Egypt, Ethiopia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Iran now form an expanded BRICS+ group. However, as some of the fastest-growing clean energy markets globally, IBSA+Indonesia offers opportunities for coordination and flexibility to pursue their shared agendas on just energy transitions that go beyond the limitations of groups like BRICS+.

Brazil has a clean electricity mix, which positions the country well to decarbonize its economy through electrification (Figure 2). In 2023, the share of renewables in the electricity mix reached 89.2 percent (49.1 percent of the total energy supply). Brazil's clean electricity mix has remained well above global levels, at over 70 percent, over the last 20 years. Since 2015, Brazil has become a net exporter of oil, consuming 50 percent of its total production. Conversely, it depends on natural gas (30 percent) and coal imports (80 percent). Brazil plans to phase out coal-fired power plants by 2040. Brazil's energy transition strategy (outlined in Table 1) emphasizes a broader economic-ecological approach that includes a strategy to promote sustainability through the use of biological alternatives such as bio-fuels rather than a conventional shift in the energy mix. In 2022, Brazil's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) pledged to achieve net zero by 2050, with a 35 percent emissions reduction compared to 2005 levels by 2025, and 59 percent - 67 percent by 2030. Some of the hard-to-abate sectors, including aviation and steel, require different approaches. South Africa's mitigation strategy involves a Peak, Plateau, and Decline (PPD) emissions trajectory that targets peak emissions in 2025, plateau through 2035, and absolute decline thereafter (Table 1). In its updated NDC, published in 2021, the country commits to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions further, a significant tightening from its initial targets (Table 1). However, as Figure 1 and 2 depict, coal accounts for a large part of South Africa's total energy supply, over 70 percent, making it one of the most coal-dependent countries in the world. It ascribes South Africa's high per capita emissions status, which is many magnitudes higher than India, Brazil, and Indonesia. This makes South Africa the least well-positioned to achieve its net-zero goals. Powerful historical and socio-cultural narratives surrounding the ownership of coal mines and the centralized electricity supply (approximately 90 percent) by Eskom, the state utility, have complicated South Africa's transition away from coal. The financial instability at Eskom, end-of-life coal deposits, infrastructure constraints, and the NDC goals have prompted the government to lead several initiatives aimed at creating a more pro-investment environment in South Africa. Furthermore, despite delayed delivery, the Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) Investment Plan in South Africa is ambitious and expansive, targeting clean energy for electricity, clean energy vehicles, and green hydrogen.

India faces similar struggles in phasing out coal, which accounts for 45 percent of India's total energy supply (Figure 2). India's federalized electricity sector and coal's regional employment footprint heavily constrain reform. India has one of the most ambitious energy targets, aiming for net-zero emissions by 2070, and seeks to achieve 50 percent of its cumulative installed capacity from non-fossil sources, totaling 500 gigawatts (GW), by 2030 (see Table 1). As of July 2025, India achieved its 2030 target of 50 percent electrification from non-fossil fuel sources, 5 years ahead of set goals. India is growing its renewables capacity at the fastest rate among emerging economies. However, energy access is bifurcated, with large portions of rural and peri-urban populations relying on non-modern biomass. When faced with fragmented institutional coordination and state-level politicization, achieving clean energy targets and integrated energy access presents a significant challenge.

Indonesia's energy transition bottlenecks mirror IBSA countries in addressing captive coal use, transmission connectivity in remote areas, and equity concerns surrounding the costs of the energy transition. Indonesia's optimistic scenario envisions net zero emissions by 2060 (Table 1), with a 43.2 percent reduction by 2030. Indonesia's core decarbonization strategy involves the JETP. Despite the United States' recent departure from the JETP, Indonesia has signaled its intent to continue towards its commitments, with support from Germany, Japan, and several international organizations. In contrast to these developments and despite growing concerns about economic efficiency, construction of

coal power plants has continued, and fossil fuel subsidies remain politically sensitive and a socially embedded issue. The country is also increasingly turning to the United States and BRICS for liquefied natural gas and oil to secure its energy supply.

All four countries are pursuing ambitious energy transition strategies and goals, both domestically and through international platforms like the G20, BRICS, and the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP). Table 1 details the latest NDC targets, where India, Indonesia, and Brazil pledge an immediate decline in emissions, and South Africa tries to balance its development targets with a PPD approach. Across the board, access to energy across social groups and geographies remains central to transition strategies but is met with significant challenges of cross-ministerial alignment, phasing out of fossil fuels, and projected peak energy demand outpacing emissions reduction targets.

III. Climate Finance: Leadership, Opportunities, And Constraints

The past few years have witnessed escalating military conflicts globally, leading to increased defense spending and reducing the fiscal space available for Global North and multilateral contributions to energy transitions. Reorienting climate finance systems to address these ambitious clean energy targets requires multilateral coherence and leadership from Global South countries to set norms that support just and equitable energy transitions. This section on climate finance explores IBSA and Indonesia's push for climate finance for the Global South through the multilateral processes, the role of international climate finance in achieving NDC targets, and the effectiveness of domestic climate finance vehicles and instruments.

As a baseline, to get to net zero, an estimated $10 trillion by 2070 is needed for India, $6 trillion by 2050 for Brazil, $450 billion by 2050 for South Africa, and $2.4 trillion by 2060 for Indonesia (Table 2). At Azerbaijan's COP29, the new deal to provide developing nations with at least $300 billion a year and $1.3 trillion by 2035 fell short of the estimated climate finance for developing countries to meet their net-zero targets. Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) also fell short by reiterating previously set goals of $120 billion by 2030, instead of setting new targets. Despite limited commitments from traditional donors, these developments have shed light on the important role of non-traditional donors in this sector like the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states (especially Saudi Arabia) and BRICS countries. For instance, the $30 billion Alterra Fund, aimed at mobilizing climate-related investments, and Masdar, both launched by the UAE, are actively investing and entering joint ventures in Indonesia. Qatar's central bank has similarly been injecting large sums of climate finance and activating green bonds across Asia.

IBSA and Indonesia are attempting to attract private capital by offering attractive incentives, but the cost differential between multilateral and private financing is both substantial and unsustainable, making it difficult for private finance to fund the energy transition solely. Current climate finance mechanisms remain severely fragmented, burdened by conditionalities, and structurally unequipped to attract investment at the scale required for equitable transitions. For instance, Brazil will require an estimated $200 billion in investment to meet its 2030 climate goals, which is over $100 billion more than the country is currently projected to receive by 2030, ranking it as the seventh-highest climate investment gap globally and the second-highest among emerging markets outside of China. In South Africa, tracked annual climate finance averaged $7.4 billion during 2019-2021, a record high. However, this figure remains significantly below the estimated average annual requirement of $18.9-$30.2 billion to meet 2030 objectives, suggesting the need to increase flows fivefold (Table 2).

International Climate Finance

The past four Global South G20 presidencies have seen significant traction on climate finance through the Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) and the Energy Transitions Working Group (ETWG). Indonesia's 2022 presidency set the agenda by identifying key pillars at the core of Global South energy transitions. India's presidency provided a platform for voices from the Global South by mainstreaming African challenges, the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and poverty in the G20 agenda. Brazil's presidency carried forward these initiatives and further anchored the G20 narrative of green transitions in development realities. This year, South Africa's message has maintained consistency by underscoring the need to scale energy transition investments globally by derisking private investment for climate change. A crucial omission, however, has remained: accelerating the transition away from fossil fuels. The G20 has served as an important platform for these four emerging economies to set norms for their needs and highlight climate financing gaps. It has introduced new targets and mechanisms for achieving them. However, these countries must now focus on implementing and operationalizing existing mechanisms that the G20 process has already delivered, rather than reinventing them.

Table 3 lists some of the most notable international climate finance partnerships, among them JETPs, green bonds, and national development banks offer essential insights into the role international finance plays in the energy transitions of IBSA and Indonesia. Insufficient funding is not the sole constraint. These countries also suffer from inadequate institutional capacity to absorb and deploy these funds.

The United States was one of the global leaders instrumental in securing JETPs for South Africa and Indonesia. While its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement (for a second time) and the JETPs have hurt the total international climate finance contributions, JETP host countries and their partners have remained steadfast in continuing the partnership and have invited other stakeholders to make up the difference. In both cases, withdrawal from JETP is of consequence from a symbolic standpoint, given the United States' influence over multilateral institutions. Substantively, the contributions primarily consist of loans through the United States Development Finance Corporation, which account for a minor share. In South Africa, German leadership has tried to mobilize other actors to close the gap, but the involvement of multiple institutions (about 50) and fragmented conditionalities make strategic coherence extremely difficult.

Indonesia JETP is far more reliant on the private sector than South Africa's, for nearly half of all contributions, anchored by the International Partners Group (IPG) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). Indonesia's and South Africa's institutional capacity to absorb these large funds, $8.5 billion and $20 billion, respectively, has been sluggish, due to the slow processing of bankable project proposals and delays in reforming key policies, and in turn, has failed to attract investors to close the gaps. A combination of both institutional capacity and committed investors is critical to making significant climate finance partnership agreements like the JETP work.

Green bonds can play a big role in mobilizing climate finance. IBSA and Indonesia have different strategies to issue them. India primarily relies on domestic issuance in rupees, with local banks and insurers serving as core investors. However, these bonds offer a lower green premium than the global average and offer no financial advantage over regular bonds, making them less attractive and India has struggled to attract both domestic and foreign participation. In contrast, South Africa and Brazil prioritize global issuance. South Africa's Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) issued a $235 million bond through private placement with a French development finance institution, Agence Française de Développement (AFD). This allowed South Africa access to a deep pool of international investors, potentially lowering capital costs but increasing dependence on foreign sentiment and exchange rate risks. Brazil released its Sovereign Sustainable Bond Framework in September 2023, shortly after which it debuted its sustainable bond. When released in November 2023, Brazil's $1.5 billion dollar-denominated bond saw 2.9 times oversubscription and was upsized to $2 billion. Like South Africa, Brazil, too, received access to new investors, although it shares similar foreign exchange risks. Indonesia offers a mixed model, with a domestic $1.25 billion Green Sukuk Bond and the world's first publicly offered sovereign international blue bond at $150 million through Japan. In this way, it balances both its local infrastructure and access to foreign capital. Overall, while global issuance offers larger, diversified funds, it introduces currency and external market vulnerabilities. A domestic strategy aligns with national priorities but can severely limit scale and investor diversity.

Beyond the JETP and green bonds, an essential international finance partnership vehicle is national development banks, which secure and channel concession finance. International experience, most notably from China, Japan, and Brazil's BNDES (Brazilian Development Bank), demonstrates the valuable role that public financial institutions can play in anchoring green industrial policy and scaling green lending (Table 3). These entities provide concessional credit, coordinate large-scale clean energy and industrial investments, and serve as institutional hubs for implementing climate strategies. In Brazil, for instance, BNDES not only channels concessional finance for sectors such as agriculture but also spearheads coordinated investment efforts through mechanisms such as the Amazon Bank Alliance and the Climate Fund.

Domestic Climate Finance Vehicles and Instruments

In response to investment gaps, countries in the IBSA + Indonesia grouping have been deploying industrial policies, taxonomies (a taxonomy is a classification system that defines and organizes economic activities based on sustainability criteria to evaluate their merit for government subsidies), as well as sector-specific and economy-wide climate finance instruments. These initiatives (Table 4) are increasingly translating into measurable domestic financial flows. India's tracked green finance in the fiscal year 2021-22 reached approximately $50 billion. Finance for mitigation was sourced predominantly through domestic channels, although there was a 2 percent year-on-year increase in international climate finance. Overall, finance flows to mitigation-related sectors rose by 20 percent during the same period.

In India, investment is driven by government-backed schemes and fiscal instruments, including the Payment Security Mechanism, Production Linked Incentives, and other targeted sector-level initiatives. In Brazil, the National Development Bank (BNDES) has sought to acquire equity stakes in companies to de-risk private capital flows into strategic sectors such as critical minerals, battery manufacturing, and electric vehicles. The bank has allocated approximately $1.6 billion in its acquisition budget for this purpose. The Brazilian government has introduced its industrial policy, ""Brazil New Industry,"" which allocates about $60 billion to modernize the national industrial sector, focused on increasing autonomy and further developing clean energy sources. Complementing this effort, Brazil's Growth Acceleration Plan directs approximately $61 million, double from the 2020 allocation, toward mining-related research and development. Additionally, the Green Mobility and Innovation program provides more than $3.8 billion in tax incentives to encourage low-carbon automobile transformation.

Similarly, in Indonesia, policy frameworks such as the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) and the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) are designed to mobilize private capital and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuel-intensive development.

Changes in electricity sector regulation have been a critical driver of growth in South Africa's climate finance landscape. These include the removal of licensing thresholds for new generation capacity, the development of wheeling and trading frameworks, and the declining costs of renewable technologies such as wind and solar. In parallel, the shift in market preferences, net-zero commitments by commercial financial institutions, and regulatory signals, such as the moratorium on new coal-fired power, have contributed to the realignment of investment strategies toward decarbonization.

IBSA and Indonesia are in different phases of publishing climate finance taxonomies to complement their clean industrial policies (Table 4). A climate finance taxonomy that provides clear definitions of green finance and climate finance and builds synergies with existing national goals can help reduce uncertainty and foster investor confidence, thereby facilitating the scaling of green finance and climate finance. The European Union's taxonomy has shown tangible outcomes over time, including higher volumes of aligned capital investments. However, interoperability and mutual legibility of taxonomies are crucial for scaling up green investments in the Global South. India and Brazil's proposed new taxonomies should be compatible with those of Indonesia and South Africa. Taxonomies must provide clarity, strict regulations, and penalties for institutions that fail to adapt. IBSA and Indonesia must share lessons learned from operationalizing taxonomies in similar contexts to further their energy transitions. For instance, Indonesia's land-use emissions are not being considered within current frameworks, despite their massive emissions profile.

Alongside industrial policy, taxonomy, and fiscal instruments, national public financial institutions are also emerging as essential enablers of climate-aligned investment. The structural bias of the global capital system continues to favor fossil fuel infrastructure, underscoring the need for systemic reform led by national platforms rather than fragmented, piecemeal efforts. A central pillar of such reform is the role of central banks in enforcing climate-aligned financial regulations. This includes implementing climate risk stress-testing frameworks and enforcing penalties for noncompliance, thereby aligning monetary stability with long-term decarbonization goals. In Indonesia, the experience of PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (PT SMI) further illustrates the potential of well-structured climate finance vehicles. Operated as a state-owned enterprise on a commercial basis, PT SMI combines sound governance and risk systems with project development expertise and the capacity to leverage private capital. Rather than establishing a new climate finance institution, the Indonesian government expanded PT SMI's mandate to include climate mitigation and adaptation, thereby capitalizing on existing institutional infrastructure and operational maturity.

Three lessons can be learned from PT SMI's institutional evolution. First, leveraging existing institutions, wherever feasible, can expedite the deployment of climate capital while maintaining alignment with national systems and standards. Second, strong and independent governance, supported by clearly defined investment mandates and comprehensive risk management frameworks, ensures discipline and credibility in financing decisions. Third, financial sustainability and leverage are essential to longevity. PT SMI maintains return hurdle rates, offers blended finance instruments such as investment grants to reduce capital costs, and preserves financial leverage without placing an undue burden on the state balance sheet. This climate finance vehicle design offers valuable insights for other developing and emerging economies aiming to scale climate action through financially resilient and institutionally anchored mechanisms. These institutional reforms operate in parallel with broader regulatory and market shifts that enable climate investment at scale.

Current trends highlight how these enabling conditions are translating into concrete shifts in sectoral financial flows. In India, foreign direct investment in the renewable energy sector has multiplied eightfold from FY 2021 to 2025. This surge is driven by large grid-scale solar projects as well as government-subsidized initiatives such as small solar power plants, solar pumps for agriculture, and rooftop solar systems. Tracked climate finance flows to electric vehicles rose from $513 million in 2020-21 to nearly $1.5 billion in 2021-22. These flows cover a wide range of vehicle types, including cars, buses, three-wheelers (such as e-rickshaws), and two-wheelers. In Indonesia, approximately 67 percent of the $35.6 billion in total investment between 2016 and 2021 went to renewable energy, primarily geothermal and hydropower. Over the same period, investments in new fossil fuel generation have been in decline. In South Africa, debt financing accounts for 75 percent of annual climate finance, with 59 percent of this debt directed toward the clean energy sector. The majority of these flows are facilitated through market-rate debt instruments, with the average cost of capital ranging between 10 and 12 percent.

While IBSA and Indonesia have made serious efforts to make their clean energy markets attractive for investment, there is a growing disconnect between donor rhetoric and the technical delivery of climate finance. To enable a coherent investment strategy and align divergent donor targets, thresholds, and red lines; robust institutional capacity along with political and financial fluency is necessary. In some of the examples discussed in this section, the availability of climate finance falls short due to the lack of hospitable investment environments. In others, despite the availability of funds, there is a lack of institutional capacity to utilize them effectively. To meet targets and accelerate energy transitions, IBSA and Indonesia must strengthen both aspects of their climate finance landscape: climate finance commitments and last-mile delivery. Most importantly, all members of the Global South must elevate local initiatives, establish their own norms, and mold the international financial architecture to meet their needs.

IV. Clean Technology Cooperation and Diversifying Supply Chains

While international climate finance remains fragmented and structurally unequal, IBSA and Indonesia are advancing simultaneous strategies to secure domestic control over their clean energy transitions. Besides financial gaps, these countries face sensitive technological dependencies, supply chain vulnerabilities, and lack access to emerging technologies. This section outlines how IBSA+Indonesia can strengthen cooperation in clean technology development and supply chain diversification to reduce reliance on external actors and to create resilient, locally anchored clean energy industries. For that to be possible, strategic industrial policies, investment in innovation ecosystems, and coordinated regional standards and efforts are needed.

Collaborating on industrial strategy, especially in clean technology, offers a strategic opportunity to reduce external exposure, which is particularly urgent given the current patterns of technological dependence across IBSA and Indonesia. As shown in Table 5, all four countries rely heavily on external manufacturers, especially China and Europe, for key clean energy inputs. Solar manufacturing is particularly concentrated, with China dominating across the board. Wind and hydro technologies have more diverse sourcing patterns, offering potential opportunities for diversification. India and Brazil, for example, already contribute to wind manufacturing and could strengthen value chains with partners like Denmark and Spain. Solar energy faces greater challenges. Recent research indicates that the main obstacle in India and Brazil is not technological capacity but the high cost of capital. Diversifying solar photovoltaic (PV) supply chains outside China could increase manufacturing costs by about 30 percent, mainly due to high capital costs rather than a lack of technical capacity an issue likely mirrored in South Africa and Indonesia. Addressing these structural barriers through joint financing platforms or special investment incentives could boost domestic manufacturing capacity in crucial technologies.

Currently, China has become the leading power in the global clean energy supply chain. It processes over 60 percent of the world's rare earth elements and refines about 90 percent of battery-grade lithium. China also accounts for 70 percent of the global manufacturing value for all major clean energy technologies including solar PV, wind, batteries, electrolyzers, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. In response, Western economies are adopting aggressive, subsidy-heavy industrial policies, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the European Union's (EU) Green Deal Industrial Plan, to reduce dependence on Chinese inputs by supporting domestic clean energy production. While these efforts aim to secure supply chains and promote decarbonization, they also deepen existing structural inequalities. Although the economies of the Global South have not significantly contributed to the historical buildup of atmospheric CO2, they are the first to suffer from its harmful effects, which are worsened by their reliance on fossil fuels for energy security, limited access to concessional finance, and technology.

These geopolitical concentrations are further aggravated by the Western subsidy regimes and trade policies, such as the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CBAM imposes a carbon tariff on imports of emission-intensive goods into the European Union, including steel, cement, and fertilizers. Although the CBAM is intended to help reduce emissions, it disproportionately impacts countries with high industrial emissions and limited capacity for decarbonization. By applying a uniform carbon price across different development contexts, CBAM risks perpetuating historical inequalities. A report by the Centre for Science and Environment estimated that, at a

rate of €100 (or $106) per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent, CBAM would impose an average annual tax burden of 25 percent on the value of CBAM-covered goods exported to the EU by India. Similarly, Africa faces export losses of up to 14 percent in aluminum and a 0.5 percent decline in GDP. These measures are being implemented without commitments for financing, technology, or transitional support, thus shifting the burden of decarbonization onto developing countries. Without fair frameworks, the Global South could be further marginalized in a subsidy-driven green economy.

Nonetheless, some policymakers argue that these pressures, though unjust, could encourage industrial growth in the Global South by motivating countries to adopt low-carbon standards, boost domestic manufacturing, and become more competitive in emerging cleantech value chains. For example, South Africa has started integrating carbon pricing into its domestic framework and launched the Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET-IP), supported by $8.5 billion in pledges from international partners, to promote a low-carbon, socially inclusive transition. However, while these efforts show potential benefits, the broader landscape remains structurally unequal few countries in the Global South have the fiscal space, institutional capacity, or technological access to absorb the short-term costs of CBAM while reaping long-term gains. Without reforms in global trade, finance, and technology governance, these industrial opportunities may remain largely inaccessible. These dynamics highlight the necessity of a coordinated strategy to localize and rebalance clean energy supply chains. As shown in Table 5, current sourcing patterns across IBSA and Indonesia reflect opportunities and risks in the clean tech manufacturing landscape.

To avoid that outcome, IBSA+Indonesia cooperation must go beyond shared structural disadvantages, to build practical, forward-looking industrial alliances. The Global South must adopt strategic industrial policies that identify important value chains and leverage state capacity to build long-term competitive advantages. Countries like Brazil, India, South Africa, and Indonesia should be viewed not just as resource suppliers but as emerging economic blocs with the potential to become self-sufficient clean technology markets, driven by regional demand, innovation ecosystems, and labor-intensive manufacturing. This involves going beyond extraction to develop comprehensive capabilities in sectors such as solar PV, batteries, green hydrogen, and grid infrastructure. Additionally, the Global South must define its value proposition not only in providing raw materials but also in shaping platform-level agendas, setting standards, and asserting leadership in global climate governance.

Increasingly, these countries are no longer content with merely following Western frameworks, such as CBAM. Instead, they aim to establish their own standards in areas like trade rules, logistics, and technology regulation. Initiatives such as India's Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, the African Union's Green Minerals Strategy, and Brazil's emerging green hydrogen plan show a change in mindset. The main challenge is expanding these efforts through coordinated investment, regional cooperation, and multilateral engagement that prioritize the development goals of the Global South, rather than just adopting frameworks created by others.

Critical Minerals

As clean energy infrastructure expands across the Global South, countries are focusing on securing the upstream materials that enable this growth. Critical minerals, such as lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements, are no longer viewed simply as commodities to be freely traded on global markets but as strategic assets linked to national development goals. By moving away from a free market approach, governments aim to ensure that mineral wealth leads to industrial growth, job creation, and domestic technological advancement. India's Critical Mineral Mission, Indonesia's export banks, and South Africa's draft mining reforms reflect a growing consensus on the importance of retaining value locally rather than exporting raw materials overseas. Brazil's new BYD electric vehicle plant in Bahia exemplifies this shift toward vertically integrated industrial strategies, from mining to clean tech manufacturing.

However, resource sovereignty alone is not enough. Cases like Mexico's state-led LitioMx illustrate the risks of pursuing resource nationalism without proper institutional readiness, which led to regulatory bottlenecks and investment uncertainty. The strategic goal for these developing countries remains to break historical patterns of extractivism and establish a more sovereign and equitable role in the global energy transition. One that relies not only on access to critical materials and domestic manufacturing but also on developing the necessary infrastructure to support and expand clean technologies.

Grid Modernization and Storage

Grid development and battery storage have become critical bottlenecks for many countries in the Global South. While wind and solar PV capacity are expanding rapidly, infrastructure often lags, resulting in delays in project deployment and reduced system efficiency. Globally, over 3,000 GW of renewable projects, 1,500 GW of which are in advanced stages, are stuck in grid connection queues, equivalent to five times the solar and wind capacity added in 2022. In several fast-growing economies, rising electrification and demand are outpacing grid readiness. Microgrids and battery storage can supplement infrastructure, but they cannot fully replace the need for modernized grids. Smarter, more resilient grids, facilitated by stronger regulatory frameworks, are essential for turning clean energy capacity into a reliable supply.

Several countries are beginning to address these gaps. South Africa has launched the continent's largest battery energy storage system (BESS), which is expected to support the design, procurement, installation, and sustainable operation of nearly 360 megawatts (MW) of large-scale energy storage infrastructure at six Eskom substation sites. India, by comparison, had installed 219.1 MW of BESS as of March 2024. Indonesia is piloting 5-10 MW systems, aiming to implement BESS across its power plants. Brazil, meanwhile, has conducted its first-ever auction to add batteries and storage systems to its grid. The planned batteries will help store energy from wind and solar sources which, although increasingly important in Brazil's energy mix, remain less predictable than traditional thermoelectric or hydropower units, thus aiding in balancing variability and ensuring grid reliability.

Still, without modern grids and large-scale storage, the growth of renewable energy in the Global South risks falling short of its potential. Battery deployment and grid upgrades must be regarded as essential infrastructure for a reliable and resilient clean energy future. However, deploying clean technologies at scale requires more than just physical infrastructure. It also depends on knowledge infrastructure. Without localized expertise, standards, and institutional support, even the most advanced technologies cannot succeed. As emerging technologies like clean hydrogen, small modular nuclear reactors, and long-duration storage evolve, the Global South must choose whether to remain passive recipients of innovation or active co-developers. Doing so will depend not only on investments but on deeper cooperation among research institutions, regulatory bodies, and innovation hubs.

Co-Development of Emerging Clean Technology

The growing focus on technical capacity and co-development is increasingly reflected in the rise of domestic research and innovation institutions across the Global South. These hubs are not only advancing frontier technologies, such as biofuels and green hydrogen, but are also emerging as key enablers of clean energy deployment through their focus on grid modernization, battery storage, and infrastructure innovation. In India, the Clean Energy Material Initiative (CEMI) advances next-generation energy systems through research on advanced materials, with a strong emphasis on solar technologies and energy storage. Brazil's Center for Research in Energy and Materials plays a vital role in bioenergy, nanotechnology, and sustainable fuels, while also contributing to grid-energy technologies that support the integration of variable renewable energy sources. South Africa's Global Cleantech Innovation Programme (GCIP-SA), led by its Technology Innovation Agency, supports clean tech entrepreneurs and small and medium enterprises, and aims to tackle real-world barriers to clean energy access, including energy reliability and storage. Indonesia's Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) is not only developing bio-based technologies such as sustainable aviation fuels from coconut oil but also exploring modular and distributed storage systems that are better suited to the country's archipelagic geography (see Figure 3).

Crucially, these institutions offer more than just technological progress; they represent an evolving knowledge infrastructure essential for absorbing, adapting, and scaling clean energy solutions. By investing in their domestic research ecosystems, IBSA and Indonesia are laying the foundation for greater self-reliance in clean energy value chains, reducing dependence on external technologies and standards. They also serve as regional hubs for South-South cooperation, providing platforms for the joint development of technologies, standard-setting coordination, and shared innovation in areas such as grid digitalization, long-duration energy storage, and distributed energy systems. These efforts collectively reflect a strategic shift, where countries in the Global South are no longer merely adopting imported solutions. They are striving to shape the clean energy transition through indigenous innovation and institution-building. This momentum must be complemented by broader cooperation across IBSA+Indonesia to expand these models and ensure a more equitable, secure, and resilient energy future.

Conclusion

As some of the largest developing economies in the Global South, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia have embarked on an ambitious path to increase their share of clean energy and achieve their NDC commitments over the coming decades. To do so, they must address similar challenges, including phasing out legacy fossil fuel infrastructure, overcoming the high cost of capital, adapting to concentrated clean energy supply chains and limited access to clean technologies. The success of these countries is key, as they represent some of the fastest-growing clean energy markets in the world. Their collective actions will significantly shape global climate outcomes.

IBSA+Indonesia as a group offers significant opportunities for coordination and collaboration to achieve a just and equitable energy transition. As a formalized grouping focused on energy transitions, IBSA and Indonesia should align their efforts by exploring five key policy priorities: workforce transitions strategies to phase out fossil fuels, building capacity to absorb climate finance, alignment to facilitate collective bargaining of the price of capital, clean industrial strategies and fostering innovation to ensure long-term competitiveness.

To bridge the disconnect between ambition and technical delivery of climate finance IBSA and Indonesia must bolster the institutional capacity and cross-ministerial alignment of their climate vehicles, including central banks, climate banks, and ministries. This can be achieved through the implementation of joint programs that strengthen the financial and political literacy of government employees critical to the energy transition and ensure last-mile delivery of climate finance. Furthermore, these countries have a significant opportunity to set norms around climate investments in the Global South by harmonizing climate finance taxonomies and jointly elevating similar local initiatives for greater eater investor visibility. This type of alignment will also facilitate the collective bargaining power of this grouping to negotiate the price of capital and build a long-term pipeline for investments in their respective energy transitions.

IBSA and Indonesia have deployed several incentives and domestic climate finance instruments to crowd in private investment. Shared learning from experiences in different clean energy sectors has great value if similar contexts can be identified at both the central and local levels. As these countries develop long-term clean industrial strategies, they must establish a recurring knowledge-sharing and feedback process that advances these strategies and collectively addresses market uncertainties, such as pandemics and conflict. This can ensure the long-term competitive advantage of IBSA + Indonesia countries.

The innovation of clean technology and emerging fuels is crucial to maintaining the long-term competitive advantage of IBSA and Indonesia's energy transitions. In this report, we have identified a few notable clean tech research hubs, however, with booming entrepreneurship and innovation in these sectors, there will undoubtedly be many more names to add to these lists. IBSA and Indonesia should expand this list, maintain a current database, and establish a cooperative framework to co-develop clean technologies of the future.

A strategy must be in place to replace jobs lost in the energy transition, particularly given the sensitivities surrounding fossil fuel sectors in IBSA and Indonesia. These countries must aim to directly mitigate adverse outcomes by offering a combination of vocational training and unemployment benefits. They can benefit by identifying transferable skills and effective place-based policies that address a variety of socio-cultural contexts. Collectively addressing these challenges of energy transitions can lighten the burden on fossil fuels to meet projected energy demand.

Beyond national collaboration, these four countries must continue to uphold unified leadership in global climate governance and trade discussions. Engaging in multilateral platforms such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the World Trade Organization, and G20, is essential to shape international norms that reflect these nations’ development goals while safeguarding their economic interests. By aligning diplomatic efforts and harmonizing policy frameworks, India, Brazil, South Africa, and Indonesia can assert a just and equitable energy transition.

Electric heat pumps have been put forward as the best option for home heating and cooling needs, rather than traditional HVAC systems.

Texas is the second-most-populous state in America with nearly 31 million residents, and they need air conditioning in the summer and heat in the winter. But that requires a lot of energy.

In 2021, a major winter storm named Uri hit the area and demand for power soared. Energy grids failed resulting in blackouts, frozen pipes, and presented dangerous conditions for people all over the state.

As the U.S. Department of Energy explains, heat pumps operate by transferring heat rather than generating it. This requires less energy than traditional HVAC units, but it is still effective at heating and cooling.

And less energy use means less pollution. In fact, another study done by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found heat pumps significantly reduce pollution.

It can be complicated to find the right HVAC fit for your home, let alone the right contractor. But companies like Mitsubishi help connect homeowners with trained professionals in their trusted network.

And since HVAC systems are responsible for an enormous percentage of our monthly energy bills, the switch will ultimately save you money. The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy report says electric heat pumps would save customers an average of $300 per year.

Quite simply, making the switch to an electric heat pump is good for your wallet and the environment. And Mitsubishi's HVAC consultation program is the type of setup that makes it easier than ever by directly connecting with local installers and all of the information you'd need to make a decision.

As Steven Nadel of the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy explains, heat pumps offer ""an enormous return on investment.""

He goes on to explain switching to heat pumps ""will save a lot of money to the consumers and reduce the winter peak demand.""

If you install a heat pump system before Dec. 31, you also could be eligible for government tax incentives.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Texas-power-gridimage-reclqOi1IQcU57bAV.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:58:48.810115

""This is not a fluke,"" said Sylvia Leyva Martinez, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie. ""Florida is now shaping national solar growth.""

The surge is being driven by utilities, not rooftop panels. Florida Power & Light alone built over 70% of the state's new solar last year. A state rule lets developers skip lengthy siting reviews for projects under 75 megawatts, which speeds up construction and cuts costs.

""There's no silver bullet,"" said Syd Kitson, founder of Babcock Ranch, a town designed to be powered almost entirely by solar. ""But one thing Florida got right is acceptance. Here, people want solar. And we're proving it works.""

""We didn't lose power, internet, or water,"" said Don Bishop, a homeowner there. ""That changes how you think about energy.""

The economics are doing the rest. With industrial demand rising and natural gas prices climbing, solar is increasingly the cheapest option, even without subsidies.

""Utilities aren't building solar because it's green,"" Martinez said. ""They're doing it because it's cheaper.""

But new challenges are emerging.

In July, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which accelerates the rollback of solar and wind tax credits. Homeowners lose the federal investment credit after 2025. Developers face tighter deadlines and stricter sourcing rules.

""It won't kill the market,"" said Zoë Gaston, an analyst who follows the solar industry at Wood Mackenzie. ""But it makes the math harder.""

Analysts now expect a 42% drop in rooftop solar installs in Florida over the next five years. And while utility-scale growth continues, grid constraints are becoming an issue. Utilities are pouring money into storage, smart infrastructure, and grid upgrades to keep up.

Babcock Ranch is piloting new microgrid systems to add resilience. The hope is that other communities can take the playbook and adapt it, storm-proofing neighborhoods one block at a time.

""We've been testing this for years,"" Kitson said. ""Now it's about scale. It's about showing others they can do it too.""

The bigger question is whether Florida can keep this momentum going without policy support, and while still leaning heavily on natural gas.

""Florida has the solar resources,"" said Mark Jacobson, a professor at Stanford's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. ""What's missing is political consistency.""

The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hosted Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in Westminster to unveil the UK-India Vision 2035 framework.

The bilateral plan aims to increase trade between the two nations by US$31.7bn annually, with a strong emphasis on sustainable development.

British firms now gain direct access to India’s expanding renewable energy market.

India’s clean energy sector is among the fastest-growing globally and the agreement gives UK green tech companies entry to one of the world’s largest clean energy transitions.

“It will create thousands of British jobs across the UK, unlock new opportunities for businesses and drive growth in every corner of the country, delivering on our Plan for Change,” said Keir Starmer at the official signing.

A gateway to India’s green energy transition

The trade deal is expected to fuel UK exports of renewable energy technologies to India, aligning with the country’s renewable energy targets.

British companies operating in solar, wind and low-carbon technologies now have access to a market undergoing rapid transition.

India’s energy policy increasingly favours sustainable solutions, creating strong demand for innovation and investment in this space.

British firms are also set to contribute to India’s clean energy infrastructure by transferring new technology and collaborating on joint research initiatives.

The agreement establishes a framework to support long-term cooperation in areas such as sustainable energy storage, grid integration and carbon-neutral industrial technologies.

This clean tech engagement is not limited to trade. It sets out structured commitments to knowledge-sharing, research and development and public-private collaboration in both countries.

These elements create opportunities for shared progress on climate and energy goals, positioning sustainability at the heart of economic growth.

Industrial cooperation expands with green tech in tow

More than two dozen UK companies are expanding operations in India under the terms of the agreement.

Aerospace firms Airbus and Rolls-Royce alone secure contracts worth about US$6.2bn, reflecting the broader industrial collaboration embedded in the trade pact.

The deal demonstrates how traditional sectors such as aerospace are aligning with broader sustainability objectives, such as more fuel-efficient aircraft and cleaner engine technology.

The UK’s Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds confirms nearly US$7.5bn in new investments and export agreements linked to the framework.

British firms from multiple sectors will benefit from reduced trade barriers, tariff cuts and liberalised investment rules, with green technology firms among the primary beneficiaries.

“India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and an emerging economic superpower,” says Jonathan, outlining how the deal opens new commercial pathways while responding to global sustainability demands.

Tariffs averaging 15% will fall to 3% for British products entering Indian markets, including low-emission vehicles, medical devices and high-efficiency machinery.

This price shift will also support India's move towards lower-carbon technologies and increase the appeal of sustainable imports.

Financial services liberalisation will allow greater UK investment in India’s green sectors.

Foreign investment caps remain stable, giving British investors more confidence to fund renewable energy projects and sustainable infrastructure across the subcontinent.

Technology and sustainability converge

The announcement coincides with the one-year mark of the UK-India Technology Security Initiative, launched in July 2024.

This initiative covers cooperation in AI, quantum computing, space exploration and cybersecurity, all of which increasingly intersect with energy and environmental priorities.

As more clean energy systems become digitally integrated, the blending of renewable infrastructure with cutting-edge technology is central.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/5805cc35c43ebc2e952b42eaa9e4551a:063c5d648ca12a5f0a844833934c0c39/uk-gov-india.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:58:34.729137

Globally, Panasonic generates 70 battery cells every second, producing more than six million cells daily.","Panasonic has officially opened its new cylindrical lithium-ion battery factory in De Soto, Kansas, US.

Spanning 4.7 million square feet, this facility is now one of the largest gigafactories in North America.

The Japanese company began mass production of 2170 battery cells on 14 July, setting a target for an annual production capacity of about 32 GWh.

Panasonic regards the Kansas factory as a landmark investment, among the most substantial in its 107-year history.

The facility was constructed on a 300-acre site, equivalent to more than 225 football fields, at a cost of US$4bn.

Upon full operation, it is projected to create up to 4,000 jobs.

Panasonic's manufacturing strategy

This Kansas facility is part of Panasonic Energy's strategic dual-region manufacturing model, complementing its existing Nevada Gigafactory, operational since 2017.

The Nevada plant, currently employing more than 4,000 people, has an annual capacity of 41 GWh and has delivered more than 11 billion battery cells to date.

When both North American facilities operate at full capacity, they will collectively produce approximately 73 GWh annually.

""The opening of our Kansas Factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States,"" said Kazuo Tadanobu, CEO of Panasonic Energy.

""This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas. Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains and nurturing the next generation of battery talent.""

""We believe that we will continue to succeed if we scale our business in a way that is sustainable for our people, sustainable for our business, sustainable for our industry, and sustainable for our planet,"" he says.

Panasonic's position in a competitive market

The launch of this facility coincides with a period when car manufacturers are actively pursuing expansions in EV production to meet growing consumer demands and comply with evolving regulatory frameworks.

While the US lacks nationwide mandates for phasing out petrol-fuelled cars, states like California have implemented regulations targeting the ban of internal combustion engine vehicle sales by 2035.

Panasonic plans to establish itself as a principal supplier to global auto manufacturers, leveraging its 30 years of expertise in lithium-ion battery production.

Globally, Panasonic generates 70 battery cells every second, producing more than six million cells daily.

The Kansas facility's anticipated annual output of 32 GWh will provide enough batteries to power approximately 500,000 electric vehicles once fully operational.

The economic impacts

Beyond direct job creation, the factory is expected to indirectly generate around 8,000 jobs in supplier and related industries.

Panasonic Energy is also partnering with institutions like the University of Kansas, fostering long-term industry-academia collaborations aimed at technological advancements and specialised talent development.

The facility's scale becomes apparent in its physical dimensions, with three passenger planes able to line up nose-to-tail in the central common area between the factory's two wings.

Walking every square foot of the facility would require nearly 13 days of continuous movement, which speaks to the sheer scale of the operation.

It is a project that is significant not only to Panasonic or the EV sector, but also the people of Kansas.

“Politics is the art of the possible, and the grand opening of the Panasonic plant in De Soto ushers in a new era for Kansas — a proud step forward in our mission to bring manufacturing jobs back to America, where they belong,"" says Ty Masterson, President of the Kansas Senate.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/fe71fa3d62528e2dcbe15cf936cc1f95:1bb7be22c52cb31b80e5d5e0e47889bd/panasonic-s-newly-opened-gigafactory-in-de-soto-kansas.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:58:40.124856

The Clear Fork solar project, located near San Antonio, is currently under construction and is expected to operate by summer 2027.

Enbridge estimates the cost of the facility at US$900m and will retain ownership of the asset. Under the agreement, Meta will offtake all electricity generated to support the company’s expanding data centre operations in the region.

“We are thrilled to partner with Enbridge to bring new renewable energy to Texas and help support our operations with 100% clean energy,” says Urvi Parekh, Meta’s Head of Global Energy.

The exact duration of the contract has not been disclosed.

“Clear Fork demonstrates the growing demand for renewable power across North America from blue-chip companies who are involved in technology and data centre operations,” says Matthew Akman, EVP Corporate Strategy & President of Renewable Power at Enbridge.

“Enbridge continues to advance its world-class renewables development portfolio using our financial strength, supply chain reach and construction expertise under a low-risk commercial model that delivers strong competitive returns.”

The project will add to Enbridge’s expanding renewable energy footprint in Texas. Earlier this year, the company brought online a 130MW solar project in Jim Wells County, also backed by a long-term PPA, this time with AT&T.

In the past year alone, Meta has announced a string of solar power deals across Texas and other US states to secure clean energy for its data centre infrastructure.

In May, Meta signed two power agreements to offtake 650MW of solar capacity across AES sites in Texas and Kansas.

That same month, it also signed Environmental Attribute Purchase Agreements (EAPAs) for two more solar farms in Texas — the 127MWdc (97.5MWac) Midpoint Solar project in Hill County and the 184MWdc (143MWac) Gaia Solar project in Navarro County — both developed by Sunraycer Renewables.

Texas remains a key market due to its land availability, favourable permitting and high solar irradiance.

While data centre developers face increasing scrutiny over energy use and grid impact, PPAs like this allow hyperscale customers to directly match their energy consumption with new renewable generation.

With Clear Fork expected to go live in 2027, Meta and Enbridge are positioning themselves for a future where data centre growth must align with reliable, utility-scale green power solutions.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/95565fbbdc422db85cdd3ebcea9569cf:18127b575538bf755011241292c8df76/urvi-parekh-head-of-energy-at-meta.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:58:57.207283

Even as the world transitions to cleaner power, oil and gas (and the infrastructure behind them) remain integral to the global economy.

Add in rising electricity demand from AI and data centers, and you have a sector where both old-school titans and new-age renewables can thrive.

If you have $500 and want to build a long-term, diversified position in energy, the goal is pretty simple: Find companies with strong balance sheets, steady dividends, and exposure to both sides of the energy transition. The following three energy stocks fit that bill precisely.

1. ExxonMobil: old-school energy with new ambitions

ExxonMobil (XOM -1.79%) is a titan of traditional energy. With operations spanning oil fields, gas stations, and refineries, the oil stock is built to weather just about any price cycle.

It's a fossil fuel giant, but Exxon isn't acting like a dinosaur. In December 2024, the company unveiled a bold 2030 plan to generate $20 billion in new earnings and $30 billion in added cash flow, all while deploying $140 billion to major projects and boosting shareholder returns.

About $30 billion of that is earmarked for carbon capture, hydrogen, and lithium developments. That's not a plan to pivot away from oil per se, but it is one to stay relevant no matter where energy goes next.

More to the present, Exxon has a fortress of a balance sheet, with $18.5 billion in cash at the end of the first quarter and an industry-leading debt-to-capital ratio of about 12%. As the chart below shows, both of these put Exxon in a favorable position in respect to its biggest competitor, Chevron.

And perhaps most important of all, Exxon pays investors to wait. The company has raised its dividend for 42 consecutive years, with a current yield near 3.5% and plenty of free cash flow to support future increases. Add in that strong balance sheet, ongoing share buybacks, and one of the lowest break-even oil prices in the industry, and you have a cash machine with staying power.

2. Enbridge: a dividend pipeline that's going solar

Enbridge (ENB 2.01%) is Canada's energy highway. It transports about 30% of North America's crude oil and 20% of the U.S. natural gas supply. Fun fact: Its oil pipeline network stretches more than 18,000 miles, long enough to wrap around three-quarters of the Equator.

With a dividend north of 6% and three decades of consecutive hikes, Enbridge has become a go-to for income investors. What really sets it apart, however, is how it is building a dual engine for growth. The company is investing billions annually not just into pipeline expansions, but also offshore, wind, solar, and renewable natural gas.

The strategy is already in motion. Enbridge recently broke ground on Clear Fork, a 600-megawatt solar project near San Antonio, Texas, backed by a long-term power purchase agreement with Meta Platforms. The $900 million facility is expected to come on line in 2027 and start adding cash flow and earnings right away. It's a clear sign that the company isn't just moving energy anymore but helping to build infrastructure that will power tech giants and data centers.

3. NextEra Energy: the clean energy leader

NextEra Energy (NEE -0.84%) the lone renewables stock on this list, brings something the other two can't: long-term growth without the fossil fuel baggage. It's the world's largest producer of wind and solar power, and it runs Florida Power & Light, the biggest regulated utility in the country.

In the second quarter, NextEra added 3.2 gigawatts of new clean-energy projects, lifting its total backlog to 30 gigawatts, roughly the size of 30 nuclear reactors. That pipeline gives the company visibility into future earnings, which it expects to grow 6% to 8% annually through 2027.

It's also targeting 10% dividend growth through at least 2026, building on 29 straight years of increases . Today's 3% yield may not scream high income, but it's backed by strong free cash flow and one of the safest payout ratios in the industry.

One caveat is that the company trades at a premium: about 20 times forward earnings. But with projected earnings per share (EPS) of $3.45 to $3.70 this year and unmatched leadership in the renewables race, that premium isn't empty air. For investors looking to own a piece of the clean energy sector, NextEra Energy seems about as ""forever"" as it gets.

Welcome back to another episode of TEN — Transport Evolved News! Thanks for joining me!.

I’m afraid today’s show is packed with a lot of not-so-great news, but hey — my job’s to report the news, not make it. So grab a beverage, put your feet up, and let’s meet the bad news head-on together.

Last week, I told you the EPA was planning to scrap the 2009 Endangerment Finding —

the rule that says greenhouse gases harm human health.

This week, the agency made it official, proposing to eliminate the finding and every regulation built around it. In a partisan press event, officials accused Presidents Obama and Biden of, quote, “twisting the law” and using “warped science.” The new EPA claims it’ll save over a trillion dollars in so-called hidden taxes. But data from the Energy Information Administration — part of the U.S. Department of Energy — shows rolling back emissions rules could raise gas prices by more than seventy-six US cents a gallon. Why? Because dirtier vehicles burn more fuel. The EPA isn’t protecting anything now — just polluters’ profits. EPA? That’s the Enriching Polluters Association, to you.

I’m afraid we’ve got more bad news from the U.S. – the U.S. and European Union have just announced a new fifteen percent tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., including cars.

This agreement came just hours after President Trump gave a rambling press conference full of lies about wind turbines and clean energy — something I debunked earlier this week on the channel (link down below).While fifteen percent is better than the twenty-five percent tariff slapped on European imports April, it’s still six times higher than the two and a half percent tariff before President Trump initiated his unpopular trade war. This, combined with no EV incentives from the end of September means that we’re unlikely to see a reversal of policies on behalf of many European automakers – who have already either stopped or restricted EV imports to the U.S.

If you’ve bought a vehicle with a warranty, you expect it to be honored. That’s just basic common sense. But if you’re a customer of Lion Electric, forget it.

This week, Deloitte Restructuring — the court-appointed firm running Lion Electric’s affairs — told fleet operators, mostly schools, their maintenance contracts have been handed to a company Deloitte plans to bankrupt. That means Lion Electric no longer feels responsible for service or warranty work, and customers are left high and dry. With such a niche vehicle, good luck finding anyone else willing or able to fix these buses. It’s a gut punch to operators who depend on these buses to keep kids safe — and a betrayal of every warranty promise. It’s infuriating. Unacceptable. And yet another dark cloud over the EV industry this week.

The Chevrolet Bolt EV is, in my opinion, one of the best low-cost EVs of the last decade. And judging by how many folks complain about the shiny new EV they traded their Bolt for at lease end, I think many of you agree.

We’ve known for a while that GM plans to resurrect the Bolt later this year, promising NACS charging, better battery performance, and—for the first time in a North American GM vehicle—a lithium-ion phosphate battery pack, which should help lower the sticker price. This week, GM teased the first photos of the new model, and I’m pleasantly surprised. It looks like much of the styling carries over from the short-lived Bolt EUV, with a similar front end, rear end, and that NACS inlet where the CCS port was on the old Bolt EV and EUV. We’ll know more in the coming months, so watch this space.

When a new vehicle hits the market, automakers like to show how thoroughly it’s been tested — helping customers gain confidence to place an order.

This week, as part of its EV4 launch program, Kia published details of battery tests done in pre-production. The car was pushed through ten thousand kilometers (about six thousand two hundred miles) at Germany’s Nürburgring, operating at ninety to ninety-five percent of its rated power, followed by hypermiling tests on the same track. It then underwent a simulated one hundred and ten thousand kilometers (around sixty-eight thousand miles) of rolling road tests. After all that, Kia reported the battery still held ninety-five percent of its original capacity — well above the seventy-percent minimum Kia guarantees over one hundred thousand miles (or one hundred and sixty thousand kilometers). Of course, no amount of testing can cover every real-world scenario, so your mileage can and will vary.

A new study from CDK Global — its EV Ownership Survey — shows that while many first-time EV owners worry their car will cost more to fuel and maintain than a gassed vehicle, that perception often changes after a few service visits.

The survey highlighted some notable trends. Many EV owners now prefer mobile service over dealership visits, though EVs are taking longer on average to repair than they were a year ago. Still, most non-Tesla EV owners come away feeling positive: fifty-three percent say their cars are cheaper to run after a few visits. Only forty-one percent of Tesla owners agree though— hinting that Tesla’s service costs might be a little too high. What do you think? Do you agree? Let us know in the comments, our Discord, or reach out to us on social media.

Another survey now — this time from EV Intelligence. Its latest Self-Driving and Electric Vehicles: U.S. Market and Analysis Report, which offers some revealing insights.

Polling both EV and non-EV owners, it found that many automakers have work to do on brand image. Toyota led with a View Intensity Score — positive opinions minus negative — of twenty, despite limited EV offerings. Honda followed at sixteen, BMW and Chevrolet at ten, and Ford, Audi, and Porsche tied at nine. Tesla came in last out of nineteen brands, with negative sixteen — fifteen points worse than VinFast, a brand most people have never heard of. Views on Tesla, Elon Musk, and Robotaxi plans were notably poor. And forty-six percent of respondents said they’d never ride in an autonomous vehicle — showing just how far there is to go to get the meat sacks out of the driver’s seat.

Ford published its second-quarter earnings this week, beating Wall Street expectations with fifty billion, one hundred and eighty million dollars in revenue and adjusted earnings of thirty-seven cents per share.

Like GM last week, Ford took a hit from White House tariffs, losing eight hundred million dollars alone. Its Model e division posted wider losses of one point three billion dollars — despite a one hundred and twenty-eight percent increase in EV sales. Most losses were due to investment in its next-generation EV platform. CEO Jim Farley confirmed we’ll learn more in ten days, with a full reveal planned for August eleventh in Kentucky. He called it a “Model T moment” for Ford’s EV plans — promising an all-electric, all-American EV for everyone. Developed in a hush-hush skunkworks led by ex-Tesla and Apple engineers, the vehicle is meant to be a game-changer. Whether it delivers? We’ll find out soon enough.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration released its May electric power report — and the numbers are encouraging for renewables.

Wind power made up twelve point two percent of electricity generated in the first five months of the year. But solar led the way, with utility-scale solar installations growing by a third year over year, plus small-scale solar up nearly nine percent. For the first time, combined utility and small solar outproduced wind — generating almost thirty-eight thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five gigawatt-hours of power. Overall, nearly thirty percent of May’s electricity came from renewables. Fossil fuels’ time is running out — even if some in power don’t want to admit it.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office has published its long-awaited report evaluating the national EV charging rollout under the NEVI and CFI program.

Commissioned before the last presidential election — and based on data from January, before the current White House took office — the report outlines serious flaws. It found rollout was far slower than promised, tracking was inconsistent, and there was widespread frustration between state and federal agencies and stakeholders. But instead of fixing the problems, the new administration has slammed on the brakes — suspending state plans, halting federal guidance, and freezing progress. The report details a mismanaged rollout under a pro-EV White House — now facing outright sabotage from a cruel dictator-wannabe who has not hidden his disdain for EVs, and who is allegedly backed by a billion dollars in fossil fuel donations.

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

We usually talk EVs, but this week, U.S. and Canadian safety bodies held a press conference exposing a harsh truth: U.S. road deaths are climbing — not falling.

From 2011 to 2021, fatalities in the U.S. jumped by a third. Among twenty-nine wealthy countries, the U.S. leads with more than double the crash death rate per person. It’s easy to blame SUV and pickups — and they do play a massive role in pedestrian deaths, thanks to their ridiculous hood heights and poor visibility. But Canada — with a similar mix of vehicles — cut its fatalities by eighteen percent in the same period. Distracted driving — especially from people misusing semi-autonomous technology and treating it like full self-driving — will only make it worse. Having taken driving tests in both the U.S. and Europe, I can say driver education and enforcement in the U.S. are embarrassingly weak. If things don’t change, more Americans will die on roads that should be safer, not deadlier.

And finally,

It’s no secret that Kate, I, and the whole TE crew are more than a little fed up with the wave of oversized, overpriced EVs flooding North America.

Vi, our DP, loves kei trucks and used to drive a Fiat 500. Kate had a Mitsubishi i-MiEV — and briefly owned the Flux Capacitor before it was famous. I’ve had not one, but three all-electric microcars. So when Honda unveiled its new N-One e in Japan this week? I nearly screamed. It’s a four-seat electric kei car with folding “magic” seats (like the old Fit/Jazz), a minimalist interior, V2L, one-pedal driving, and crucially — no need to prove you have a parking space to own it in Japanese cities. This is exactly the kind of city EV we need. Not another rolling monument to excess. And honestly? I wish I lived in a timeline where tech like this was celebrated… not mocked.

And on that note, we’re done for today!

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we’d really appreciate it. YouTube is now putting upwards of fifteen ads in our videos – and keeping all the profits for itself, our ad revenue is now officially less than one eighth of what it was a few years back. And while we’re certainly not alone – other creators are similarly struggling at the altar of corporate greed – if we can’t increase our Patreon support, we’re done for. If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month, would put us in a much better financial position.

I should also note we’re available for third-party video production work in the Portland Oregon area, if you have a business or project you’d like us to work with you on, reach out. You’ll also find merch at our swag store, and amazon affiliate links in this video description or on our website that you can use to support TE when you worship at the altar of Bezos. We don’t like Amazon, but without affiliate links, Amazon pockets the money it would otherwise send to us.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

To finish, remember this:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what anyone says. And no corporate policy change or discriminatory rules change that.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. In these times, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

If you need to rest or step back, that’s okay. Take care of yourself. Then, when you’re ready, stand up for decency, community, and justice — peacefully and together. Build connections that celebrate every voice, embrace diversity, and learn from the past to shape a better future.

Wherever you are, whoever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be the change you want to see. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

In a groundbreaking development, a fully electric Venetian water taxi, named Lucietta, has emerged as a symbol of innovation and sustainability in the world of marine tourism. This stunning vessel represents a collaborative effort between marine designers, shipyards, and energy experts, setting a new benchmark for eco-friendly transportation on Venice’s historic canals. With a focus on providing zero-emission, stylish, and functional transportation, Lucietta is poised to enhance the tourism experience in one of the world’s most visited cities while staying true to its unique history and traditions.

Venice, known for its iconic canals, gondolas, and water taxis, is now embracing a new form of travel with Lucietta, a modern reinterpretation of the classic Venetian water taxi. Powered entirely by electricity, this innovative watercraft offers a sustainable alternative to traditional petrol-powered taxis, providing both locals and tourists with a cleaner, quieter, and more eco-friendly way to navigate the city’s famous waterways.

Lucietta: Blending Tradition with Modern Innovation

Lucietta’s design is a perfect balance between tradition and innovation, staying true to the iconic aesthetic of Venice’s water taxis while incorporating advanced electric propulsion technology. The development of Lucietta stemmed from the vision of renowned marine design studio Nauta Design, who worked in collaboration with Cantiere Serenella, a respected Italian shipyard, and Swiss energy company Repower. Together, these experts have created a boat that not only upholds the beauty of Venice’s rich maritime history but also champions sustainability with its cutting-edge electric motor.

The design of the Lucietta is deeply rooted in the Venetian cultural context. The water taxi’s dimensions are specifically tailored to fit within the city’s tightly constrained canals, which are bordered by historical buildings, bridges, and narrow streets. The boat measures 9.3 meters (30.5 feet) in length, 2.25 meters (7.4 feet) in width, and 2.1 meters (6.8 feet) in height, perfectly matching the size limitations imposed by Venice’s infrastructure. Despite these constraints, the Lucietta retains a sleek, modern look that reflects its advanced technology.

Electric Propulsion for Clean, Quiet Travel

Lucietta’s electric propulsion system is powered by a 200 kW motor paired with a 180 kWh battery pack. This system enables the water taxi to reach a top speed of 30 knots (34.5 mph), with cruising speeds between 7 and 10.8 knots (8 to 12 mph), perfect for leisurely trips through the Venetian lagoon. When operating at lower speeds, the vessel can remain out on the water for an entire working day without needing to recharge, offering a sustainable solution for all-day tours.

The electric propulsion not only reduces noise pollution, making the canals quieter and more serene, but it also eliminates harmful emissions, providing a cleaner, greener way to travel through Venice. This move toward electrification is seen as a vital step in preserving the city’s environment while continuing to support the marine tourism industry. In a city where tourism plays a critical role in the economy, offering a sustainable alternative to conventional gas-powered boats is an important contribution to Venice’s long-term future.

Features Designed for Comfort and Functionality

The Lucietta is designed with passenger comfort and practicality in mind. The boat can carry up to 14 passengers, with plenty of seating options for guests to choose from. A shaded midsection offers a cool respite from the sun, while the exposed stern provides an ideal spot for those who want to bask in the Venetian sunshine. For optimal visibility, the “driver” of the Lucietta sits at the front of the boat, offering excellent views of the canal and allowing for smooth maneuvering.

Passengers aboard the Lucietta can enjoy a range of modern amenities designed to enhance the overall experience. These include USB charging ports, allowing passengers to keep their mobile devices charged during their journey, and a high-quality audio system for onboard entertainment. The boat also boasts a 42-liter fridge for cold refreshments, a 56-liter fresh water tank, LED navigation lights, and underwater aft lighting to ensure visibility even in the darker hours. The boat’s synthetic teak deck and flooring add a touch of luxury, while the carbon fiber hull ensures that the boat is both lightweight and durable.

Sustainability Meets Luxury in Venetian Tourism

One of the key features of Lucietta is its commitment to sustainability, which is a growing concern in global tourism, especially in iconic destinations like Venice. Venice’s canals are integral to the city’s charm, attracting millions of tourists every year. However, the environmental impact of tourism, particularly from gas-powered boats, has raised concerns over the years. Lucietta’s electric-powered design provides a solution to this issue, reducing the carbon footprint of the tourism industry in Venice while maintaining the luxurious, high-end travel experience that visitors expect.

The integration of fast-charging stations for electric vehicles in Venice will make it easier for operators of electric boats like Lucietta to stay fully powered throughout the day, further enhancing the practicality of this new technology. This marks a significant step forward in modernizing public transportation in Venice, making it more sustainable and efficient for both tourists and locals alike.

Lucietta’s Role in Modernizing Public Transport in Venice

The Lucietta isn’t just a new attraction for tourists; it’s also a contribution to the ongoing discussion about improving public transportation in Venice. The city has long struggled with issues of congestion, pollution, and the impact of tourism on local infrastructure. With its emission-free propulsion system, Lucietta offers a glimpse into what the future of public transport in Venice could look like.

By introducing electric boats to Venice’s historic canals, the Lucietta paves the way for a more sustainable future for the city’s marine transport system. It is part of a larger movement to rethink transportation options in Venice, blending innovation with respect for the city’s ancient traditions. As cities around the world increasingly adopt electric transport solutions, Venice is no exception, with Lucietta leading the charge in offering a more eco-friendly way to navigate the canals.

Lucietta at Major Events: A Symbol of Innovation and Sustainability

The Lucietta made its debut at the prestigious Salone Nautico di Venezia, the Venice Boat Show, where it garnered significant attention for its innovative design and sustainable features. The boat also made an appearance at the Venice International Film Festival, an iconic event that attracts visitors from around the globe. Its presence at such high-profile events showcases not only the boat’s elegance but also its potential to become a key player in the future of Venetian tourism and transport.

Despite its debut at these events, the Lucietta is still in its prototype stage, with no official production plans announced yet. However, the collaboration between Nauta Design, Cantiere Serenella, and Repower has shown that electric water taxis are a feasible and exciting new direction for the future of Venetian transport.

The Future of Electric Water Taxis in Venice

The introduction of Lucietta marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter in the way Venice approaches tourism and public transport. As more and more cities around the world look to reduce emissions and embrace sustainable technologies, the electric water taxi could become a key component of Venice’s transport infrastructure. By offering a comfortable, stylish, and eco-friendly alternative to traditional boats, Lucietta is setting the stage for other cities to adopt similar solutions, not just for tourism, but for everyday use.

As the conversation around sustainability and climate change continues to grow, projects like Lucietta serve as a reminder that innovation and tradition can coexist to create a better future. For Venice, Lucietta is not only a beautiful vessel; it’s a symbol of the city’s commitment to preserving its heritage while embracing the technologies of tomorrow.

The proposed anaerobic digestion plant at Marigold Farm, off Welham Way, Great Bowden, would treat chicken manure, maize and straw to create biogas.

Developer Great Bowden Green Energy Ltd wants to pipe the gas to the nearby National Grid plant.

Planning officers at Leicestershire County Council have advised councillors to approve the scheme when they discuss it on Thursday.

A report to the council's development control board said more than 300 people had objected to the scheme.

Concerns raised include fears about odour from the treatment process as well as the impact of heavy goods vehicles importing manure and food stock to the site.

The applicant said the treatment process would create no smells, and there would be a maximum of 52 daily lorry movements in and out of the site during 30 peak days of the year - with 22 trips at other times.

It also said the lorries' loads would be covered to prevent spillage.

The county council report said the operator would require a permit from the Environment Agency, which would require pollution control measures.

If councillors approve the scheme, there would be conditions limiting the importation of manure and crops to 40,000 tonnes a year.

The company was recently reported to have secured a 6 trillion won ($4.3 billion) deal to supply LFP batteries for Tesla’s ESS products.
The Tennessee plant, with an annual capacity of 50 gigawatt-hours, could potentially secure an additional 10 gigawatt-hours for LFP production.
It seeks to produce LFP ESS cells next year.","The market for energy storage systems, or ESS, in the US is at a critical juncture, as Korean battery-makers move to fill the gaps left by domestic players hurt by tariffs.

Oregon-based Powin, once a top-three ESS integrator, filed for bankruptcy after tariff-driven costs on Chinese battery imports surged, exposing how vulnerable US firms are to foreign supply shocks.

The shift, driven by Donald Trump’s push to curb Chinese dominance, is opening the door for Korean firms to ramp up local production and expand their US footprint.

According to recent media reports, Powin, headquartered in Oregon, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last month at a court in New Jersey after piling on more than $300 million in debt. The Chapter 11 filing will enable the company to operate under court supervision while restructuring its finances.

The main factor behind Powin’s collapse was its inability to find alternative suppliers for battery cells outside of China. The company predominantly sourced lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, battery cells from Chinese battery-makers, including CATL, and integrated them into its ESS products.

Powin has reportedly suffered from project delays or even renegotiations with clients due to supply chain disruptions arising from its dependence on China-focused battery sourcing.

Last month, the company said in a statement that its “significant financial challenge” was “reflective of ongoing headwinds in the broader energy storage industry.”

Chinese-made ESS batteries imported into the US are currently subject to a 40.9 percent tariff, which is anticipated to rise to 58.4 percent next year.

Industry insiders indicate that while Trump’s strategy to curb US reliance on the Chinese battery supply chain may come at the expense of domestic companies like Powin, it is likely to open doors for Korean battery-makers.

Notably, LG Energy Solution, the only company capable of manufacturing LFP ESS cells in the US at its Michigan facility, is moving fast to capitalize on this emerging market with no clear leader.

The company was recently reported to have secured a 6 trillion won ($4.3 billion) deal to supply LFP batteries for Tesla’s ESS products. Tesla was considered a promising US company to start LFP cell manufacturing for its own ESS lineups, such as Megapack and Powerwall, at its Nevada facility. But its production capacity will apparently not be enough to meet market demand.

During its second-quarter earnings conference call, LG Energy Solution also hinted at the possibility of converting portions of the production lines at its joint venture facilities in the US with global automakers -- likely the second plant with General Motors in Tennessee -- from electric vehicle manufacturing to ESS. It aims to increase its capacity from a potential 17 gigawatt-hours by the end of this year to 30 gigawatt-hours by 2026.

The Tennessee plant, with an annual capacity of 50 gigawatt-hours, could potentially secure an additional 10 gigawatt-hours for LFP production. This is based on last year’s 40 percent operational rate and the potential allocation of half its capacity to LFPs.

“Utilizing a joint venture facility with GM is an efficient move to streamline capital expenditures, while swiftly addressing the fast-growing demand for ESS,” said Lee Ho-geun, an automotive engineering professor at Daeduk University. “This strategy could buy time for LG to prepare its third joint plant, acquired from GM, for ESS battery production.”

On Thursday, Samsung SDI announced that it will convert a portion of the EV production lines at its joint venture plant with Stellantis in Indiana into ESS lines, with large-scale production for nickel, cobalt and aluminum batteries set to start this year. It seeks to produce LFP ESS cells next year.

SK On is also gearing up for large-scale manufacturing of LFP cells and has signed a cathode supply deal with L&F Co. for the North American market.

Korean companies are looking to solidify their presence in the US with large-scale, containerized ESS, spurred by the rapid expansion of data centers and the increasing demand for reliable electricity supply solutions.

Among the ESS products, ranging from battery packs to containerized systems, containerized ESS is gaining momentum, driven by the rapid expansion of data centers and the increasing demand for reliable electricity supply solutions.

“Compared to small battery packs for residential applications, containerized ESS are more effective in boosting sales and profits because they are considered value-added products,” said an industry source familiar with the matter on condition of anonymity. “These systems are equipped with various features, including safety mechanisms that control humidity and temperature to protect the battery systems within the container.”

Samsung SDI’s flagship Samsung Battery Box 1.5, a fully equipped, ready-to-deploy product, is housed within a 20-foot container using nickel, cobalt and aluminum cells, with an energy capacity of approximately 5.26 megawatt-hours. LG Energy Solution’s JF2S DC Link, similar in size to Samsung Battery Box 1.5, offers a capacity of approximately 5 MWhs. However, it is powered by more cost-effective LFP batteries.

A key component of this effort is the large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources (RES), such as solar and wind, which are rapidly transforming electricity systems worldwide1. In response, many regions have adopted ambitious decarbonization targets to accelerate renewable integration. This study focuses on two major U.S. electricity markets: the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) and the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). These markets are notable for both their high annual electricity demand and significant penetration of renewables. California and Texas have also enacted distinct policy frameworks to support decarbonization2,3,4,5,6. In California, Senate Bill 100 mandates that 100% of electricity retail sales be supplied by renewable and zero-carbon resources by 20457. Texas, by contrast, was an early adopter of a renewable portfolio standard and has expanded its renewable capacity through a market-based approach8.

As of 2021, Texas and California were the first- and second-largest U.S. states in terms of electricity consumption9. While California’s overall demand has declined in part due to efficiency and conservation measures10, both states have experienced substantial growth in wind and solar generation. As shown in Table 1, renewable energy accounted for 28.4% of annual generation in California and 25.4% in Texas, a significant increase from 2010 levels, when wind and solar represented only 2.9% and 0.4% of California’s net generation, respectively11,12. Over the same period, Texas increased its share of generation from wind and solar from 6.35% and 0.002–20.7% and 3.1%, respectively.

Earlier studies examining the operational impacts of RES focused primarily on simulations rather than actual historical data. Makarov et al.13 predicted that CAISO would need additional load-following capacity (0.8 GW up, 0.6 GW down) to integrate 4.1 GW of new wind generation from 2006 to 2010. Katzenstein and Apt14 modeled a wind or solar photovoltaic plus gas system, finding that steam injection gas generators achieved only 30–50% of expected NOx emissions reductions and close to 80% of expected CO2 emissions reductions.

Others, like Eser et al.15, show the effect of increased penetration of RES on thermal power plants in Central Western and Eastern Europe. Using a power flow model, the authors show that an increase in penetration of RES induces a 4–23% increase in the number of starts in conventional plants, and a 63–181% increase in load ramp. Eser et al.’s15 findings are similar to those from other studies regarding the effect of cycling on power plant operational life: not only does increased cycling result in more wear and tear on gas generators16,17,18 but also reduces emissions performance, especially at lower capacity factors19. Valentino et al. show the change in the number of startups and the degradation of plant heat rate with lower utilization20. They use a dispatch model to determine active units and estimate a fuel consumption function based on different blocks of heat rate data. However, the study does not consider heat rate as a function of plant type, ramping, vintage, and degree of cycling, which is a key determinant of heat rates at low utilization levels.

Some studies focus on how RES may change the unit commitment and economic dispatch of generators and conclude that increasing wind and solar penetration changes market dynamics in both nodal and wholesale electricity market designs21,22,23. Other analyses find that RES lead to an increase in ramping, lower utilization, and higher operations and maintenance costs24,25,26,27,28. While unit commitment and economic dispatch studies using simulations provide valuable insights and demonstrate that increasing penetration of RES changes several operational characteristics of thermal plants, these approaches may miss real-world operations in the electricity system, including coping with transmission constraints, with policies, and with RES variability29. Empirical approaches that rely on observational data mitigate some of these limitations, but may not capture future conditions with larger RES capacity and generation. Examples of such approaches include the studies by Fell and Johnson29, Mills et al.30, and Wiser et al.31. These studies find that renewables do indeed displace thermal generation; however, the nature and magnitude of the displacement are still heterogeneous across the studies. Empirical studies examining how renewable energy affects emissions and ramping in thermal power plants remain limited. In particular, there is little analysis of how operational changes drive emissions intensity and how these effects can be mitigated through improved dispatch.

In this study, we develop a framework to evaluate the operational and environmental impacts of renewable integration on thermal generation. Using historical data from 2018 to 2023 for CAISO and ERCOT, we analyze patterns in thermal plant behavior under increasing renewable penetration. We begin by comparing emissions outcomes under simplified operational scenarios. We then use regression analysis to estimate the system-level change in generation and emissions associated with a 1% increase in wind and solar generation. Finally, we examine individual plant-level responses, highlighting heterogeneous effects by region and fuel type.

Alternate emissions scenarios for thermal power plants

We use hourly thermal generation and CO2 emissions from the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA) Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) at the generating unit and power plant level to study the operational characteristics of power plants. We start by assessing the observed emissions in each year from 2018 to 2023 in CAISO and ERCOT, and then compare those emissions to what they would have been under different operational scenarios. Specifically, we compare the historical emissions to counterfactual scenarios in which each power plant operates at its observed emissions intensity under both low and high capacity factor conditions.

The rationale for constructing simplified emissions scenarios is illustrated in Fig. 1, which presents the relationship between emissions intensity and capacity factor across generating units at two representative thermal power plants: Moss Landing, a natural gas-fired facility in CAISO (Fig. 1a), and Tolk Station, a coal-fired plant in ERCOT (Fig. 1b). In both cases, operation at lower capacity factors is associated with a marked increase in emissions intensity. For example, reducing the capacity factor from 0.3 to 0.05 results in a 133% increase in average emissions intensity at Moss Landing and a 51% increase at Tolk Station. This pattern reflects a broader trend across thermal generating units: emissions intensity rises as capacity factor declines. The underlying mechanism is thermodynamic inefficiency—when thermal units operate at low utilization levels, they consume more fuel per unit of electricity generated, leading to higher CO2 emissions per megawatt-hour. Each point in the figure represents an hourly observation of generation and emissions at the unit level, as reported to CEMS.

At Moss Landing, generating units operating at capacity factors greater than 0.3 exhibit a mean emissions intensity of 0.36 tons CO2 per MWh. When operating below a capacity factor of 0.05, this value increases to 0.84 tons CO2 per MWh. At Tolk Station, the mean emissions intensity increases from 0.94 to 1.43 tons CO2 per MWh over the same capacity factor range. These findings are not limited to the two facilities examined. Across the full fleet of natural gas and coal-fired units in CAISO and ERCOT, we observe consistent increases in emissions intensity at lower capacity factors. Supplementary Figs. 3 through 11 present analogous plots for all relevant generating units. To account for this systematic variation in operating emissions, we construct alternative emissions scenarios as described below.

As the generation from RES increases, more thermal plants will be required to operate at low capacity factors or will remain online as spinning reserves given ramping and startup constraints (also shown in Supplementary Fig. 12). Low utilization will in turn result in higher hourly heat rates as a direct consequence of which system-level emissions will also increase. To model these effects, we start by considering two simplified emissions intensity scenarios that represent different operational regimes of thermal plants: (i) a “low emissions” scenario where we select, for each plant, the 10th percentile of emissions intensity, (ii) and a “high emissions” scenario where we consider the emissions intensity of the plant at the 90th percentile of their observed emissions intensity in CEMS. These low and high emissions intensity scenarios are related to how the plants are operated, and thus, in the next results sections, we will address this issue using regression-based models. Figure 2 presents annual emissions under three scenarios: low, high, and observed emissions intensity. Figure 2b, d and f additionally show the distribution of plant-level emissions intensities, highlighting the variability among units with the same fuel type within each Independent System Operator (ISO) region.

These simplified scenarios provide important bounding results: if power plants were to be operating far from their optimal operation limits, i.e., with low capacity factor and high emissions intensity, the overall CO2 emissions from natural gas and coal power plants in CAISO and ERCOT would be 12 and 26% higher than the observed emissions (depending on the year). Although the emissions intensity at low capacity factor operation is several factors higher than the baseline emissions intensity, plants are operated infrequently at very low capacity factors (<0.05). Hence, the 90th percentile of emissions intensity is lower than the extreme values observed in Fig. 1.

Marginal impacts of wind and solar on plant-level generation, emissions and emissions intensity

Now, we turn our attention to providing more systematic estimates on the effect of renewables on thermal power plant operations, using entity and time fixed-effects panel regression model with a logarithmic specification. This model describes the change in the dependent variable (generation, emissions, or emissions intensity) as a function of the generation from wind and solar, residual thermal demand, individual power-plant entity effects, time effects, and other effects from control variables. The logarithmic specification used is given by Eq. (1). The control variables include the total wind and solar generation and electricity demand from the ISO’s trading partners, as well as a measure of wind generation intermittency. Wind intermittency is defined as the intra-day variability in output and is calculated by taking the absolute value of the differences in hourly wind generation and summing them over the day. This captures short-term fluctuations in wind availability, which may influence the dispatch of thermal resources. Rather than aggregating renewable generation, we model wind and solar as separate independent variables to reflect their distinct temporal profiles and differing penetration levels in CAISO and ERCOT. Time fixed effects are included at the month and year level to account for temporal trends, while plant fixed effects control for time-invariant characteristics of each generating unit. These controls allow us to isolate the relationship between renewable generation and thermal plant operation across both systems. Under the logarithmic specification, the estimated coefficients can be interpreted as the percent change in the dependent variable—generation, emissions, or emissions intensity—associated with a 1% change in wind or solar generation.

In Table 2, we show the coefficients of the panel regression model for CAISO and ERCOT. In this way, we are able to quantify the percent change in emissions intensity, total emissions, and generation for thermal power plants attributable to a marginal increase in generation from solar and wind. Here, the term “marginal” implies an additional unit (or unit percent) increase in generation from renewables and its resulting impact. This, in turn, can be used to determine the expected versus actual emissions displacement from renewables.

From Table 2, an increase in wind and solar generation is associated with lower thermal generation and emissions. That said, if this displacement was 100% efficient (or 1:1), both generation and emissions would reduce by an equivalent amount, and thus should have identical coefficients in the fixed-effects model. In CAISO, the displacement from wind and solar is unequal. Our regression estimates indicate that a 1% increase in solar generation is associated with a 0.27% decrease in thermal generation and a 0.25% decrease in total emissions. By comparing the coefficients for solar generation with emissions and emissions intensity as the exogenous variables, we can compute the share of expected emissions displacement due to the logarithmic specification of the panel regression (see “Methods”). Based on these coefficients, the observed emissions reduction associated with solar generation represents 92.6% of the theoretically expected emissions displacement. Similarly, the observed reduction associated with wind generation represents 95.6% of the theoretically expected emissions displacement. In ERCOT, on the other hand, displacement from wind is an order of magnitude more pronounced than the displacement from solar, which may be attributable to the difference in the installed utility-scale capacity of the two resources in the ISO. Examining the relationship between wind generation and displacement, our analysis shows that a 1% increase in wind generation is associated with a 0.34% decrease in thermal generation and a 0.31% decrease in total emissions. Based on these coefficients, the observed emissions reduction associated with wind generation in ERCOT represents 91.1% of the theoretically expected emissions displacement.

While the expected vs actual emissions displacement helps us understand the system-level impact of renewables, it still does not associate the effect of renewables on plant-level emissions intensity. Looking closely at the coefficients of the model with emissions intensity as the dependent variable, we find that a 1% increased generation from wind and solar does indeed impact plant-level emissions intensity for existing thermal generators. For CAISO, thermal power plant intensities are more susceptible to increased generation from solar as compared to wind (0.02% for solar, 0.01% for wind). In ERCOT, generation from wind results in a 0.02% increase in the emissions intensity of plants. While these coefficients may initially appear small, the hourly ramp in solar generation in CAISO during the day can reach 50%, which corresponds to an estimated 1% increase in the emissions intensity of power plants for that hour, according to our model. If we consider CAISO’s 2022 system-level emissions averaged uniformly across all hours, a 1% increase in intensity across all power plants is equivalent to 53 tons of additional CO2. As the ramp becomes more pronounced with increasing intermittent renewable capacity, this marginal increase should not be ignored. Meeting 2030 and 2045 clean energy targets in both CAISO and ERCOT will require the installation of more installed renewable capacity, resulting in an even higher percent change in generation from renewables across all days of the year. Supplementary Figure 14 demonstrates the change in CO2 emissions intensity for a 0-100% increase in generation from solar and wind in CAISO and ERCOT.

Intermittency in generation from wind is measured by the daily wind ramp variable, represented by \({\overline{W}}_{t}\) in Eq. (1). In contrast to the coefficients for wind and solar generation, higher wind variability is associated with higher generation from thermal plants in both regions. The magnitude of the positive displacement from wind ramping relative to wind generation is also quite significant—52% for CAISO, and 35% for ERCOT. Clearly, wind and solar generation play a key role in determining the generation and emissions in thermal plants, however, variability and intermittency in the generation from renewables has a significant impact as well.

Individual plant response in CAISO and ERCOT is heterogeneous by fuel type and nameplate capacity

The panel regression formulation helps us understand how thermal plants across the fleet respond to changes in generation from wind and solar. Plant fixed-effects further control for heterogeneity across plant types and fuel inputs, however, this formulation does not yield any insights into how heterogeneous these plants are, and what the impact of increased generation from wind and solar results in on a per-plant basis. To further understand plant-specific response, we develop a fixed-effects ordinary least squares (OLS) regression formulation with the same specification as the panel regression above, except for every individual plant (no panel is considered) and using hourly instead of daily data points. The ramp variable in the formulation is determined as a difference in wind generation at the intra-hourly level. While the panel regression provided a single coefficient for a dependent variable in response to solar and wind, here, we consider a distribution of coefficients across all plants to model their response.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of coefficients for plant generation, emissions, and emissions intensity in response to solar in CAISO (Fig. 3a) and wind in ERCOT (Fig. 3b). A positive coefficient indicates a positive correlation between the dependent variable and renewable generation, and vice versa. We find that natural gas plants in CAISO show highly heterogeneous relationships with solar generation, and the associated change in generation, emissions, and emissions intensity. In contrast, all but two plants in ERCOT demonstrate lower generation and emissions with higher wind generation. However, the emissions intensity of all coal plants and most gas plants shows a positive correlation with marginal increases in wind generation.

The heterogeneous relationship between natural gas plants in CAISO compared to ERCOT may be related to shifting generation patterns accompanying increased utility-scale solar capacity. Fast-ramping peaker plants replace base load combined cycle plants during peak production hours. In CAISO, four out of seven plants with a coefficient greater than 1.0 account for 28% of generation and also exhibit the highest emissions intensity of all plants in the balancing region. In ERCOT, plant behavior is very different from that of CAISO. The mean coefficient for generation is −0.41, which is close to our fleet-level coefficient of −0.34 from the panel regression. Coal plants with a relatively smaller nameplate capacity are characterized by a higher emissions intensity, even though the capacity factor of these plants is comparable to that of larger plants. The two smallest coal plants in ERCOT show the largest deviation in response to wind (−2.25%, −2.07%) and also have a NOx emissions intensity 60% higher than the mean of all coal plants indicating more frequent ramping and startup.

Figure 4 shows the regression coefficients for plant generation, further characterized by nameplate capacity and capacity factor. Each data point represents a power plant. The x axis is annual capacity factor, and the y axis is the OLS coefficient in response to solar generation in CAISO and wind generation in ERCOT. The size of the data point indicates the nameplate capacity of the plant and the color indicates the annual emissions intensity. All plants are natural gas-fired in CAISO, and a mix of natural gas and coal in ERCOT. In CAISO, larger plants exhibit negative correlations with solar generation, although the magnitude of this correlation is smaller compared to plants with lower nameplate capacity. Smaller plants are also characterized by a significantly lower annual capacity factor, high emissions intensity, and a wider distribution in coefficient magnitude. In ERCOT, the markers in Fig. 4 show a mix of coal and natural gas-fired plants. All coal plants are characterized by a higher emissions intensity and operate at an annual capacity factor consistently greater than 0.3. The coefficients associated with wind generation show less variation for larger plants, with values not falling below −0.2. Similarly to CAISO, natural gas plants with a lower nameplate capacity show the highest emissions intensity and operate at lower annual capacity factors.

Supplementary Fig. 13 shows a comparison between the distrubution of coefficients obtained from the plant-level OLS with emissions displacement estimates from Katzenstein and Apt14 and Graf et al.32.

We perform our analysis for the years 2018 through 2023 for the CAISO and ERCOT. We start by describing the data used, followed by the methods.

Data

We develop a dataset with thermal power plants in CAISO and ERCOT that includes hourly unit-level emissions, gross generation, heat rate, and fuel consumption from the EPA’s Air Markets Program Data35. The EPA requires all combustion power plants with a nameplate capacity greater than 25 MW to install and maintain a CEMS that records key unit-level operational parameters36.

We obtain plant nameplate capacity, total annual generation, primary fuel information, and total annual emissions from the EPA’s Emissions and Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID)12. eGRID is a comprehensive source of data on the environmental characteristics of electric power plants and their associated unit stacks. Each data file contains key indicators at different levels of aggregation—unit, generator, plant, state, balancing area, NERC region and eGRID subregion. A manual inspection of the plant-level nameplate capacity indicates that the capacity indicated is not accurate in all cases, whereas the same is not true for aggregated generator-level information. Hence, instead of obtaining the plant nameplate capacity directly, we compute the sum of the generator nameplate capacity (in MW) of all generators associated with a particular plant, as identified by their unique Office of Regulatory Information Systems Plant Code. Hourly data from CEMS is collated with plant nameplate capacity to determine hourly capacity factor values and the associated fuel stack.

Hourly generation from wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal energy is obtained from US Energy Information Administration Form 930 (EIA-930) data. We use processed publicly available data obtained from a physics-informed data reconciliation framework for real-time electricity and emissions tracking developed by Chalendar and Benson28,37. Using this dataset, rather than raw EIA-930 data, has two key advantages. First, the reconciled data sets are devoid of unrealistic generation values and contain estimates within reasonable confidence intervals for time intervals where data is missing or erroneous. Second, this method includes an optimization-based data reconciliation to impose physical relations that guarantee energy conservation between key variables. Thus, this dataset provides electric system operating data on generation, consumption, and exchanges of electricity for every hour and at the level of the balancing area.

Model specification

We use a fixed-effects panel regression formulation to quantify the marginal effect of wind and solar generation on the generation, emissions, and emissions intensity of thermal plants. Similar to Bushnell and Wolfram38, Graf et al.32 and Fell and Johnson29, we use an entity and time fixed-effects logarithmic specification for all plants within an ISO using daily observations in Eq. (1).

$${\ln}\,{y}_{i,t}= {\alpha }_{i}+{\beta }_{1}{\ln}\,{D}_{t}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{2}{\ln}\,{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{3}{\ln}\,{W}_{t} \\ +{\beta }_{4}{\ln}\,{\overline{W}}_{t}+\gamma \,{\ln}\,{{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{t}+{\eta }_{t,m}+{\eta }_{t,y}+{\alpha }_{i}\times {\eta }_{t,m}+{\epsilon }_{i}$$

(1)

where yi,t is the dependent variable of interest, which is daily generation in MWh, emissions in tonnes or emissions intensity in tonnes/MWh for power plant i at timestep t. Dt, St and Wt represent the daily net thermal generation, generation from solar, and generation from wind in MWh for the ISO to which i belongs. The daily net thermal generation is the total ISO thermal generation minus generation from hydro and imports, i.e., \({D}_{t}^{{\prime} }={D}_{t}-{H}_{t}-{I}_{t}\), where Dt, Ht and It represent the daily thermal generation, generation from hydro and net imports in MWh for the ISO. \({\overline{W}}_{t}\) is a parameter that estimates the intermittency of net generation from wind at the hourly level and is calculated by taking the sum of the absolute value of hourly differences in wind output over the course of the day. Mathematically, this is expressed as \({\overline{W}}_{t}=\mathop{\sum }_{h=0}^{23}\left\vert {W}_{t \!,\!h \!+\! 1}-{W}_{t\!,\!h}\right\vert\). The intermittency parameter \({\overline{W}}_{t}\) captures the cumulative hourly fluctuations in wind generation throughout the day, rather than using a simpler measure like daily variance. This specification focuses on short-term variations between consecutive hours that may require rapid adjustments in thermal generation to maintain grid stability. While variance would measure overall daily deviations from mean wind generation, our intermittency measure specifically quantifies the magnitude of hour-to-hour changes that operators must balance. This is particularly relevant as frequent short-term fluctuations in wind generation may necessitate different operational responses from thermal plants compared to more gradual changes over the course of a day.

Xt is a set of control variables that includes the sum of wind generation, solar generation, and demand for trading partners of the ISO to which i belongs. For instance, CAISO trades with the other balancing authorities in the Northwest and Southwest NERC subregions. For every hour, these external control variables would consider the sum of wind generation, solar generation, and demand for these two regions. For ERCOT, the only trading partner is the Southwest Power Pool. ηt,m and ηt,y are the time fixed-effects parameters controlling for the month and year, respectively. We interact the monthly fixed-effects variable with the indicator variable for the plant ID to account for heterogeneity in fuel prices across different technology categories, regions and plant types. ϵ represents the error term.

The model specifications employed by Graf et al.32 and Fell and Johnson29 may not be able to fully explain the deviation caused due to intermittency in renewable generation due to gaps in granularity and panel formulation. Graf et al.32 do not include granular regional generation from trading partners, and also conduct the analysis on annual data and hence miss intra-day operational parameters such as resource ramping. Fell and Johnson29 do not construct a plant-level panel regression but rather run a time fixed-effects model for the balancing authority that does not account for location-based heterogeneity.

In our formulation, the parameters that are of interest are the coefficients for solar, β2 and wind, β3. These coefficients represent the percent change in the dependent variable per 1% increase in generation from solar and wind, respectively. For example, if the dependent variable yi,t represents the net generation from thermal plants for an ISO, then β2 and β3 will represent the percent change in generation for thermal plants per unit percent increase in generation from solar and wind. These coefficients thus measure the associated change in the dependent variable under the assumption that daily wind and solar production (represented by W and S) are uncorrelated with the error term ϵ after controlling for net demand, entity, and time fixed effects. As suggested by Qiu et al.39, this assumption is valid for wind at the hourly level and thus can be extrapolated to daily observations. Solar output is likely to be correlated with the error term and time fixed effects parameter when considering hourly data, which is why we aggregate hourly observations to daily intervals in the statistical model above. To test for correlation between thermal power plant generation and other exogenous variables, in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, we present the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, along with the Durbin–Watson test to check for autocorrelation in the panel regression model for each entity. We also present alternate specifications of the statistical model in Supplementary Note 1.

Displacement effectiveness

Modeling the response of individual plants outside a panel regression formulation helps us understand whether plants are individually load-following, solar-following, and wind-following, and the extent of their response. In contrast to the fixed effects ISO-level formulation considering daily time steps, the plant-level model uses hourly data and is given by Eq. (2).

where the variables are the same as those in the panel regression formulation above. In the plant-level OLS, \({\overline{W}}_{t}\) measures the deviation in wind generation from the previous hour.

To determine the share of emissions displaced due to renewables, we use the panel regression formulations where emissions and emissions intensity are the dependent variables, similar to Graf et al.32

$${\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2}{{{{\rm{EI}}}}}_{p,t}= {\alpha }_{i}+{\beta }_{1}{\ln}\,{D}_{t}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{2}{\ln}\,{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{3}{\ln}\,{W}_{t} \\ +{\beta }_{4}{\ln}\,{\overline{W}}_{t}+\gamma \,{\ln}\,{{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{t}+{\eta }_{t,m}+{\eta }_{t,y}+{\alpha }_{i}\times {\eta }_{t,m}+{\epsilon }_{i}$$

(3)

$${\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2,p,t}= {\alpha }_{i}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{1}^{{\prime} }{\ln}\,{D}_{t}^{{\prime} }+{\beta }_{2}^{\prime}\,{\ln}\,{S}_{t}+{\beta }_{3}^{{\prime} }{\ln}\,{W}_{t} \\ +{\beta }_{4}^{{\prime} }{\ln}\,{\overline{W}}_{t}+{\gamma }^{{\prime} }{\ln}\,{{{{\bf{X}}}}}_{t}+{\eta }_{t,m}^{{\prime} }+{\eta }_{t,y}^{{\prime} }+{\alpha }_{i}^{{\prime} }\times {\eta }_{t,m}^{{\prime} }+{\epsilon }_{i}^{{\prime} }$$

(4)

In Eq. (3), the marginal effect due to increased generation from solar can be represented by α2.

$${\alpha }_{2}=\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2}{{{{\rm{EI}}}}}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(5)

$${\alpha }_{2}=\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,\frac{{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2,p,t}}{{G}_{p,t}})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(6)

$${\alpha }_{2}=\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2,p,t}-{\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(7)

$${\alpha }_{2}=\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{CO}}}}}_{2,p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}-\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(8)

$${\alpha }_{2}={\alpha }_{2}^{{\prime} }-\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}$$

(9)

Rearranging, gives:

$$\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{solar}}}}}_{t})}={\alpha }_{2}-{\alpha }_{2}^{{\prime} }$$

(10)

Equation (10) represents the change in thermal generation if generation from solar replaces the generation from fossil-fueled plants on a 1:1 basis. Thus, the fraction of expected emissions reductions for solar is represented by:

$${{{\rm{Fraction}}}}\,{{{\rm{of}}}}\,{{{\rm{expected}}}}\,{{{\rm{emissions}}}}\,{{{\rm{reduction}}}}\,({{{\rm{solar}}}})=\frac{{\alpha }_{2}^{{\prime} }}{{\alpha }_{2}^{{\prime} }-{\alpha }_{2}}$$

(11)

Similarly, for wind, the expected emissions reductions and the corresponding fraction are given by:

$$\frac{\partial ({\ln}\,{G}_{p,t})}{\partial ({\ln}\,{{{{\rm{wind}}}}}_{t})}={\alpha }_{3}-{\alpha }_{3}^{{\prime} }$$

(12)

$${{{\rm{Fraction}}}}\,{{{\rm{of}}}}\,{{{\rm{expected}}}}\,{{{\rm{emissions}}}}\,{{{\rm{reduction}}}}\,({{{\rm{wind}}}})=\frac{{\alpha }_{3}^{{\prime} }}{{\alpha }_{3}^{{\prime} }-{\alpha }_{3}}$$

This article is part of the series—Jakarta Edit 2025

Background

The first Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) was launched at the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, with a US$8.5 billion financing agreement between South Africa and the International Partners Group (IPG), a group of donor countries. The goal was to accelerate South Africa’s transition away from coal through a mix of financial instruments and technical assistance.

Following South Africa’s lead, a second group of countries, this time in Southeast Asia, established similar agreements, including Indonesia and Vietnam. Indonesia’s JETP, announced in 2022, pledged US$20 billion over three to five years from public and private sources. IPG members, including the US, Germany, and the EU, along with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), committed to providing financing for Indonesia’s transition, aiming to peak power emissions at 290 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO₂e) by 2030, increase the share of renewable energy to 34 percent, and achieve net-zero in the power sector by 2050.

That same year, Vietnam signed a US$15.5 billion JETP agreement with similar actors. Half of the funds would come from IPG governments, and the other half from GFANZ. Vietnam’s goals are to reduce electricity-sector emissions from a projected 240 MtCO₂e in 2035 to 170 MtCO₂e by 2030, increase the share of renewable energy to 47 percent of electricity output, limit coal power capacity to 30.2 gigawatt (GW), and begin phasing out coal-fired power plants.

In 2023, a third set of countries began JETP negotiations. Senegal signed a US$2.5 billion JETP agreement. Though often hailed as innovative tools for mobilising climate finance, the JETPs are unlikely to deliver on the “just” in just energy transitions.

Recent Developments: Indonesia and Vietnam

In November 2023, Indonesia released its Comprehensive Investment and Policy Plan (CIPP), outlining investment priorities, policy reforms, and a just transition framework. Vietnam followed with its Resource Mobilisation Plan (RMP), detailing its goals and priority projects.

In line with its retreat from international cooperation and responsibility in March 2025, the Trump administration withdrew the US from the JETPs, relinquishing Washington’s co-leadership role in Indonesia’s partnership. In its place, Germany assumed leadership alongside Japan. The US had pledged US$3 billion, just a fraction of the total.

JETPs fail to address the historical inequalities underlying climate responsibility. Countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam have contributed a tiny fraction of cumulative global emissions, yet they are offered transition packages dominated by debt.

As of March 2025, Indonesia had received just US$1.1 billion of the promised funding. In Vietnam, three projects have secured funding, and a further four are under negotiation.

Falling Short on Justice

As a relatively new financial cooperation model, JETPs face several challenges. While it is undoubtedly true that countries, including Indonesia and Vietnam, require significant capital for climate mitigation and adaptation, JETPs will not be the route to a just transition.

First, JETPs fail to address the historical inequalities underlying climate responsibility. Countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam have contributed a tiny fraction of cumulative global emissions, yet they are offered transition packages dominated by debt. In Indonesia, 97 percent of JETP financing is comprised of loans, with only 3 percent provided as grants. Overall, just 60 percent of the financing is offered as concessional loans. In Vietnam, 96 percent of the funding is in the form of loans, with just 34 percent of the total being offered at concessional rates. This financial structure effectively shifts the burden of decarbonisation onto countries that bear limited responsibility for the climate crisis. Indonesia is responsible for an estimated 4 percent of all historical emissions, and currently accounts for less than 2 percent of the annual global total. In contrast, the United States, which is responsible for 20 percent of historical emissions, today emits 16 percent of the global total, despite comprising just four percent of the global population. From the standpoint of international climate justice and equitable financing, the JETPs in Indonesia and Vietnam are hardly pathways to a just transition. In order to be truly just, these financial instruments should mainly be comprised of grants, with a moderate reliance on concessional loans.

Second, a just transition will require significantly more capital. Currently, there are persistent gaps between the capital requirements of developing countries, the commitments made by high-income countries, and the actual disbursement of funds. The scale of finance committed through JETPs is drastically inadequate. Indonesia needs an estimated US$285 billion by 2030 to meet its conditional climate targets; JETP covers just 7 percent. Similarly, Vietnam needs US$368 billion by 2040 to achieve net-zero; JETP offers about 4 percent of that. Not only are the current commitments far short of what is required, but the actual disbursement has also been lacking. Concerns regarding climate justice extend beyond the composition of financial instruments and the scale of funding. Civil society organisations and communities affected by climate change have raised alarms about their limited participation in and the transparency of these agreements. A just transition requires input and involvement from the communities affected. While Indonesia’s JETP CIPP included a three-week public consultation period, the overall process has been criticised for a lack of engagement and transparency. Similarly, Vietnam has been criticised for not meeting commitments to conduct regular consultations.

A just transition will require significantly more capital. Currently, there are persistent gaps between the capital requirements of developing countries, the commitments made by high-income countries, and the actual disbursement of funds.

Moreover, the focus on centralised, large-scale energy infrastructure will likely displace local communities, harm ecosystems, and undermine equitable energy access. Distributed renewable energy systems, not megaprojects, offer a more straightforward path to inclusive energy access. However, the investment strategy in Indonesia, for instance, focuses solely on on-grid power. It only references the need for a study on community-based renewable energy systems, which are likely to prove critical to ensure energy justice in a country with over 17,000 islands.

Key Takeaways

Significant climate finance is urgently needed to support mitigation and adaptation efforts in countries like Indonesia and Vietnam. While JETPs present a new model for international cooperation, they fall short of enabling a truly just transition. Their heavy reliance on debt shifts responsibility away from historically high-emitting countries and onto those least responsible for the climate crisis. The overall scale of financing is inadequate, and disbursements have been limited, mirroring the broader failures of global climate finance. Meanwhile, the processes for identifying priorities and projects have excluded affected communities, with the lack of transparency and local participation undermining the principles of justice these partnerships claim to advance. Mobilising and deploying climate finance is essential, but the design of financial instruments, investment strategies, and implementation processes must align with the goals of a just transition.

The U.S. LNG sector is no longer a speculative bet—it is a cornerstone of global energy security.","The U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector is at a pivotal inflection point in 2025, driven by a confluence of geopolitical realignments, strategic trade agreements, and a historic surge in infrastructure expansion. As global demand for energy security intensifies and traditional suppliers face scrutiny, U.S. LNG producers are uniquely positioned to capitalize on a $750 billion EU-South Korea energy procurement pipeline, a 70 bcm/yr surge in global LNG capacity additions, and a favorable arbitrage environment. This article examines how these factors are creating a ""perfect storm"" for sustained outperformance in the sector, urging investors to act decisively before market dynamics shift.

Infrastructure Expansion: The Backbone of U.S. LNG's Global Dominance

The U.S. is undergoing its largest wave of LNG capacity additions in history, with nearly 295 bcm/yr of new export infrastructure coming online by 2030. Projects like Plaquemines LNG (Louisiana) and Corpus Christi Stage 3 (Texas) are emblematic of this transformation. The Plaquemines project alone, which reached full capacity by mid-2025, added 10 mtpa of export capability, while Corpus Christi's midscale trains are projected to contribute an additional 3 mtpa by late 2026.

These projects are not just incremental—they are reshaping global supply chains. For instance, the Haynesville and Permian basins, which supply 60% of U.S. LNG feedstock, are now 40% more cost-competitive than their Middle Eastern counterparts due to proximity to Gulf Coast terminals and lower production costs. This arbitrage advantage is amplified by the U.S.'s flexible ""destination-independent"" contract model, which allows buyers to redirect cargo, creating liquidity and pricing resilience.

Geopolitical Tailwinds: From Commodity to Strategic Asset

U.S. LNG is no longer just a commodity—it is a geopolitical tool. The EU's RePowerEU initiative and South Korea's $100 billion LNG procurement plan are explicitly designed to reduce reliance on adversarial suppliers like Russia and China. The EU has pledged $250 billion annually in U.S. energy imports from 2026 to 2028, while South Korea is diversifying its imports to counter Chinese influence.

This strategic pivot is creating a ""demand floor"" for U.S. LNG. Even if global demand for natural gas peaks by 2030, the EU's methane monitoring and verification (MRV) framework—set to enforce maximum methane intensity limits by 2030—will further entrench U.S. producers in climate-conscious markets. The Inflation Reduction Act's methane fee and abatement measures, though still lagging behind Australia and Norway, are closing the gap and could unlock a premium for U.S. LNG in the long term.

Financial Metrics: A Sector in Motion

The financial health of leading U.S. LNG producers underscores the sector's long-term viability. Cheniere Energy, for example, reported $1.9 billion in Q1 2025 Adjusted EBITDA and reaffirmed full-year guidance of $6.5–$7.0 billion. Its Corpus Christi Stage 3 project is now 82.5% complete, with first production expected by mid-2025. Similarly, Sempra Energy (SRE) is investing $1.241 billion in Q1 2025 CAPEX, with its Port Arthur LNG Phase 1 and Energía Costa Azul Phase 1 projects on track for 2026 commercialization.

These companies are also prioritizing shareholder returns. Cheniere allocated $1.3 billion in Q1 2025 to growth, debt reduction, and share repurchases, while Sempra's adjusted EPS guidance of $4.30–$4.70 for 2025 reflects confidence in its infrastructure pipeline.

Risks and Mitigants: Navigating a Complex Landscape

While the outlook is bullish, investors must remain vigilant. The EU's MRV framework could penalize U.S. LNG if methane intensity improvements fall short. Additionally, overcapacity risks loom as Qatar and Australia expand their export capabilities. However, the U.S. is countering these challenges through:

- Strategic Partnerships: The EU-South Korea agreements lock in long-term demand.

- Operational Efficiency: Shale gas producers are consolidating to reduce costs and enhance resilience.

- Infrastructure Diversification: Projects like the Permian Basin Reliability Plan (costing $35 billion) ensure supply chain robustness.

Investment Implications: Capitalizing on the Inflection Point

The U.S. LNG sector is at a crossroads. For investors, the key is to balance optimism with prudence. Companies with strong project pipelines (e.g., Cheniere's Stage 3, Sempra's Costa Azul) and proactive methane abatement strategies are best positioned to outperform. The sector's 28% revenue growth in Q1 2025 and projected 7–9% long-term EPS CAGR through 2029 suggest a compelling risk-reward profile.

Actionable Advice:

1. Prioritize Infrastructure Leaders: Cheniere and Sempra offer a blend of near-term project execution and long-term strategic alignment with global energy transitions.

2. Monitor Methane Metrics: Track progress on the Inflation Reduction Act's abatement goals and EU MRV benchmarks.

3. Diversify Exposure: Consider midstream players (e.g., Oncor Electric) and upstream shale producers (e.g., Encana) to hedge against commodity price volatility.

The U.S. LNG sector is no longer a speculative bet—it is a cornerstone of global energy security. As 2025 unfolds, the window to invest in this inflection point is narrowing.

A number of major corporations, including PepsiCo, Amazon, Netflix, Meta, and Mastercard, are leading the charge on a shift in carbon credits. How are they doing this? By teaming up with Kinetic Coalition, a global alliance of major corporations seeking to make change by unlocking clean energy investment in emerging economies.

Rather than utilizing technology offsets or tree-planting, as is the norm, these corporations are backing an early retirement for power plants run on coal. According to Carbon Credits, this is a significant step in alleviating damage to the climate and local environments.

These companies are using transition credits, rather than traditional carbon credits, meaning they're paying the owners of coal plants to retire them early, Carbon Credits reported. Typically, companies are offsetting damage already done by paying for every metric ton of carbon produced, but this method allows for the avoidance of future damage while also making way for cleaner energy.

Not only do transition credits ensure that there are no future emissions from these coal plants — which would otherwise cause the planet to heat even more — but this method can also support workers leaving closed coal plants and help create new jobs in clean energy, benefiting both communities and the environment.

Best of all, estimates suggest that if transition credits become the norm, hundreds of billions of dollars could be allocated toward clean energy. In fact, Carbon Credits reported that the Kinetic Coalition may be able to provide between $72 billion and $207 billion by 2035, all on its own.

As the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions President Nat Keohane explained to Carbon Credits, ""Energy transition credits can accelerate the transition to clean energy systems for emerging economies, help companies reduce their supply chain emissions – and, most importantly, bring economic, health, and environmental gains to local communities. They offer an opportunity to achieve emission reductions at scale while benefiting companies and people – and Kinetic is excited to seize it.""

While we can't predict the future of transition credits, the fact that these major corporations are utilizing them now is a significant step toward the continued transition from dirty energy to clean energy and could mark a substantial boost for the economies of cities and towns where these coal plants reside.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/transition-creditsimage-recqcVs5c5GVkwE2g.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:00:59.172348

What's at stake Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables.
Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.
However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.","President Donald Trump's plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the United States could speed up a building boom that already was expected to strain the nation's ability to power it.

The White House released its AI Action Plan on July 23, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others pour billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Environmental concerns

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are increasingly severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Big Tech moves

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most power plants in the U.S. still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

Tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables. Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

In recent days, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world's largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means ""relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,"" Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear, power generation.

What's ahead

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for.

""In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,"" said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

""They're planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that's projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/news8000.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/94/3949508c-3e2e-5fa6-8b0a-8c01dbadc9fb/688a2963bf078.preview.jpg?crop=1919%2C1007%2C0%2C35&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-08-03 04:59:45.771195

The country's 2025 strategy, marked by deliberate interventions in critical sectors, is not just about survival but about positioning for long-term growth. For investors, this represents a rare confluence of policy-driven stability and innovation-led opportunity.

The Automotive Sector: Tariffs as a Catalyst for Domestic Innovation

The U.S. administration's 25% tariffs on Canadian automobiles and parts in 2025 initially seemed like a seismic threat. Yet, the Canadian government turned this challenge into a strategic pivot. By imposing retaliatory tariffs on U.S. vehicles and introducing a quota-based relief framework for automakers that maintain production in Canada, the government has created a buffer against trade shocks. This framework, which includes support for General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis, ensures that domestic manufacturers remain competitive while incentivizing capital reinvestment.

The proposed modernized Auto Pact—reminiscent of the 1965 Canada-U.S. agreement—adds another layer of foresight. By linking import rights to domestic production, it aims to preserve North American supply chains while deterring trade diversion. For investors, this signals a sector where policy acts as a stabilizer, reducing exposure to cross-border risks. The automotive industry's pivot toward electrification and digital integration (with government-backed incentives for battery and software R&D) further amplifies its appeal.

AI: A Sovereign Compute Strategy to Outpace the Global Race

Canada's AI Compute Access Fund—a $300 million initiative under the $2 billion Sovereign AI Compute Strategy—is a masterstroke in the race for artificial intelligence dominance. By democratizing access to high-performance computing for SMEs, the government is fostering a generation of innovators who might otherwise be starved of resources. The fund's focus on sectors like life sciences, energy, and advanced manufacturing aligns with Canada's comparative strengths, ensuring that AI development is not just theoretical but applied.

The government's emphasis on “sovereign compute” infrastructure—building domestic data centers and a new AI supercomputing system—addresses a critical vulnerability: overreliance on foreign cloud providers. This move not only enhances data security but also creates a scalable ecosystem for AI startups. For investors, the AI sector in Canada is no longer just about tech giants. It's about a pipeline of SMEs and academia-driven projects that could yield high-growth equities.

Clean Energy: Decarbonizing the Grid as a Growth Engine

Canada's Clean Electricity Regulations (CER), finalized in late 2024, are the cornerstone of its net-zero ambitions. By setting annual emissions limits for fossil fuel-based power plants and offering compliance flexibility through offset credits, the government is balancing environmental goals with grid reliability. The $60 billion in federal funding for clean infrastructure—ranging from Indigenous-led solar projects to battery storage initiatives—signals a decade-long commitment to decarbonization.

The economic ripple effects are profound. Electrification is projected to slash household energy bills and create 600,000 jobs by 2050. For investors, the clean energy sector offers a dual opportunity: infrastructure plays (wind, solar, grid modernization) and technology plays (battery storage, smart grid software). The Oneida Energy Storage Project, a joint venture between Northland Power and Indigenous partners, exemplifies how policy and capital can align to deliver both ESG and financial returns.

The Investment Thesis: Policy-Driven Resilience as a Risk Mitigator

Canada's 2025 interventions are not just sector-specific—they are part of a broader narrative of economic sovereignty. By shielding industries from external shocks (via retaliatory tariffs and trade agreements), empowering innovation (via compute and R&D funding), and future-proofing energy systems (via decarbonization), the government is creating a risk-averse environment for capital.

For investors, this translates to three key opportunities:

1. Automotive and Advanced Manufacturing: Bet on companies benefiting from the Auto Pact and electrification incentives.

2. AI and Compute Infrastructure: Target SMEs and data center operators supported by the Sovereign AI Compute Strategy.

3. Clean Energy and Grid Modernization: Prioritize firms involved in renewable infrastructure and energy storage.

Conclusion: Resilience as a Strategic Asset

Canada's approach to economic resilience is neither reactive nor timid. It is a calculated, multi-sector strategy that leverages policy to amplify private-sector potential. For investors, the lesson is clear: in a world of uncertainty, the most compelling opportunities often lie where government and innovation converge.

What pressures are threatening the power grid?

Extreme weather, including high temperatures and thunderstorms, resulted in power outages across the country, and it highlighted a growing problem.

The North American Electric Reliability Corp. said that power grids in the Midwest, New England, Texas, and Southern California would be unable to operate in ""above-normal conditions,"" Al Jazeera reported.

There's also the matter of artificial intelligence. According to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, creating one AI-generated image uses the energy equivalent of fully charging a smartphone. The increased use of AI has led to energy demands that the grid is struggling to meet.

Why does the state of the power grid matter?

Power systems are outdated and cannot adapt to such dramatic changes.

For example, a 2021 Texas cold snap led to 4.5 million people losing power and more than 200 deaths, many of which were attributed to hypothermia, per the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

The cold also affected gas lines and other equipment. A typically warm state, Texas lacked the infrastructure to respond to such weather.

As the planet continues to warm and extreme weather events become more prevalent, power outages are expected to rise, leading to price spikes and leaving people vulnerable to the elements. It's crucial to assess and address the grid's weak points before it's too late.

""The power grid is one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure,"" Kyri Baker, an associate professor in the University of Colorado Boulder's Department of Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering, told CU Boulder Today. ""Keeping that system safe, secure, and reliable is not only convenient but also life-saving.""

How renewable energy can help save the grid

Incorporating renewable energy into the grid won't be a simple feat, but its meteoric rise shows that people are ready for it. In fact, in 2024, renewable energy accounted for over 30% of the world's electricity.

One way to make this transition smoother is to utilize battery storage systems, which store excess energy from solar power, among other clean forms of energy. On days when sunlight is scarce, the stored energy is released. According to the United Nations, this can be cheaper and more reliable than electricity in certain locations.

Bottom line: If overreliance on dirty fuels is harming people, then finding alternative forms of energy to strengthen the grid is a must.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/power-gridimage-recwgvVMXRQ6cy3Ac-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 23:59:54.648905

Since the president has returned to office, his goons have ordered the following: 

• Announced it would lay off all of the health research scientists at the EPA, laying off investigators who try to understand how toxic pollution affects the human body

• Seek to repeal its recognition of climate change as a threat to human health, potentially limiting the government’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases. 

• Relaxed existing standards for mercury and lead pollution—two toxins that can lead to developmental problems in children. 

• Postponed its implementation of new Biden-era regulations that were supposed to reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals Americans are exposed to

Meanwhile, House Republicans are attempting to grant widespread liability relief to pesticide companies and restrict EPA regulation of PFAS “forever chemicals” through provisions that have been tucked into the spending bills currently moving through Congress. (Democrats, for their part, have offered opposing legislation that would protect an individual’s right to sue over any harm from pesticides.)

This collective assault upon America’s environmental regulations targets not just the environment, but human health as well. Which means it sits oddly with the work of another Trump official whose office at the Department of Health and Human Services is just a 15-minute walk from EPA headquarters: Robert F. Kennedy Jr, whose Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement seeks to, obviously, make Americans healthier.

But Kennedy hasn’t spoken up about these contradictions—and his supporters are beginning to notice.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Resilience Subaru's July 2025 sales demonstrate a company in transition.","In a market increasingly defined by electric vehicle (EV) transitions and shifting consumer preferences, Subaru of America's July 2025 sales performance offers a compelling case study. The company reported 54,035 vehicles sold in July 2025, a 4.5% increase compared to the same period in 2024. While this growth rate appears modest, the underlying trends—particularly in the premium SUV segment—reveal a strategic alignment with evolving industry dynamics. For investors, the question is whether Subaru's current trajectory positions it as a long-term winner in a segment poised for disruption.

July 2025 Sales: Resilience in a Fragmented Market

Subaru's July 2025 sales highlight a mix of resilience and vulnerability. The Crosstrek, its top-selling model, achieved a record 17,628 units sold—a 15.1% year-over-year increase—cementing its dominance in the compact SUV category. The Forester and Outback also delivered strong performances, with 11,886 and 14,982 units sold, respectively, driven by their reputation for durability and family-friendly utility. Most notably, the Solterra, Subaru's first all-electric SUV, reached its best monthly sales ever with 1,562 units, a 23.9% increase. These figures underscore Subaru's ability to maintain relevance in a segment where EV adoption is accelerating.

However, challenges persist. The Ascent (down 28.7%), BRZ (down 18.1%), and WRX (down 66.6%) struggled to attract buyers, reflecting a broader industry trend of declining interest in performance-oriented and larger SUVs. These declines signal a need for innovation in product differentiation, particularly as competitors like Tesla and Rivian gain traction.

Contextualizing the EV Transition

The premium SUV segment is undergoing a seismic shift. In 2025, EVs accounted for over 7.5% of U.S. new vehicle sales, with automakers like Ford, GM, and Tesla expanding their high-end offerings. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has further accelerated this shift by incentivizing EV purchases through tax credits, though eligibility criteria tied to local manufacturing complicate the landscape.

Subaru's Solterra stands out in this context. Unlike most EVs, the Solterra features Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive, a hallmark of Subaru's engineering, and 8.3 inches of ground clearance—critical for buyers seeking off-road capability in an electric vehicle. This differentiation is a strategic coup in a segment where EVs have traditionally lacked ruggedness. The 2025 Solterra's price reductions (down $6,500 for the base model) and the introduction of the Touring Onyx Edition (priced at $45,495) also signal a commitment to affordability and premium positioning.

Product Development: Aligning with Consumer Preferences

Subaru's 2025–2026 product roadmap further strengthens its investment case. The 2026 Outback, reimagined as a midsized SUV, will emphasize ruggedness with a taller profile, plastic body cladding, and a Wilderness trim featuring 9.5 inches of ground clearance. This redesign caters to the growing demand for adventure-ready vehicles, a trend amplified by the rise of outdoor lifestyles.

Additionally, the introduction of a hybrid Forester (leveraging Toyota's hybrid technology) underscores Subaru's pivot toward fuel efficiency. With an estimated 35 mpg in the city, the hybrid version addresses cost-conscious buyers hesitant to adopt full EVs. These moves reflect a balanced approach: embracing electrification while retaining the practicality and reliability that define Subaru's brand.

Risk and Reward: A Long-Term Investment Perspective

For investors, Subaru's long-term potential hinges on its ability to navigate three key challenges:

1. EV Competition: Tesla's price cuts and Rivian's focus on premium SUVs pose risks. However, Subaru's AWD differentiation and affordability pricing mitigate this threat.

2. Inventory and Supply Chains: The industry's ongoing supply chain issues could delay production of the 2026 Outback and hybrid Forester. Subaru's reliance on a 640-dealer network, however, provides a buffer against such disruptions.

3. Brand Perception: Subaru's reputation for reliability (96% of its 10-year-old vehicles remain on the road) is a major asset. The company's community initiatives, such as Subaru Loves Learning, further reinforce brand loyalty.

Conclusion: A Strategic Bet on Resilience

Subaru's July 2025 sales demonstrate a company in transition. While its EV and hybrid offerings are still nascent compared to Tesla's dominance, the Solterra's unique capabilities and the 2026 Outback's rugged repositioning position Subaru to capture a niche but growing segment of the premium SUV market. For investors, the key is to balance optimism with caution: Subaru's long-term potential is promising, but its success will depend on sustained innovation and the ability to scale its EV and hybrid lineups.

In a market where EV transitions and shifting consumer preferences are the norm, Subaru's blend of heritage, practicality, and incremental innovation makes it a compelling, if not yet dominant, player. Those willing to bet on a company that prioritizes reliability and adaptability may find Subaru's stock a strategic addition to their portfolio.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 05:59:41.413467

Investors who navigate the tension between energy security and decarbonization—by balancing LNG, green hydrogen, and RNG—will be well-positioned for the long-term.","The global energy landscape in 2025 is defined by a tectonic shift in natural gas supply chains, driven by geopolitical tensions and the collapse of traditional pipeline routes. The end of Russian gas transit through Ukraine in January 2025, the operational constraints of Nord Stream 1 and 2, and the EU's March 2025 ban on Russian LNG transshipments have forced a rapid reallocation of energy infrastructure and investment priorities. These disruptions are not merely short-term volatility—they represent a fundamental restructuring of global energy markets, with profound implications for investors.

The Pipeline Collapse and Its Aftermath

The closure of Ukraine's transit corridor—the primary route for Russian gas to Europe—has reduced Russian exports to the continent by nearly 50% year-on-year. The TurkStream pipeline, now the sole functioning conduit, has seen a 4.7% increase in flows post-maintenance, but its capacity remains a fraction of what Europe once relied upon. This vacuum has triggered a surge in LNG demand, with the U.S. emerging as a dominant supplier. However, the long-term risks of overreliance on LNG—volatile pricing, infrastructure bottlenecks, and the carbon footprint of liquefaction—loom large.

For investors, the key question is: How do we balance the urgency of securing energy security with the need to decarbonize? The answer lies in a dual strategy: short-term infrastructure adaptation and long-term investment in alternative gas sources.

The Rise of Alternative Gas Sources

Natural gas is no longer a monolith. The post-pipeline era has accelerated the rise of alternatives, from green hydrogen to biogas, each with distinct investment profiles.

Green Hydrogen: The High-Potential Gamble

Green hydrogen, produced via electrolysis powered by renewable energy, is gaining traction as a clean alternative to fossil fuels. The U.S. has pledged $570 billion in hydrogen projects through 2030, though only $39 billion has reached final investment decision (FID). The “green premium”—the higher cost of green hydrogen compared to grey hydrogen—remains a barrier. At €3–8/kg versus €1–2/kg for grey hydrogen, the economic viability of green hydrogen hinges on subsidies and demand creation.

Government support is critical. The Inflation Reduction Act's Section 45V Credit (up to $3/kg) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act's $8 billion for hydrogen hubs are game-changers. California's ARCHES project, for example, aims to produce hydrogen from renewables while cutting emissions by 2 million metric tons annually. However, delays in regulatory clarity and the absence of demand-side incentives (e.g., mandates for industrial use) risk stalling progress.

Biogas and Renewable Natural Gas (RNG): The Near-Term Fix

Biogas, derived from organic waste, offers a transitional solution. Upgraded to RNG, it can be injected into existing gas infrastructure, reducing reliance on imports. The U.S. is leveraging tax credits and state-level renewable portfolio standards to scale RNG production, but feedstock limitations and processing costs remain challenges.

LNG: The Unstable Bridge

While LNG has filled the void left by Russian pipelines, its role is precarious. The U.S. has expanded export capacity, but infrastructure bottlenecks—such as the Permian Basin's 90% pipeline utilization—threaten to undermine supply stability. The Matterhorn Express Pipeline's October 2024 launch (2.5 Bcf/d capacity) is a step forward, but investors must weigh the risks of stranded assets as demand shifts toward cleaner alternatives.

Infrastructure Rebalancing: Risks and Opportunities

The energy transition is reshaping infrastructure investment. The Infrastructure Quarterly: Q2 2025 reports that renewable energy accounted for one-third of total infrastructure deal volume, with battery storage projected to make up 29% of new power generation capacity in 2025. Data centers, driven by AI demand, are another hotspot, with supply in primary markets expanding 34% year-over-year.

Yet, the path is fraught with challenges. The U.S. aims to produce $100 billion in domestic batteries by 2030, but manufacturers face a 30%–40% gap in meeting domestic demand due to supply chain constraints. Similarly, greenfield hydrogen projects often stall without offtake agreements, as seen with Dirostahl's abandoned green hydrogen plans and Iberdrola's delayed expansions.

Strategic Investment Advice

For investors, the post-pipeline disruption era demands a nuanced approach:

Diversify Across Gas Alternatives: Allocate capital to a mix of green hydrogen, RNG, and LNG infrastructure. Prioritize projects with government-backed offtake agreements (e.g., California's ARCHES) and tax incentives.

Leverage Data and Digital Infrastructure: The energy transition is inseparable from AI-driven demand. Target data centers and battery storage projects in regions with abundant renewables.

Hedge Against Geopolitical Shocks: Invest in midstream infrastructure (e.g., Permian Basin pipelines) while hedging against regulatory shifts via ESG-aligned portfolios.

Monitor Policy Signals: The Inflation Reduction Act's 45V Credit and the EU's hydrogen strategy will shape market dynamics. Stay agile to pivot as subsidies evolve.

Conclusion: The New Energy Equation

The collapse of traditional gas pipelines has exposed the fragility of global energy systems but also unlocked new opportunities. Investors who navigate the tension between energy security and decarbonization—by balancing LNG, green hydrogen, and RNG—will be well-positioned for the long-term. The next decade will be defined not by the fuel itself, but by the infrastructure and policies that enable its transformation.

According to the head of the agency charged with protecting the nation’s environment, it appears to be the latter. So, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin exulted last week in a proposal to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases are endangering public health and welfare.

The EPA’s “Endangerment Finding” strengthened the agency’s hand to establish under the Clean Air Act climate regulations for motor vehicles, power plants and other sources of pollution. Repealing it, Zeldin rejoiced, “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.”

“There are people,” he said, “who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country. They created this endangerment finding, and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence, in many cases, a lot of segments of our economy. And it cost Americans a lot of money.”

Let’s first acknowledge that American car companies, airplane manufacturers and airlines, power companies and more seem nowhere near the point of going out of business. Then, let’s remember that, in any case, it’s not Zeldin’s job to worry about them. It is, or ought to be, his job to ensure that the best science is used to identify environmental hazards to public health and promote guidelines to eliminate or control them.

Instead, antithetically to his agency’s mission, he proposed rollback or repeal of 31 environmental rules — including the 2009 finding — for managing clean air, clean water and climate change.

For Chicagoans, Zeldin’s announcement preceded experiences with almost karmic undertones.

Using data from the PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Washington Post reported this week that 18 Eastern and Midwestern states, Illinois among them, endured the highest July humidity on record, contributing in some cases to heat indexes as high as 128 degrees in Missouri. In another eight states, July humidity this year was the second or third highest they had ever felt.

And, for a while on Thursday, an international monitoring company found the Chicago area wheezing through the worst air quality in the world, a distinction the region has held before.

“The air quality is officially dangerous in Chicago,” said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health programs at the Chicago-based Respiratory Health Association.

Granted, the distinction was temporary and exacerbated by wildfires raging in Canada. But the situation, the wildfires and the humidity records all reflect conditions scientists have long predicted would become more commonplace as climate change intensifies across the planet.

So, it is more than a little discouraging to hear the person chiefly responsible for protecting us from “officially dangerous” circumstances cheering the removal of potential safeguards.

Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said as much in response to Zeldin’s announcement.

“As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat. It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare,” she complained.

If America is indeed on the path to bankruptcy, economic repercussions from environmental regulations could not be ruled out as a factor, of course. But neither could such repercussions from military spending, tax cuts, aid to schools or any other expense. Using that arguable connection to a questionable conclusion in order to justify making our nation and our world less livable is something to condemn, not celebrate.

Fortunately, Zeldin’s proposal must go through a lengthy process of review and public hearings. Let’s hope that somewhere during this period, individuals with more interest in the conditions under which we and our children and grandchildren live will emerge to protect the nation’s environmental policy from the people currently overseeing it.",https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=2b4451cb-9e11-5048-b09b-59eccc974435&function=fit&type=preview,N,,2025-08-03 00:59:26.159965

India is becoming a major hub for climate investments. Clean energy demand and zero-emission technologies are rising. Over $2 bn in climate-focused capital has been invested in the past year. Major investors are making strategic investments in India's energy and clean tech sectors.

Mumbai: India is rapidly emerging as a key destination for climate capital, driven by rising demand for clean electric alternatives and a growing push from heavy industries towards zero-emission technologies.

The country has attracted more than $2 billion in climate-focused capital over the past year alone, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) data.

Over the past 8-12 months, major climate investors such as TPG Rise Climate, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, LeapFrog Investments, Lowercarbon Capital, and Fullerton Fund Management have moved beyond cautious pilot projects to make strategic bets in India’s energy and clean tech sectors.

This influx of climate funding is fuelled not only by environmental urgency, but also by a confluence of favourable factors: cost parity with traditional energy sources, inflection in consumer demand and supportive policy frameworks. India’s clean energy demand is increasingly being powered by essential services — including logistics, cooling and distributed power — rather than discretionary consumption.

Long-term scalability

This shift provides investors with confidence in both long-term scalability and durable margins, say industry experts.

“There’s been a marked uptick in growth and infrastructure capital doubling down on platform plays across circularity, e-mobility, OEMs, battery lifecycle management and energy storage,” said Nakul Zaveri, partner and co-head of Climate Investment Strategy at LeapFrog Investments, which plans to commit over $500 million to climate solutions.

A key part of this strategy includes a $60 million investment by the European Investment Bank (EIB), with additional backing from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Temasek.

Globally, climate finance surpassed $2 trillion in 2024, with a significant portion of private capital flowing into electric mobility, battery storage and green infrastructure.

Singapore-based Fullerton Fund Management recently made its first investment under the Fullerton Carbon Action Fund, acquiring an equity stake in Routematic, an AI-driven corporate transport company in India.

“Climate finance in India is poised for a surge, increasingly driven by market economics,” reckons Akhil Jain, investment lead at Fullerton Carbon Action Fund. “Clean energy and key segments of electric transport are now at or beyond cost parity with conventional options.”

This shift is reshaping investment patterns. Funds are increasingly focused on companies with strong revenue models and proprietary technology. “There’s surging demand for low-emission, resource-efficient technologies, especially in sectors like transport and energy,” said Shailesh Vickram Singh, founder of Climate Angels, which has backed 22 startups in the EV, clean air and climate tech space over the past two to three years.

Rather than backing isolated innovations, investors are now prioritising integrated operators who can build full value chains and deliver resilient, scalable infrastructure solutions. “What was once seen as high-risk is now attracting a premium, especially for operators executing climate strategies at scale,” said Zaveri.

This evolution also reflects a broader recognition of the importance of embedding adaptation into climate solutions. “Capital is now flowing towards companies that reduce emissions and also build resilience—across sectors like waste, cooling and mobility,” noted Vasudha Madhavan, founder & CEO of Ostara Advisors, an investment bank focused on electric mobility.

Industry leaders see this as an inflection point.

Over the next 2-3 years, climate finance in India is expected to deepen its focus on scalable technologies with the potential to transform high-emission sectors. “This is a pivotal moment,” Madhavan added. “Climate finance is shifting from small, fragmented bets to strategic, high-value investments that can accelerate the clean transition at scale.”

State utility regulators are fast-tracking plans for projects that will bring more renewable energy because they need to get the projects started before Inflation Reduction Act incentives disappear under a new federal law.

Using renewable energy results in cost savings and reduces pollution that contributes to the warming of the planet.

Some of the state's clean-energy developments were put on hold because of the pandemic, so utility regulators are hoping to make progress toward their mandated target of utilizing 100% clean energy by 2040, according to Canary Media.

A bill passed by the Maine Legislature in 2023 requires the state to install renewable energy projects on PFAS-contaminated land. PFAS are a group of highly toxic chemicals that are found in many everyday products such as clothing, nonstick cookware, and food packaging. Since the contaminated land has been deemed unsuitable for agriculture, Maine is giving preferential treatment to renewable energy developments that can make use of the land, per Canary Media.

Francesca Gundrum, director of advocacy for Maine Audubon, believes that using the land this way is positive news for renewable energy, wildlife, and farmers who cannot use the land as they originally intended.

""This work to help deploy solar and other renewable technologies is exactly the kind of siting we need to see more of in Maine,"" she stated, per Canary Media. ""Whatever we can do to minimize the turnover of habitat is something we're going to be supportive of.""

These projects to bring low-cost, clean energy to Maine have bipartisan support from legislators.

Maine's commitment to ramp up renewable energy usage has already saved residents money, and studies show that reaching 100% clean energy by 2040 would save the average Maine household about $1,300 per year.

""This is an opportunity to get some things done that Maine had every intention of getting done a handful of years ago,"" said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, a nonprofit industry group, per Canary Media. ​""It's good news.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Maine-renewable-energyimage-recrSDjcfHTqjZMTr-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 22:59:06.128756

Diversification across electrolyzers (e.g., Bloom Energy), hydrogen infrastructure (e.g., Linde), and renewables (e.g., NextEra Energy) can mitigate sector-specific risks.
Short-term risks—geopolitical shocks, regulatory uncertainty, and economic slowdowns—will continue to test investor patience.","The energy sector in 2025 is a theater of paradoxes. On one hand, it grapples with acute volatility driven by geopolitical tensions, macroeconomic fragility, and regulatory uncertainty. On the other, it harbors robust long-term growth potential, particularly in renewable energy and hydrogen technologies. For investors, the challenge lies in discerning which headwinds are temporary and which tailwinds are structural.

Short-Term Risks: A Fragile Equilibrium

The immediate risks to energy equities are stark. The global economy, now growing at 2.3% according to the IMF, is a fragile backdrop for capital-intensive energy projects. Elevated real yields—spurred by central banks' inflation-fighting policies—have tightened credit conditions, raising the cost of financing for both fossil fuel and clean energy ventures. Meanwhile, geopolitical conflicts, from U.S.-China trade disputes to the Israel-Iran standoff, have triggered sharp price swings in crude oil and natural gas.

Consider West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude: it dipped below $60 per barrel in May 2025 but rebounded sharply after the June 13 Israel-Iran clash. Such volatility underscores the sector's exposure to geopolitical shocks. Natural gas markets, meanwhile, face near-term softness due to oversupplied storage, though futures suggest a potential winter rebound. These short-term corrections are compounded by regulatory shifts, such as the U.S. enforcement of a 10% universal tariff and elevated “reciprocal” tariffs on 57 countries, which are reshaping supply chains and increasing corporate capital expenditure (CapEx) costs.

Long-Term Opportunities: The Energy Transition's Inevitability

While the near-term outlook is clouded, the long-term trajectory of the energy sector is clear: decarbonization is accelerating, and hydrogen and renewables are central to this transition. The cleantech, artificial intelligence (AI), and carbon industries are driving demand for 24/7 clean energy, with projected needs exceeding 57 gigawatts by 2030. Renewables, with their low costs and technological maturity, are poised to dominate this demand.

Green hydrogen, in particular, is emerging as a linchpin of the energy transition. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has allocated $7 billion to develop hydrogen hubs, with five of seven projects securing phase 1 funding. Federal incentives, such as the $3/kg green hydrogen tax credits, remain pending final guidance, but the sector's momentum is undeniable. Companies like Plug Power (PLUG) and Bloom Energy (BE) are leading the charge. Plug Power, for instance, raised $280 million in equity and secured a $525 million credit facility in early 2025, while Bloom Energy's solid oxide electrolyzers offer 15–45% higher efficiency than competitors.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) further amplifies these opportunities. By allocating $27 billion to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and supporting state-level green banks, the IRA is creating a robust pipeline for renewables and hydrogen. For example, the Solar for All initiative and Empowering Rural America program are projected to drive 36 gigawatts of renewables and storage by 2030. These programs are not just policy abstractions; they are translating into real projects, such as green hydrogen from Superfund site wastewater providing 16 hours of solar power storage.

Strategic Positioning for Investors

The key for investors lies in balancing exposure to short-term volatility with long-term structural trends. While fossil fuel equities may face near-term headwinds from policy shifts and geopolitical risks, the renewable and hydrogen sectors offer compelling upside.

Prioritize Resilient Sub-Sectors: The commercial solar segment, despite a 28% quarter-over-quarter decline in Q1 2025, outperformed peers due to California's NEM 2.0 rollout. Similarly, green hydrogen and long-duration energy storage (LDES) are gaining traction as solutions for 24/7 clean energy.

Leverage Policy Tailwinds: The IRA and permitting reforms are critical catalysts. Investors should favor companies with strong IRA-aligned projects, such as Air Products (APD) and Linde (LIN), which are scaling blue hydrogen and carbon capture infrastructure.

Diversify Across Technologies: While solar remains dominant, hydrogen's role as a LDES solution is expanding. Diversification across electrolyzers (e.g., Bloom Energy), hydrogen infrastructure (e.g., Linde), and renewables (e.g., NextEra Energy) can mitigate sector-specific risks.

The Road Ahead

The energy sector in 2025 is a mosaic of turbulence and transformation. Short-term risks—geopolitical shocks, regulatory uncertainty, and economic slowdowns—will continue to test investor patience. Yet, the long-term story is one of resilience: renewables are scaling, hydrogen is maturing, and policy frameworks are aligning with decarbonization goals.

For those with a multi-decade horizon, the current volatility may present an opportunity to acquire undervalued equities in the energy transition. However, caution is warranted. As the adage goes, “The trend is your friend, but it is a poor guide.” Investors must navigate the present chaos with both discipline and vision, recognizing that the energy sector's future lies not in resisting change but in embracing it.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 12:04:46.513913

Our world has been run by coal for the longest time; the impact on the environment has been overlooked, even though its effect has been cataclysmic. Our scientists have found a breakthrough for humanity. An alternative that could also offer the benefits of coal power, but without the environmental hazards that come with it.

The most challenging part of the new discovery

The bottleneck in searching for alternatives to coal power lies in the drilling through our planet’s geosphere. 20 km is not a regular distance, especially when it comes to drilling. On the path to discovering sustainable, reliable geothermal sources of energy, sophisticated equipment and machinery have to be present to make it a success. Humanity didn’t fail in this regard, making the advancement seamless and easy.

A conventional geothermal well’s maximum depth is 5 km. Reaching for something extra requires a professional level of resilience and patience. This new discovery is called “hot rock” by most scientists.

Unveiling of coal’s alternative

This name “superock” might seem alien to a lot of enthusiasts, but this is the frontier of advanced energy alternation. Its system behaves inertly and carries far more energy than normal steam. With proper research and implementation, this “superrock” can generate up to ten times the power of regular geothermal sources as we know it.

Another advantage this new alternative possesses, just like the new advancements that are being made in the energy sector, is efficiency, reliability, and maximum automation in the entire energy generation process.

The great restructuring: transforming our coal plants into cleaner energy generators

The financial burden that would be imminent for an entire overhaul of our current coal energy generating systems would be quite enormous, which is why a simpler alternative, which is repurposing our current infrastructure, is the best bet going forward for energy generation.

We could take advantage of some of the existing infrastructure, like powerful high-capacity turbines, transmission lines, cooling systems, and grid access.

The shift from black to ordinary steam

Humanity is prepared for the immense relief this initiative is going to have on our environment. The idea is quite simple: utilize geothermal systems while generating energy from the earth’s core, phasing out the activity of burning coal at super high temperatures to produce dangerous levels of greenhouse gases in our ozone layer.

If this simple but effective plan can be carried out carefully, our coal plants can be transformed into clean energy systems capable of operating in a symbiotic relationship with our environment

A new era or a colossal myth for energy generation?

Many giant nations of the world are pouring a chunk of their resources into developing this technology at scale. The benefits for humanity and our environment are just too immense for researchers to pass up. The emerging leader of the silent geothermal race will control the technology in the future.

If scaled globally, this technology could dramatically reduce carbon emissions, stabilize energy prices, and provide sustainable jobs for former coal regions. It could also help nations meet their climate targets without sacrificing energy reliability.

However, the road ahead isn’t without obstacles. Deep drilling is expensive and energy-intensive. Risks like induced seismicity and equipment failure at extreme depths must be managed. Most importantly, governments must create supportive policy frameworks and invest in early-stage projects to push this innovation forward.

The new beginning is upon humanity. After several years of iterating and testing, we have once again, as a species, unlocked a cleaner and more efficient way of generating energy. All of this was made possible by tapping into our planet’s core reserves after all these years. The question is no longer “When is humanity going to detect an alternative means of generating energy?” It is now a matter of mass adoption.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/depositphotos_507234760-stock-photo-aerial-view-volcanic-eruption-night-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:01:17.916750

Minnesotans are already seeing higher prices on electronics, groceries and a host of other product categories due to the Trump administration's sweeping import tariffs. Industry experts say electricity prices could follow.

""We believe that this is going to raise costs for all electricity consumers,"" said Michael Allen, co-founder and CEO of St. Paul-based All Energy Solar, which installs solar, battery and EV charging systems for residential and commercial customers.

On April 2, President Donald Trump announced tariffs on goods imported from nearly every country, including manufacturing powerhouses China, Vietnam and Mexico, with exemptions for hundreds of raw materials, manufacturing inputs and finished goods.

About a week later, following a stock market crash and blowback from the international business community, he dialed back duties on most countries to 10% while preserving the option to increase them again in 90 days and boosting tariffs above 100% on a range of goods produced in China.

Trump's broad tariffs added to preexisting duties on key materials and finished products used across the energy sector. In February, for example, Trump set a 25% levy on imported steel and aluminum in an executive order that name-checked Minnesota's iron ore industry. A similar tariff on copper -- a critical input for electrical equipment -- could follow soon. And U.S. tariffs on imported solar cells and lithium-ion batteries date back as far as the Obama administration.

""This is not the first road show we've seen come to town,"" Allen said. What's different about this go-round, he said, is the deep uncertainty of an on-again, off-again tariff framework where levies seem to change by the day.

""I have no idea what's going to happen, and no one else does either. We're all in limbo right now,"" Allen said, adding that pricing throughout the supply chain is much more volatile than usual.

It's not just local executives like Allen warning about a possible increase in energy costs -- and business uncertainty -- induced by the administration's unpredictable trade policy. So are energy supply chain experts.

""[T]he tariffs could lead to significant cost increases in the power industry supply chain. Uncertainty over tariff liabilities in complex supply chains, and over possible future changes in tariff rates, can also be a deterrent to investment,"" wrote Ed Crooks, vice chair of Americas for global consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which focuses on the energy industry, in an April 8 note that called the U.S. power industry ""one of the sectors that is most exposed to tariff impacts.""

The average final tariff on electrical equipment is now 38%, Crooks said. And suppliers face similar rates on other key power inputs, like the glass used in solar panels and steel used in piping.

Solar panel installers and other energy equipment buyers in Minnesota and across the United States are actively seeking U.S.-made alternatives to imported products, said Martin Pochtaruk, CEO of solar equipment manufacturer Heliene. Canada-based Heliene has two solar module factories in Minnesota and is considering opening a third production facility here.

Although suppliers don't have to pay tariffs on the products they make in the U.S., higher demand is combining with still-limited U.S. supplies to push prices higher across the board, Pochtaruk said.

""The price is going up whether the product is imported or local, due to the higher demand for local,"" he said.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission sets rates charged by public electric and natural gas utilities like Xcel Energy and CenterPoint Energy. A utility can ask for permission to raise rates in a process known as a rate case, which the PUC says involves ""a comprehensive review of [its] investments and expenses"" to determine whether the proposed increase is ""necessary and reasonable.""

As a rate case proceeds, the utility can bill customers at a higher interim rate, subject to a refund of the difference if the case resolves at a rate lower than requested.

Minnesota law allows utilities to charge rates to recover costs needed ""to provide adequate, efficient, and reasonable service to ratepayers, including an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return"" on investment, the PUC says.

Utility rates apply not only to residential consumers but also to commercial and industrial consumers that may consume many times more power than a typical household. So if U.S. trade policy chills investment in energy-intensive industries, such as data centers, utilities may have fewer new customers to support planned or already-underway investments in new and existing infrastructure, said Brian Ross, vice president of renewable energy at the Great Plains Institute, a Minneapolis nonprofit focused on decarbonizing power, industry and transportation.

In an April earnings call, an executive with California utility PG&E said the company could actually reduce customer rates amid an influx of data center proposals, making explicit the connection between data center development and residential customers' bills.

Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and a lesser-known Colorado developer have announced plans to build massive data centers in the Twin Cities' exurbs, each expected to eventually consume enough power for tens or hundreds of thousands of homes.

That said, utility planning is a slow process, so Minnesota customers won't see immediate bill impacts due to data center demand or lack thereof, Ross said.

Tariffs could also raise prices -- and the risk of shortages -- by worsening preexisting supply constraints for transformers, gas turbines and other critical electrical equipment, Ross said. The average wait time for a new transformer increased from about one year in 2021 to more than two years in 2024, and orders for some larger transformers now take as long as four years to fill, Wood Mackenzie said last year.

Higher equipment prices and longer lead times will make it more difficult and expensive to build new power generation to serve growing demand for electricity from transportation, buildings and the new industrial facilities the Trump administration wants to attract to the U.S., All Energy Solar's Allen said. If you're a homeowner or business who believes energy will become more expensive amid future scarcity, it could make sense to lock in relatively low costs -- and reduce reliance on the electric grid -- by installing solar panels and perhaps batteries for onsite energy storage now, before the tariff impacts fully hit, he added.

""Our customers who already have solar are telling us, ""Whew, I'm really glad I made this decision,"""" Allen said.

With the administration unlikely to rethink its protectionist stance anytime soon, businesses across the energy supply chain may try to locate more production in the United States, especially if Congress preserves the clean energy manufacturing tax credits enacted during the Biden administration, Pochtaruk said.

But for more complicated factories, that could take years. Pochtaruk contrasted the eight-to-nine-month build time for a new solar module plant like the ones Heliene runs in Rogers and Mountain Iron with the roughly two-year development window for a new solar cell factory, which he said involves a ""wet chemical process"" in a super-clean manufacturing environment.

In December, Heliene paused plans to build what would be one of the United States' only solar cell plants, citing uncertainty around federal tax credits for clean energy manufacturing. The company has done a significant amount of early work on the project and could get the new facility up and running 18 months after deciding to move forward, Pochtaruk said.

Heliene is weighing two possible locations for the cell factory, one in North Carolina and the other in the Twin Cities metro. Heliene today employs about 340 people in Mountain Iron and about 220 in Rogers, he said.

Even for seemingly basic components like solar cells, tariffs play havoc with complex global supply chains. Though solar cell manufacturing involves a mix of imported and U.S.-made inputs, most are more expensive now in part because even domestic inputs may themselves require imported precursors, Pochtaruk said.

Likewise, All Energy Solar sources solar panel racks, power inverters and other types of equipment from U.S. manufacturers, but the complexities of global supply chains for energy equipment mean it's unlikely that the local industry will ever be able to source everything it needs within the United States, let alone Minnesota, Allen said. Even if trade barriers persist, it may cost less to make some low-margin inputs in lower-cost southeast Asian countries that already make them cheaply, he said.

While Minnesota's energy industry faces the same tariff-related uncertainty as other states for the moment, the state could protect itself in the longer run by leaning into emerging energy sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, produced from crops and other biomass, Ross said.

Minnesota lawmakers and business boosters seem to agree. A SAF producers' and buyers' consortium convened by the GREATER MSP Partnership in 2023 now includes heavyweights like Delta Air Lines and Airbus, and state lawmakers authorized a $1.50-per-gallon tax credit for Minnesota-made sustainable jet fuel last year. A few months later, DG Fuels announced plans to produce more than 190 million gallons of SAF annually in Moorhead by 2030.

However, one of the significant hurdles for widespread EV adoption is range anxiety, primarily driven by the time-consuming charging processes of traditional lithium-ion batteries. Recent breakthroughs in lithium-sulfur battery technology offer a promising solution, potentially revolutionizing the EV industry. These advancements could lead to faster charging times and longer vehicle ranges, paving the way for a more sustainable future.

Revolutionizing Battery Technology with Lithium-Sulfur

Lithium-sulfur batteries (LSBs) represent a significant leap forward in energy storage technology. Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, LSBs utilize a sulfur cathode and a metallic lithium anode, promising a theoretical capacity up to ten times greater. This innovation comes with the potential to extend the range of electric vehicles significantly, thereby addressing the prevalent issue of range anxiety among consumers.

One of the standout features of LSBs is their ability to charge much faster than existing technologies. According to an international study led by researchers from Germany, India, and Taiwan, these batteries could potentially achieve full charges in as little as 12 minutes. This capability would not only enhance the convenience of owning an electric vehicle but also make EVs more appealing to a broader range of consumers.

Despite the promise of LSBs, their development faces several technical challenges. Sulfur’s poor conductivity requires innovative solutions to enhance performance, including mixing it with carbon-based materials to facilitate electron transport. Additionally, overcoming the shuttle effect, where lithium polysulfides migrate between electrodes, is crucial for maintaining battery stability over time.

Addressing Technical Challenges in Battery Design

The path to commercializing lithium-sulfur batteries is fraught with technical obstacles that researchers are keen to overcome. A significant challenge lies in preventing dendrite formation on the lithium metal anode, which can lead to short circuits and pose safety risks. To address this issue, researchers are experimenting with protective coatings and engineered lithium structures designed to inhibit dendrite growth.

Advancements in cathode design are also underway to enhance the performance of LSBs. By incorporating advanced carbon-based materials such as graphene, researchers aim to improve the transport of electrons and ions, which is critical for efficient battery operation. The use of catalytic materials, including metal oxides, is being explored to accelerate sulfur conversion reactions and mitigate the effects of the shuttle phenomenon.

Furthermore, innovations in battery components, such as improved separators and highly concentrated electrolytes, are essential for rapid ion exchange and polysulfide containment. These developments are integral to increasing the energy density and lifespan of lithium-sulfur batteries, bringing them closer to practical application in electric vehicles.

Harnessing Artificial Intelligence in Battery Development

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool in the optimization of battery materials, significantly accelerating the development of lithium-sulfur technology. By leveraging AI, researchers can predict the most effective combinations of materials that balance energy density, stability, and charging speed. This approach has already yielded prototypes demonstrating promising energy densities at practical charging rates.

Dr. Mozaffar Abdollahifar, a lead researcher in the field, highlights the importance of AI in advancing battery technology. “Our analysis indicates that charging times under 30 minutes, and in some cases under 15 minutes, are realistic,” he notes. This optimism is backed by a collaborative research effort involving institutions from Germany, India, and Taiwan, supported by several international funding bodies.

The integration of AI in battery development not only expedites the research process but also enhances the precision of material selection, leading to more reliable and efficient batteries. As AI continues to evolve, its role in energy storage solutions is likely to expand, driving further innovations in the field.

With the capability to charge rapidly and provide extended driving ranges, these batteries could significantly boost the adoption of EVs. This shift would not only contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also lessen the world’s reliance on fossil fuels.

As researchers continue to refine lithium-sulfur battery technology, the vision of a fully electrified transportation system becomes increasingly tangible. The advancements in battery technology could lead to a future where electric vehicles are the norm, supported by infrastructure that accommodates quick and efficient charging.

The future of electric mobility is bright, with lithium-sulfur batteries at the forefront of this transformation. Will these technological advancements be the catalyst that finally propels us into a sustainable, electrified future?

On a visit to Lossiemouth on the North Sea coast in Moray, the Chancellor described oil and gas as “incredibly important for the UK and our energy security”.

Her appearance in Scotland followed a five-day visit from the US president, who called on the UK Government to “incentivise the drillers, fast”.

Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social: “North Sea oil is a treasure chest for the United Kingdom.

“The taxes are so high, however, that it makes no sense.”

‘Unlock’

Asked whether she would “unlock” the “treasure chest”, Ms Reeves told the PA news agency: “Oil and gas are incredibly important for the UK and our energy security.

“And oil and gas is going to play an important role in our energy mix for decades to come.

“It’s why, alongside the private sector, we’re investing in carbon capture and storage, which is absolutely essential for supporting energy intensive industries.

“But it’s not either-or.

“At the same time, we’re investing in clean homegrown energy, including at Berwick Bank in Scotland, which will create thousands of new jobs and power millions of homes.

“And that’s what we need to do to make sure that our economy has this energy security that we need, that we bring down bills and bring more good jobs to Scotland.”

Berwick Bank in the North Sea has this week received a green light from the Scottish Government.

The proposed wind farm, off the coast of East Lothian, could add more than 4.1 gigawatts of capacity, which according to developer SSE Renewables is enough electricity to power more than six million homes annually.

‘Windmills’

But Mr Trump criticised existing wind farms during his visit, when he said: “When we go to Aberdeen, you’ll see some of the ugliest windmills you’ve ever seen, the height of a 50-storey building.”

Gesturing with his hands, he added: “You can take 1,000 times more energy out of a hole in the ground this big.”

Conservative shadow Scottish secretary Andrew Bowie has written to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, calling for a review of policies affecting the oil and gas industry.

“As President Trump has said, the UK’s ‘very high’ tax on oil and gas companies is a deterrent to investment,” he wrote.

“The extension of the energy profits levy (EPL), coupled with uncertainty around future licensing and investment signals, has created a climate of instability that threatens jobs, innovation and the region’s economic resilience.

“President Donald Trump’s remarks during your visit – calling Aberdeen the ‘oil capital of Europe’ and urging the UK to ‘bring it back’ – reflect a sentiment shared by many in the region.

“May I urge you to consider the president’s call to ‘incentivise’ domestic production of hydrocarbons?

“Oil and gas still have a vital role to play in our energy mix and economic future; British people would rather see the UK benefit from domestic exploration and drilling than import more from Norway and Qatar.”

Game-Changing Solid-State Technology

Uniquely, the groundbreaking electrolyte technology combines high ion concentrations in solids with interfacial contact properties found in liquids. Researchers say this combination addresses ionic conductivity, interfacial stability, and manufacturing efficiency, three hurdles that traditionally afflict solid-state batteries.

As a result, the new electrolyte delivers crucial advantages, including high conductivity, enhanced safety, fast charging, reliable low-temperature operation, and elimination of pressurized modules.

According to the scientists, the electrolyte system boasts a world-record ionic conductivity. SGS, a third-party testing firm, verified that the room-temperature ion conductivity reaches 57 mS/cm. Researchers say this figure is about five to six times higher than conventional numbers.

The “superior” conductivity produces fast-charging capabilities, boosting energy-dense batteries from 5% to 60-80% charge in about 4-6 minutes. Potentially, this technology could enhance electric vehicles and heavy electric transportation.

Furthermore, the technology withstands extremely cold environments. Even at -20°C, the system retains more conductivity than lithium-ion batteries, reportedly delivering 90-95% discharge efficiency for automotive purposes. Researchers say it “eliminates range anxiety for EV users in cold climates.”

The EU trade deal with the U.S. and the EU's reliance on China-made solar PV panels, wafers, and critical battery metals are likely to keep shaping the pace of energy transition in the European Union, which remains firmly committed to decarbonizing economies and becoming a carbon-neutral bloc by 2050.

The new geopolitical realities in an increasingly protectionist world make the EU’s energy transition more dependent on trade and tariff policies by the U.S. and China.

In the goal to ditch all Russian energy by 2027, the EU is now more dependent on the United States than ever, while the target to accelerate renewable energy installations hinges on Chinese export policies for solar panel components and critical and rare earth elements.

“Balancing energy security and political realities will determine the pace and success of the EU's energy policies in the coming years,” Reuters energy columnist Ron Bousso points out.

The reality under U.S. President Donald Trump is that Europe pledged to buy a total of $750 billion of American energy in three years, or about $250 billion per year. This would be more than tripling the $76 billion worth of American energy imports into the EU in 2024.

A large part of the planned increase is expected to come from additional purchases of LNG from the United States.

“Purchases of US energy products will diversify our sources of supply and contribute to Europe's energy security,” the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said last week, commenting on the trade deal with the U.S., under which the American tariffs on most EU goods would be at 15%, half compared to the initially proposed 30%.

“We will replace Russian gas and oil with significant purchases of US LNG, oil and nuclear fuels.”

So far, so good.

But Europe is set to boost its reliance on U.S. LNG and pay higher prices for it, as soaring U.S. exports would drive U.S. benchmark prices higher, while competition for LNG supply with Asia will intensify.

Significantly higher EU purchases will need a significant increase in U.S. export capacity.

Even if all other planned or announced projects were approved today, they won’t make it on time for a significant rise in LNG exports to drastically boost EU imports within three years.

U.S. LNG exports are booming, but they won’t be anywhere close to helping the EU triple its imports of American energy, per the trade deal.

Europe, however, will become even more dependent on U.S. LNG.

Related: Trump Administration Expands Rare Earth Price Support Policy

The U.S. is already the EU’s top supplier of LNG, with 55% of LNG supply to the bloc from the U.S. so far in 2025, according to estimates by the European Commission.

The US is also the EU's top oil supplier (17% of all EU imports in 2024), and a key supplier of nuclear fuel and fuel services.

The Commission insists that the EU-U.S. trade deal “does not undermine EU’s determination to decarbonise” as a jump in LNG imports over the next three years “is fully compatible with our medium- and long-term policy to diversify our energy sources and to implement the REPowerEU Roadmap so that we fully phase out Russian energy imports as soon as possible.”

The pillar of the REPowerEU plan and net-zero goals is the acceleration of solar and wind energy capacity installations.

And here comes the Chinese dominance in solar power panels and other equipment. In 2023, China was the EU’s largest supplier of solar panels, accounting for a whopping 98% of all imports, per the latest Eurostat data.

Cheap Chinese panels are helping with the solar capacity rollout, but they have put many European solar manufacturers out of business.

China’s stronghold in critical minerals and rare earths is also a serious concern for Europe’s automotive and renewable energy sectors. Stephane Sejourne, European Commissioner for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy, has even called for the creation of a strategic EU rare earths reserve.

The goal was to help the wind and solar industry. They also dropped a surprise tax on parts from China. Lawmakers say this change will bring stability. It will keep investors and developers confident.

Overview

Subsidy Delay: Pushes back the end date of clean energy tax breaks.

Tax Removal: Scraps the excise tax on equipment from China.

Investor Boost: Offers more time for projects to start and finish.

Market Impact: Keeps supply chains moving and prices steady.

Delaying Subsidy Phase-Out

The original plan cut wind and solar credits in stages. It set strict deadlines. The amendment softens that pace. Now, developers get extra years of support. This gives them room to secure loans and sign contracts. It means fewer delays on big farms and panels. In turn, jobs stay steady and growth stays strong.

Project Type Original End Date New End Date Wind Dec 31, 2026 Dec 31, 2028 Solar Dec 31, 2025 Dec 31, 2027

Removing the China Excise Tax

The initial draft added a 10% excise tax on solar panels and turbines from China. It aimed to protect U.S. factories. But it would have raised costs for every project. Many developers warned it could slow new builds. So Republicans chose to drop that tax. They said the market should decide which parts to buy. This helps keep prices low and projects on track.

The Surprise Tax Mystery

No one claimed they wrote the excise tax rule. Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) said he first heard of it at lunch. “Leadership had not heard about it,” he noted. Other senators were just as shocked. The rule appeared in a late June draft. Then it vanished days later. This sudden move left many asking how and why it got there.

Political Reactions and Finger-Pointing

The tax caused a real stir. Renewable energy groups called it a “kill shot.” Senators raced to remove it. They blamed each other and outside voices. Here are some key theories:

A fossil fuel advocate pushed it to curb clean energy.

A China critic wanted to punish low-cost imports.

White House aides sought leverage in trade talks.

Yet none of these claims stuck. Groups like the Solar Energy Manufacturers for America said they did not write it. Fossil fuel backers denied it too. The real source remains unknown.

Behind the Scenes: Committee Staff

Staff on the Senate Finance Committee met for over a year. They worked with the Joint Committee on Taxation and legal counsel. They wanted a way to help U.S. factories. But with a tight July 4 deadline, they did not explain every change. That rush let the excise tax sneak in. Then, sensing the uproar, leaders yanked it out.

Industry Impact and Next Steps

These moves will affect many players. Developers will adjust timelines and budgets. Investors will recalculate returns and risks. Suppliers here and abroad will watch orders closely. Next, the Senate will debate the amendment. If it passes, the House must agree. Then projects can move forward with clear rules and stable costs.

Key Takeaways

Extended Support: Wind and solar get more time on tax credits.

Open Supply Chains: No extra tax on foreign parts keeps costs steady.

Staff-Driven Change: Committee aides shaped policy under time pressure.

Unknown Origin: The excise tax idea still has no clear author.

Future Votes: Both chambers must pass the amendment to lock it in.

Conclusion

By slowing subsidy cuts and dropping the China tax, Senate Republicans aim to keep clean energy on track. They want to balance growth, jobs, and budgets. Still, the mystery of who wrote that excise tax lingers. In Washington, the answers may come slowly. But for now, the wind and sun get a brighter path forward.",https://microgridmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_2543144643-1-scaled-e1747125118244.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 20:00:11.762318

The waivers were also the basis for California’s nation-leading plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and transition to electric vehicles.
According to the EPA, that $1-trillion savings would come from rescinding vehicle regulations built upon the endangerment finding.
With California’s rules repealed, “you end up with fewer EVs, more gasoline cars, more demand for gas and higher gas prices,” he said.
But major U.S. automakers such as GM and Ford have already committed to an electric future — as have international competitors such as China, which is investing heavily in electric vehicles.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s recent proposal to repeal its own 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health marks a major U-turn for the nation’s climate progress. While it’s impact will be felt nationwide, the plan takes direct aim at California.

In supporting documents released in the wake of Tuesday’s proposal, the nation’s top environmental agency outlined the justifications for its plan to rescind the so-called endangerment finding and roll back its longstanding regulations for planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from all motor vehicles, including cars and trucks.

“As a result of these proposed changes, engine and vehicle manufacturers would no longer have any future obligations for the measurement, control, and reporting of (greenhouse gas) emissions for any highway engine and vehicle,” the agency wrote in its rule summary.

But the documents, including an 80-page notice of proposed rulemaking and 60-page draft regulatory impact analysis, also contain several nods to California policies, referencing the state by name 27 times — by far more than any other state.

That’s largely because for more than 50 years, California has been granted unique authority from the EPA to set stricter tailpipe emissions than those mandated by the federal government.

This authority, obtained through waivers issued by the EPA, has been critical to the state’s efforts to address its notorious smog and air quality issues, which are driven partly by transportation emissions and by California’s unique topography that traps pollutants in its interior basins. The waivers were also the basis for California’s nation-leading plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and transition to electric vehicles.

The EPA’s documents repeatedly state that California’s waivers have officially been repealed. As of publication, however, the Trump administration’s unprecedented effort to do so in June is still winding its way through the court system following a lawsuit from the state.

Notably, the EPA’s own analysis of the possible outcomes of its proposal indicate that without California’s leadership — and without the tax credits created under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — national adoption of electric vehicles will decline. At the same time, gasoline prices will increase because of the higher demand from more gas-powered vehicles on the road.

“They don’t seem to have put together that strong of a case,” said Chris Busch, director of transportation and a senior economist with Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, who reviewed the analysis. “What this shows is that the net impact is less favorable when you reduce the California (Advanced Clean Trucks rule), when you take away the California waivers and remove the IRA credits.”

In a statement this week, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said repealing the endangerment finding would have economic benefits for the American people. “If finalized, rescinding the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations would end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families,” Zeldin said.

According to the EPA, that $1-trillion savings would come from rescinding vehicle regulations built upon the endangerment finding. That includes the Biden administration’s electric vehicles sales target, which the agency refers to as an “EV mandate.”

The EPA also said removing the endangerment finding would save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of greenhouse gas standards.

Busch said he could not readily see how the agency arrived at that figure based on the analysis provided. With California’s rules repealed, “you end up with fewer EVs, more gasoline cars, more demand for gas and higher gas prices,” he said.

The EPA also argues that electric vehicles are sucking up energy that could be better used elsewhere — “from factories to data-center servers to air-conditioning.” It uses California as an example of this perceived misappropriation of electricity, pointing to a 2022 memo from the California Independent System operator that urged people to reduce energy use, including EV charging, during a record-breaking heat wave.

The EPA’s announcement stunned many members of the environmental community who condemned it as a dangerous abdication of the agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment. Among the agency’s many claims are that no technology currently exists to reduce greenhouse gases enough to measurably affect global climate change concerns without risking greater harm to public health and welfare, such as increased vehicle prices.

But major U.S. automakers such as GM and Ford have already committed to an electric future — as have international competitors such as China, which is investing heavily in electric vehicles. According to the California Energy Commission, about 22% of new vehicles sales in the state in the second quarter of this year were zero-emission vehicles.

“Despite Trump’s full-on attack, Californians are choosing the clean simplicity of ZEVs,” read a statement from CEC Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “Make no mistake: California is not backing down from its ZEV goals. We will continue to heavily invest in accessible and reliable ZEV infrastructure, making the ZEV driving experience better each day.”

Busch said California has several tools at its disposal to defend itself and preserve its clean vehicle progress.

In the heavy-duty space, the California Air Resources Board already has the Clean Truck Partnership— an agreement with nearly all truck manufacturers in the state to meet advanced emissions reduction targets. The state’s heavy vehicle incentive program also provides funding opportunities for fleet owners to replace older heavy-duty diesel vehicles with zero-emission ones.

There are also legislative possibilities, such as Assembly Bill 914, which would give CARB more authority to regulate indirect sources of pollution such as warehouses. One way those warehouses could meet those rules would be by increasing their electric truck fleets, Busch said.

CARB also employs a clean-mile standard for transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft, which will see them gradually increase their zero-emission miles, and a similar tactic could be employed for the freight sector, he said.

“States have a lot of options still,” Busch said. “There is a lot of momentum.”

In a statement this week, CARB chair Liane Randolph described the EPA’s proposals as “the latest moves from this feckless federal government that choose polluter fantasyland over proven science.”

“Meanwhile, back on Earth, the planet continues to suffer from the consequences of unchecked carbon pollution as heatwaves, floods and wildfires threaten increasingly uninsurable communities everywhere,” Randolph said. “Unlike this negligent administration, California won’t turn our backs on what is happening right before our eyes. We choose reality, science and innovation — and we know we are not the only ones.”",https://thumb.spokesman.com/MSaJlqNVKYqSsEniCVkl54uXSXY=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/08/02/682f7d2a80e3a.hires.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 20:59:04.889242

Successfully repealing the endangerment finding is a gamble for Trump, but Americans — including everyone in Hampton Roads — will pay the price if he’s successful.","The Trump administration stuck its head firmly in the sand this week about the scientific reality of climate change, dragging every American face-first into the dirt with them. Negating the federal government’s legal basis for regulating greenhouse emissions, as the White House said it would seek to do, is to ignore the reality plainly evident in every corner of this nation.

The United States recorded 27 billion-dollar natural disasters last year and the thread that connects them is a climate destabilized by the byproducts of fossil fuel consumption. Addressing climate change is a fight for the very existence of coastal communities such as Hampton Roads. President Donald Trump would have us wage it with both hands tied behind our back.

In 2007, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v Environmental Protection Agency concluded the EPA had a legal requirement under the Clean Air Act to address greenhouse emissions since they, as air pollutants, harm public health. Two years later, the agency issued what is known as its “endangerment finding,” which allowed the EPA to impose regulations on “motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet,” according to the Associated Press.

The regulatory framework has been a constant target by industry groups and anti-climate activists, who have filed more than 100 lawsuits in a futile effort to overturn it. The Supreme Court declined to review its 2007 ruling when given the opportunity in 2023, and legal experts speaking to The New York Times earlier this year cast doubt on efforts to overturn the EPA’s finding.

That hasn’t stopped the Trump White House from trying. This week, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans to withdraw the finding, akin to pulling out the agency’s teeth. He crowed on a podcast that “repealing (the endangerment finding) will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America” and lamented it “cost Americans a lot of money.”

As Zeldin spoke Tuesday about the decision on Fox News, a small graphic in the corner of the screen noted that some 161 million Americans, or nearly half the country, were at risk that day due to extreme heat. Zeldin made his announcement only weeks after an unprecedented rainstorm caused flash flooding in Texas that killed at least 138 people, and months after wildfires in Los Angeles killed 30 people. Those fires inflicted damage that could reach $250 billion, if Zeldin is worried about things that cost Americans a lot of money.

In fact, the proliferation of extreme weather events is our reality now, and it’s one that Hampton Roads residents know all too well.

We see coastal flooding becoming more frequent, more invasive and more destructive with each passing year, even on sunny days. We watch the tropics during hurricane season, and cannot help but notice the storms’ rapid intensification in recent years. We know that sea levels are rising and understand the danger they pose to the region’s future.

None of that means squat to the president and his administration of climate change deniers. Trump has claimed this is all a Chinese hoax rather than a scientific reality and, in his first term, withdrew the United States from the Paris Climate Accord. But that pales in comparison to the all-out assault on climate regulations — and the overwhelming evidence and data that underpins them — he’s undertaken upon returning to the White House.

Since taking office in January, Trump has radically and recklessly downsized the EPA; made cuts to other agencies working on climate issues, including the National Weather Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association and NASA; and canceled the National Climate Assessment (which is mandated by Congress).

All of these hamstring efforts to curb greenhouse emissions and guard against a future of extreme weather that will cause more death and destruction to our communities.

For investors seeking exposure to North America's evolving energy landscape, Enbridge offers a rare combination of stability, growth potential, and strategic foresight.","In an energy landscape marked by volatility, shifting regulatory priorities, and surging demand for both fossil fuels and renewables, Enbridge (ENB) stands out as a masterclass in strategic infrastructure development. With North America's energy systems at a crossroads—balancing decarbonization goals with the realities of a still-oil-dependent economy—the Canadian energy giant is uniquely positioned to capitalize on its dual expertise in traditional hydrocarbon transportation and emerging clean energy projects. This article explores how Enbridge is leveraging surging power and gas demand to deliver consistent, high-margin returns while navigating the evolving energy transition.

The Backbone of Oil Sands Transportation: Mainline Optimization

Enbridge's crown jewel, the Mainline system, remains the largest crude oil pipeline in North America, currently operating at 3 million barrels per day (bpd). By 2027, the company plans to add 150,000 bpd of capacity through a $1.5 billion optimization project. Two-thirds of this new capacity will flow the full path from Edmonton to the Houston refining complex—a critical link for oil sands producers who have long struggled with transportation bottlenecks.

This expansion is not just about volume but also about margin resilience. With oil sands production expected to grow by 1 million bpd by 2035, Enbridge's ability to secure long-term contracts with producers ensures stable cash flows. The project's high return profile—supported by cost-competitive infrastructure and low incremental capital expenditures—positions it as a cornerstone of Enbridge's growth strategy.

Gas Storage and LNG: A Dual-Track Strategy for Energy Transition

While oil sands transportation remains a pillar of Enbridge's business, the company is also doubling down on gas infrastructure to meet the growing demand for cleaner-burning fuels. In British Columbia, the 40 Bcf expansion of the Aitken Creek gas storage facility is a strategic move to support the LNG value chain. This project, paired with the Aspen Point Program's 535 MMcf/d capacity boost, ensures Enbridge can meet the needs of both domestic and international LNG markets.

The Woodfibre LNG project in BC further underscores Enbridge's commitment to this segment. By providing a sustainable source of Canadian natural gas to global markets, the company is aligning with global decarbonization trends while maintaining profitability. Gas storage and LNG infrastructure are inherently high-margin, with long-term contracts and minimal operational variability, making them ideal for generating stable returns in a volatile energy environment.

Renewable Energy: Clear Fork Solar and the Future of Power Demand

Enbridge's diversification into renewables is another key component of its strategy. The Clear Fork Solar project, a 600 MW, $900 million development, is a prime example. This project, backed by a long-term offtake agreement with Meta, taps into the surging demand for clean energy from data centers and industrial clients. With corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) growing rapidly, Enbridge is leveraging its infrastructure expertise to enter the renewable energy market without overextending its balance sheet.

The Traverse Pipeline's upsizing from 1.75 to 2.5 Bcf/d is another strategic move, driven by strong market demand for natural gas in power generation. This bidirectional pipeline between Katy and Agua Dulce in the Gulf Coast allows Enbridge to respond dynamically to price differentials, enhancing margins through optimized throughput.

Financial Strength and Growth Backlog: A Foundation for Resilience

Enbridge's financial discipline is the linchpin of its success. As of Q2 2025, the company reported adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 billion, a 7% year-over-year increase, and a Debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.7x, leaving ample room for further investment. Its $32 billion growth backlog, including projects like the Flanagan South pipeline and Texas Eastern Transmission expansion, ensures a steady pipeline of returns.

The company's ability to outmaneuver competitors like TC Energy and Pembina Pipeline lies in its focus on high-impact, low-risk projects. For instance, the Flanagan South pipeline's oversubscribed open season—connecting Illinois to Cushing—demonstrates the robust demand for Enbridge's infrastructure. By reconfiguring existing assets (e.g., the Southern Illinois Connector in partnership with Energy Transfer LP), the company is minimizing capital outlays while maximizing capacity.

Investment Implications and Strategic Outlook

For investors, Enbridge's current trajectory presents a compelling case. The company's diversified portfolio—spanning oil sands transportation, gas storage, LNG, and renewables—provides a buffer against sector-specific volatility. Its financial strength, coupled with a growth backlog that spans both traditional and emerging energy markets, ensures long-term cash flow visibility.

Key risks include regulatory headwinds, particularly for LNG projects, and potential delays in renewable energy permitting. However, Enbridge's track record of navigating complex regulatory environments and its strategic partnerships (e.g., the Calvados Offshore Wind Project in France) mitigate these concerns.

Conclusion: A High-Margin Infrastructure Play for the Energy Transition Era

Enbridge is not just adapting to the energy transition—it is shaping it. By leveraging surging power and gas demand through optimized infrastructure, strategic expansions, and a balanced approach to decarbonization, the company is delivering consistent, high-margin returns.

Ukrainian drones also struck a fuel depot in Russia’s Voronezh region and an electronics facility in Penza, it said. All the targets were part of Russia’s war apparatus, the military said.

The Ukrainian state security service said its long-range drones also attacked a military airbase in the Krasnodar region in Russia’s southwest, where storage and launch sites of Shahed drones were hit.

It wasn’t possible to independently verify the claims. Rosneft PJSC, owner of the Ryazan and Novokuibyshevsk refineries, didn’t immediately reply to a WhatsApp message seeking comment on Saturday.

Ukrainian authorities said that at least 31 people were killed in a combined drone and missile barrage on Kyiv on Thursday that lasted for several hours. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said another 159 people were injured, including 16 children, in one of the deadliest strikes on Kyiv for the war to date.

Samara regional Governor Vyacheslav Fedorischev said in social media posts that an industrial facility had been attacked and that one man had been killed by falling drone fragments. Ryazan regional Governor Pavel Malkov said on Telegram that debris from a unmanned aerial vehicle had fallen on the premises of an enterprise, without providing more detail. Three people were killed in the various incidents, Russian officials said.

With the Kremlin’s war against Ukraine almost halfway through its fourth year, Kyiv’s forces have repeatedly targeted energy infrastructure, including some Rosneft facilities, in a move to curtail Russia’s ability to send fuel to the front line and limit Moscow’s revenue from oil sales.

The Ryazan refinery, about 120 miles (193 km) southeast of Moscow, is one of the largest in Russia and has a design processing capacity of about 340,000 barrels of crude a day. The Novokuibyshevsk plant has a design processing capacity of over 177,000 barrels a day and the two facilities account for less than a tenth of Russia’s total refinery capacity.

Separately, explosions damaged a gas pipeline that carries fuel from Turkmenistan in Central Asia to Russia’s Volgograd region, said a Ukrainian military official who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive issues. The damaged segment carries fuel to Russian military plants, the official said. Bloomberg cannot independently verify the claim.

What’s in the New Legislation?

As with any large piece of legislation, there’s a bit of complexity attached to the elimination of wind and solar subsidies in the OBBB. Thanks to negotiation from some Republican senators, tax incentives will remain for companies that start construction on projects by July 4, 2026, and that place them in service by the end of 2027.

However, as Norton Rose Fulbright points out, even this provision has been muddied by proclamations from the Trump administration. An executive order issued by President Trump just three days after the legislation was signed directs the Treasury Department to issue “new and revised guidance” within 45 days “restricting the use of broad safe harbors [to treat projects as under construction] unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.”

This confusion prompted Ryan Sweezey, director of North America power and renewables at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, to say, “I would characterize this as a high degree of volatility expected over the next year. I mean, the policy situation is still not clear.”

For renewable energy companies, this means they are being prompted to rush new projects while at the same time being uncertain if they will actually receive the tax incentives they seek. This type of stalemate puts renewables in a state of limbo for the time being, which isn’t good for business.

It seems unlikely that Trump will backpedal on his campaign against renewables, as he called wind and solar energy “a blight” on the country during a Cabinet meeting, according to NPR. “They hurt our country very badly,” he said. “And smart countries don’t use it.”

How Will the Legislation Affect Energy Prices?

The bottom line is that even a reduction in subsidies and incentives for the renewable energy market — let alone an elimination — will drive up energy prices across the country. According to NPR, energy demand is likely to increase significantly over the next few years, and renewable energy plants were being counted on to produce relatively cheap energy for new data centers and factories.

Energy Innovation predicts that national energy rates will increase for consumers by an average of 9% to 18% by 2035. On a wholesale basis, prices are expected to rise 25% by 2030 and a whopping 74% by 2035. Additionally, it will cost the U.S. economy thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in planned investment.

Which States Are Most Vulnerable, and Why?

The states hardest-hit by the new legislation may dream of a 10-year increase of “only” 9% to 18% in energy costs. This is because some states rely completely on the federal government for renewable energy development. According to Dan O’Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, the firm anticipates that costs will rise the most in these four states:

Oklahoma

Kentucky

Missouri

Kansas

In Oklahoma, rates are expected to skyrocket by between 60% and 350% by 2035. Kentucky, Missouri and Kansas are projected to see rate increases of at least 48%, 39% and 30% over the next decade, respectively.

When factoring in job losses in addition to energy price increases, Energy Innovation sees these five states as the biggest losers:

South Carolina

Florida

Texas

Kentucky

North Carolina

All of these states in both lists are predominantly Republican-led, from a Congressional standpoint. Energy Innovation says that costs will rise the most in these “red” states because they have no state-led renewable programs. This means they will have to rely on more expensive forms of energy as wind and solar industries shrink and subsidies vanish.

Investing.com - August could prove to be a critical month for renewable energy companies, as the industry awaits revised guidance from the Treasury Department on tax credit eligibility.

President Donald Trump has directed the department to enforce the phasing out of tax breaks for wind and solar projects -- a key provision of his sprawling fiscal policy bill signed into law on July 4.

In particular, the Treasury Department was told in an executive order from Trump to submit a report detailing the actions it has taken. The update is due to be submitted by August 18.

Trump has argued that renewable energy resources are expensive, unreliable and displace more ""dispatchable"" energy sources. He has also claimed that many were threatening national security by being heavily reliant on foreign supply chains.

Power industry representatives, on the other hand, have argued that new generation projects are needed to help meet rising U.S. demand. Citing consulting firm ICF, Reuters has reported that U.S. electricity demand is anticipated to grow by 25% by 2030, due largely to an ongoing artificial intelligence boom and cloud computing.

The tax-cuts and spending package, which was passed by Congressional Republicans earlier this summer after weeks of internal wrangling, would gradually slash tax incentives for renewable projects that begin construction after 2026. Previously, developers would have been able to claim a tax credit of 30% through 2032.

In effect, it requires projects to start construction within a year or begin service by the end of 2027 in order to qualify for the credits. New developers have, in response, started racing to get projects off the ground.

But the Treasury Department’s review could change that, especially because Trump ordered it to assess the definition of ""beginning of construction."" A revision could see the end of a rule granting developers four years to claim tax credits after spending 5% of the project’s costs, analysts at Bernstein warned.

""If Treasury materially increases the minimum construction amount or decreases the safe harbor window, it could negatively impact the massive pull forward of projects over the next 12 months,"" they wore in a note.

With these worries in mind, Bernstein downgraded its rating of Houston-based Quanta Services (NYSE:PWR), a provider of infrastructure services for the power industry, to ""market perform"" from ""outperform.""

During its run, the site became heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, resulting in a complex and costly remediation effort.

On Monday, city officials sent letters to the current owners of the island expressing their desire to “negotiate a fair purchase price” for the property.
Local advocates have also questioned the need to tear down the hulking, brick-clad structure of English Station, which many argue carries historic and aesthetic significance to the city.","A Connecticut judge has ordered state officials to go back to their deliberations in a long-running dispute with United Illuminating over the cleanup of one of the utility’s former power plants, English Station.

The ruling — which is almost certain to add further delays to the remediation effort — came just days after officials in New Haven announced ambitious plans to tear down the dilapidated plant and develop the site into a waterfront park complete with walking trails and a public pool.

“While this is not the only dispute that has interfered with the remediation of the English Station site, originally contemplated to have been completed years ago, the parties’ dispute over the applicable cleanup standard inside the buildings is a significant impediment to completing that project,” Superior Court Judge John B. Farley wrote in his decision.

United Illuminating operated the plant for more than a half century, burning coal and later oil to produce electricity for its customers, before the plant was finally powered down in 1992. During its run, the site became heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, resulting in a complex and costly remediation effort.

Over the years, the plant fell into disrepair and was subject to vandalism and thefts of leftover metal. As part of a deal with regulators to approve UI’s merger with Spanish utility giant Iberdrola in 2015, the company agreed to spend $30 million to clean up the site.

That agreement, however, quickly became subject to a dispute over the standard to which the property should be cleared of contaminants and made ready for development.

The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, led by Commissioner Katie Dykes, argued that the consent decree signed by both parties required UI to remediate PCB levels in the plant building to below 1 part per million, which would allow for a wider range of future uses, such as housing, businesses or recreation. Utility officials balked, arguing that doing so would require the complete demolition of the building — something they had not agreed to do during negotiations over the agreement.

Last year, Dykes issued a ruling requiring UI to abide by the higher remediation standard. UI promptly sued, arguing that Dykes had overstepped her authority and misconstrued the language in the consent decree to suit the state’s desire for a more robust cleanup.

In his decision on Thursday, however, Judge Farley opted not to side with either party’s interpretation of the consent decree, which he said was ambiguous as to the required level of cleanup.

Instead, Farley remanded the case back to DEEP for further proceedings. At the same time, he found that Dykes had not abused her authority by issuing a declaratory ruling, thus allowing her to make further decisions regarding the consent decree.

In a statement Friday, United Illuminating spokesperson Sarah Wall Fliotsos said the company appreciated the decision to sustain their appeal and send the case back to DEEP.

“In this case, DEEP wrongfully changed the standard for clean-up that was agreed upon nearly a decade ago,” Fliotsos said. “It is clear DEEP was wrong to try to enforce a standard that was not part of the original agreement, and they are wrong to continue to blame UI for delays.”

“Ultimately, clean-up of this site cannot be achieved without clarity on the standard we are working towards,” she added. “As this issue is remanded for further proceedings, we hope to be able to work in good faith with state officials to chart a clear path forward for UI’s role in the future of English Station.”

DEEP officials referred comment to Attorney General William Tong’s office, which represented the agency in the lawsuit. Tong told the CT Mirror on Friday that his office is still reviewing the judge’s decision and its impact on the cleanup process.

“We’re gonna keep fighting,” Tong said. “UI owes whatever it takes to remediate English Station, and I’m never going to come off that position.”

A spokesman for New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said Thursday that the ruling would not impact the city’s plans to move ahead with the proposed redevelopment of English Station.

“As the City advances its proposal for Mill River Park, it’s critical that UI stop dragging its feet and complete the remediation of English Station so that this land can finally be put to good public use, and we’re confident the Attorney General and CT DEEP will continue to hold UI accountable for its longstanding failure to clean up this site,” the spokesman, Lenny Speiller, said in a statement.

“We hope the City’s proposal and intended use of the site brings a new focus and urgency on what needs to be done to help make this vision a reality,” he added.

The city’s proposal is part of a larger plan to redevelop former industrial areas along the Mill River, which surrounds the small island on which the power plant sits.

In order to make the land safe for walking, playing and swimming, the site would have to be cleaned to the 1 ppm level being sought by DEEP, Speiller said. Even then, the city has estimated it will cost at least another $25 million to develop its park proposal.

“After bearing the costs of industrial pollution and blight from the English Station power plant for decades, our community deserves a true treasure in its place,” Elicker said in his announcement of the city’s plans on Monday. “By replacing it with a new waterfront public park and recreation area, we will transform this site into an amazing public asset that will benefit our residents, improve our environment and strengthen our community for generations to come.”

Beyond the initial cleanup, however, other hurdles exist that could complicate the city’s plans.

New Haven still has to acquire the English Station property, which has changed hands several times over the last two decades. On Monday, city officials sent letters to the current owners of the island expressing their desire to “negotiate a fair purchase price” for the property. If the owners do not respond, Speiller said, the city will consider using eminent domain to acquire the property.

The owners are a pair of limited liability corporations tied to three people — George Goldstein, Esther Schiller and David Tropper — with business addresses listed in Brooklyn, Queens and Israel.

When reached for comment earlier this week, Goldstein at first denied being one of the owners of English Station before saying he had received the city’s letter and was reviewing it. “I have to get back to you on that,” Goldstein said when asked if he was interested in selling the property.

Schiller and Tropper could not be reached for comment. Goldstein hung up after being reached for comment a second time on Friday.

Local advocates have also questioned the need to tear down the hulking, brick-clad structure of English Station, which many argue carries historic and aesthetic significance to the city.

Anstress Farwell, the president of the New Haven Urban Design League, said this week that she supported the city’s efforts to take control of the power plant property, though she called its plans to raze the remaining buildings “premature” until further studies can be done to determine whether they are salvageable.

“In all of my talks with the city, it’s been about ‘the building is an asset,'” Farwell said. “It’s 110,000 square feet that city officials have said that they could never rebuild on the site but could use if it could be renovated.”

Nor did Thursday’s ruling put an end to the state’s ongoing legal battle against UI over English Station.

Tong filed a separate lawsuit last year, accusing the utility of failing to uphold its agreement to spend $30 million on the remediation effort. In response, UI officials have argued that the company has already spent millions toward the remediation of the site, including removal of asbestos, but that its efforts have been hampered by the ongoing dispute with DEEP.

That case is also assigned to Judge Farley, who issued a separate ruling on Thursday dismissing four out of the five defenses that the utility had raised. That case is currently set for trial in October 2026.

Lastly, there is the case involving the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s decision in 2023 to begin fining United Illuminating $2 million a year over what regulators called a failure to abide by the utility’s agreement to remediate English Station. Earlier this year, a judge upheld the legality of that penalty — a decision that the utility is appealing.

But a quieter, more strategic revolution is unfolding in Florida—a state that has quietly become the third-largest solar market in the nation. With 20,065 megawatts (MW) of installed solar capacity as of 2025, Florida is powering over 2.35 million homes while creating 14,108 solar-related jobs and attracting $28.2 billion in investment since the solar boom began. This surge positions Florida as a critical under-the-radar opportunity in the Sun Belt's renewable energy renaissance, driven by policy tailwinds, utility innovation, and a growing appetite for energy independence.

The Policy-Driven Catalyst: IRA Tax Credits and Utility Ambition

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has been the linchpin of Florida's solar ascent. By extending a 30% tax credit for residential and commercial solar installations through 2025, the federal legislation has slashed upfront costs for developers and homeowners alike. For Florida, a state with high electricity bills and abundant sunshine, the IRA's incentives have been transformative. Solar panel prices have fallen 42% over the past decade, and the 30% credit now makes installations cost-competitive with traditional energy in many regions.

Meanwhile, Florida Power and Light (FPL), the state's largest utility, has emerged as a key player. Its 10-year site plan includes expanding energy storage capacity to 4 gigawatts by 2033—nearly 90% of Florida's current total storage capacity. FPL's investments in solar-plus-storage systems are not just about growth; they're about resilience. With hurricane season a constant threat, battery storage ensures grid reliability during outages, a value proposition that's hard to ignore.

NextEra Energy (NEE), the parent company of FPL, has seen its stock reflect the utility's aggressive clean energy strategy. Since 2022, NEE has gained over 40% as solar and storage investments outperformed expectations. For investors, this underscores the importance of aligning with utilities that are doubling down on renewables in high-growth markets.

Market Dynamics: A Solar Ecosystem in Motion

Florida's solar ecosystem is robust and diverse. The state hosts 447 solar companies, including 57 manufacturers and 225 installers/developers. This infrastructure, combined with falling equipment costs, has made solar accessible to a broader demographic. The Florida Solar Energy Center and the Public Service Commission have further supported this momentum through rebates and streamlined permitting processes.

Yet Florida's success is not without its quirks. Unlike states such as California or New York, Florida lacks a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) or power purchase agreement (PPA) authorization. Instead, its growth has been fueled by market demand and federal incentives. This creates both opportunities and risks. The absence of state-level mandates means Florida's solar industry is more vulnerable to federal policy shifts, such as the recent House budget reconciliation bill, which threatens to eliminate residential tax credits by 2026.

Challenges on the Horizon: Policy Uncertainty and Trade Pressures

The May 2025 House budget reconciliation bill has cast a shadow over Florida's solar future. If the proposed phaseout of residential tax credits takes effect, it could stifle demand for rooftop solar installations, a segment that has driven much of the state's recent growth. Similarly, restrictions on commercial incentives could slow utility-scale projects. The bill has already caused $1.4 billion in clean energy projects to be canceled this year, with solar stock values dipping in response.

Compounding these challenges are rising trade tariffs on solar equipment from Canada, Mexico, and other countries. These tariffs have increased production costs by 8-12% for developers, squeezing margins at a time when falling panel prices were supposed to make solar the cheapest energy source. For Florida, where 90% of solar components are imported, this is a critical vulnerability.

Investment Thesis: Positioning for Resilience and Growth

Despite these headwinds, Florida remains a compelling long-term bet for investors. The state is projected to add 13,261 MW of solar capacity over the next five years, ranking fifth in the U.S. for future growth. Here's how to position for it:

Utility Stocks with Solar Exposure: NextEra Energy (NEE) and Duke Energy (DUK) are well-positioned to benefit from Florida's grid modernization and storage expansion. Both have strong balance sheets and clear solar growth trajectories.

Solar Equipment Manufacturers: Companies like Enphase Energy (ENPH) and SunPower (SPWR) could see increased demand for residential and commercial solar systems in Florida, provided tax credits remain intact.

Storage Focused Firms: As Florida prioritizes grid resilience, investments in battery technology (e.g., Tesla's Megapack, SimpliSafe Solar) will become increasingly valuable.

Policy Advocacy Plays: The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) and state-level lobbying groups are key to maintaining favorable conditions. Supporting their efforts could mitigate policy risks.

The Road Ahead: A Test of Policy and Vision

Florida's solar story is a microcosm of the broader U.S. energy transition. It demonstrates how federal incentives, utility innovation, and market demand can converge to create a thriving renewable energy sector—even in the absence of state-level mandates. However, the coming months will test whether policymakers can protect this progress from short-sighted budget cuts.

For investors, the lesson is clear: Florida's solar surge is not a flash in the pan. It's a calculated, policy-driven growth story that reflects the Sun Belt's broader potential. The risks are real, but so are the rewards. In a world increasingly defined by energy independence and climate resilience, Florida's quiet revolution may well become the blueprint for America's next energy frontier.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 20:59:45.238929

Conclusion IDACORP's Q2 2025 results may lack the fireworks of a tech breakout, but they reflect the hallmarks of a utility company executing its long-term strategy with precision.","IDACORP (IDA) has long been a bellwether for utility sector resilience, and its Q2 2025 earnings report reaffirms its position as a disciplined operator navigating the dual pressures of rising costs and decarbonization. While the stock's muted post-earnings reaction reflects the utility's stable but unexciting performance, a closer look at its strategic capital allocation, regulatory agility, and long-term energy transition plans suggests the company is well-positioned to deliver consistent returns in a sector increasingly defined by infrastructure investment and climate-driven innovation.

Stable Earnings Amid Rising Costs

IDACORP's Q2 2025 results were a mixed bag. GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.76 fell short of the $1.78 Street target, dragged down by a 2.9% year-over-year decline in revenue. However, net income rose 7% to $95.8 million, driven by a 2.5% customer growth rate, higher electricity usage (particularly for irrigation), and the implementation of 2025 base rate increases. The company's ability to maintain a 21% profit margin—up from 20% in Q2 2024—despite inflationary pressures on labor, wildfire mitigation, and depreciation costs underscores its operational discipline.

The use of accumulated deferred investment tax credits (ADITC) and regulatory mechanisms like power cost adjustments allowed IDACORP to smooth earnings volatility. For instance, leveraging $17.2 million in ADITC in Q2 2025 (versus $7.5 million in 2024) provided a buffer against rising interest expenses. This strategic use of regulatory tools, combined with a debt-to-equity capital structure (50:50 target), positions the company to manage its $1.0–$1.1 billion annual capital expenditure plan without overleveraging.

Capital Allocation: A Bridge to 2045

IDACORP's long-term value proposition lies in its clean energy transition. The company's Boardman-to-Hemingway 500 kV transmission line project, along with its new battery storage facility, exemplifies its commitment to modernizing infrastructure for renewable integration. These initiatives align with its 2045 net-zero target and 88% carbon reduction goal by 2030. While such projects require upfront capital, they also create recurring revenue streams through rate-based cost recovery, a critical advantage for regulated utilities.

The firm's capital spending roadmap—$1.0–$1.1 billion annually—signals confidence in its regulatory filings and cost recovery timelines. Investors should monitor the success of its upcoming rate cases, which could unlock additional earnings headroom. Meanwhile, the 50:50 debt-to-equity mix ensures financial flexibility, particularly as the company's credit profile remains strong despite rising interest costs.

Risks and Opportunities

IDACORP's flat revenue growth and modest EPS guidance ($5.70–$5.85 for 2025) highlight the challenges of operating in a mature utility market. However, its reliance on regulatory mechanisms and tax incentives mitigates downside risk. For example, the projected use of $60–$77 million in tax credits for 2025 suggests management is proactive in leveraging policy tailwinds.

The key risk lies in regulatory uncertainty and the cost of wildfire mitigation, which could pressure margins. Yet, IDACORP's proactive wildfire mitigation plans—approved by regulators—provide a degree of cost recovery certainty. Additionally, Idaho's growing population and energy demand (driven by industrial expansion and residential growth) offer a structural tailwind for customer acquisition and usage growth.

Investment Implications

From a long-term perspective, IDACORP's stock appears fairly valued, trading in line with its intrinsic value. Its stable cash flows, coupled with a diversified capital plan focused on clean energy, make it an attractive “defensive” play in a sector increasingly influenced by ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria. While the company may not deliver high-growth returns, its disciplined approach to capital allocation and regulatory engagement should support steady earnings growth and dividend stability.

For investors seeking exposure to the energy transition, IDACORP's portfolio of transmission and storage projects offers a tangible link to the decarbonization of the U.S. grid. However, those prioritizing top-line growth may find the utility's revenue trajectory underwhelming. The stock's muted volatility and low beta further reinforce its role as a portfolio stabilizer rather than a high-conviction growth pick.

Conclusion

IDACORP's Q2 2025 results may lack the fireworks of a tech breakout, but they reflect the hallmarks of a utility company executing its long-term strategy with precision. By balancing capital expenditures with regulatory cost recovery, leveraging tax incentives, and investing in infrastructure that aligns with decarbonization goals, IDA is positioning itself as a reliable partner in the transition to a cleaner energy future. For investors with a multi-year horizon, IDACORP remains a compelling case study in how a utility can transform from a cost-driven entity into a growth-oriented, climate-conscious enterprise.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 15:02:21.015683

A major health insurer uses AI to indiscriminately deny claims, a national bank creates fake accounts and orders unwanted credit cards for real customers, an airplane manufacturer’s corner cutting on safety causes crashes that kill hundreds, are but three examples from recent years.

Too often, overworked and underfunded government regulators fail to discover the wrongdoing in time to prevent harm. Or, companies have used armies of lobbyists to rewrite laws in their favor, allowing them to “self-police” themselves with little to no independent oversight. And, if they do get caught, they’ve also changed the rules such that they’ll receive trivial fines amounting to no more than a slap on the wrist and something built into their cost of doing business. The results when there are no real consequences for corporate malfeasance can be tragic.

Legislation that passed the Illinois General Assembly with supermajority support and is now sitting on Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk represents an opportunity for Illinois to add additional teeth to our laws that will deter big businesses from behaving badly by putting profits before people.

Senate Bill 328 concerns injuries and illnesses caused by the improper use of substances defined as toxic under the state’s Uniform Hazardous Substances Act. Examples include asbestos, benzene and vinyl chloride – all common, but dangerous, industrial materials that require people who are exposed to them be informed and provided with proper safety equipment, such as goggles, chemical-resistant gloves, breathing masks, and protective clothing.

The bill is needed because too often businesses have sought to evade accountability for harms they have caused workers or consumers exposed unprotected to hazardous substances. Those companies claim that though they are registered or make money by selling products in Illinois, because they are not legally incorporated (many choose Delaware) or do not have their physical headquarters here, our state’s courts are not the proper venue to hear claims against them.

Instead, they demand that people who have been injured or sickened, some of whom are in the process of dying, travel to other states to pursue their cases – an onerous burden that sometimes isn’t physically or financially possible.

The reason that you can be assured this is a good bill and much needed is because of the way its opponents resort to outright lies about what it permits and why. Chief among the fabrications is that it will allow “attorneys to file lawsuits in Illinois state courts that have nothing to do with our state.”

But, the truth and letter of the law explicitly say that there must be an Illinois connection for the case to be brought here. Once that is established, the legislation would allow other companies to be added as defendants in the case, regardless of where they may have their headquarters or be incorporated, for harm they have caused to an Illinois connected person.

The reason that’s important is because in some instances a person who has been harmed was exposed to hazardous substances not just in Illinois, but in other states or from products manufactured by companies not incorporated or headquartered here.

A good example of this is asbestos, which for decades was used in building materials and automobile parts due to its fire-suppression properties. In time, however, we learned that very fine asbestos fibers were easily inhaled and caused debilitating, painful and ultimately fatal lung diseases like mesothelioma. While nearly all forms of asbestos have been banned, its toxic legacy lives on and time is running out for those seeking justice and fair compensation for the suffering they have endured because of it.

As part of their scare-mongering, those demanding a gubernatorial veto also falsely claim that Senate Bill 328 pertains to “lifesaving medications, food and baby formula” and are trying to raise the specter that such essential items would no longer be available in Illinois. It should go without saying that such products by definition are not made with hazardous substances, which are defined as those that cause harm through ingestion, inhalation or absorption through the skin.

To listen to the cries of the extremely well-funded Chicken Little front groups and trade associations, businesses will leave the state in droves and the sky will fall if the governor signs Senate Bill 328 into law.

These are the same organizations that are cheering the loudest at the national level for President Donald Trump’s gutting of the Environmental Protection Agency, Food & Drug Administration, National Institutes of Health, and Occupational Safety and Health Administration – government bodies that have historically played essential roles in policing the worst kinds of corporate predation and disregard for human lives.

At a time of incredible national turmoil when society is being rigged even more in favor of the billionaire class, by signing Senate Bill 3238 into law Gov. Pritzker has an opportunity to show, once again, that in a sea of darkness Illinois is a beacon of light and hope for those who are being trampled by the selfish interests of a wealthy and powerful elite. The governor can demonstrate that while D.C. is abandoning its responsibilities to protect its citizens, Illinois will not.

Interestingly, a willingness to buy an EV was the most politically polarized choice someone could make to help the environment.
The big change, though, was in liberal Americans' desire to purchase any EV at all.
As the report points out, Musk appears to have reduced liberal support for electric cars quite a bit but hasn't been able to increase conservative interest at all.","A new study indicates that Americans are growing less willing to purchase electric cars. While that's not exactly breaking news, what the research team at Williams College found was that the collapse in purchase intention came almost entirely from liberal-identifying Americans, and in particular, those with unfavorable views of the Tesla's mascot, CEO Elon Musk. In fact, antipathy to Musk is running so hot on the left that it's dragging down desires to buy any EV, not just a Tesla. The man who popularized the battery-powered car in America is now unpopularizing it again.

The report, published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, breaks down five surveys that Williams College ran from August 2023 through March 2025, a period in which Musk at first seemed to be drifting rightward with his Twitter takeover, then formally endorsed Donald Trump, then brought his chainsaw to Washington. The team measured a variety of factors for each respondent, including political leanings, personal support for Musk, income, and willingness to engage in a variety of eco-friendly activities.

Interestingly, a willingness to buy an EV was the most politically polarized choice someone could make to help the environment. Versus liberals, conservatives were more likely to say they would get an electric heat pump, get solar panels for their home, and even eat less red meat than get a car that didn't need fossil fuels. Yes, they'd rather give up steak than gas stations.

During this period, an American's desire to buy a Tesla hasn't changed much; for the most part, it's highly correlated with how much that American personally likes Musk. It's gotten a little bit worse lately with moderates and conservatives, where this relationship grew more correlated over time.

The big change, though, was in liberal Americans' desire to purchase any EV at all. This used to track modestly with whether or not they liked Musk, but that correlation has veered sharply and is much starker today than it was just a year ago. In other words, liberals who like Musk (unicorns do exist) are about as likely to want an EV now as before, but liberals who don't are radically less willing to buy any EV from any brand than they were last year.

As the report points out, Musk appears to have reduced liberal support for electric cars quite a bit but hasn't been able to increase conservative interest at all. The latter are just about as likely to buy an EV now as they were before. Combined, that would predict for a decline in EV sales across the board, and, well, here we are.

In case you were curious, the research team did account for other factors, such as the respondent's income. Could the drop in interest be due to the cost of the cars? However, they found that while a higher income does make someone generally more open to an EV, that didn't explain for the pronounced partisan split between liberals, moderates, and conservatives. It also doesn't explain why a like or dislike of Elon Musk would have such a strong correlation.

Apparently, the Tesla CEO has successfully tied his own personal brand to an entire category of vehicle. He's torched that brand with the category's biggest market. Ah well, at least Tesla itself is in great financial shape — oh.

What to watch at 2025 climate talks The Paris Agreement isn’t going anywhere.","When President Donald Trump announced in early 2025 he was withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement for the second time, it triggered fears that the move would undermine global efforts to slow climate change and diminish America’s global influence.

A big question hung in the air: Who would step into the leadership vacuum?

While it’s still too early to fully assess the long-term impact of the United States’ political shift when it comes to global cooperation on climate change, there are signs that a new set of leaders is rising to the occasion.

World responds to another U.S. withdrawal

The U.S. first committed to the Paris Agreement in a joint announcement by President Barack Obama and China’s Xi Jinping in 2015. At the time, the U.S. agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 and pledged financial support to help developing countries adapt to climate risks and embrace renewable energy.

Some people praised the U.S. engagement, while others criticized the original commitment as too weak. Since then, the U.S. has cut emissions by 17.2% below 2005 levels — missing the goal, in part because its efforts have been stymied along the way.

Just two years after the landmark Paris Agreement, Trump stood in the Rose Garden in 2017 and announced he was withdrawing the U.S. from the treaty, citing concerns that jobs would be lost, that meeting the goals would be an economic burden, and that it wouldn’t be fair because China, the world’s largest emitter today, wasn’t projected to start reducing its emissions for several years.

Scientists and some politicians and business leaders were quick to criticize the decision, calling it “shortsighted” and “reckless.” Some feared the Paris Agreement, signed by almost every country, would fall apart.

But it did not.

In the United States, businesses such as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Tesla made their own pledges to meet the Paris agreement goals.

Hawaii passed legislation to become the first state to align with the agreement. A coalition of U.S. cities and states banded together to form the United States Climate Alliance to keep working to slow climate change.

Globally, leaders from Italy, Germany and France rebutted Trump’s assertion that the Paris Agreement could be renegotiated. Others from Japan, Canada, Australia and New Zealand doubled down on their own support of the global climate accord. In 2020, President Joe Biden brought the U.S. back into the agreement.

Now, with Trump pulling the U.S. out again — and taking steps to eliminate U.S. climate policies, boost fossil fuels and slow the growth of clean energy at home — other countries are stepping up.

On July 24, China and the European Union issued a joint statement vowing to strengthen their climate targets and meet them. They alluded to the U.S., referring to “the fluid and turbulent international situation today” in saying that “the major economies … must step up efforts to address climate change.”

In some respects, this is a strength of the Paris Agreement — it is a legally nonbinding agreement based on what each country decides to commit to. Its flexibility keeps it alive, as the withdrawal of a single member does not trigger immediate sanctions, nor does it render the actions of others obsolete.

The agreement survived the first U.S. withdrawal, and so far, all signs point to it surviving the second one.

Who’s filling leadership vacuum?

From what I’ve seen in international climate meetings and my team’s research, it appears that most countries are moving forward.

One bloc emerging as a powerful voice in negotiations is the Like-Minded Group of Developing Countries, a group of low- and middle-income countries that includes China, India, Bolivia and Venezuela. Driven by economic development concerns, these countries are pressuring the developed world to meet its commitments to both cut emissions and provide financial aid to poorer countries.

China, motivated by economic and political factors, seems to be happily filling the climate power vacuum created by the U.S. exit.

In 2017, China voiced disappointment over the first U.S. withdrawal. It maintained its climate commitments and pledged to contribute more in climate finance to other developing countries than the U.S. had committed to — $3.1 billion compared with $3 billion.

This time around, China is using leadership on climate change in ways that fit its broader strategy of gaining influence and economic power by supporting economic growth and cooperation in developing countries. Through its Belt and Road Initiative, China has scaled up renewable energy exports and development in other countries, such as investing in solar power in Egypt and wind energy development in Ethiopia.

While China is still the world’s largest coal consumer, it has aggressively pursued investments in renewable energy at home, including solar, wind and electrification. In 2024, about half the renewable energy capacity built worldwide was in China.

While it missed the deadline to submit its climate pledge due this year, China has a goal of peaking its emissions before 2030 and then dropping to net-zero emissions by 2060. It is continuing major investments in renewable energy, both for its own use and for export. The U.S. government, in contrast, is cutting its support for wind and solar power. China also just expanded its carbon market to encourage emissions cuts in the cement, steel and aluminum sectors.

The British government has also ratcheted up its climate commitments as it seeks to become a clean energy superpower. In 2025, it pledged to cut emissions 77% by 2035 compared with 1990 levels. Its new pledge is also more transparent and specific than in the past, with details on how specific sectors, such as power, transportation, construction and agriculture, will cut emissions. And it contains stronger commitments to provide funding to help developing countries grow more sustainably.

In terms of corporate leadership, while many American businesses are being quieter about their efforts, in order to avoid sparking the ire of the Trump administration, most appear to be continuing on a green path — despite the lack of federal support and diminished rules.

USA Today and Statista’s “America’s Climate Leader List” includes about 500 large companies that have reduced their carbon intensity — carbon emissions divided by revenue — by 3% from the previous year. The data shows that the list is growing, up from about 400 in 2023.

What to watch at 2025 climate talks

The Paris Agreement isn’t going anywhere. Given the agreement’s design, with each country voluntarily setting its own goals, the U.S. never had the power to drive it into obsolescence.

The question is if developed and developing country leaders alike can navigate two pressing needs — economic growth and ecological sustainability — without compromising their leadership on climate change.

Florida Democrats warn that a move by DeSantis and the state’s Republicans would set a negative precedent.","Florida Republicans are increasingly pushing to redraw the state’s congressional lines following a similar move by the Texas GOP.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) said Wednesday he is “very seriously” looking at asking the state Legislature to redraw the state’s congressional map, arguing the 2020 census is flawed.

Rep. Jimmy Patronis (R-Fla.) came out in favor of redistricting in a post on social platform X, writing that “Texas can do it, the Free State of Florida can do it 10X better.”

Florida Republicans say they were already headed in this direction following a state Supreme Court decision that upheld a congressional map supported by DeSantis and state Republicans.

But the plan is gaining even more traction in the wake of Texas Republicans’ unveiling of a new congressional map.

“It’s picking up steam,” Florida GOP Chair Evan Power told The Hill. “We were probably heading there with the court decision, but Texas made it top news.”

Florida has seen an uptick in population growth following the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

The state has also become solidly Republican over the past decade, with Republicans growing their representation in Congress and once-Democratic strongholds like Miami-Dade and Osceola counties flipping from blue to red.

A number of Democratic-held congressional seats could be impacted if redistricting were to take place, including those held in south Florida by Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Jared Moskowitz and Lois Frankel. Rep. Kathy Castor (D) in the Tampa area and Rep. Darren Soto (D) outside of Orlando have also been floated as possible targets.

Florida Republicans already hold a 20 to 8 advantage over Democrats in the congressional delegation.

Republicans were boosted last month when the state’s Supreme Court ruled to uphold a congressional map that blocked a challenge to the elimination of a majority-Black congressional district in the north of the state that previously was represented by former Rep. Al Lawson (D). The area that comprised the former congressional district is now divided among three Republican lawmakers.

But DeSantis is not stopping there.

The governor has argued that Florida got a “raw deal” in the 2020 census when the state only gained one congressional seat. The governor said last month he had relayed his concerns to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick after he was sworn in earlier this year and that the Trump administration could be pursuing redoing the census.

Additionally, the governor said he believes Florida’s Fair District amendments, which a majority of voters approved of in 2010, could conflict with the U.S. Constitution. The amendments say that districts cannot be drawn in a way that hinders minorities voting for their choice of elected representatives.

“There’s a lot of people who believe that the Fair District Amendments is unconstitutional, because what it does is, it mandates having race predominate,” DeSantis said this week. “Whereas, neutrality should really be the constitutional standard.”

Patronis also said in his X post that he believes the Fair District Amendments are unconstitutional “because it violates freedom of speech AND elections are a states rights issue.”

“Time to add more conservatives to Congress, so we can better deliver on President Trump’s agenda, finally win the war against woke, cut government waste, and create an economy that moves our country into a new age of prosperity,” Patronis said.

Republicans argue that DeSantis and the state’s Republicans could be setting an example for other red states to follow.

“DeSantis here sees an opportunity to be a trailblazer for the Republican Party in this sense in that he could be setting up a pilot program that Texas and some of the other states can actually follow,” a Florida Republican strategist said.

“Let’s not disillusion ourselves, if he pulls this off, he will be a fan favorite of one person who sits at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue,” the strategist added, referring to Trump.

So far, Republicans in the Florida state Legislature have remained publicly quiet about the prospect of pursuing redistricting. This year’s state legislative session was extended from 60 days to 105 days and saw tensions emerge between DeSantis and members of his own party.

State Rep. Alex Andrade, a vocal Republican critic of DeSantis, said he has not spoken to his colleagues about redistricting. The state lawmaker noted he would support the effort only if the census was redone.

“I get the partisan argument,” Andrade told The Hill. “I understand we could make hay right now and benefit Republicans but at some point do I care more about my party or the Constitution?”

“If the census were redone, I’d jump all over it,” he said.

Florida Democrats warn that a move by DeSantis and the state’s Republicans would set a negative precedent.

“It would mean that the governor and the state legislative branch would completely capitulate under Donald Trump,” state House Minority Leader Fentrice Driskell (D) said. “It’s not supposed to be that the president gets to act like a king and say ‘do this on my behalf.’”

In a Facebook video posted by Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-N.M.), Soto accused Republicans of wanting to cheat in the election.

“They want to pick their voters rather than voters picking their representatives,” he said. “You’ll see us do whatever we can in the courts to make sure that the Fair Districts Amendments are enforced.”

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Madison Andrus dismissed the effort from Florida Republicans as “a bold-faced attempt to save their flailing midterm performance by rigging the game.”

The effort comes as the nationwide redistricting war heats up and both parties seek to gain seats ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

In addition to Republicans in Texas and potentially Florida taking a look at redistricting, Democrats in states like California and New Jersey are also exploring their options.

“There’s an opportunity and if it better reflects the makeup of a state whether that’s Texas or Florida, or to Gavin Newsom’s point even California, then you should do it,” a national Republican strategist said.

“These redistricting efforts, if they comply with the law and meet all of the various federal thresholds to get mapped through, if you do that and do it quickly, you’re going to increase the likelihood that the president and Republicans in Washington and going to be able to keep pushing things forward,” the strategist continued.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/FloridaRepublicans_Manchester_AP-OrlandoSentinel_JoeBurbank_855518.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-02 18:03:07.671917

The first-of-its-kind celebration brought together Michigan elected officials, EV industry leaders and climate advocates from across the state to promote sustainable transportation, joined by sponsors Moms Clean Air Force, Environmental Defense Fund Action, Sierra Club and Tesla Owners Club.

""The overarching theme is that EVs are here to stay, and we want to educate the public that they are not going by the wayside,"" said Amy Rogghe, executive director and founder of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance. ""The transportation sector in Michigan is the largest contributor of greenhouse gasses out of every sector. So in our state, it's ultimately important that we decrease the greenhouse gas emissions from transportation.""

The event featured a wide range of activities centered around the environmental and health benefits of electric transportation and highlighting electric vehicles from various manufacturers. A Ride 'n Drive experience allowed those interested to test out the vehicles and drive them up and down Woodward Avenue.

As EV technology improves year over year and sales increase, Rogghe said, Detroit needs to stay one step ahead.

“If we don't buy in, we're going to be left in the dust,"" Rogghe said. ""So we really need to buy in, not only for our state's economy, but just to be in the global economy, to be a big piece of that market. ... I mean, in Michigan, we have the Detroit Motor City, right? We need to stay at the cutting edge of auto technology, and that is what an EV is.""

""This is going to be the evolution,"" said Terry Richards, who displayed his Chevy Bolt EV at the event. Richards, 67, called himself the ""oldest EV owner around"" and said he hopes the event reaches younger generations.

""It's not about us, it's about the kids,"" Richards said.

Erin DeMoss, who was sitting beside Richards and owned a Tesla Model S, agreed with him. Her Tesla has been to the Grand Canyon, Pikes Peak, Mount Washington and ""all around Michigan,"" she said.

""When we first bought our Tesla, wherever we would go, the kids are so amazed. They'd be like, 'Oh my God, it's a Tesla,'"" DeMoss said. ""So we have all these boomers who will say, 'No, no, it's gas all the way.' But you know, they're not going to be around forever, and when you look to the kids, they're just so excited.""

""I've had a lot of discussions with people that are like 'Gasoline forever,'"" Richards said. ""You can't change everyone. All you can do is change enough people to switch over to get to what you call critical mass.""

Rie Yamakawa of Novi brought along her 4-year-old son to test out several mini battery-powered children's motorcycles and cars. His stamp of approval, she said, made all the difference.

""I just think it's awesome that they brought all these vendors, that they're showing all these alternatives here,"" Yamakawa said. ""It's great that they're making people aware of these new models, there are so many for someone to choose from.""

When asked if she'll be buying one for her son, Yamakawa laughed: ""I think I need to now, he won't get off. He finished the battery on the last one, the car, and now he's riding the motorcycle.""

Also at the event, attendees could listen in on presentations and discussions on the benefits of transitioning to electric transportation, which experts said help in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving overall air quality.

Nora Naughton, communications director of the Sierra Club's Michigan chapter, said EVs are going to be ""super key"" in fighting the climate crisis.

""As soon as someone interacts with an electric vehicle, they're so much more likely to actually consider them,"" Naughton said. ""There's so many different things that we can do for climate action, and this is just one leg of the stool for us. This is an individual action that you can take today. You can turn in your gas powered car for an electric one, and I would argue that it would improve your life.""

Manufacturers demonstrated advancements in EV technology, giving attendees the opportunity to explore the vehicles up close through a showcase featuring over 60 different cars. The display even included an electric school bus and a solar vehicle designed by University of Michigan students.

Junior Julia Glasco and sophomore Evan Winters, both part of the university's student-run UM Solar Car Team, presented their student-made and designed solar vehicle called Astrum. The car finished fourth in the 2023 Bridgestone World Solar Challenge, an 1,800-mile race across the Australian Outback, and first in the 2024 American Solar Challenge.

""I always watch the green cruise growing up and it's the best way to display what our car does for sustainability, because it kind of gets overlooked when people think it's just a racing team,"" Winters said.

BRASÍLIA (DF) – The Federal Prosecution Office (MPF) has increased pressure on President Lula to veto the General Bill on Environmental Licensing (Bill 2159/2021), known as the “Devastation Bill,” which was passed by the National Congress on the 17th of this month. The institution sent a technical note to the Presidential Palace last Tuesday, the 29th, recommending the veto of more than 30 provisions of the bill, citing violations of the Constitution, threats to environmental protection, and breaches of international treaties.

Also on Tuesday, the Minister of the Environment and Climate Change, Marina Silva, stated that the Ministry’s technical team is finalizing its analysis of the bill to support the president’s decision to either sanction or veto the measure, which consists of 60 articles and over 300 provisions. Lula has until August 8 to decide.

According to Marina, it’s not only the amendments introduced by the Senate that need to be assessed, but the bill as a whole, which environmentalists argue was already flawed when it left the House of Representatives, as it initiated the dismantling of the licensing process, considered a key tool for environmental protection in the country.

Within the federal government, while Marina’s ministry supports the veto, the Ministries of Mines and Energy and of Transportation have already expressed interest in the bill’s sanctioning, as many of the proposed changes would exempt strategic projects from environmental licensing. In Marina’s view, vetoing the bill is not enough: an alternative must be presented to restore the rules, which could mean submitting a new bill or a Provisional Measure to Congress.

The MPF’s technical note was prepared by the Chamber on the Environment and Cultural Heritage (4CCR), the Chamber on Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities (6CCR), and the Federal Prosecutor’s Office for Citizens’ Rights (PFDC), all upper bodies within the Prosecutor General’s Office (PGR).

The 13-page document states that the contested provisions “violate the Federal Constitution and contravene fundamental principles such as the right to an ecologically balanced environment and the rights of Indigenous Peoples over their lands, as well as the principles of public administration, the prohibition of environmental regression, effective protection, and federalism. The measure also goes against established Supreme Federal Court (STF) precedents in several specific rulings.”

The bill introduced new types of licensing, such as the Special Environmental License (LEA) and the License by Commitment and Adhesion (LAC), a kind of self-licensing, while exempting various sectors from licensing or extending licensing deadlines. According to the MPF, the STF has already ruled against such measures, as in the Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI) 6.618, stating that “the simplification of procedures is only acceptable in cases of low environmental impact.”

More permissive licensing

The MPF also objects to the creation of more permissive licensing models, such as the exemption of licensing for sectors like agribusiness and infrastructure works; automatic license renewals; and the exclusion of institutions such as the National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples (Funai) from projects affecting unratified traditional territories.

The prosecutors who signed the document recall that the Supreme Federal Court (STF) has already ruled that “the territorial rights of Indigenous and quilombola peoples are original and do not depend on the formal conclusion of administrative processes.” In addition to hindering the evaluation of indirect impacts of large projects on these communities, the MPF argues that the approved bill violates the precautionary principle and the right to free, prior, and informed consultation, as established by Convention 169 of the International Labour Organization (ILO).

Another criticism is the removal of the requirement for registration in the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) and the loosening of rules under the Atlantic Forest Law. “Although presented under the pretense of modernizing and speeding up the environmental licensing process, the approved text contains provisions that, in practice, dismantle one of the most important instruments of Brazilian environmental policy and the defense of human rights,” the MPF states in the document.

Violations and socio-environmental rollback

In concluding the technical note, the prosecutors further state that “the set of analyzed provisions constitutes a systematic violation of the principle prohibiting socio-environmental regression, recognized by the STF as stemming from Article 225 of the Federal Constitution.”

“Through self-licensing, the exemption of entire sectors, the elimination of technical analysis, and the weakening of requirements, the bill promotes a generalized dismantling of the licensing system, representing an unjustified rollback that jeopardizes the core of the right to the environment,” emphasize the prosecutors.

In addition to ILO Convention 169, the Paris Agreement—signed in 2015 to combat climate change—is also considered violated. According to the MPF, all this generates “a high risk of the country being held accountable by international courts, such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR).”

The MPF stated that it had already warned the National Congress several times about the risks of regression posed by the Licensing Bill, including in May 2024, when it submitted a document to the Senate detailing the environmental and social damage the rule changes would cause. This year, the MPF met again with the Federal Senate’s Environment Committee to discuss the measure and participated in public hearings on the subject.

Impact on unratified Indigenous Territories

A report published this Thursday, the 31st, by the InfoAmazônia portal shows that the Licensing Bill excludes 121 Indigenous Territories (ITs) in the Legal Amazon from protection zones surrounding major projects. This is because projects such as ports, railways, highways, mining ventures, wind farms, thermal plants, hydroelectric plants, and power lines may now be established around unratified ITs without consulting the National Foundation for Indigenous Peoples (Funai).

According to InfoAmazônia, of the 792 territories recognized by Funai in Brazil, 289 (36%) have not yet been ratified, with 121 of those located in the Legal Amazon—equivalent to 26% of the region’s ITs.

“The text also reduces the direct impact zone of projects, in the case of ratified Indigenous lands and those with restricted use for isolated communities in the Amazon biome. And it significantly reduces this buffer zone in other Legal Amazon biomes, such as the Cerrado and Pantanal, equating them to other regions of the country,” the report states.

Since the bill changes the term “Legal Amazon” to “Amazon Biome,” InfoAmazônia notes that, if fully sanctioned, the proposal will also reduce the protection radius for ratified ITs in the Amazon biome from 40 to 15 kilometers for highways; from 10 to 8 kilometers for railways, ports, thermal plants, and mining projects that require environmental impact assessments; from 40 to 30 kilometers for hydroelectric plants with reservoirs; and from 8 to 5 kilometers for transmission lines.

Conclusion: A Clean Energy Leader in the AI Age AES's Q2 2025 results are more than a quarterly beat—they are a masterclass in strategic foresight.","The AES Corporation (AES) has emerged as a linchpin in the global transition to clean energy, and its Q2 2025 results underscore its deft strategic positioning in a rapidly evolving market. With a 56% surge in Adjusted EBITDA for its Renewables Strategic Business Unit (SBU) year-over-year, AES is not just riding the wave of decarbonization—it is shaping it. The company's aggressive expansion of 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of new renewable capacity in 2025, coupled with a 12 GW Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) backlog, positions it to capitalize on the surging energy demands of the data center industry, a sector poised to redefine global electricity consumption. For investors, this represents a compelling case of alignment between macroeconomic trends, operational execution, and long-term value creation.

A Renewable Powerhouse in the AI Era

The data center industry's energy needs are escalating at an unprecedented pace. By 2025, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that data centers will drive over 20% of the U.S. electricity demand surge, with global demand from data centers expected to more than double by 2030. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency operations are the primary culprits, with AI-optimized centers alone projected to consume quadruple their current energy by 2030. AES has positioned itself at the intersection of these trends through a dual strategy: scaling renewable energy infrastructure and securing long-term PPAs with tech giants.

In Q2 2025, AES signed or was awarded 1.6 GW of new solar and wind projects, all directed toward data center clients like Microsoft and Meta. These agreements, part of a 12 GW PPA backlog (with 5.2 GW under construction), provide a stable revenue stream and insulate the company from short-term volatility. Notably, the 650 MW of solar power allocated to Meta's Texas and Kansas data centers exemplifies AES's ability to deliver “time-to-power” solutions—projects that can be deployed rapidly to meet the urgent needs of high-growth industries.

Financial Resilience Amid Transition Risks

AES's Q2 results highlight its financial discipline despite headwinds. While the company reported a GAAP net loss of $150 million, driven by non-cash charges and Colombia's regulatory challenges, its Adjusted EBITDA of $681 million and Adjusted EBITDA with Tax Attributes of $1,057 million reaffirmed its operational strength. The company's ability to maintain a $0.17595 quarterly dividend—despite sector-wide uncertainties—signals confidence in its cash flow resilience.

AES's 2025 guidance of $2,650–$2,850 million in Adjusted EBITDA and $2.10–$2.26 in Adjusted EPS is underpinned by three pillars:

1. Renewables Growth: The 3.2 GW expansion in 2025, with 1.9 GW already completed, will add recurring revenue.

2. U.S. Utility Rate Base Growth: AES Indiana's regulatory rate review aims to unlock $400 million in annualized earnings by 2027.

3. Geographic Diversification: Normalized performance in Colombia and Mexico, along with green hydrogen partnerships (e.g., Air Products in North Texas), diversifies risk and taps into emerging decarbonization markets.

Strategic Partnerships as a Growth Engine

AES's collaboration with data center operators is not merely transactional—it is strategic. By aligning with hyperscalers like Meta, which has committed to 100% clean energy, AES gains access to a sector with insatiable demand and a willingness to pay premium prices for reliability. The 650 MW Texas-Kansas project, for instance, is expected to generate $150 million annually in revenue while creating 500+ construction jobs and boosting local tax revenues. Such projects enhance AES's reputation as a “utility as a service” provider, a model gaining traction as data centers seek partners that can manage both energy and infrastructure complexity.

Moreover, AES's pipeline of 65 GW—far exceeding its 12 GW backlog—ensures a multi-year growth trajectory. The company's status as a top-ranked clean energy provider by Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) further solidifies its competitive edge in a market where ESG credentials are increasingly tied to corporate value.

Investment Implications: A “Buy” in the Long Game

For long-term investors, AES offers a rare combination of near-term visibility and structural growth. The data center-driven energy boom is not a fad but a structural shift, and AES's PPA backlog and project pipeline provide a clear runway. With renewables accounting for 25% of U.S. electricity generation in 2025 (per EIA), and AES's renewables SBU growing at 56% annually, the company is well-positioned to outperform peers in both earnings and ESG metrics.

However, risks remain. Regulatory delays in rate cases, supply chain bottlenecks, and the intermittency of solar/wind could pressure margins. Yet, AES's advanced construction capabilities and diversified portfolio mitigate these risks. The company's joint venture in green hydrogen also positions it to benefit from the next phase of decarbonization, where hydrogen could replace fossil fuels in heavy industry and transport.

Conclusion: A Clean Energy Leader in the AI Age

AES's Q2 2025 results are more than a quarterly beat—they are a masterclass in strategic foresight. By aligning its renewable expansion with the data center industry's energy demands, the company is not only securing its financial future but also contributing to a global energy transition. For shareholders, this translates to a durable moat: recurring revenue from high-credit-quality clients, a disciplined capital structure, and a leadership position in a sector expected to grow at 5–7% annually through 2027.

As AI reshapes the economy, AES's ability to power the digital future with clean, reliable energy makes it a compelling long-term investment. Investors who recognize the intersection of technology, energy, and sustainability will find AES to be a cornerstone of their portfolios.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 19:02:29.215345

Picking Graham County But first, the abandoned Stanley plant needs major renovations — to the tune of $21 million.
Graham County once had more than 1,100 manufacturing jobs across four factories and a sawmill.
Many of the manufacturing jobs that left Graham County — and Western North Carolina more broadly — went to China as companies chased cheaper labor.","When Shaun Adams was laid off by Stanley Furniture in 2014, he was beyond frustrated. Not only was he losing his job at the furniture manufacturing plant, but Graham County was losing its largest employer and last major manufacturer.

In the year after Stanley left, the unemployment rate in Graham County rose to the highest across North Carolina. Adams’ frustration grew as he saw the Robbinsville facility lay almost entirely vacant for more than a decade. Why weren’t town and county officials courting another company to use the factory space and create more jobs?

Adams ran for mayor, determined to bring manufacturing jobs back to Robbinsville. He won the office in 2021.

Last week, he got his wish: the Chinese biodegradable paperware company EcoKing announced an $80 million investment to reopen the same shuttered facility, promising 515 jobs in one of North Carolina's most economically distressed counties.

“We have lost so much population over the years because of factories closing and our low median income,” Adams told Carolina Public Press. “This means a lot of people will get to come home.”

EcoKing manufactures for fast food restaurants like Chipotle, Chick-Fil-A, and Panda Express. When the Robbinsville facility comes online in 2026, it will be the biggest employer in Graham County, providing an average wage of $46,700, nearly double the median individual income in the county.

Picking Graham County

But first, the abandoned Stanley plant needs major renovations — to the tune of $21 million.

“If you walked through the plant with me, you would say they ought to do a series of The Walking Dead here, because it just looked abandoned and neglected,” Robin Sargent, owner of Old Town Brokers, a firm that helped orchestrate the sale of the plant.

“At one time, it was a vibrant place, but holy cow, someone just let it go to hell. Taking the pictures was like getting it ready for a dating site. It takes a special person to be able to have a vision for a space like that.”

The facility needs major HVAC, plumbing and electrical work. But EcoKing wasn’t scared off by the state of the plant.

Partially they were wowed by Graham County’s natural beauty. Partially they were swayed because of the cheap, abundant power supply in the area.

The deciding factor, however, was incentives: between the town, the county and the state, EcoKing was offered $12 million over five years to pick Graham County instead of a site in the other Southern states they were eyeing.

EcoKing’s customers — those big name fast food restaurants — wanted paperware products made domestically. With the tariffs coming down from Washington, the company had to act quickly.

“The tariff is high,” John Lin, EcoKing’s representative for this project, told CPP. “And 80% of our customers are here in the United States. So is most of our raw material. That taught us to make a decision: we’re going to land right here, and be Made in the USA.”

Economic lifeline

The EcoKing investment is a lifeline for this Western corner of the state. Graham County once had more than 1,100 manufacturing jobs across four factories and a sawmill. Now all of that is gone.

After Stanley Furniture was the last to leave, a company called Oak Valley Hardwood occupied a small corner of the same building starting in 2016, but left when COVID hit. Other than that blip, hardly any economic investment has come to the area.

“For decades we struggled with the closing of textile plants and furniture plants and the tobacco industry being more or less sunset,” Sargent said.

“This area has just been hammered in a way that is not well understood — 500 jobs is a big deal here. This is a really great story of how we were able to capture the interest of an Asian company to launch a big investment in their industry here.”

There's a certain economic irony to EcoKing's investment. Many of the manufacturing jobs that left Graham County — and Western North Carolina more broadly — went to China as companies chased cheaper labor. Now, a Chinese company is bringing manufacturing back to the exact same building where American workers once made furniture.

EcoKing will use the same pulp supplier that served the Pactiv paper plant in Canton, whose 2023 closure resulted in the loss of 1,200 jobs and a lawsuit from former attorney general and current governor Josh Stein.

Bringing back Graham County workforce

The one downside of US manufacturing is the cost of labor, Lin said. In China, the company can get away with much lower wages. EcoKing plans to use some automated manufacturing to offset this inflated cost.

But still, the plant will need 515 workers. In one of the state’s smallest counties, that won’t happen overnight — it will require coordinated workforce development.

Hiring is projected to happen in two phases. The first phase will take place over the next three to five years, and create about 300 jobs. The second, on a longer timeline, will bring on 215 more. The company is partnering with Tri-County Community College and Western Carolina University for workforce development.

“We’re going to take a slow-burn approach,” Josh Carpenter, director of economic development group Mountain West Partnership, told CPP. “That’s what we did with Harrah’s Cherokee Casino: built a workforce of 900 to 1,200 over the years.”

Construction crews are already at work on the $21 million restoration.

However, unlocking this potential depends not only on technology and resources, but on overcoming structural investment and regulatory barriers.

This column outlines the key legal and financial risks that hinder hydrogen deployment in Ukraine — from high capital costs and geopolitical uncertainty to the lack of dedicated hydrogen legislation. It also explores scalable solutions: international guarantees, green PPA frameworks, strategic zones and legal recognition of hydrogen as a national priority for energy security and export.

Following the 2024 energy crisis, triggered by targeted attacks on Ukraine’s critical infrastructure, hydrogen has shifted from a long-term ambition to an immediate strategic necessity. Amid Europe’s accelerated decarbonisation, Ukraine now has a window of opportunity to position itself as a key hydrogen supplier to the EU — if it can overcome its legal, financial, and institutional barriers.

Enormous technical potential

Ukraine holds one of the largest technical potentials for green hydrogen production in Europe. According to various estimates, renewable energy potential reaches 1,300–2,300 terawatt-hour (TWh)/year — enough to produce up to 38 million tonnes of hydrogen. The country’s gas transmission network could carry up to 33 million tonnes of hydrogen, with export routes through Slovakia into Germany.

Projects with a combined production of over 600,000 tonnes/year are already in development, including 100 megawatts (MW) pilot plants in Reni and Zakarpattia. By 2030, the plan is to install up to 10 gigawatts (GW) of electrolysers — requiring 85–90 billion euros in investment and creating up to 100,000 jobs. The domestic hydrogen economy could generate up to 22 billion dollars in annual revenue.

Legal and investment barriers

Despite this promise, Ukraine’s hydrogen market faces five major challenges that stall investment and industrial-scale deployment. These barriers are legal as much as economic, and must be addressed to make hydrogen financeable and scalable.

1. High Cost of Capital (WACC)

In 2024, Ukraine’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) reached 15–20 per cent, double that of most EU countries. This results in a levelised cost of hydrogen (LCOH) between 5.1 and 8 dollars per kilogram — well above the 4 dollars per kilogram threshold expected by EU off-takers. Without state subsidies or concessional financing, Ukrainian hydrogen remains uncompetitive. Legal mechanisms for capital expenditures (CAPEX) recovery and investment guarantees are urgently needed.

2. Geopolitical and security risk

War-related instability remains a major deterrent to capital, particularly in southern and eastern regions. Political risk insurance, military force majeure clauses, and de-risking instruments from institutions like MIGA (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency) or KfW (German state development bank) are essential to make Ukrainian projects viable in high-risk zones.

3. Legal vacuum

As of mid-2025, Ukraine still lacks a dedicated Hydrogen Law. Key regulatory gaps include:

Certification of hydrogen origin;

Buyer and supplier obligations;

Grid access and tariff methodology;

Export and import conditions.

This legal uncertainty prevents long-term offtake agreements (PPAs), delays project bankability and increases transaction risks.

4. Institutional fragmentation

Ukraine has yet to develop a state procurement system for hydrogen, align with EU certification systems (such as RED II or CertifHy), or establish balancing mechanisms for hydrogen demand and supply. The absence of a dedicated hydrogen regulator contributes to administrative fragmentation and policy unpredictability — further deterring investment.

5. Macro pressure and talent shortages

With inflation exceeding 26 per cent and the country operating under martial law, macroeconomic risks complicate project planning. Moreover, Ukraine faces a shortage of qualified energy lawyers, engineers and policy specialists — even in safer regions. Effective project delivery will depend on targeted support for capacity building and legal-financial architecture.

Solutions: What will reduce investor risk?

Several mechanisms could help lower entry barriers and unlock hydrogen investment in Ukraine: support from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) such as KfW, EBRD, and EIB will be decisive.

Key instruments include:

Concessional lending (lower rates, longer tenors);

Partial risk guarantees;

Political risk insurance;

R&D and feasibility-study grants.

These tools can significantly lower WACC and improve project bankability from the pre-development stage.

Competitive tendered PPAs

Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) awarded through state or municipal tenders can:

Ensure minimum investor returns over 10–15 years;

Guarantee offtake volumes and tariffs;

Include foreign exchange protection and force majeure clauses.

Such frameworks can anchor project finance and attract cross-border developers.

Hydrogen Investment Zones

Special Economic Zones (SEZs) or hydrogen investment parks could:

Offer tax exemptions (VAT, profit tax, customs duties);

Simplify permitting and customs procedures;

Establish dedicated rules for hydrogen certification and trade.

These zones could align with regional recovery plans and build on successful SEZ (Special Economic Zone) models in Poland and Romania.

Legal recognition of hydrogen as a strategic resource

Officially designating hydrogen as a “strategic energy resource” in national law could:

Enable fast-track permitting;

Guarantee network access;

Unlock sovereign support tools;

Allow concessional loans from national development banks.

This measure should be included in the forthcoming Hydrogen Law, currently under review.

War risk insurance via MIGA

For projects in risk-prone areas like Odesa, political risk insurance from MIGA — the World Bank’s investment guarantee agency — could protect against:

Expropriation;

Currency inconvertibility;

Contract interference;

War-related disruptions.

MIGA is already supporting renewable projects in Ukraine, offering a proven model that can extend to hydrogen.

Regional investment cases

Strategic hydrogen projects are already forming in key regions:

Odesa Hydrogen Hub (Reni): 100 MW plant with port access and Black Sea export potential.

Zakarpattia Cluster: Secure region close to EU networks, ideal for integration and scale-up.

Ivano-Frankivsk, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskyi: High solar potential and proactive local governance.

Lviv Region: Geological potential for underground hydrogen storage — critical for seasonal balancing.

Conclusion: The Case for Early Movers

Hydrogen is more than an emergency response — it is Ukraine’s opportunity to lead in Europe’s next energy market. To seize this chance, businesses must begin preparing now: by understanding fiscal incentives, forming consortia with municipalities and EU partners, and engaging in legislative advocacy.

Ukraine’s hydrogen economy is not yet ready — but the groundwork is being laid. Those who move early will shape the rules and reap the long-term returns.",https://ceenergynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/hydrogen-6362274_1280.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 18:01:58.680459

An EV adapter isn’t an overpriced extension cord.","Certified adapters often cost $200-$250.

Using the wrong adapter could damage your vehicle and the charger.

Electric vehicle owners, beware: Buying a cheap, unapproved converter to connect your EV to a Tesla DC fast charger — or connect your Tesla to the more common CCS charger — could damage your vehicle.

Experts agree the best course is to use the adapter your vehicle’s manufacture recommends. They typically cost $200 or more. You can find adapters for under $100 on Amazon, but cheap, off-brand devices could be less efficient and not as reliable.

Worst case, it might damage your vehicle and void the warranty.

“If an adapter overheats, it can melt and damage the inlet on your vehicle and the charger,” said Ted Bohn, the engineer at Argonne National Laboratory who chaired the public-private committee that created the safety standard for adapters you can rely on.

A melted adapter could essentially weld your vehicle’s inlet port to the charging cable, rendering both inoperative.

High voltage, high stakes

DC fast chargers are complicated devices that carry high electric voltages. They connect a big expensive vehicle to a charging kiosk that almost certainly costs more than the vehicle.

What could go wrong?

Plenty, and a faulty adapter could leave you on the hook for damage to both. The tab can easily run into thousands of dollars

A bad adapter might even expose vehicles and chargers — conceivably, even your home — to cybersecurity threats.

Automaker-approved adapters are available from new car dealers and automakers’ websites and apps.

“It’s important to stick to the adapter your vehicle manufacturer specifies,” Consumer Reports Associate Director of Automotive Testing Gabe Shenhar said. “People who bought cheaper alternatives had problems, including voiding their warranty and the adapter overheating.

“It’s not worth saving a few bucks on something that could damage your vehicle.”

Why do I need an adapter to charge my EV?

EV owners typically use DC fast chargers when they drive long distances or don’t have access to a Level 2 (240 volt) charger to fill their battery overnight or at work. Run by companies like Electrify America, EVgo, Ionna and Charge Point, DC fast chargers — as the name suggests — deliver high levels of power to charge the battery quickly, so the vehicle can get back on the road.

Most EVs use what’s called a CCS, or combined charging system, plug. Teslas have a different plug, called NACS, or North American charging system.

The two are incompatible because Tesla built its DC fast chargers first. It kept the design proprietary, so only Tesla vehicles could charge at its kiosks, which the company calls Super Chargers.

The network of fast, convenient chargers gave Tesla a major sales advantage. Imagine what it would’ve been like in 1910 if Ford owned most of the gas stations in America, and only Fords could fill up at them.

Getting back to the present, it took other automakers a while to catch on, but they eventually agreed on the CCS design. They and independent charging companies built thousands of them around the country.

Now anybody can use Tesla's chargers

Result: A VW or Chevy EV owner couldn’t charge at a Tesla station, and vice versa. On top of that, NACS chargers earned a reputation for being faster and more reliable than CCS.

They were seen as the gold standard.

Today, there are about 17,000 NACS charging stations and something over 18,000 CCS stations in the United States. The numbers are continually increasing, due to EV sales and rising demand. That compares with 145,000 gas stations nationwide. Concern about access to chargers held EV sales back.

Automakers negotiated to get their vehicles access to Tesla’s network.

To solve that, engineers from automakers, charging companies, the U.S. Department of Energy and others created a standard for adapters to connect CCS vehicles to NACS chargers. Doubling the number of places to fast-charge was a boon to automakers, but, initially, owners couldn’t buy an adapter. It still was like trying to plug an English appliance into an American outlet: The plugs didn’t match.

Why did my adapter cost $225?

SAE International, the engineering group that created standards for everything from lubricating oil to how heavy a trailer a vehicle can safely tow, oversaw standards for reliable adapters that work with all vehicles and chargers.

Called J3400/1, the standard specifies performance for charging, durability, use in all kinds of weather and more. They also shut down before damage occurs if something goes wrong and the adapter starts to overheat.

Any adapter stamped UL 2252 has been certified to meet those standards by UL Solutions, the long-standing independent testing group once known as Underwriters Laboratories.

“The requirements outlined in the standard are designed to ensure that an adapter meets safety standards not only when it’s first used but continues to meet them over time — even after typical wear and tear from everyday use,” said UL Solutions engineer Joe Bablo.

An EV adapter isn’t an overpriced extension cord. It’s a sophisticated safety device.

G'head, run a pickup over it

Adapters that meet the standards have been certified to work for years in all weather conditions, endure repeatedly being dropped to the ground and more. A Ford video shows the automaker’s adapter surviving being driven over by an F-150 Lightning full-size electric pickup.

Adapters that don’t meet SAE standard can even present cybersecurity concerns.

Some early adapters had USB ports so they could be updated. The ports left them open to hacking. The standard bans that: Adapters are now like an air-gapped computer, with no data link to the outside world.

“GM designed our adapter to meet the same standards as our vehicles,” GM Energy Chief Operating Officer and Head of Public Charging Bill Hotchkiss said. “We tested it in fleets of vehicles.

“Our chargers are good in all conditions: hot, cold, heavy rain, through thousands of use cycles These are high-voltage connections. We want to make sure our customers are secure.”","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/25/PDTF/85380733007-g-mbrand-app-controls-super-charger-session-2.jpg?crop=9503,5346,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-02 17:02:27.965146

“Treatment as a state significantly increases our capacity to protect and restore the lower Klamath River, which serves as the spiritual, cultural, and ecological foundation of our existence. We extend our sincere gratitude to the US EPA for its formal recognition of our sovereign authority and demonstrated ability to effectively regulate water quality within our homeland,” said Joseph L. James, the Chairman of the Yurok Tribe. “I also want to acknowledge our highly professional environmental and legal teams for completing the rigorous application process.” Based on a 1987 amendment to the Clean Water Act, TAS empowers the Yurok Tribe Environmental Department to assume the same authority as state governments in setting and enforcing environmental standards that apply to tribal lands and waters. The TAS designation enables the department to enforce the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Safe Drinking Water Act as well as other federal environmental laws. It strengthens the Tribe’s ability to improve the health of 44 miles of the Klamath River and several tributaries that flow through the Yurok Reservation. “We now have the authority to determine beneficial uses of water based on our cultural values, environmental priorities, and community needs,” said Yurok Tribe Environmental Department Director Louisa McCovey. “This achievement is the result of a multigenerational effort to regain our sovereign right to govern the natural resources of our homelands.”

The EPA’s approval follows a rigorous review process of the Tribe’s capacity to manage environmental programs at a level equivalent to or better than states.

The Yurok Tribe Environmental Department’s Water Quality Program has continuously conducted water quality monitoring on the Klamath River and its tributaries since 2002. Additionally, the Water Quality Program conducts research on a wide variety of topics related to the Klamath River and its

tributaries, such as nutrient pollution, pathogenic bacteria and macroinvertebrate abundance. The program also performs Tribal Water Quality Certification for federally and state-funded projects that are subject to National Environmental Policy Act or California Environmental Quality Act compliance and have the potential to impact water quality of surface waters within the Yurok Reservation.

The Yurok Tribe Environmental Department is responsible for protecting tribal lands, air and water resources for the benefit of current and future generations of Yurok people. Led by tribal scientists, the department’s three programs include Water, Community and Ecosystems and Pollution Prevention. An expression of tribal sovereignty, the Environmental team employs science, traditional knowledge and thoughtful regulation to protect and enhance fragile ecosystems within Yurok ancestral territory.

[July 30], U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the approval of the Yurok Tribe’s application for “treatment in a similar manner as a state” under the federal Clean Water Act (CWA). With this authority, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California can develop water quality standards for waters within their reservation, similar to states exercising this authority under Sections 303 and 401 of the CWA. EPA’s approval of this application advances the cooperative federalism pillar of EPA’s Great American Comeback initiative by supporting tribal self-governance to protect water quality.

Josh F.W. Cook, EPA’s Pacific Southwest Region Administrator, presented the signed certificate reflecting this authority to the Yurok Tribe at the Regional Tribal Operations Committee meeting in San Francisco.

“We are pleased to recognize – and formalize – the Yurok Tribe’s authority to protect rivers and streams on their tribal lands,” said Cook. “The Yurok will now be able to more directly safeguard their tribal communities and natural resources. The goal of EPA is Indian Self Determination, self-governance, and returning regulatory responsibilities back to the tribes.”

“Treatment as a state significantly increases our capacity to protect and restore the lower Klamath River, which serves as the spiritual, cultural, and ecological foundation of our existence. We extend our sincere gratitude to the U.S. EPA for its formal recognition of our sovereign authority and demonstrated ability to effectively regulate water quality within our homeland,” said Joseph L. James, the Chairman of the Yurok Tribe.

After tribes seeking this “treatment as a state” authority develop water quality standards and gain EPA approval, they directly administer surface water quality standards. EPA’s decision promotes tribal self-government, empowering tribes to issue water quality certifications for actions on their lands requiring federal permits.

There are now 32 tribes in EPA’s Pacific Southwest Region with this authority. With this approval for the Yurok, all Klamath River Basin tribes in the Pacific Southwest, including the Hoopa Valley Tribe, Karuk Tribe, Quartz Valley Indian Reservation, and Pulikla Tribe of Yurok People, have achieved this status.

“The endangerment finding has been the basis for our work at the federal level, and limiting pollution and climate emissions.

“It just fuels my passion,” said Susan Theberge, co-founder of Climate Action Now Western Massachusetts. “We have to work at the state level and at the municipal level, which is where we have power right now. We are holding the line.”

On Tuesday, the EPA published a proposal that revokes the “endangerment finding,” a 2009 decision that defined carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases as harmful to human health. The 16-year-old determination officially classified these gases as air pollution that the agency could regulate under the Clean Air Act. Now, the agency walked back its definition, claiming that air pollution is best defined as “local or regional exposure to dangerous air pollution.”

“It’s really a criminal act in the big picture,” said Andra Rose, president of Local Energy Advocates of Western Mass. “The endangerment finding has been the basis for our work at the federal level, and limiting pollution and climate emissions. It discourages being able to do anything at the federal level.”

Local activists like Theberge interpret the proposal as “gaslighting” their daily experiences with climate change and as part of the Trump administration’s attempts to deny global warming. With the federal government’s stance on climate action clearly communicated, they’re setting their sights on advocating for state climate legislation and combating new fossil fuel projects in Springfield.

“For them to be making these decisions right now when we are in the middle of the heat wave and we see huge amounts of smoke wafting from wildfires in the north, when many people are feeling the climate changes in their homes, when people who have asthma have to go to the hospital emergency room, when people with chronic illness like myself are having complications due to the heat, it’s an insult to us and to humanity itself,” said Naia Tenerowicz, lead organizer of the Springfield Climate Justice Coalition.

The EPA proposal also claims that even if the agency could regulate these emissions, greenhouse gases do not have as large an impact on climate change or human health as previously believed. The statement is based on a non peer-reviewed study published by the Department of Energy’s 2025 Climate Working Group, which finds that U.S. policy has relatively small impacts on combating climate change.

In mid-March, EPA rolled back 31 environmental rules that preserve air and water quality and reduce emissions in what Administrator Lee Zeldin called the “greatest day of deregulation in our nation.” Zeldin wrote that he drove “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion” by weakening regulations on power plants, fossil fuel companies and automobiles.

“I’m appalled, but not surprised, that the Environmental Protection Agency is now declaring that it’s not going to protect the environment,” Greening Greenfield leader Peg Hall said. “Greening Greenfield and other such entities are working on making sure that locally — whether that be Greenfield or Massachusetts — we continue to make progress wherever we can, which is a little more under our control.”

An Associated Press examination, which also used data from the EPA itself, found the rollback of these rules would come with a high cost. These regulations, including setting limits for air pollutants, would have saved at least $275 billion a year and more than 30,000 lives annually in the U.S. At least 10,000 of those deaths were related to air pollution and toxic particulate matter such as lead and mercury.

Springfield, the city with the fourth-highest asthma rates in the country, knows that state climate policy can improve quality of life for residents. In an effort to prevent further smog and smoke in the city, the Springfield Climate Justice Coalition is fighting two projects that would expand greenhouse gas emissions in the city: a wood-burning power plant that will burn up to 1,200 tons of wood a day, and an Eversource natural gas pipeline that extends from Longmeadow into Springfield.

Tenerowicz and Rose said they decided to focus on these two projects because the permitting and approvals are at the state and local levels. The elimination of the endangerment finding sent Tenerowicz a clear message that the federal government is “writing off people’s lives as acceptable sacrifice for the economy,” but she said Gov. Maura Healey’s administration continues to move forward with the green transition.

“Right now, we have to do everything we possibly can, and even more than we think we can do, at the municipal and state levels to move swiftly and rapidly to a just energy transition,” Theberge said.

Just before an Eversource open house and listening session on Aug. 7, Climate Action Now Western Massachusetts and the Springfield Climate Justice Coalition will hold a demonstration and letter-writing campaign at 5:15 p.m. in Stearns Square. The organizations are also focusing on state bills H.3547/S.2290 to block further large-scale natural gas infrastructure in environmental justice areas and accelerate the transition to clean, non-combusting heating systems.

In a column in the Daily Hampshire Gazette last week, Darcy Dumont, a former Amherst town councilor and sponsor of legislation creating the town’s Energy and Climate Action Committee, urges residents to support two other pieces of climate action legislation. The Climate Bank Bill would establish an independent bank that finances decarbonization efforts, renewable energy infrastructure and green manufacturing development. The Make Polluters Pay Bill would fine fossil fuel companies for the environmental and health impacts of emissions and leverage the funds into climate adaptation and mitigation projects.

“The one thing that we have on our side is the enormous power of people coming together. This country cannot operate unless we are all cooperative with it,” Theberge said. “The escalation of the climate disaster should give us more energy and passion to stand together. Life on this planet is at stake.”

The quest for more power to meet rising demand from electric vehicles and data centres running artificial intelligence technology has led to an apparent “renaissance” of nuclear energy.

The White House recently posted an op-ed piece exalting U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive orders for reinvigorating America’s nuclear power generation using that just that term, while effusively lauding his agenda to increase the nation’s output by 300 gigawatts by 2050.

That’s enough to power about 300 million homes or, more likely, thousands of data centres for AI, as well as millions of EVs.

Climate change commitments may not be high on the U.S. president’s mind, but it is on China’s list, as it seeks to add as much as 400 GW more from atomic energy by 2050 while aiming to decarbonize its economy.

It’s arguably off a faster start with 119 GW of nuclear power generation in construction or development. India is next in activity with 32 GW potentially under development. The United States is much further behind at eight GW, even trailing nations like France and Poland.

Actual activity and planned growth suggests trillions of dollars being invested in nuclear energy over the coming decades — and investors are intrigued.

“The ducks are coming in a row, finally,” says Scott Clayton, Toronto-based senior analyst for the Canadian Wealth Advisor with the TSI Network in Toronto.

The last time nuclear energy was on an upswing with investors was in the 2000s as oil prices surged. Then, the Fukushima plant disaster in Japan in 2011 put the brakes on nuclear power.

Companies like Cameco Corp. — based in Saskatoon and the world’s largest uranium producer — saw growth put on ice.

That is until recently. Today, Cameco’s share price, fuelled largely by all the talk of plans for new reactors, is at all-time highs.

Although Canada may be an oil and gas powerhouse, its potential as a supplier of the fuel for nuclear energy has arguably more upside. It has the third largest discovered reserves in the world. It is also the second-largest producer behind Kazakhstan and potentially much more production is coming, as exploration companies like NexGen Energy and Paladin Energy look to develop mines in the Athabasca Basin (home to the highest-grade deposits of uranium in the world).

Yet before jumping into a surging industry, driven by the future promise of much more nuclear power (not to mention the unnerving revival of the nuclear arms race), let’s splash a bit of cold water on the overheating rods of speculation.

“It still faces challenges,” Clayton says.

Among them are regulatory concerns. Mining projects in Canada take a notoriously long time to be approved and uranium is particularly tricky, given its environmental impact.

Power plants are equally complicated. The public might appreciate the cheap, abundant power, just don’t generate it close to where they live.

“The other problem is that the costs (of construction) are just astronomical,” Clayton says.

The newest nuclear power generating station in the U.S, for example — two reactors at Plant Vogtle in Georgia — cost US$35 billion and were behind schedule and over budget.

“We definitely think it’s (nuclear energy) going to be needed,” says Andrew Bischof, senior equity analyst at Morningstar in Chicago.

Yet many projects are far from construction, let alone completion, and a history exists of projects being cancelled, especially in the U.S.

Bischof says many major utility companies are talking about amping up nuclear power, but those are far-away ambitions, part of five- and 10-year plans to build capacity, which could take several more years before that power is added to the grid.

There does seem to be more buzz around small modular reactors, he adds. These are scaled-down power plants that take less time to build, but it’s an emerging technology.

To that end, Canada is a leader with a project underway in Darlington, Ont.

“Duke Energy has also mildly stated that it’s exploring SMRs, but again, that is 2030 to 2035 for a time frame,” Bischof says about the U.S. power provider, which presently has six nuclear power plants in the U.S..

Notably, big tech — Microsoft, Meta and Alphabet (Google) — are considering or currently entering into contracts with power providers, providing cash up front to restart or build new nuclear capacity, often involving small reactors, to meet climate change goals and growing energy-hungry AI capabilities.

The need is substantial. AI is forecast to eat up 20 per cent of new energy growth through 2030. EV expansion is expected to increase demand by 15 per cent.

Whether all this growth translates into future profits remains to be seen.

In the meantime, investors might consider risk-adjusted exposure.

“If you’re looking to invest in more speculative areas, it’s best to get exposure through stocks that already have a solid business,” Clayton says. He points to U.S.-based Constellation Energy Corp. as one viable choice. Nearly 70 per cent of its output is nuclear and it pays a small dividend (0.47 per cent yield).

Another way to invest in this theme is exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Investors have close to a handful of choices. One of the longest running is VanEck Uranium and Nuclear ETF, launched in 2007. It has seen renewed popularity, after peaking in price around 2011.

“(Its) recent asset growth mirrors a broader nuclear renaissance fueled by surging electricity demand, the global pursuit of dependable low carbon power and fresh policy support extending plant life and financing next generation reactors,” says Brandon Rakszawski, director of product management, VanEck in New York.

Its portfolio also holds the aforementioned stocks with Constellation and Cameco among the largest positions.

While the stars might be aligning for nuclear, conditions quickly change — i.e. battery power for renewables — that could make a long-term investment in nuclear suddenly less ideal.

Still, for investors with an appetite for risk and a long time horizon, the nuclear option could power long-term profitability.

E-Cite Motors Group (OTCID:VAPR), an emerging electric vehicle manufacturer, today announced that its stock has dramatically outperformed major electric automakers over the past week and year-to-date. E-Cite's share price closed at $0.0112 on Friday, August 1, up roughly 12% from Monday's $0.0100 opening price. This weekly gain stands in stark contrast to declines in leading EV stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) during the same period. Tesla's stock fell from about $325 on July 28 to $303 by Aug. 1 (approximately, 7% change), while Rivian slipped roughly, 8% (from $13.78 to $12.60), and Lucid dropped roughly, 12% (from $2.79 to $2.46) over the week.

Year-to-date, E-Cite's momentum is even more pronounced. Since January 1, 2025, VAPR shares have nearly doubled in value, rising from around $0.0057 at the start of the year to $0.0112 today (an increase on the order of +96%). In comparison, many EV peers have struggled: Tesla stock is down about 24% for 2025 (opening the year near $379 and recently trading around $308), Lucid has declined roughly 18% YTD, and Rivian remains roughly flat with a modest ~3% dip year-to-date These figures underscore that E-Cite (VAPR) has delivered industry-leading returns for investors so far this year, outpacing even the largest EV manufacturers in percentage gains.

""This exceptional stock performance reflects the unique advantages and progress E-Cite has achieved,"" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of E-Cite Motors. ""We benefit from a special low-volume manufacturing exemption that lets us bring vehicles to market faster and more efficiently than traditional automakers, and our recent technological and strategic milestones are resonating with investors.""

E-Cite operates under the U.S. Low Volume Manufacturers Act, giving it a government exemption from certain costly certification requirements that burden traditional OEMs. Notably, E-Cite's vehicles are produced under a low-volume manufacturing exemption, allowing the company to bypass extensive crash-testing delays and expenses while still meeting all safety and regulatory standards. This streamlines development and approval, enabling E-Cite to deploy new models faster and more efficiently than any traditional OEM, a significant competitive edge that investors recognize. By accelerating time-to-market for its electric vehicles, E-Cite can capitalize on market opportunities more quickly than legacy manufacturers encumbered by bureaucracy.

Recent product breakthroughs and strategic initiatives from E-Cite Motors have further bolstered market confidence. Earlier this month, the company unleashed a next-generation electric driveline for its upcoming American sports cars, doubling performance metrics and setting new benchmarks. The newly unveiled Zero Emissions electric motor spins up to 26,000 RPM (in performance trim), an astonishing leap from the previous 12,000 RPM, and delivers a face-melting 4,000 Nm of torque. This advanced powertrain, paired with dual high-density 90 kWh battery packs, will power E-Cite's EV-GT, EV-C3, and EV-DT models, all built on a common modular aluminum chassis.

""The new motor's RPM increase from 12k to 26k is a game-changer,"" CEO Henthorn noted, emphasizing that it enables blistering acceleration and higher top speeds in a compact, lightweight package.""

Legendary designer Gene Langmesser, E-Cite's COO, added that ""the company's revolutionary chassis was engineered for adaptability, allowing rapid integration of such upgrades across models and giving E-Cite agility that legacy OEMs can't match.""

In addition to cutting-edge technology, E-Cite is leveraging iconic designs to capture the imagination of enthusiasts. This July, the company announced it has secured the design and production rights to the famed 1954 Kaiser-Darrin sports car, an American classic renowned for its elegant lines and distinctive ""pocket"" doors that slide into the fenders. E-Cite will resurrect this legend as the all-electric EV-DT ""Dutch Touch"" model, preserving the Kaiser-Darrin's timeless styling (including the signature sliding doors) while infusing it with state-of-the-art electric performance.

""The Kaiser-Darrin is not just a car, it's rolling sculpture,"" said Gene Langmesser, the vehicle's revival designer and E-Cite's COO, calling the opportunity to modernize it with electric power ""a dream come true"". The EV-DT will share E-Cite's proprietary chassis and driveline with the brand's other models, ensuring that beneath the retro bodywork lies the full might of E-Cite's latest EV technology.

E-Cite's ambition extends to redefining the electric pickup truck segment as well. In June, the company revealed details of its upcoming RJ9 electric pickup, which boasts an unprecedented 900+ mile total range - the highest of any production pickup in the world, whether electric or gasoline. This extraordinary range is achieved via an extended-range EV (EREV) system pairing a 40-kWh battery with a small onboard generator, giving approximately 140 miles of pure electric driving plus hundreds more on generator power. The RJ9's specs are game-changing: 0-60 mph in under 5 seconds, dual-motor AWD, and rapid DC fast-charging (20% to 80% in just 26 minutes). Equally impressive are its luxury features, from zero-gravity massage seats to panoramic displays, which elevate it to an unrivaled level of comfort and tech in the truck category. E-Cite openly touts that the RJ9 will surpass Tesla's Cybertruck, Rivian's R1T, and Ford's F-150 Lightning not only in driving range but in premium appointments, ""raising the bar for the entire truck industry"". Crucially, the RJ9 will also take advantage of E-Cite's low-volume exemption, allowing the company to bring this advanced truck to market swiftly while meeting all safety requirements.

Beyond vehicle development, E-Cite Motors has made strong commitments to American manufacturing that position it favorably amid shifting economic winds. The company recently announced a strategic initiative to dramatically increase its U.S.-based production and sourcing. Key components for E-Cite's vehicles, including body panels, lighting systems, wheels, battery enclosures, chassis assemblies, and even advanced glass, will be sourced from domestic suppliers going forward. This reshoring effort, driven by rising import tariffs and growing consumer demand for American-made EVs, is expected to optimize E-Cite's supply chain, shorten delivery timelines, and enhance production flexibility. E-Cite is currently in the final stages of site selection for expanded U.S. assembly plants, narrowing down locations and finalizing plans for new assembly operations to be announced later this quarter. ""As the economic environment in the U.S. becomes more conducive to advanced manufacturing, E-Cite is proud to bring more of our production home,"" Henthorn said, underscoring that investing in American jobs and infrastructure is a win-win for the company and its customers. ""By expanding domestic manufacturing, E-Cite aims to further differentiate itself from competitors while ensuring capacity to meet the anticipated demand for its vehicles.""

It confirmed that increasing solar generation by 15% in the northern country could lead to an annual reduction of 8.54 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2).

More solar energy in the United States, less CO2 in the air

The research team demonstrated that the climate benefits of solar energy vary by region, clearly indicating where investments in clean energy generate greater environmental dividends.

“This study is exciting because it uses the power of data science to provide useful information to public policy makers and stakeholders on how to advance CO₂ reduction goals,” explained Francesca Dominici, director of the Harvard Data Science Initiative and lead author of the study.

The advantages of solar energy.

The study was based on the analysis of five years of hourly data (since July 2018) on electric generation, demand, and emissions, covering 13 energy regions in the country: California, Texas, Florida, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Carolinas, New York, New England, Southeast, Southwest, Tennessee, Central region, and the Northwest.

Through an advanced statistical model, it was possible to quantify for the first time the reduction in both immediate and deferred emissions resulting from the increase in solar generation:

In California, a 15% increase in solar energy at noon resulted in a reduction of 147.18 metric tons of CO2 in the first hour; and 16.08 metric tons eight hours later.

This type of impact also benefits neighboring regions. For example, the same capacity increase in California generated daily reductions of 913 tons in the Northwest and 1942 metric tons in the Southwest.

Solar energy is still a minority compared to fossil fuels

According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, 60% of the electricity generated in the country came from fossil fuels, while only 3.9% came from solar energy.

Solar energy is still a minority.

This reality positions the expansion of renewable sources as a key tool not only to reduce CO2 emissions but also to improve public health. It reduces exposure to atmospheric pollutants such as fine particles (PM2.5), associated with diseases, hospitalizations, and premature deaths.

Where solar energy performs best

The results indicate that areas like California, Florida, Texas, the Mid-Atlantic, the Southwest, and the Midwest would achieve significant climate benefits, even with modest increases in solar generation.",https://noticiasambientales.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/energia-solar-1024x681.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 18:03:18.316501

The Bigger Picture Florida's solar story is emblematic of a broader shift in U.S. energy markets.
For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Florida's solar surge is not a flash in the pan but a strategic inflection point.","In the shadow of Texas's sprawling wind farms and California's solar sprawl, Florida has quietly emerged as a critical player in the U.S. renewable energy transition. By Q1 2025, the state added over 3 gigawatts of new utility-scale solar capacity, with Florida Power & Light (FPL) accounting for 70% of these installations. This growth has positioned Florida as the second-largest utility-scale solar market in the U.S., trailing only Texas, and third in total solar installations, with 20,065 megawatts of capacity now powering over 2.35 million homes. The state's solar boom is not just a story of scale—it's a masterclass in policy alignment, corporate demand, and economic pragmatism.

The Drivers of Florida's Solar Momentum

Florida's solar surge is fueled by three pillars: abundant natural resources, streamlined policy, and corporate demand. The state's average of 5.5 peak sun hours daily makes it one of the sunniest in the nation, while its levelized cost of utility-scale solar ($25/MWh) now outcompetes fossil fuels even without subsidies. Meanwhile, tech giants like Meta, Amazon, and Verizon have secured large-scale solar contracts, driven by ESG mandates and rising grid electricity costs. These corporations are not just passive buyers—they are reshaping the energy landscape by demanding long-term reliability and price stability.

Policy, however, remains a double-edged sword. The recent One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA), enacted in July 2025, has introduced a “use-it-or-lose-it” scenario for developers. The bill phases out the federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) from 30% to 80% by 2029 and eliminates it by 2032, forcing developers to accelerate permitting and construction. While this creates short-term urgency, it also risks destabilizing the market for smaller firms lacking capital to meet aggressive deadlines.

Strategic Opportunities for Investors

Despite these challenges, Florida's solar market presents a unique set of opportunities for investors who can navigate its complexities.

Tax Credit Arbitrage: Developers with projects in pre-construction phases can still lock in the 30% ITC by starting construction by July 2026. This creates a narrow but lucrative window for investors to capitalize on tax equity financing before incentives erode.

Grid Infrastructure and Storage: As solar penetration grows, grid modernization becomes critical. FPL's $300 million investment in battery storage by 2026 underscores the need for resilient infrastructure. Investors in smart inverters, grid software, and battery systems stand to benefit from this trend.

Microgrid Partnerships: Advanced Green Technologies (AGT) is pioneering microgrid projects across Florida, integrating solar, storage, and AI-driven energy management for industrial clients. These systems offer energy independence and are projected to grow at a 18.2% CAGR through 2030.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies

The primary risks—policy volatility and supply chain constraints—require careful hedging. The OBBBA's rapid ITC phase-out could stifle long-term growth if not amended, while tariffs on Chinese solar modules (30%) have inflated equipment costs by 15–20%. Smaller projects with thin margins are particularly vulnerable.

Investors should prioritize diversification: pairing Florida solar projects with storage or grid infrastructure in states with stable policies (e.g., Texas or Georgia). Timing is also critical—focusing on projects that can secure the 2026 ITC deadline while building buffers for potential regulatory shifts.

The Bigger Picture

Florida's solar story is emblematic of a broader shift in U.S. energy markets. Unlike states with renewable portfolio standards, Florida's growth has been driven by utility innovation and corporate demand. This model—where private sector needs align with economic incentives—offers a blueprint for scaling renewables in markets resistant to top-down mandates.

For investors, the key takeaway is clear: Florida's solar surge is not a flash in the pan but a strategic inflection point. The state's abundant sunlight, corporate partnerships, and utility investments create a compelling case for clean energy infrastructure. However, the window for tax-advantaged projects is closing rapidly. Those who act now—while hedging against policy risks—will be well-positioned to capitalize on a market that is reshaping the future of American energy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 17:02:43.465110

WEAs were initially established to identify offshore locations suitable for wind energy development.
Offshore wind means energy production without the carbon emissions that make storms stronger, flooding worse, and economic disruptions to local economies more severe.
“A great move by the Trump administration which will protect coastal communities and taxpayers from risky, foreign-controlled projects,” said Maryland Rep. Andy Harris.","WASHINGTON—The U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced this week that it is rescinding all designated Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), an action that will de-designate over 3.5 million acres of federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development.

The decision was made in accordance with a Secretarial Order and a Presidential Memorandum, which aim to end what the Trump administration calls “preferential treatment for unreliable, foreign controlled energy sources.”

The de-designated areas span the Gulf of America, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon and the Central Atlantic.

WEAs were initially established to identify offshore locations suitable for wind energy development. The rescission effectively ends the federal practice of designating large swaths of the OCS for speculative wind development.

The move follows Secretary’s Order 3437, titled “Ending Preferential Treatment for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources in Department Decision-Making,” and a Presidential Memorandum from Jan. 20, 2025, which called for a “Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the OCS from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects.”

Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul G. Pinsky on Friday issued the following statement in response to BOEM’s announcement:

“The Trump administration’s latest attack on renewable energy is an insult to America’s economy, energy independence, and the public’s common sense. Offshore wind means good jobs in places that need them. Offshore wind means energy production without the carbon emissions that make storms stronger, flooding worse, and economic disruptions to local economies more severe. And offshore wind means expanded clean energy production for a state, regional grid and country that all need more reliable energy in a bad way.

“More disappointing than its failure of leadership toward more responsible energy is this administration’s tendency to try to use energy policy to change the narrative away from less-then-desirable headlines. The people of Maryland – and beyond – simply deserve a better national energy policy than one based on needless distraction when the news cycle suits. I look forward to continuing to work to move forward the thoroughly studied, much needed, and economically beneficial offshore wind projects slated for Maryland.”

Other local elected officials, however, are applauding the decision.

Community solar power is one of my favorite cleantech solutions. It’s helpful in multiple ways, and can often play that “Goldilocks” role of being “just right” — not too big, and not too small. It enables more solar power for more individuals, and benefits from certain economies of scale to bring down costs — maybe not as much as gigawatt-level utility-scale solar projects, but more than home rooftop solar projects.

What you don’t often see is community solar projects and corporate commercial solar projects. However, that seems to be what giant global logistics real estate company Prologis is working on. The company is getting a series of large rooftop solar installations and deploying them as community solar projects.

The first community solar rooftop project was launched this week in Franklin Park, Illinois. It is the first of what are expected to be 45 such solar projects totaling 82 megawatts (MW). For some more perspective, while community solar is getting quite big in Illinois (and some other states), there are currently just around 200 community solar projects in the Land of Lincoln. Adding 45 more is a huge increase for the sector.

“More than half of the energy credits will be directed to income-qualified households, expanding access to clean energy in underserved communities in the Chicago area and beyond,” a press release states.

The project was launched by Prologis alongside ComEd, the region’s utility company. “We’re proud to join ComEd to officially launch this project, the first of many community solar projects that our energy team is deploying across our Illinois rooftops,” said Carter Andrus, Prologis’ Chief Operating Officer. “Illinois is one of the fastest-growing solar markets in the country, and we’re excited to help lead its momentum. For us, this is about more than solar panels—it’s about using our scale to make a real difference in the communities where we operate and bring the benefits of clean energy to more people across Illinois.”

Indeed. We love cleantech because it cuts CO2 emissions and other pollution, but when it is also used to help socioeconomic issues and inequity, it’s extra heartwarming.

“As we continue to support the expansion of solar across northern Illinois, new and planned Prologis rooftop solar sites promise to provide northern Illinois customers additional options for lowering their energy costs via renewable energy connected to the grid,” said Gil Quiniones, President and CEO of ComEd. “With dozens of additional projects in the pipeline, we are seeing the effect of the pro-solar incentives put in place by Gov. JB Pritzker’s administration and how they support a cleaner, more equitable energy future in our state.”

“Illinois policymakers have worked hard on policy that encourages businesses like Prologis to grow and our energy sector to expand, especially in renewable energy,” said Illinois House Majority Leader Robyn Gabel, 18th District. “It’s exciting to see the fruits of CEJA, one of the most expansive energy bills in the country come to fruition with vital initiatives like this one, reinforcing Illinois’ leadership in community solar.”

“I’m happy to stand with ComEd and Prologis as we celebrate the launch of this community solar project right here in Franklin Park,” said State Representative Norma Hernandez, 77th District. “By leveraging underutilized industrial rooftops, we’re not only expanding access to clean, renewable energy—we’re ensuring that working families in our communities can directly benefit from lower utility costs and a more resilient energy grid. This is a smart, community-centered model for how we decarbonize equitably and sustainably. Thank you for your leadership and bringing this to the 77th District.”

Here are some more details on this first rooftop community solar project from Prologis: “SunVest Solar, a national developer and independent power producer, designed the Franklin Park 3 rooftop community solar installation atop a 195,000-square-foot Prologis logistics center. Prologis will own and operate the 1.56 MW community solar project, which will serve mostly residential customers, with the remaining community solar credits benefiting local businesses.”

Lastly, here’s a bit more on community solar in Illinois and why this is becoming a bigger and bigger sector of the Illinois solar market: “The 2016 Future Energy Jobs Act created Illinois’ community solar program, and the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) made it stronger. Since the passage of CEJA, there has been a 400% increase in connected community solar — 4x the capacity of Community Solar that was installed in 2024 vs. 2023. ComEd expects to have 240 community solar sites on its system by the end of 2025, producing 520MW and powering about 71,000 homes.” I love it! This is the way to go. Kudos to Illinois for taking a lead on this, and now also Prologis for jumping right in. I know it helps Prologis’ bottom line, but it still deserves a pat on the back for the insight, vision, and care.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Prologis-community-solar-roof-Illinois.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 17:01:47.221395

Kia Niro EV Wind Price: starting at $41,045 Power: 201 horsepower Battery capacity: 65 kWh Range: 253 miles Kia Niro EV is closely related to the Hyundai Kona Electric, sharing the same vehicle architecture.","As the auto industry braces for the phasing out of the EV tax credit on September 30, carmakers bet on cheaper models to keep their customers interested. Many have announced new affordable models, with the latest being the upcoming Chevrolet Bolt. The electric crossover will slot beneath the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which is already one of the most affordable battery-powered cars in the US.

Chevrolet is only one of the carmakers trying to fill the void Tesla left in the market when it canceled plans to build the next-generation compact EV. Ford also enters the fray with several compact EVs based on an all-new EV architecture. Unlike other carmakers, Ford outsourced the development to a ""skunkworks team,"" and promised to showcase the results on August 11. Ford is also present on the market with the Mustang Mach-E, which has a very attractive price these days.

Even though it abandoned plans for a compact EV, Tesla still works on a stripped-down variant of the Model Y. By eliminating all the unnecessary features, Tesla promises a much lower price point for its best-selling EV. Whether this will be enough to compensate for the loss of the federal tax credits or will just be a mildly popular trim of the Model Y, we'll find out soon enough. Until then, it's worth remembering that Tesla's cheapest models are also some of the longest-range EVs on the market.

As you can see, carmakers are concerned that customers might shy away from buying an electric vehicle because of the higher price. Their concerns are a boon for buyers of electric vehicles. Many electric cars sold now in the US are quite affordable, and some still have two months of $7,500 tax credit ahead to lure customers. If you're in the market for a new EV, we've compiled a list of the most affordable EVs sold today in the US market.

1. Nissan Leaf S

Price: $28,140

Power: 147 horsepower

Battery capacity: 40 kWh

Range: 149 miles The second-generation Nissan Leaf is in its final model year, with a replacement expected to launch later this year. Until then, Nissan is trying its best to keep sales alive. Not many people want an already obsolete EV, especially when they know something better is just around the corner. This explains why the Nissan Leaf is the most affordable EV in our roundup.

The Nissan Leaf S 40 kWh is probably not the best EV for road trips, considering its 149 miles (240 km) of range, but it could be a decent solution for a short commute. Although the range is unimpressive, the Leaf has an ace up its sleeve: Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) support, making it a smart choice for remote homes.

The Nissan Leaf SV Plus 60 kWh can take you further, up to 212 miles (341 km) on a charge, but the price starts at $36,190, dangerously close to the vastly superior Ariya. It's probably not wise to buy it when much better alternatives exist for less money.

2. Fiat 500e

Price: $32,595

Power: 117 horsepower

Battery capacity: 42 kWh

Range: 162 miles This subcompact car might not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a fashionable EV that can appeal to those looking for a city-friendly vehicle. The price is reasonable, and the 162-mile range is enough for the short trips around town. If this sounds underwhelming, well, the Fiat 500e is not suitable for longer trips anyway.

The Fiat 500e is small, barely providing space for two adults, and you're unlikely to feel safe next to a full-size truck or SUV. The 117-horsepower motor would not impress anyone: the 500e needs 8.5 seconds to reach 60 mph (97 kph) from a standstill.

What it lacks in space and performance, the Fiat 500e tries to compensate for with technology and creature comforts. It has a 10.25-inch center screen with Uconnect 5 services and a 7-inch full digital cluster. The former features Android Automotive OS, the Alexa virtual assistant, as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

3. Chevrolet Equinox EV FWD LT1

Price: $31,995 (with $3,000 discount)

Power: 220 horsepower

Battery capacity: 85 kWh

Range: 319 miles The Chevrolet Equinox EV is probably the best buy in the EV market right now, thanks to its reasonable price and 319-mile range. On top of that, Chevrolet offers a $3,000 discount on the already low $34,995 starting price. The LT2 trim is more expensive, at $43,295, but since it's offered with the same $3,000 discount, it can still make it to this ranking.

Despite the low price, the Equinox EV has an attractive design and practical features. This explains why it has become GM's best-selling EV in recent months. Even the LT1 trim comes equipped with 19-inch aluminum wheels and Google Built-in for the 17.7-inch touchscreen infotainment system. The feature list also includes an 11-inch digital instrument cluster.

The FWD variant is the most affordable and has the highest range, at 319 miles (513 km). An optional AWD variant with a range of 307 miles (494 km) is also offered, starting at $37,295 with the $3,000 discount mentioned above.

4. Ford Mustang Mach-E RWD Select

Price: $34,435 (with $6,250 discount)

Power: 264 horsepower

Battery capacity: 73 kWh

Range: 260 miles Once touted as a Tesla Model Y killer, the Ford Mustang Mach-E has since become the poor man's electric crossover. Thousands lie around at Ford dealerships across the country, which is why you might get a sweet deal if you buy one.

Ford lures customers with a whopping $6,250 discount, turning the Mustang Mach-E into an opportunity. Even at MSRP, the Mustang Mach-E provides plenty of reasons to choose it, although buyers might be better served by other models in that price bracket.

The best quality of the Mustang Mach-E is that it lives up to its name and can be very agile despite weighing more than 4,500 lbs./2,000 kg. Even in the base trim, the electric pony is pretty agile and can do 0-60 in 5.8 seconds. The downside is a more rigid suspension, which affects comfort.

5. Hyundai Kona EV SE

Price: starting at $34,470

Power: 133 horsepower

Battery capacity: 49 kWh

Range: 200 miles Unlike the fancier Hyundai Ioniq 5, the Kona Electric doesn't use the E-GMP architecture. This makes it less efficient and less technologically advanced. The upside is the more affordable price, which puts it in the Top 5 of this roundup. The $32,675 SE trim is rather limited in range, considering you can't go more than 200 miles (322 km) on a charge.

Hyundai claims it developed the Kona as an EV-first and squeezed the combustion engine inside the ICE and hybrid variants of the crossover. However, the design doesn't look optimized for aerodynamic efficiency. On the other hand, the cabin space is great, and Hyundai offers a modern dashboard with plenty of features.

The charging is not its strong point, though, as the Kona Electric needs 45 minutes to charge from 10% to 80% when hooked to a 100-kW DC charging station. That's also the maximum power it supports, so it's not great for road trips. Unlike the E-GMP electric vehicles, the Kona Electric doesn't support bi-directional charging and doesn't have an 800-volt electrical system.

6. Toyota bZ4X XLE

Price: $38,520

Power: 201 horsepower

Battery capacity: 71 kWh

Range: 252 miles Toyota has long been reluctant to embrace electric vehicles. Its first model, the bZ4X crossover, was plagued with issues, although the Japanese carmaker has solved most of them and improved the bZ4X tremendously. For the 2025 model year, Toyota enhanced the charging experience, one of the issues many people complained about.

The 2025 Toyota bZ4X also has an improved thermal management system, offering a better ownership experience in cold climates. Not only that, but the standard equipment has also been upgraded, with the base version XLE getting an 8-way power-adjustable driver's seat and power liftgate for easy access.

Although the bZ4X is spacious and comfortable, it's not particularly practical, missing a glove compartment and a frunk. Charging it at a DC charger also takes longer than many modern EVs. Toyota claims about 30 minutes for a typical 10%-80% charge when charged at a 150-kW+ DC fast charger.

7. Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE SR

Price: starting at $39,095

Power: 149 horsepower

Battery capacity: 53 kWh

Range: 240 miles Hyundai Ioniq 6's design looks bizarre to many people, but it's a direct result of aerodynamic optimizations. The electric sedan boasts an impressive 0.22 drag coefficient, resulting from painstaking fine-tuning in the wind tunnel. This makes it the longest-range EV in Hyundai's lineup, but only when fitted with the extended range battery.

The standard range model, which is also the most affordable, has a smaller battery pack, at 53 kWh. Coupled with the 149-horsepower motor, it can power the Ioniq 6 for up to 240 miles on a charge. It doesn't sound like much, but it's more than most people need during their daily commutes.

The Korean electric sedan offers exciting features like bi-directional charging and an impressive driver-assistance package. Thanks to its 800-volt architecture, the Hyundai Ioniq 6 is one of the fastest-charging EVs on the planet, needing only 18 minutes to go from 10% to 80% when hooked to a 350-kW+ charger.

8. Nissan Ariya FWD Engage

Price: $39,770

Power: 214 horsepower

Battery capacity: 63 kWh

Range: 216 miles Despite being one of the first to launch an electric vehicle (Leaf, in 2010), Nissan has lost steam in the EV market. The second-generation Leaf has not been very successful, and the Ariya crossover seems to share its fate. Nissan Ariya has decent specs, but availability has been an issue due to production constraints.

The Nissan Ariya is roomy and comfortable, making it a decent proposition. Connectivity features and safety assist systems abound, and it doesn't lack comfort features either. Still, the pricing is rather bold, especially when pitted against the Chevrolet Equinox EV, which offers better specs at a lower price.

The affordable trim Engage has an FWD configuration and is powered by a 214-hp electric motor. The battery pack has 63 kWh, which is only enough for 216 miles of range. Charging is limited to 130 kW, which leads to long charging times. Nissan claims 35 minutes are needed to charge the battery from 10% to 80%.

9. Subaru Solterra Premium

Price: starting at $40,390

Power: 215 horsepower

Battery capacity: 73 kWh

Range: 227 miles If the Solterra looks familiar, it's because it's a Toyota bZ4X in disguise. However, unlike the Toyota, it's only available in a dual-motor configuration. Toyota has made some upgrades with the 2025 model year, but Subaru will only offer them with the 2026 model year, which arrives later this year.

The Solterra charges from 10% to 80% in 35 minutes, which is still slower than most EVs. The Japanese EV only supports DC fast charging at up to 100 kW. The AC charging is also limited to 6.6 kW, which means a full charge can take up to 11 hours.

Subaru packs Eye-Sight with supervised hands-free driving up to 25 mph (40 kph) as standard. The Solterra also comes standard with roof rails with a static load capacity rated up to 700 pounds (318 kg). However, the base Premium trim lacks some fancier driver assistance and convenience features in the higher trims.

10. Kia Niro EV Wind

Price: starting at $41,045

Power: 201 horsepower

Battery capacity: 65 kWh

Range: 253 miles Kia Niro EV is closely related to the Hyundai Kona Electric, sharing the same vehicle architecture. However, it sports a larger, 65-kWh battery pack, allowing it to travel up to 253 miles on a charge, significantly more than the Kona EV.

As Kia's entry-level EV, the Niro EV doesn't have a heat pump fitted as standard, so make sure you buy it with the Preserve Package if you're living in a colder region. On the plus side, the equipment is rich, even in the Wind base trim. Goodies include dual 10.25-inch screens for the instrument cluster and infotainment system, an eight-speaker audio system from Harman Kardon, and a bi-tone interior theme for the Wave top trim.

A comprehensive driver-assist package is also standard, making the Niro EV a compelling proposition. Those looking for even more options and an arguably better EV experience should consider the Kia EV6, which starts at $44,395 and is also available as an AWD electric crossover.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/top-10-most-affordable-electric-vehicles-in-the-us-right-before-the-ev-credit-goes-away-255310_1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 15:00:04.215466

In fact, thanks to Trump and Republicans’ attacks on clean energy, utilities have requested $29 billion in electricity rate hikes in the first half of 2025 alone.
According to CNN and Energy Innovation, Republican states, including Missouri, Kentucky and South Carolina, could see 13% to 14% increase in energy costs over the next decade.
Our bill would stop these energy hikes in their tracks and lower costs for working families across the country.
We need more energy in America, not higher prices—and the fastest, cheapest way to get there is clean energy, like solar and wind.","Washington, D.C. – Today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Senate Finance Committee Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR) led Senate Democrats in introducing legislation to reverse the tax hikes on clean energy Republicans passed in their “Big, Ugly Betrayal,” which would raise energy costs for Americans by hundreds of dollars, kill almost a million jobs, and shrink GPD by $1.1 trillion.

Today, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, Ron Wyden (D-OR), led Senate Democrats in introducing the Lowering Electric Bills Act, which would repeal the Trump and Senate Republicans’ extreme energy tax and restore the domestic energy incentives that were on track to keep electricity affordable, create millions of good-paying jobs, and position America as a global leader in fast-growing industries.

Energy Innovation estimates that the Republicans’ tax hikes will cost American families and small businesses over $33 billion over the next ten years. Trump’s extreme budget stripped away support for wind and solar, the most affordable energy sources – which will drive up electricity bills for American small businesses and families by as much as 18% over the next decade. This is not theoretical – it is already happening. In fact, thanks to Trump and Republicans’ attacks on clean energy, utilities have requested $29 billion in electricity rate hikes in the first half of 2025 alone. According to CNN and Energy Innovation, Republican states, including Missouri, Kentucky and South Carolina, could see 13% to 14% increase in energy costs over the next decade. In Missouri and Kentucky, energy costs could increase by $640 and $630 a year, respectively. Additionally, by increasing taxes on solar and wind projects, the Republicans’ “Big, Ugly Betrayal” increased taxes on more than 90% of new electricity projects set to come online in the next five years. Experts predict this will result in the U.S. losing out on 340 gigawatts of power, equivalent to more than 3 times the current U.S. nuclear power fleet, at a time when we need more power not less.

For months, Senate Democrats have been sounding the alarm on Republicans’ new taxes on clean energy, which will do nothing more than raise prices on families, cede American energy dominance to China, and ship American jobs overseas. Now, they are taking action and working to reverse the harm that Senate Republicans are placing on American families.

“Americans are already struggling to pay to power their homes and businesses every month. But instead of helping, Republicans handed a massive tax break to the wealthy and Big Oil—then paid for it by jacking up your energy bills,” said Leader Schumer. “Senate Democrats are fighting back. Our bill would stop these energy hikes in their tracks and lower costs for working families across the country. We need more energy in America, not higher prices—and the fastest, cheapest way to get there is clean energy, like solar and wind. But instead of investing in our future, Senate Republicans bowed to Big Oil and slapped a tax on nearly every new power project in the country. That’s bad for families, bad for jobs, and a gift to China. Senate Democrats are here to fix it.”

“Donald Trump doesn’t like the sight of wind turbines near his resorts and he’s sold out the federal government to Big Oil lobbyists and executives, so maybe it shouldn’t come as a surprise that he and Republicans are nuking the wind and solar industries in America and forcing Americans to pay higher energy bills,” said Senator Wyden. “ At a time when data centers are gobbling up huge amounts of energy, we need every electron we can get on the grid, and the cheapest and fastest way to produce energy is solar. What Trump and Republicans are doing to clean energy in America is a level of economic self-sabotage we’ve never seen in modern times, and American families and small businesses will suffer for it.”

The legislation is co-sponsored by Patty Murray (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Jack Reed (D-RI), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Ed Markey (D-MA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chris Coons (D-DE), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Angus King (I-ME), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Tina Smith (D-MN), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

Ford’s decision echoes a similar $3 billion credit line it opened in 2023 during the height of pandemic-related uncertainties, as reported by Ford Authority.
Industry insiders suggest this loan might also preempt any credit rating downgrades, preserving access to favorable borrowing terms.
Analysts from Moody’s have indicated that while Ford’s liquidity remains strong at over $45 billion total, persistent external pressures like recession fears could test this buffer.
Ultimately, this $3 billion commitment positions Ford to weather short-term storms, but its success hinges on broader economic recovery and policy stability.","Ford Motor Co. has secured a $3 billion term loan commitment from a syndicate of lenders led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., a move disclosed in a recent SEC Form 8-K filing that underscores the automaker’s strategy to bolster liquidity amid mounting economic pressures. The agreement, effective July 28, 2025, provides Ford with a one-year drawdown period, requiring the company to maintain at least $4 billion in cash reserves during that time. This financial maneuver comes as Ford navigates a challenging environment marked by potential tariff hikes, slowing demand for electric vehicles, and broader recession fears.

Details from the filing reveal that the loan is unsecured, signaling a vote of confidence from lenders despite Ford’s BBB- credit rating from S&P Global Ratings, which places it at the lower end of investment-grade status. Analysts note that this rating reflects vulnerabilities to adverse economic conditions, including supply-chain disruptions and fluctuating raw material costs. Ford’s decision echoes a similar $3 billion credit line it opened in 2023 during the height of pandemic-related uncertainties, as reported by Ford Authority.

Tariffs and Policy Shifts Amplify Financial Strain

The timing of this loan aligns closely with escalating trade tensions, particularly under the specter of renewed tariffs on imported goods. President Donald Trump’s administration has signaled potential increases that could add up to $2 billion in headwinds for Ford this year alone, according to the company’s recent earnings call. Posts on X from industry watchers, including those from CBT News, highlight how these tariffs are exacerbating cash flow issues, with Ford projecting “rocky times ahead” as costs for steel and aluminum rise.

In a detailed report, Automotive Dive emphasizes that while the loan enhances Ford’s financial flexibility, it also points to proactive risk management in an industry grappling with slowing EV adoption. Ford’s second-quarter 2025 results showed adjusted EBIT of $2.1 billion, beating expectations, but the company revised its full-year guidance downward, citing a net tariff impact of approximately $2 billion—higher than the previously estimated $1.5 billion.

Strategic Implications for Ford’s Operations

Beyond immediate liquidity, this credit facility could support Ford’s ongoing investments in electrification and autonomous technologies, areas where the company has committed billions despite market headwinds. For instance, recent X posts from SEC Filings Digest confirm the loan’s structure as a term loan for operational financing, with covenants tied to liquidity maintenance. This setup allows Ford to draw funds as needed without immediate repayment pressure, a critical buffer as auto sales soften globally.

Comparisons to peers like General Motors, which has maintained stronger cash positions, underscore Ford’s relative caution. As noted in coverage from Detroit Free Press, Ford ended the first quarter of 2025 with about $35 billion in cash, but ongoing expenditures on EV battery plants and software development are straining resources. Industry insiders suggest this loan might also preempt any credit rating downgrades, preserving access to favorable borrowing terms.

Broader Industry Context and Lender Confidence

JPMorgan’s role as administrative agent isn’t coincidental; the bank has a history of facilitating large-scale financing for automakers, including a 2024 risk transfer deal linked to a $3 billion loan portfolio, per BNN Bloomberg. For Ford, this partnership reflects lender optimism in the company’s turnaround plan, which includes cost-cutting measures and a pivot toward profitable truck and SUV segments amid EV market volatility.

However, not all signals are positive. Sentiment on X, including from Traders Community, points to Ford’s Q2 2025 warnings on elevated costs and a revised adjusted free cash flow outlook of $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion—down from prior estimates. This loan, while unsecured, carries interest rates tied to SOFR plus a margin, potentially adding to Ford’s debt burden if drawn upon extensively.

Looking Ahead: Risks and Opportunities

Ford’s executives, in statements accompanying the filing, framed the loan as a “prudent step” to ensure resilience, especially with another tariff deadline looming. As detailed in The Detroit News, the automaker is also contending with shifting emissions regulations, which could necessitate further capital outlays. Analysts from Moody’s have indicated that while Ford’s liquidity remains strong at over $45 billion total, persistent external pressures like recession fears could test this buffer.

Ultimately, this $3 billion commitment positions Ford to weather short-term storms, but its success hinges on broader economic recovery and policy stability. For industry observers, it serves as a barometer of the auto sector’s fragility, where even legacy giants like Ford must continually fortify their finances against unpredictable global forces.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xai-tmp-imgen-fc515677-8dbd-4689-8520-53b2b55c6e39.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 17:02:35.819701

At a beach cleanup Friday morning ahead of the event, many delegates told the Herald they remain determined to push for local change, even as federal climate policy backslides.
De Marneffe said they chose Miami as the conference’s location to show students what ground zero for climate change looks like.
“South Florida is no stranger to a hostile political climate, and Floridians are on the front lines,” de Marneffe said.","Young climate activists from across the U.S. are gathering in Miami for a major conference this weekend to learn how to draft and advocate for policies that could shape the world they’ll soon inherit.

“This is our future, and a lot of times we don’t even have a say,” said Parishay Azer, a 17-year-old from California. “But with conferences like these, our opinions are heard and it gives us the confidence to go to other places and speak out.”

For the past three years, the Local Conference of Youth (LCOY) has collaborated with the federal government to produce a national youth climate statement outlining recommendations for the how the U.S. should deal with spiraling concerns, from rising temperatures to more extreme weather events.

This year, things look different.

Under the Trump administration, federal engagement has dried up. Agencies that previously supported the youth-led effort, including the White House Climate Policy Office and the State Department’s climate negotiation team, have been dissolved. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has also pulled back support. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, wants to largely end regulation of greenhouse gases driving much of the global climate problems

Despite the setbacks, organizers say the youth movement is looking for ways to adapt as they meet at the University of Miami’s alumni center and law school this weekend after a beach cleanup early Friday.

Coco de Marneffe, LCOY’s lead coordinator, said the federal pullout was discouraging but they were shifting focus from federal authorities to local and state representatives. South Florida counties have lead the way in acknowledging the mounting problems and already have spent billions to reduce the risks of sea-rise and other climate-driven concerns.

The statement crafted at this year’s conference will still be presented on national and international stages, including the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP) in Brazil this year.

“Our federal government isn’t showing up and if civil society doesn’t show up we could be left out of the international discussion,” Marneffe said.

The LCOY conference will bring together students and young adults from 40 different states. The youngest delegate is a 12-year-old from New Jersey and the oldest is a 35-year-old from Florida.

At a beach cleanup Friday morning ahead of the event, many delegates told the Herald they remain determined to push for local change, even as federal climate policy backslides.

Morgan Brown, a 25-year-old from Denver, Colorado said the news surrounding the White House pull back on research and regulation is overwhelming, “but we can still create change in our local governments.”

Nitya Nekkauti, a university student from Ohio, said the conference offers a rare chance to share strategies across state lines.

“Since we are focusing on the state level, it’s a good chance to compare issues in different states and take ideas from each other,” she said.

De Marneffe said they chose Miami as the conference’s location to show students what ground zero for climate change looks like. Throughout the weekend, delegates will attend workshops on policy writing, speaking to politicians and grassroots organizing. They’ll also hear from local leaders, including State Rep. Anna Eskamani, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava, and Miccosukee environmentalist Betty Osceola.

“South Florida is no stranger to a hostile political climate, and Floridians are on the front lines,” de Marneffe said. “The youth who will inherit this messy, messy world represent the best of us.”

The two-and-a-half hour roundtable, held at the Pennsylvania College of Technology’s Thompson Professional Development Center, was co-sponsored by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, Pennsylvania College of Technology and Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce.

The event marked a continued effort by U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Dallas, and his colleagues to bring federal policymakers into direct conversation with those creating jobs, training the next generation, and building energy capacity across Pennsylvania.

The discussion — on a round table — served as a platform to discuss how federal policy can better align with regional success models – focusing on workforce development, energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing. It was introduced by state Rep. Jamie Flick, R-South Williamsport, a college alum. Flick is among the House members working on projects mentioned at the conference along with future economic development in the region in Union and Lycoming counties in the 83rd House district.

“This roundtable underscored the incredible opportunity we have to grow Pennsylvania’s energy economy, support small businesses, and invest in workforce development programs that deliver results,” Meuser said.

“We heard directly from job creators, educators, and innovators who are driving progress in our region,” he said. “Whether it’s strengthening technical education pipelines, modernizing permitting to meet 21st-century demands, or scaling homegrown energy solutions, the discussion was about action — focused, practical, and rooted in what’s working right here in Pennsylvania.”

Meuser added, “Pennsylvania has the resources, the talent, and the entrepreneurial spirit to lead the next chapter of America’s energy and manufacturing renaissance. From the classroom to the jobsite to the boardroom, our Commonwealth is positioned to lead. Today’s dialogue is part of ensuring that federal policy helps — rather than hinders — that momentum by reinforcing local strengths, removing bureaucratic barriers, and supporting the industries that power our economy.”

The conversation focused on several priorities that will be essential to sustaining Pennsylvania’s competitive edge.

These included expanding federal support for career and technical education through corporate tax credit models inspired by Pennsylvania’s EITC program; modernizing infrastructure and permitting processes to attract data centers and meet surging energy demands driven by AI and manufacturing reshoring; unlocking critical mineral recovery from produced water through targeted tax incentives and streamlined federal regulation; and strengthening coordination between federal, state, and local partners to scale successful workforce pipelines and rural economic development strategies.

Prior to the roundtable, Meuser toured the college campus to see firsthand how the institution is “Inspiring and Preparing Tomorrow Makers” with a world-class, hands-on education.

He met with college President Dr. Michael J. Reed and Dr. Bradley Webb, Dean of Engineering Technologies, to discuss how Penn College blends real-world experience, innovation, and strong industry partnerships to prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow. Meuser emphasized the importance of supporting institutions like Penn College that are building a more skilled and resilient workforce in Pennsylvania.

Training, education and initiatives provided by the partners of Williamsport/Lycoming Chamber of Commerce are resulting in economic successes for this region.

Jason Fink, president and CEO of the chamber, discussed the recent expansion and increase in jobs at Prysmian Group, which is making aluminum cable for the Midwest Grain Belt Express electricity grid.

He also discussed how AA Metal Specialities bought Chance Aluminum and restarted the plant and has purchased about 200 acres of industrial land where it plans to open in either late 2026 or early 2027, expecting to employ 350 to 400 people.

Fink related success for West Pharmaceuticals at the Williamsport and Jersey Shore facilities, where the city facility is planning to hire hundreds of people, and he touched on the recent announcement by Verne Inc. to — in nine months — open a production Muncy area plant that will build storage tanks that store compressed hydrogen for use in tanks for over-the-road trucks. The plant will employ 61 people. Moreover, the Verne plant will network with businesses such as PMF Inc. which designs the storage containers that store hydrogen gas.

Fink observed the grand opening of Chick-fil-A on Maynard Street and the expected opening of the Bass Pro in Muncy Township in 2027.

Larry Allison Jr., owner of Allison Crane & Rigging, discussed his business relationship to oil and gas fields, moving heavy machines and establishing a presence here and in western Texas.

He also said he branched out by purchasing a 100-year-old commercial bakery and the former Country Store Brand Meats. He said his wife oversees a third business.

“We’d love to see our employees paid more,” he said, looking forward to the no-tax on overtime policy, which he said would give the employees a couple more dollars in their paychecks when they perform overtime for the businesses.

He said he also was pleased to see the national interest rates going down, and a drive to deploy more capital investments but he cautioned those at the table to “keep the pressure on.”

In terms of controlling business expenses, he was not positive, asking why a trailer cost $30,000 and is now $50,000 for the same product.

Additionally, he said, a tractor trailer runs an average of $100,000 on up. “Why?” he asked.

More pressure for the businesses include rising health insurance and general liability, he said.

While there have been positive trends, such as the price of eggs dropping, other groceries are not, Allison observed.

“How do we keep absorbing this?” he asked the panel.

Allison said he was in attendance at the recent Energy Summit in Pittsburgh, where $92 billion of energy sector projects were announced. He listened to speakers, including Mike Rowe, the television celebrity and narrator for the show Dirty Jobs, who promotes and advocates for students learning trades.

He said Rowe “stole the entire show,” while asking those at the summit where the next group of skilled workers was going to come from, and then answering, “eighth grade.”

He suggested displaying career information at the school districts and showing the students the average amount of income they could earn in various career fields — including jobs that begin at $30 to $40 per hour on up.

“Overall, the roundtable featured three major focus areas:

Workforce development

Panelists from Penn College, the Susquehanna County Career & Technology Center, and Coterra highlighted how regional models are effectively preparing students for high-skill, high-demand energy and technical careers. Participants explored ways the federal government can replicate Pennsylvania’s Education Improvement Tax Credit (EITC) program at the national level — leveraging private-sector investment to expand career and technical education.

Manufacturing and technology infrastructure

Industry innovators emphasized the urgency of upgrading permitting systems and expanding access to reliable energy infrastructure. As energy demand surges — especially with the rise of AI and data centers — speakers stressed the need for regulatory certainty and policies that support domestic production, including new investments in power transmission, siting reforms, and localized supply chains.

Energy services and small business growth

Representatives from Repsol, Seneca Resources, Costy’s Energy, and others shared real-world perspectives on operating in Pennsylvania’s natural gas fields.

China realized early in the 21st century that electric vehicles were the future.
Current administration policy, including eliminating clean energy incentives and increasing subsidies for fossil fuels, will essentially halt that progress, according to a Princeton University study.
Over $200 billion in clean energy and vehicle investments have already been plowed into U.S. manufacturing projects since 2022.
The politics of electric vehicles and alternative energy in general is complex, sometimes verging on tribal.","Americans interested in taking advantage of current tax incentives to purchase an electric vehicle or improve the energy efficiency of their homes had better get a move on. Many of these subsidies, originally scheduled to last through 2032, are instead running out of gas over the next few months.

President Donald Trump's recently enacted ""one big beautiful bill"" includes the early demise of federal support for adoption of alternative fuel vehicles and home improvements. Refundable credits for electric cars will evaporate on Sept. 30, and several home tax credits will expire on Dec. 31. Households will end up with higher energy bills as a result. But the true beneficiary of the policy shift is China.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended and enhanced several tax credits to promote and accelerate the move to more sustainable sources of energy. Purchasers of electric vehicles can claim a refundable credit of up to $7,500 that may be applied to the down payment or purchase price of the car, subject to some restrictions. Qualifying vehicles include passenger cars with prices of $55,000 or less and SUVs or trucks less than $80,000. The credit also phases out for couples with adjusted gross incomes above $300,000. The rebate also applies to leased vehicles, and a credit of up to $4,000 is available for used cars. Under the new law, purchasers must take possession prior to Oct. 1 to qualify for the discount.

Home improvement credits for solar panels, efficient heating and air conditioning equipment, insulation and other upgrades will disappear on Dec. 31.

In addition to axing clean energy incentives, the administration is killing off the successful Energy Star program, a government initiative to improve energy efficiency that has saved consumers and businesses over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented the emission of 4 billion tons of greenhouse gases since its inception in 1992.

The elimination of support for clean energy and electric vehicles been framed in terms of supporting American petroleum and coal producers, many of whom were generous contributors to Trump's campaign. But the abandonment of support for alternatives plays directly into Chinese hands and endangers the future of American auto manufacturers.

China realized early in the 21st century that electric vehicles were the future. Since then, the Chinese Communist Party has invested huge sums into the development of its indigenous auto industry with startling results.

China now produces three times as many total cars and light trucks as the U.S., more than America, Japan, Germany and South Korea combined. And its bet on electric vehicles has paid off big time. The Asian colossus now builds 70% of all the world's EVs, while the U.S. makes just 5% (and shrinking). There are over 100 separate Chinese EV manufacturers the largest of which, BYD, sells twice as many cars as Tesla at half the price and offers an entry level model for under $10,000.

And unlike in the U.S., electric cars in China are already cheaper to buy and less expensive to operate than internal combustion vehicles, thanks to economies of scale and the country's massive investment in charging infrastructure.

The story is similar in batteries. China dominates global production, claiming over 70% of all EV battery output and 80% of some minerals necessary for their production.

Given China's aggressive state support of EVs, wind and solar power components, American manufacturers must rely on supportive policy and tax incentives to level the field until they become competitive. Instead, the U.S. has shifted into reverse.

American imports of Chinese cars were essentially prohibited by Biden era embargoes, so U.S. consumers have been shielded from exposure to these advanced vehicles while domestic manufacturers have largely avoided direct competition with them here at home. But America's growing deficit in the EV space poses an existential crisis for U.S. carmakers, a fact known only too well by Detroit auto executives.

Jim Farley, CEO at Ford Motor Co., spoke of the urgency for U.S. automakers to become more competitive in electric vehicles.

""We're in a global competition with China ... and if we lose this, we do not have a future at Ford,"" he said.

Farley bought five Chinese vehicles for his engineers to study. ""It's the most humbling thing I've ever seen ... They are far superior in vehicle technology.""

For its part, General Motors once jockeyed with Volkswagen for the pole position as top-selling nameplate in China and once sold more cars there than in America. Today, GM is number 16 in China.

America's withdrawal from engagement in clean technology is already reaping both environmental and economic consequences.

The U.S. had been on a path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 40% below 2005 levels over the next five years, shy of the 50% reduction target under the Paris accords but significant, nonetheless. Current administration policy, including eliminating clean energy incentives and increasing subsidies for fossil fuels, will essentially halt that progress, according to a Princeton University study.

Retreat from global competition will also cost American jobs. Over $200 billion in clean energy and vehicle investments have already been plowed into U.S. manufacturing projects since 2022. According to research from the Rhodium Group, an additional $522 billion in private capital investment is at risk thanks to the elimination of federal support. Already this year, over $22 billion in project cancellations have been announced and billions more are on hold, with the potential to eliminate as many as 400,000 high-paying American jobs including 15,000 jobs in Tennessee. Ford's massive Blue Oval City in west Tennessee, which planned to employ nearly 6,000, has delayed the completion of its battery project and reduced output targets for electric F150 trucks.

The politics of electric vehicles and alternative energy in general is complex, sometimes verging on tribal. But the national defense and economic security implications of surrendering American industrial leadership in these areas presents an existential threat, one that grows daily and is being celebrated in Beijing.

They claim that climate change activists are alarmists, part of a “religion.” Where does this rejection of clean energy come from?","Dear Editor,

There have been a number of decisions made by the Trump administration that make me scratch my head. Closing Voice of America, firing all the Inspector Generals whose job it is to ferret out “waste, fraud, and abuse,” pardoning the 1500 January 6 rioters, attacking any opposition voices in the media as “enemies of the people,” cutting off funding for public media, large reductions in food aid at home and abroad, claiming the “government” is replete with “deep state” radical leftists to justify cutting many agencies including USAID, FDA, EPA, FEMA, IRS, VA, Consumer Financing Protection Bureau, (what did I miss?), weaponizing the Department of Justice, attacking colleges as “Woke” and anti-semitic, cancelling the subsidies in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act which encouraged green energy transition, while expanding the subsidies for fossil fuel extraction, and so on.

Drill, baby, drill, and bring back “clean coal” … an oxymoron for sure. The US is the world’s largest producer of oil and gas, nearly double the closest 2nd, Saudi Arabia. And do we really want waxy crude trains from Utah travelling the Colorado River corridor through Glenwood Canyon? I say No!

The laws of physics still apply. We are told that today’s price of gas at the pump is the rationale for the rollback of science-based climate change investigation, and the decimation of the agencies established by Congress to assess this slow-moving train wreck. Never mind what kind of planet we will be leaving for our children and grandchildren.

But there are other voices in the debate as well. The Secretary General of the United Nations recently called our world today “A Moment of Opportunity: Supercharging the Clean Energy Age.” Here is part of his comments:

“The headlines are dominated by a world in trouble. By conflict and climate chaos. By rising human suffering. By growing geo-political divides. But amidst the turmoil, another story is being written. And its implications will be profound.

“Throughout history, energy has shaped the destiny of humankind – from mastering fire, to harnessing steam, to splitting the atom. Now, we are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age. Just follow the money.

“$2 trillion went into clean energy last year – that’s $800 billion more than fossil fuels, and up almost 70% in ten years. And new data released today from the International Renewable Energy Agency shows that solar – not so long ago four times the cost of fossil fuels – is now 41% cheaper. Offshore wind – 53%. And over 90% of new renewables worldwide produced electricity for less than the cheapest new fossil fuel alternative.

“This is not just a shift in power. This is a shift in possibility. Yes, in repairing our relationship with the climate. Already, the carbon emissions saved by solar and wind globally are almost equivalent to what the whole European Union produces in a year. But this transformation is fundamentally about energy security and people’s security. It’s about smart economics. Decent jobs, public health, advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. And delivering clean and affordable energy to everyone, everywhere.”

And just this past week, the International Court of Justice issued a unanimous decision (14 to 0) that high emitting countries are responsible for the damage they are doing to the environment and to the millions of people affected by their emissions. The US, the largest historical emitter, and China, the largest current emitter, are in the cross hairs. The US is only 4% of the world’s population but has put up a large percentage of the CO2 in the atmosphere today.

We have a moral obligation to clean up after ourselves. Common sense would dictate that we do “all of the above” in keeping people warm and / or cooled, and able to move around their world. That includes the remarkably economic solutions of wind, solar and, yes, nuclear.

But the administration is doubling down on denial. They claim that climate change activists are alarmists, part of a “religion.” Where does this rejection of clean energy come from?

Money talks. The fossil fuel lobby paid Trump a billion dollars for rescinding many Biden era regulations. In 10 years, people will be asking, what did you do when there was still time to change this outcome? Trump and his sycophants are on the wrong side of history, prejudiced by the corrupting influence of big money in our politics.

The 10 hottest years on record have been the last 10 years. 2024 was the hottest year on record. There is an increase in frequency and severity of extreme weather such as hurricanes, heat domes, wildfires, droughts, floods, melting sea ice and sea level rise, warmer oceans leading to rapid intensification of hurricanes.

According to Audubon, two thirds of all birds are in danger of extinction. The changes to our planet that normally would take hundreds of thousands of years, are happening in decades. We are at an inflection point and must act to turn this around.

Dissent is patriotic, and our current spineless Republican Congress is complicit. “America First” ignores our responsibility to the rest of the world for creating the mess the environment is in. Throw the bums out and let’s move toward sane public policy.

This all-cash C$12 million deal, offering a 28% premium to Synex shareholders, underscores Sitka's aggressive strategy to consolidate assets in British Columbia's booming renewable market. For investors, the transaction raises critical questions: Does this acquisition create long-term value? How does it position Sitka to navigate Canada's evolving energy landscape? And what does it signal about the sector's growth trajectory?

Strategic Alignment with National and Provincial Clean Energy Goals

Canada's Clean Electricity Strategy, launched in 2024, aims to decarbonize the grid by 2050, with British Columbia (BC) playing a central role. The province's existing 85% reliance on non-emitting energy sources, coupled with its ambitious 10-year Clean Electricity Regulations, creates a regulatory environment ripe for renewable developers. Synex's portfolio—11 MW of operational hydro projects, 9.4 MW of construction-ready run-of-river assets, and 16 wind sites with 4,700 MW potential—directly aligns with BC's focus on expanding clean generation. By integrating these assets, Sitka gains access to high-quality, low-cost resources in a jurisdiction with streamlined permitting and strong community partnerships, particularly through Indigenous-led projects.

The acquisition also taps into BC's policy-driven demand for renewable infrastructure. The province's recent award of nine Indigenous-majority wind projects, adding nearly 5,000 GWh annually, highlights a shift toward inclusive development. Synex's existing relationships with First Nations communities, combined with Sitka's post-merger governance structure (featuring Indigenous representatives on its board), position the company to navigate social license challenges that often derail renewable projects elsewhere.

Market Positioning in a Competitive but Fragmented Sector

British Columbia's renewable energy market is highly competitive but fragmented, with key players like BC Hydro, Brookfield Renewable Partners, and Innergex Renewable Energy dominating hydro and wind assets. However, the rise of Indigenous equity partnerships is reshaping the landscape. Sitka's acquisition of Synex, which already operates in tandem with Indigenous stakeholders, provides a unique edge. For instance, Synex's Kyuquot Power Ltd. grid connection utility and its 24 hydro sites with 150+ MW potential offer a scalable platform for vertical integration into green hydrogen and long-duration storage—sectors poised for explosive growth as the IRA incentivizes clean tech innovation.

Moreover, the deal's C$2.40/share premium suggests undervaluation relative to Synex's pre-announcement trading price. This premium reflects investor confidence in Sitka's ability to leverage Synex's assets for higher-margin revenue streams, such as securing long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with data centers and hydrogen producers. With BC's electricity rates among the lowest in the OECD, Sitka is well-positioned to attract these industries, which require both affordability and carbon neutrality.

Growth Potential and Emerging Opportunities

The acquisition's most compelling aspect is its alignment with Canada's 2035–2050 clean energy roadmap. The Clean Electricity Regulations, which impose annual emissions limits on fossil fuel plants and incentivize non-emitting sources, will drive demand for hydro, wind, and solar. Synex's 16 wind sites alone could generate 4,700 MW of capacity—enough to power over 1.5 million homes—while its hydro assets provide baseload stability. This diversification reduces exposure to intermittency risks, a critical factor as the grid integrates more variable renewables.

Furthermore, the IRA's 10-year tax credit structure (which includes incentives for hydrogen and long-duration storage) creates a buffer against policy shifts and interest rate volatility. Sitka's access to favorable debt markets—with bond yields near multi-decade lows—enables it to finance these projects at historically low costs. The company's CEO, Trevor White, has emphasized plans to scale into green hydrogen, a sector projected to grow to C$100 billion by 2040 in Canada. Synex's grid connection via Kyuquot Power could serve as a hub for hydrogen production, linking renewable generation to industrial demand.

Risks and Mitigation Strategies

While the acquisition is strategically sound, risks remain. Regulatory delays, particularly for large hydro projects, could derail timelines. Additionally, the IRA's focus on domestic manufacturing may pressure developers to source equipment from Canadian suppliers, increasing costs. However, Sitka's emphasis on Indigenous partnerships and its existing infrastructure (including transmission assets) mitigate these risks. The company's post-merger governance, with a board comprising former Synex executives and Sitka's leadership, ensures continuity in project execution.

Investment Outlook

For investors, Sitka's acquisition of Synex represents a high-conviction opportunity in a sector set for structural growth. The deal's immediate value creation is evident in the 28% premium and the enhanced asset base, while long-term upside lies in green hydrogen and storage synergies. With Canada's clean energy transition projected to attract over C$60 billion in federal and private investment by 2035, Sitka's expanded portfolio positions it to capture a significant share of this market.

However, caution is warranted. The company's success hinges on its ability to integrate Synex's operations efficiently and secure PPAs in a competitive bidding environment. Investors should monitor the company's Q3 2025 earnings report, which will provide insights into post-merger cost synergies and project timelines.

In conclusion, Sitka Power's acquisition of Synex Renewable Energy is a masterstroke in a sector primed for disruption. By leveraging BC's policy tailwinds, Indigenous partnerships, and IRA incentives, the company is poised to emerge as a leader in Canada's net-zero transition. For those seeking exposure to the clean energy revolution, this deal offers a compelling entry point—provided they are prepared to hold through integration challenges and regulatory uncertainties.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 16:03:30.727045

By utilizing glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) tubes, this facility can now store heat 1.2 miles underground, effectively reshaping energy storage and waste heat recovery. The collaboration between the Lounavoima plant, Exel Composites, and QHeat aims to not only capture and preserve surplus heat but also reduce reliance on fossil fuels during colder months. This advancement represents a significant step forward in addressing global energy challenges through innovative engineering.

Storing Heat Underground

Traditionally, the Lounavoima waste-to-energy plant released its excess heat into the atmosphere during warmer months. This was an inefficient practice, especially given the harsh Finnish winters where temperatures can drop to -4 degrees Fahrenheit. In such conditions, the plant had to resort to oil burners to supplement heating needs, increasing both costs and emissions. With the new GFRP tube system, the plant can now store and utilize this previously wasted energy to heat approximately 700 homes annually. This not only reduces emissions but also enhances the plant’s efficiency.

Erika Salmenvaara, CEO of QHeat, emphasized the potential environmental benefits of electrifying heating. While she acknowledged the challenges posed by the strain on the aging power transmission infrastructure, she highlighted the rapid advancement of grid-enhancing technologies. Salmenvaara pointed out that heat pumps can offer up to 600 percent more energy efficiency compared to direct electricity use, underscoring the potential of such innovations in the broader energy landscape.

True Engineering in Action

The success of this project is rooted in the advanced engineering of the GFRP tubes, which are designed to withstand the extreme conditions of underground storage. Lightweight, corrosion-resistant, and thermally efficient, these tubes are a product of rigorous collaboration between Exel Composites and QHeat. The teams meticulously optimized various aspects, including sizing, connection methods, and the balance between thermal insulation and mechanical strength.

Tiina Uotila, technical sales manager at Exel Composites, highlighted the importance of achieving the right mechanical performance while maintaining heat preservation. Additionally, the sustainability of these tubes extends beyond their immediate function. Once their operational life concludes, they are repurposed into cement, where composite materials can replace fossil fuels and raw materials. This sustainable approach ensures that the tubes do not end up in landfills, further contributing to the project’s environmental benefits.

Environmental Implications and Future Prospects

The broader implications of this project extend beyond the immediate benefits of heat storage. As Salmenvaara noted, 60 percent of the European Union’s heat production still relies on fossil fuels. Innovations like the GFRP tube system could play a pivotal role in reducing this dependency. By capturing and storing excess heat, facilities can significantly cut down on fossil fuel use, particularly during peak heating seasons.

Moreover, the project sets a precedent for other waste-to-energy plants worldwide. By demonstrating the feasibility and efficiency of such systems, it encourages similar initiatives in regions facing similar energy challenges. The collaboration between different sectors—engineering, composites manufacturing, and geothermal technology—highlights the importance of interdisciplinary solutions in tackling complex environmental issues.

Challenges and Opportunities

While the Lounavoima project represents a significant advancement, it is not without challenges. The initial investment costs and the complexity of implementing such systems on a larger scale can be daunting. Furthermore, the reliance on advanced technology necessitates skilled personnel for maintenance and operation. However, the opportunities presented by such innovations are compelling. They offer a pathway to reduce emissions, improve energy efficiency, and promote sustainable practices. As grid-enhancing technologies continue to evolve, the potential for widespread adoption of similar systems grows, paving the way for a more sustainable energy future.

As the world grapples with the dual challenges of energy demand and environmental sustainability, projects like the one in Salo offer a glimpse into potential solutions. The question remains: How can other regions and countries adapt and implement similar technologies to address their unique energy challenges?

Federal cutbacks in energy assistance and additional power production will hit us hard. That “big, beautiful bill” will hurt Republicans and Democrats alike. Add some extreme storms, an aging grid, and we are really going to be hurting, especially if you need power in a rural area.

Take Bemidji, for example: that storm of the century with 106-mile-an-hour winds knocked out power for 27,000 people. More will come.

Here’s what’s up: The “big, beautiful bill” will cost us money. The Energy Innovation think tank, along with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, projects electric rates for Minnesotans will increase anywhere from 25% to 42%, costing ratepayers $2.6 billion over the next decade. The average Minnesota household could see its annual energy bill increase by more than $400 by 2035.

The bill guts Energy Assistance. According to the Minnesota Department of Commerce, about $125 million comes annually to the state for Energy Assistance, serving an estimated 125,000 families. Becker, Hubbard and Clearwater counties, and Tribes like Red Lake and White Earth will be hit hard, where approximately 50% of the people are on Energy Assistance. That money is gone.

That’s not just a hardship for Native families, it’s a hardship for all of us, even Ferrell Gas and Itasca-Mantrap Electric Cooperative, which received major payments from Energy Assistance vouchers. That gravy train will be gone. And, in the end, it means tougher winters. Some Pine Point households pay over $500 a month for power.

Heat is even more on top of that.

Now is the time to think ahead, work together and solve these challenges. Power consumption is expected to increase fourfold over the next 20 or so years. Pine Point Village has a solution. Pine Point School is building a resilience hub with solar plus battery storage. It is approximately 500 kilowatts (kW) solar and 2.75 megawatt-hours (MWh) battery storage. Local power, in times of rising outages and grid failures, is the answer.

That’s why the Pine Point Resilience hub is a good idea. The project plans an August groundbreaking and operations by winter.

A group of hardworking people from 10Power, 8th Fire Solar and the Pine Point School raised all the money for this project. The solar panels are manufactured in Minnesota by a local company, Heliene, with Build America, Buy America (BABA) solar panels. This is a win-win situation for all of us.

Across the country, this type of project is increasingly common, as local communities, schools, and even small industries are working to bring more electricity to the grid. A few years ago, Beltrami Electric joined Red Lake Nation and brought online 275 kW of power to serve the community. More is coming.

Not every rural cooperative wants to work with tribes. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission recently scolded Minnesota Valley Cooperative for threatening to cut power to the Upper Sioux Community’s casino if the tribe turns on the 2.5 MW solar array.

On July 26, the PUC voted 4-0 to investigate a complaint from Upper Sioux arguing that the threat by the Minnesota Valley Cooperative Light and Power Association is illegal and discriminatory. The commission said it might resort to the extraordinary step of taking away Minnesota Valley’s right to serve the tribe with power and giving it to another provider, such as nearby Xcel Energy. The commissioners then asked state attorneys to take legal action if necessary to prevent a shutoff.

At 500 kW, the Pine Point Solar Project will be the largest solar project on the grid for Itasca-Mantrap and the first with energy storage. The project is intended to support the Pine Point Elementary School, which pays a considerable bill because the school is 100% electric. Itasca Mantrap and its power supplier, Great River Energy, will purchase the excess solar energy at the minimum mandated PURPA rate.

They have not yet designed a program for batteries, so the 2.76 MWh energy storage capacity at the Pine Point School cannot be fully utilized today to provide resilience and cost-saving benefits to the grid and other customers within their territory. It is our hope that the battery can be included in an upcoming pilot program, although Great River Energy has indicated they are designing the pilot for smaller batteries. Itasca Mantrap recently sponsored a workshop on solar, with Wolf Creek Solar.

Having locally generated, clean power is good for everyone. Now is the time.

Let’s review the challenge: Most of us are energy addicts. Pine Point got power in 1961 because of our cooperation. Since we got those power lines, we’ve been lapping it up here in the north, and today, most of our households use a good chunk of power, not just for lights, but also for all sorts of appliances. And, increasingly, many of our people need power for some medical devices. When a blackout happens in the middle of winter, it’s going to be deadly.

So, what’s wrong with bringing more renewable energy online, power to the people, so to speak? Bob Blake, aka Solar Bear, a Red Lake Tribal member, and one of the largest solar installers in Minnesota, is positive: “Renewables are the future. And to invest in renewable energy is to invest in the future …”

Tesla registrations in California have dropped 18.3% so far this year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.","Sales of new electric vehicles in California remained sluggish in the second quarter of this year and the road ahead appears bumpy, as federal tax credits will expire at the end of next month.

The number of EVs registered between April and June in the Golden State came to 100,671, according to figures released by the California Energy Commission. That’s ever so slightly higher than the first-quarter figure of 100,326 but noticeably lower than the 116,813 registrations seen in the second quarter of 2024.

What’s more, the market share for sales of zero-emission vehicles dropped to 21.6% from April through June, down from 23% in the first quarter and 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

The California New Car Dealers Association released its own second-quarter figures that largely paralleled the energy commission’s numbers and percentages.

Ivan Drury, senior manager of auto insights at Edmunds, said a number of factors came into play, including concerns by potential buyers that tariffs on cars and trucks from the Trump administration would go into effect in April or May.

“It’s not surprising to see that EVs tapered off,” Drury said. “It makes sense because (the California market) is the place that has the most receptivity” to zero-emission purchases.

The second-quarter numbers came just days before what was dubbed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” led by Republicans on Capitol Hill, was signed into law July 4 by President Donald Trump. The 940-page budget bill affects taxes and spending on multiple elements of the nation’s economy, including the auto industry.

Under the new legislation, federal tax incentives for buying an electric vehicle will expire Sept. 30. That includes a credit of up to $7,500 on a new EV, or $4,000 for a used one. The credit for buying and installing a home charging station will end June 30, 2026.

The ending of the federal tax credit for EVs figures to have major implications for California because Gov. Gavin Newsom five years ago issued an executive order that mandates the elimination of sales of all new gasoline-powered passenger vehicles throughout the state by 2035.

Under standards passed by the California Air Resources Board, at least 35% of model year 2026 passenger cars and trucks sold in the state must be EVs, plug-in hybrids or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The numbers ramp up each year, going to 68% in 2030 and 100% by 2035.

In a separate move, Trump in June signed three Congressional Review Act resolutions rescinding those California EV mandates — as well as rules related to diesel engines.

Newsom responded by filing a lawsuit, arguing that Trump’s actions are unconstitutional and beyond the authority of Congress. Ten other states joined in the litigation.

While the court battle proceeds, California policymakers insist the state’s goals to transition to EVs will continue and say the recent quarterly numbers amount to a blip.

“This quarter’s modest decline in zero-emission vehicle sales is no surprise given the federal government’s misguided and ongoing assault on clean transportation,” Liane Randolph, chair of the air resources board, said in a statement. “While they may slow progress, they can’t change the fact that zero-emission vehicles are here to stay — in California and around the world.”

A big reason for the drop in EV sales is a slump in Tesla registrations.

The company had a rough second quarter, with automotive revenue falling 16% compared to a year ago — the second straight quarter of lower sales. Tesla registrations in California have dropped 18.3% so far this year, according to the California New Car Dealers Association.

Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk campaigned for Trump in the run-up to the November presidential election. Musk’s posts on political topics on X, the social media company he owns, and his role in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) sparked protests, boycotts, vandalism and even arson at some Tesla locations.

Musk stepped down from DOGE in late May to focus on Tesla and then had a falling out with the Trump administration. More than a few Wall Street and auto analysts said his zig-zags have damaged the company’s image with potential customers.

However, Tesla’s sales growth had been slowing even before Musk jumped into the 2024 political campaign, signaling that EV adoption rates may have more long-term issues to address.

“It’s clear many consumers still face barriers to going fully electric,” said Robb Hernandez, chairman of the new car dealers association, “whether that’s due to affordability, lack of infrastructure (public charging stations), or range anxiety” — the fear of an EV conking out before a driver gets to a charging station.

Sales are anticipated to ramp up in the third quarter because customers considering an EV purchase are expected to race to dealerships before the federal tax credit goes away.

“Why wait?” Drury said. “The selection’s going to get worse” as the Sept. 30 deadline looms.

Despite Tesla’s woes, the automaker still had the top-selling vehicle in California in the second quarter — the Tesla Model Y, with 44,112 registrations, according to the new car dealers association. The Toyota RAV4 came in second with 33,960, and the Tesla Model 3 finished third with 31,394.

And there’s some good news for EVs in the used-car market.

According a study released in June by iSeeCars.com, a search engine that analyzes car listings, the average price for a 1- to 5-year-old used electric vehicle in the U.S. has dropped 8.8% over the past year to $31,110.

That’s lower than the average price of $32,317 for a gasoline-powered car in the same age range.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SUT-L-TESLA-CHARGING-0625-01.jpg?w=1024&h=778,N,,2025-08-02 13:05:41.122777

The agency will accept public comments on the proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding and repeal of vehicle and engine GHG emissions standards through September 15, 2025.","Today, August 1, 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a controversial proposed rule that, if finalized, would rescind the agency’s landmark 2009 determination that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution that endangers public health and welfare (the Endangerment Finding).

That regulatory finding is the essential predicate for federal regulation of motor vehicle and engine GHG emissions. Based on rescission of the Endangerment Finding, the proposal would repeal all GHG emission standards for new light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines sold in the US.

Resetting US climate and transportation policy

Announcing the proposed rule, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin criticized existing GHG emissions regulations as ineffective in addressing climate change, and focused on the cost of compliance with EPA’s GHG tailpipe standards, describing them as “hidden taxes on American businesses and families” costing them “$1 trillion or more.”

EPA’s proposal responds to a directive of President Donald Trump’s Executive Order “Unleashing American Energy” (issued the day he took office), ordering the agency to submit recommendations to the White House regarding the “legality and continuing applicability” of the Endangerment Finding.

In March 2025, EPA recommended reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding and all regulations and actions grounded in that Finding. The new proposed rule formally initiates the process of rescinding the foundational Endangerment Finding.

EPA’s action is part of a broader effort by the Trump Administration and congressional Republicans to change US climate policy by eliminating programs or regulations they consider too costly or ineffective, particularly policies affecting the transportation and energy sectors.

In May 2025, Congress passed – and President Trump signed – Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions revoking waivers issued by EPA that authorized California’s separate GHG standards for light- and heavy-duty vehicles and nonroad engines. However, use of the CRA to revoke the waivers is subject to a pending court challenge.

In addition, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, eliminated monetary penalties for noncompliance with federal corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and terminated tax credits for electric vehicles. The common rationale for these and related Trump Administration actions is that eliminating GHG vehicle emission standards will reduce energy and transportation costs while increasing choice for consumers and businesses.

Background on the Endangerment Finding

The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to regulate tailpipe emissions from new motor vehicles and engines. Specifically, Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA requires EPA to prescribe by regulation “standards applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in [EPA’s] judgment cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”

In 2007, the US Supreme Court issued Massachusetts v. EPA, a 5–4 decision concluding that the CAA’s broad definition of “air pollutant” includes GHGs. Therefore, the Court ruled, Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA grants EPA the statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines. The high court decision left to EPA’s judgment the determination of whether GHG emissions from vehicles cause or contribute to conditions (eg, climate change) that endanger public health or welfare.

Chief Justice John Roberts, joined by two other justices who still serve on the Court (Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito) dissented in Massachusetts v. EPA. While that dissent focused on the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ standing to bring the lawsuit, it also suggested that the majority (none of whom serve on the Court today) “ignores the complexities of global warming” and opined that there is an “evident mismatch” between “catastrophic global warming – and the narrow subject matter of the Clean Air Act provision [for motor vehicles].”

Following the Supreme Court’s decision, EPA issued the Endangerment Finding, concluding that six GHGs – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) – emitted from motor vehicles and engines contribute to air pollution at concentrations projected to threaten public health and welfare.

Based on that finding, EPA promulgated vehicle GHG emissions standards, which took effect in model years 2012 (light-duty vehicles) and 2014 (medium- and heavy-duty vehicles). Those standards have generally increased in stringency for each successive model year. Current EPA GHG tailpipe emissions standards extend through model year 2032.

EPA has also relied on the Endangerment Finding, in part, to support other GHG emissions regulations under other CAA provisions, including standards for stationary sources (eg, power plants) and aircraft engines. The Endangerment Finding thus forms a significant part of the foundation for various GHG and climate change mitigation regulations and policies that EPA has implemented over the past decade.

Proposal to rescind the Endangerment Finding

EPA’s new proposal proffers legal and factual rationales for rescinding the Endangerment Finding and repealing federal GHG emission standards for vehicles and engines.

Legal bases for proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding

Some of the key components of EPA’s revised legal analysis and interpretation of its authority under the CAA include:

Air pollution subject to regulation: EPA proposes to interpret the term “air pollution” as exclusively referring to local or regional exposure to air pollutants, not global risks associated with global emissions of air pollutants such as GHGs.

Procedural requirements for the Endangerment Finding: EPA also proposes to find that the CAA does not grant it power or discretion to issue a general endangerment finding in isolation, based on GHGs with elevated concentrations in the upper atmosphere (not all of the GHGs covered by the Endangerment Finding are contained in vehicle tailpipe emissions). Instead, EPA asserts, the statute only authorizes such a finding based on a narrower set of GHGs that EPA determines are associated with vehicle tailpipe emissions. Thus, EPA concludes, the agency previously acted outside its authority when issuing the broader Endangerment Finding.

Regulated emissions must cause or contribute to endangerment: EPA’s proposal would further find that the CAA requires EPA to establish a causal connection between new motor vehicle GHG emissions and endangerment to public health or welfare caused by climate change. Thus, the proposed rule would conclude, the Endangerment Finding erroneously relied on global GHG emissions and stationary sources of GHG emissions regulated by other sections of the CAA to justify its finding regarding motor vehicle emissions.

EPA finds further legal support for its proposed withdrawal of the Endangerment Finding in the Supreme Court’s recent decisions in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (eliminating Chevron deference to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes) and West Virginia v. EPA (the “major question” doctrine).

Citing Loper Bright and the absence of specific statutory authorization to regulate GHG emissions, the proposed rule contends that EPA may not rely on statutory silence or ambiguity to justify the agency’s interpretation of CAA Section 202(a).

Relying on the major question doctrine adopted in West Virginia, EPA would further find that regulating motor vehicle GHG emissions is an economically and politically significant issue requiring a clear directive from Congress, which the agency suggests is lacking in Section 202(a).

Factual and evidentiary bases for proposed rescission

Supplementing EPA’s legal rationale for rescinding the Endangerment Finding, the proposed rule also criticizes the prior factual and scientific analysis and concludes that the Endangerment Finding was unreasonable, not adequately supported by contemporaneous empirical data or evidence, and contradicted by more recent data and climate trends.

Key components of EPA’s determination that the Endangerment Finding is not supported by the facts and evidence include:

New evidence and data: EPA’s proposal would find that the scientific record, including recent data and studies, cast doubt on the prior analysis, including its assessment of uncertainties as well as forecasts and predictions underlying the Endangerment Finding.

No “requisite technology” to control GHG emissions from vehicles: EPA’s proposal would also find that even reducing US GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines to zero “would not have a scientifically measurable impact on global GHG concentrations and climate trends.” Based on that determination, EPA would conclude there is no “requisite technology” (as required by CAA Section 202) to mitigate any endangerment to public health and welfare caused by global climate change.

Restoring consumer choice: EPA proposes to conclude that existing GHG emission standards for new vehicles and engines would harm public health and welfare by increasing prices, decreasing consumer choice, and delaying replacement of older vehicles that are less safe and generate greater emissions of air pollutants.

EPA estimates that the proposed rule would save consumers and industry approximately $54 billion annually. The agency will accept public comments on the proposed rescission of the Endangerment Finding and repeal of vehicle and engine GHG emissions standards through September 15, 2025.

EPA has also scheduled a public hearing on the proposal for August 19–20, 2025. We anticipate this major regulatory action will be controversial and generate significant comments in support and opposition.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16336_0535.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 13:07:17.101368

The White House released its AI Action Plan on July 23, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others pour billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Environmental concerns

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are increasingly severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Big Tech moves

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most power plants in the U.S. still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

Tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables. Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

In recent days, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world's largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means ""relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,"" Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear, power generation.

What's ahead

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for.

""In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,"" said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

""They're planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that's projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added.

E-Cite Motors Group (OTCID:VAPR), an emerging electric vehicle manufacturer, today announced that its stock has dramatically outperformed major electric automakers over the past week and year-to-date. E-Cite's share price closed at $0.0112 on Friday, August 1, up roughly 12% from Monday's $0.0100 opening price. This weekly gain stands in stark contrast to declines in leading EV stocks such as Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Rivian (NASDAQ: RIVN), and Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) during the same period. Tesla's stock fell from about $325 on July 28 to $303 by Aug. 1 (approximately, 7% change), while Rivian slipped roughly, 8% (from $13.78 to $12.60), and Lucid dropped roughly, 12% (from $2.79 to $2.46) over the week.

Year-to-date, E-Cite's momentum is even more pronounced. Since January 1, 2025, VAPR shares have nearly doubled in value, rising from around $0.0057 at the start of the year to $0.0112 today (an increase on the order of +96%). In comparison, many EV peers have struggled: Tesla stock is down about 24% for 2025 (opening the year near $379 and recently trading around $308), Lucid has declined roughly 18% YTD, and Rivian remains roughly flat with a modest ~3% dip year-to-date These figures underscore that E-Cite (VAPR) has delivered industry-leading returns for investors so far this year, outpacing even the largest EV manufacturers in percentage gains.

""This exceptional stock performance reflects the unique advantages and progress E-Cite has achieved,"" said Barry Henthorn, CEO of E-Cite Motors. ""We benefit from a special low-volume manufacturing exemption that lets us bring vehicles to market faster and more efficiently than traditional automakers, and our recent technological and strategic milestones are resonating with investors.""

E-Cite operates under the U.S. Low Volume Manufacturers Act, giving it a government exemption from certain costly certification requirements that burden traditional OEMs. Notably, E-Cite's vehicles are produced under a low-volume manufacturing exemption, allowing the company to bypass extensive crash-testing delays and expenses while still meeting all safety and regulatory standards. This streamlines development and approval, enabling E-Cite to deploy new models faster and more efficiently than any traditional OEM, a significant competitive edge that investors recognize. By accelerating time-to-market for its electric vehicles, E-Cite can capitalize on market opportunities more quickly than legacy manufacturers encumbered by bureaucracy.

Recent product breakthroughs and strategic initiatives from E-Cite Motors have further bolstered market confidence. Earlier this month, the company unleashed a next-generation electric driveline for its upcoming American sports cars, doubling performance metrics and setting new benchmarks. The newly unveiled Zero Emissions electric motor spins up to 26,000 RPM (in performance trim), an astonishing leap from the previous 12,000 RPM, and delivers a face-melting 4,000 Nm of torque. This advanced powertrain, paired with dual high-density 90 kWh battery packs, will power E-Cite's EV-GT, EV-C3, and EV-DT models, all built on a common modular aluminum chassis.

""The new motor's RPM increase from 12k to 26k is a game-changer,"" CEO Henthorn noted, emphasizing that it enables blistering acceleration and higher top speeds in a compact, lightweight package.""

Legendary designer Gene Langmesser, E-Cite's COO, added that ""the company's revolutionary chassis was engineered for adaptability, allowing rapid integration of such upgrades across models and giving E-Cite agility that legacy OEMs can't match.""

In addition to cutting-edge technology, E-Cite is leveraging iconic designs to capture the imagination of enthusiasts. This July, the company announced it has secured the design and production rights to the famed 1954 Kaiser-Darrin sports car, an American classic renowned for its elegant lines and distinctive ""pocket"" doors that slide into the fenders. E-Cite will resurrect this legend as the all-electric EV-DT ""Dutch Touch"" model, preserving the Kaiser-Darrin's timeless styling (including the signature sliding doors) while infusing it with state-of-the-art electric performance.

""The Kaiser-Darrin is not just a car, it's rolling sculpture,"" said Gene Langmesser, the vehicle's revival designer and E-Cite's COO, calling the opportunity to modernize it with electric power ""a dream come true"". The EV-DT will share E-Cite's proprietary chassis and driveline with the brand's other models, ensuring that beneath the retro bodywork lies the full might of E-Cite's latest EV technology.

E-Cite's ambition extends to redefining the electric pickup truck segment as well. In June, the company revealed details of its upcoming RJ9 electric pickup, which boasts an unprecedented 900+ mile total range - the highest of any production pickup in the world, whether electric or gasoline. This extraordinary range is achieved via an extended-range EV (EREV) system pairing a 40-kWh battery with a small onboard generator, giving approximately 140 miles of pure electric driving plus hundreds more on generator power. The RJ9's specs are game-changing: 0-60 mph in under 5 seconds, dual-motor AWD, and rapid DC fast-charging (20% to 80% in just 26 minutes). Equally impressive are its luxury features, from zero-gravity massage seats to panoramic displays, which elevate it to an unrivaled level of comfort and tech in the truck category. E-Cite openly touts that the RJ9 will surpass Tesla's Cybertruck, Rivian's R1T, and Ford's F-150 Lightning not only in driving range but in premium appointments, ""raising the bar for the entire truck industry"". Crucially, the RJ9 will also take advantage of E-Cite's low-volume exemption, allowing the company to bring this advanced truck to market swiftly while meeting all safety requirements.

Beyond vehicle development, E-Cite Motors has made strong commitments to American manufacturing that position it favorably amid shifting economic winds. The company recently announced a strategic initiative to dramatically increase its U.S.-based production and sourcing. Key components for E-Cite's vehicles, including body panels, lighting systems, wheels, battery enclosures, chassis assemblies, and even advanced glass, will be sourced from domestic suppliers going forward. This reshoring effort, driven by rising import tariffs and growing consumer demand for American-made EVs, is expected to optimize E-Cite's supply chain, shorten delivery timelines, and enhance production flexibility. E-Cite is currently in the final stages of site selection for expanded U.S. assembly plants, narrowing down locations and finalizing plans for new assembly operations to be announced later this quarter. ""As the economic environment in the U.S. becomes more conducive to advanced manufacturing, E-Cite is proud to bring more of our production home,"" Henthorn said, underscoring that investing in American jobs and infrastructure is a win-win for the company and its customers. ""By expanding domestic manufacturing, E-Cite aims to further differentiate itself from competitors while ensuring capacity to meet the anticipated demand for its vehicles.""

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.","President Donald Trump's plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the United States could speed up a building boom that already was expected to strain the nation's ability to power it.

The White House released its AI Action Plan on July 23, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others pour billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat ""radical climate dogma,"" a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

Environmental concerns

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are increasingly severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

Big Tech moves

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most power plants in the U.S. still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

Tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often that's not from renewables. Sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

In recent days, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world's largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee said.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means ""relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,"" Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear, power generation.

What's ahead

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for.

""In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,"" said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

""They're planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that's projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.""

Those carbon savings are sold as voluntary credits to companies and are verified by third-party auditing.
Landowners earn credit royalties while still being able to harvest some of their timber, NativState officials said.
Louisiana landowners have already started earning royalty payments from earlier deals, company officials said.
Corporate officials from Indonesia, Japan and other countries have visited Arkansas and Louisiana prospecting for carbon deals, he said.","More than 63,000 acres of north Louisiana forestland are part of a new 10-year deal to sell carbon credits to a French petrochemical and natural gas exporter with operations in the Baton Rouge area and southwest Louisiana.

And the chief executive officer of the carbon credit company that was part of the deal says he expects continued interest from big industrial companies in voluntary credit sales involving Louisiana forests, though U.S. environmental policy is beginning to shift away from climate regulation.

TotalEnergies has inked the deal with the Arkansas-based NativState to enroll in 13 long-term forest management plans across 247,000 acres in Louisiana and three other states, officials with both companies said.

TotalEnergies says it is trying to avoid or cut greenhouse gas emissions where it can — including with permanent underground carbon storage — and offset the rest by investing $100 million annually in projects that will be able to generate at least 5 million metric tons of carbon credits per year by 2030.

The NativState deal, the value of which was not disclosed, is part of TotalEnergies' buildout of that carbon offset portfolio, which is also expected to include agriculture and wetlands protection projects, company officials said in a statement.

""We are working to build a high-quality portfolio and are paying close attention to the integrity and permanence of the emissions reductions and sequestration achieved by the activities financed in this way,"" said Gabin Poizat, a TotalEnergies spokesperson.

'Some give and take'

The company, which has the world's largest combined styrene and polystyrene manufacturing plant in Carville, says it already has 1 gigawatt of renewable energy under development to supply electricity to U.S. petrochemical sites, including in Carville, a Port Arthur, Texas, oil refinery, and plastics manufacturing in LaPorte, Texas.

NativState aggregates smaller timber properties to create economies of scale and, in long-term deals reached with landowners, sets up reduced harvesting practices to create a net savings in carbon emissions.

The deal with TotalEnergies involved more than 280 landowners in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee in a portion of the nation where there is aggressive timber harvesting, NativState officials said.

Landowners agreed to 40-year sustainable management programs with help from NativState's foresters and wildlife biologists that will reduce but not eliminate harvests.

Those carbon savings are sold as voluntary credits to companies and are verified by third-party auditing. Landowners earn credit royalties while still being able to harvest some of their timber, NativState officials said.

""So, there's some give and take there, but, in the end, in most cases, that landowner is getting as much, if not more, between the carbon credits and timber revenues on these properties,"" said Stuart Allen, founder and chief executive officer of NativState.

'Political pressures'

The TotalEnergies agreement is NativStat's fourth large credit deal. Louisiana landowners have already started earning royalty payments from earlier deals, company officials said.

The companies announced the latest deal late last month shortly before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was planning to rescind the so-called endangerment finding for greenhouse gases known to contribute to climate change.

The finding is a key underpinning for the climate regulations that have followed in the 16 years since it was reached in 2009. The proposed change is part of a wider deregulatory effort by the Trump administration to spur energy and industrial production and cut consumer prices.

Allen, the NativState CEO, said Thursday that while shifting U.S. regulations may affect interest in carbon credits from smaller, domestic companies, it's not affecting the large international companies with which he is dealing.

They have 25-year planning horizons, he said, that extend past any single administration and face different business pressures than in the United States. Corporate officials from Indonesia, Japan and other countries have visited Arkansas and Louisiana prospecting for carbon deals, he said.

""And we bring groups in and their view on carbon and climate change and the political pressures on them or corporate investor pressures are considerably different than what we've seen here in the U.S., in some cases. And so I think the majority, we're not seeing any lack of demand from global players,"" Allen said.

This project is more than enough risk for one town on Cape Cod,"" she said.","Two Cape Cod state representatives are advocating for increased state oversight of offshore wind development to protect communities.

Two bills are under consideration: one to examine the local impact of onshore wind infrastructure and another to prioritize community involvement in siting decisions.

Concerns include potential risks to water supplies, recreational areas, and historic neighborhoods, as well as the need for coordinated strategies in case of emergencies.

State Rep. Steven Xiarhos, R-Barnstable, and State Rep. Kip Diggs, D-Barnstable, have filed the bills.

As Massachusetts looks to expand its clean energy footprint, state Rep. Steven Xiarhos is sounding the alarm: offshore wind may be the future, but without stronger state oversight, that future could come at a steep cost to Cape Cod communities.

The Republican lawmaker from West Barnstable gave testimony on July 29 in front of the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities, and Energy, pushing for new laws that would require developers to work more closely with local communities when deciding where onshore wind infrastructure should go — and make sure those communities have a real voice before shovels hit the ground.

The commission is accepting public comments about the bills through Aug. 5.

Xiarhos said his Barnstable constituents are already feeling ""the real and growing consequences"" of high-voltage infrastructure planned through densely developed and historic neighborhoods, and close to water supplies, recreational areas and places of business.

While he supports expanding the state's clean energy capacity, he stressed that it must be done with transparency, safety, and respect for local input. His bill and others like it, he insisted, are not “anti-renewable energy,"" but rather ""they are pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.""

“These are the principles that must guide any serious effort to grow our clean energy capacity without sacrificing the health, safety, or stability of our communities,"" he said.

Legislation aims to address community risks and concerns

Xiarhos pointed to two key bills — one that he filed to examine the local impact of onshore wind infrastructure, and another from fellow Cape Cod legislator, Rep. Kip Diggs, D-Barnstable, which he supports for prioritizing community involvement.

“These bills are not speculative. They are responsive,” Xiarhos said. “These concerns are important and well-founded. The time for action to protect our communities is now, before it is too late.”

Talking about his bill (H. 3585), he said he is ""deeply concerned about the potential risks these projects pose."" These include routing power transmission cables under local beaches and through historic villages, siting ""massive substations"" directly on top of the Cape's sole source aquifer, ""unknown long-term effects on marine life, public health, and the environment,"" and ""a clear lack of coordination and readiness in the event of a catastrophic failure, cyberattack, or environmental hazard.""

Comprised of experts in public health, safety, environment and energy, his proposed panel would examine and prepare for all of these potential risks, and ""would ensure that the voices of host communities — those being asked to shoulder the burden — are heard, respected and protected,” he said.

Cape Cod towns at the center of transmission debates

Many Barnstable residents have raised concerns about the same issues. The town is already hosting onshore infrastructure connected with Vineyard Wind 1 — which now has 17 turbines online — and is also the proposed landing site for Avangrid's New England Wind 1 (formerly Park City Wind) and New England Wind 2 (formerly Commonwealth Wind).

The proposed landing spot for the latter project is on Dowses Beach, which resident activists say is environmentally sensitive. And not far away, Falmouth is eyed as a potential landing place for the second phase of the proposed SouthCoast Wind project.

On July 29, Xiarhos also backed Diggs' bill (H. 3479) that calls for more local input and smarter siting of onshore wind infrastructure. The bill pushes developers to place infrastructure in industrial zones or at existing power generation sites.

“No one community can be expected to shoulder the burdens of meeting an entire region’s needs,” Diggs said. “From wastewater, broadband, and housing to energy, workforce shortages, and the unique demands of our seasonal economy, it’s about making sure we plan wisely and share responsibility as Cape Cod tackles its biggest infrastructure challenges.”

Xiarhos said Cape Cod towns ""should not be chosen as energy corridors simply for the convenience of developers.""

The bill also ""calls for coordinated offshore transmission strategies to reduce cost and disruption — offering a smarter path forward for both ratepayers and host communities.""

Resident advocate: Bills are 'a step in the right direction'

Barnstable resident Stacey Guenther, who is on the steering committe for the local, non-partisan advocacy group Save Greater Dowses Beach (www.SaveDowes.org), said in spite of ""the thousands of signatures on petitions opposing the landing of these industrial-scale offshore wind projects in the Barnstable community, the very real on-shore risks often go unrecognized or ignored.""

Xiarhos' and Diggs' bills, she said, ""are a step in the right direction."" Members of the grassroots organization are pleased to see that two of their state legislators, a Republican and a Democrat, have both put forward legislation ""shedding light on some of the public’s concerns,"" she said.

Vineyard Wind 1, if completed, will mean 800 megawatts of power at Covell’s Beach, Guenther said.

""This power will run through residential and tourist areas of Hyannis to a massive wind substation adjacent to a moderate-income apartment complex. This project is more than enough risk for one town on Cape Cod,"" she said.

The other two projects eyed for landing in Barnstable — New England Wind 1 and 2 — would also land at other ""pristine residential beaches,"" she said.

""Extra high voltage/high heat cables — 800 megawatts and 1200 megawatts respectively — will be run through tourism-dependent residential areas, adjacent to natural gas lines and fresh water pipes,"" she said, ending at ""two newly-constructed, massive substations containing hundreds of thousands of gallons of toxic coolant and located directly above the Cape’s sole source aquifer, which supplies drinking water to all of Cape Cod.""

Ultimately, Guenther said, ""it is our hope that Massachusetts and adjacent New England states will stand up to offshore wind developers and protect our natural resources and our people.""

In short, the US does not have an energy security problem.
It has clawed back billions of US dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.
Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.
It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations.","During the Cold War, the US and Soviet Union were locked in a desperate race to develop cutting‑edge technologies like long-range missiles and satellites. Fast forward to today and the frontiers of global technology have pivoted to AI and next‑generation energy.

In one domain, AI, the US has far outpaced any other nation – though China looks to be closing the gap. In the other, energy, it has just tied its shoelaces together. The reason isn’t technology, economics or, despite the government’s official line, even national security. Rather, it is politics.

Since returning to the White House in January, Donald Trump has handed out huge wins to the coal and oil and gas industries. This is no great surprise. Trump has long been supportive of the US fossil fuel industry and, since his reelection, has appointed several former industry lobbyists to top political positions.

According to the Trump administration, national security requires gutting support for renewable energy while performing political CPR on the dying coal industry.

The reality is that, since 2019, the US has produced more oil, gas and coal annually than Americans want to use, with the rest exported and sold overseas. It is currently one of the most prolific exporters of fossil fuels in the world.

In short, the US does not have an energy security problem. It does, however, have an energy cost problem combined with a growing climate change crisis. These issues will only be made worse by Trump’s enthusiasm for fossil fuels.

Over the past six months, the Trump administration has upended half a decade of green industrial policy. It has clawed back billions of US dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.

Meanwhile, China has roared forward. Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined. To China’s delight, the US has simply stopped competing to be the world’s clean energy powerhouse.

Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China. Many of the newest high‑tech batteries are also being developed and patented there. While Trump repeats the tired mantra of “drill, baby, drill”, China is building factories, cornering the market for critical minerals such as lithium and nickel, and locking in export partners.

At the same time, household energy spending in the US is expected to increase by $170 each year between now and 2035 as a result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The bill, which includes sweeping changes to taxes, social security and more, will raise energy costs mainly because it strips away support for cheap and abundant renewables like wind and solar.

Household energy costs could go up even more as Trump threatens to make large‑scale clean energy development much more onerous by putting up bureaucratic hurdles. The administration recently issued a directive requiring the Secretary of the Interior to approve even routine activities for wind and solar projects connected to federal lands.

Meanwhile, climate change is hitting American communities harder with each passing year. As recent flooding in Texas and urban fires in California and Hawaii have shown, fewer Americans still have the luxury of ignoring climate change.

As the cost of these disasters mount – $183 billion in 2024 – the grifting of the oil and gas industry will become an increasingly bitter pill for the nation to swallow.

China’s foresight

China, with its authoritarian government, is less susceptible to the petroleum-obsessed dogma fueling the Republican party. It does not have prominent leaders like US politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, who previously warned that Democrats are trying to “emasculate the way we drive” by advocating for electric vehicles. Rather, China’s leaders are seeing green – not in the environmental sense, but in a monetary one.

It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations. According to a June 2025 report by Lazard, an asset management company, electricity from new large-scale solar farms costs up to $78 per megawatt hour – and often much less. The same electricity from a newly built natural gas plants, by comparison, can cost as much as $107 per megawatt hour.

Across the world, utilities are embracing clean energy, choosing lower costs for their customers while reducing pollution. China saw the writing on the wall decades ago, and its early investments are bearing a rich harvest. It now produces more than half of the world’s electric vehicles and the vast majority of its solar panels.

The US can still compete at the leading edge of the energy sector. American companies are developing innovative new approaches to geothermal, battery recycling and many other energy technologies.

But in the battle to become the world’s 21st-century energy manufacturing powerhouse, the US seems to have walked off the playing field. In Trump’s telling, the US may have simply exited one race and reentered another. But the fossil fuel industry – financially, environmentally and ethically – is obviously a dead end.

In this episode of Inside Automotive, Jim Fitzpatrick checks in with Tim Hovik, dealer principal of San Tan Ford, to discuss how these changes are already affecting his operations and what strategies his team is using to maintain momentum in EV sales. Hovik, who previously set a national EV sales record at his store, shares practical insights on consumer behavior, inventory challenges, and future demand expectations.

The rollback of EV tax credits is already influencing the car-buying process, with the $7,500 federal incentive playing a role in nearly every electric vehicle purchase, even if it wasn’t the primary motivator. With the credit set to expire at the end of September, dealerships face the dual challenge of encouraging buyers to act now without discouraging those who may miss the deadline.

San Tan Ford currently has a few hundred EVs on the ground. Recent customer inquiries, including a local pool company planning to buy three Ford Lightnings, reflect growing awareness of the deadline. As the word continues to spread, more customers are expected to act quickly to avoid losing the financial benefit.

""We're always adjusting to something. We adjusted to the microchips and to COVID. We're going to adjust to different tax credits and different incentives, and we'll move forward.""

Used EV inventory remains low, mainly because most early EV buyers are trading in internal combustion vehicles. Many EVs are still on short-term leases, and a surge in off-lease volume is expected over the next two years. That influx will significantly impact the used EV market as these vehicles hit auctions and dealership lots.

EV leasing at San Tan Ford is running at 65%—well above the store’s overall 15% lease penetration. For the Mustang Mach-E, 80% of transactions are leases. Until now, lenders factored in the commercial-use EV tax credit to lower lease costs. Without that contribution, monthly payments could rise substantially unless manufacturers introduce new incentives. The credit itself amounts to several hundred dollars in savings per month when spread across a typical 36-month lease.

EVs account for 20% of San Tan’s new vehicle sales, a rate higher than many non-ZEV state dealers. That success stems from positioning EVs as quality vehicles with a different propulsion system, rather than marketing them solely on their electric powertrain. Matching customers to the right vehicle based on lifestyle and driving habits remains central to the store’s approach.

Roughly 10% of the dealership’s salespeople drive EVs, compared to 50% of the management team. To improve EV selling confidence, Hovik hired an EV specialist from the electric power industry. That specialist supports the sales team and helps close knowledge gaps when engaging with highly informed EV shoppers.

Hovik expects EV sales to continue growing year over year, though at a more moderate pace than many predicted several years ago. Current trends show gradual adoption, often through “split garages,” where households own both an EV and a gas-powered vehicle. Early lease returns have been positive, with all recent EV customers at lease-end choosing to stay with electric.

San Tan Ford continues to market EV inventory aggressively, while also preparing for a new environment where tax credits no longer drive demand. Future growth will rely more on competitive pricing, targeted incentives, and accurate customer alignment than on government support.

This marks a slight decrease in overall sales year-over-year compared to the second quarter of 2024. Despite numerous setbacks, including tariff whiplash, the dismantling of ZEV incentives, and illegal clawbacks of federal funding for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, over 100,000 ZEVs were purchased in California in Q2 of 2025, surpassing 2.3 million sales to date. Californians are making it clear: ZEVs are here to stay.

The U.S. EV sales through the first two quarters of 2025 set a record at 607,089, representing a 1.5% year-over-year increase. Over 30% of new ZEVs sold in the U.S. are sold in California, according to the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Worldwide this year, 25% of vehicle sales are projected to be EVs. Consumers want to drive EVs, and the global move to transition to ZEVs is well underway.

The dip in sales, compared with a year ago, continues to be driven by lower Tesla sales, while non-Tesla ZEVs sales remain strong and stable.

Federal Incentives End on September 30, 2025

With federal incentives ending on September 30, 2025, the time to buy a ZEV is now. Tax credits up to $7,500 are available for eligible new ZEVs purchase or lease and up to $4,000 for eligible used ZEVs. Federal incentives for at-home charging and associated energy storage are also available, up to $1,000.

There are currently 150 ZEV models available in California — a 35% increase compared to Q2 of 2024. There’s never been a better time to buy a ZEV. Not only do ZEVs clean the air, but they’re also fun and powerful to drive and cost less to maintain compared to traditional vehicles.

California is the National Leader in Zero-Emission Vehicles and Infrastructure

California’s support for clean cars is unmatched. Despite federal headwinds, California has doubled down on improving the state’s charging network and making it easier than ever to own a ZEV:

– Over 178,000 public or shared private electric vehicle charging ports have been installed throughout California, plus over 700,000 at-home charging ports.

– California has nearly 50% more EV charging ports— public and shared private— than the number of gasoline nozzles.

– 94% of Californians live within 10 minutes of an EV charger.

– Grants and rebates for thousands of dollars are available for low-income Californians to purchase ZEVs.

Here’s some of what California is doing to make ZEV fueling accessible to all Californians. State agencies are working to speed up EV charger deployment, cut through red tape, plan for the expected increased grid demand, and efficiently electrify charging stations through local utilities. This includes:

– Providing grant funds that support publicly accessible and at-home charging installations, including in multi-family complexes, in communities throughout the state.

– Prioritizing shovel-ready EV charging installations for both state and federal incentives.

– Developing the Zero-Emission Vehicle Infrastructure Plan, a comprehensive plan that lays out the overall infrastructure strategy to meet California’s ZEV goals.

– Establishing charger reliability standards.

To keep UK public support strong for green policies, energy ministers – notably Mr Miliband – must ensure a well-planned green transition to bring down prices.","With net zero policies under attack from elected far-right populists as well as autocratic petrostates, and another summer of record-breaking temperatures in Europe, the failure to decarbonise the world’s power supply is as gravely concerning as ever. But the UN secretary general, António Guterres, struck an optimistic note in a recent speech in New York. The world, he said, “is on the cusp of a new era … The sun is rising on a clean energy age.” Pointing to falls in the cost of onshore wind and solar, and the risk of further gas-price shocks in future, he called on big technology companies – whose datacentres are one reason for soaring energy use – to adopt a target of 100% low-carbon electricity by 2030.

Given US president Donald Trump’s personal hostility to renewable energy, Mr Guterres may be right that it makes more sense to demand action from US businesses at this point. In Scotland earlier this week, Mr Trump launched his latest misleading tirade, urging European leaders to “stop the windmills”.

His repeated attacks on wind power, as well as the recent cancellation of billions of dollars of green energy investment, make Mr Trump a destructive outlier. But populist parties in other countries are also ramping up their opposition to climate goals. In the UK, such positions were once confined to the political fringe. Now, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, is a net zero sceptic who has floated the possibility of a future government quitting the Paris agreement, while her acting shadow energy secretary, Andrew Bowie, accused the UN’s most senior climate scientists of bias.

This disturbing shift rightly provoked a strong response from the government. In July Ed Miliband called out Ms Badenoch’s party for its irresponsible and anti-science stance. With the UN’s deadline for countries to present their climate plans (known as nationally determined contributions) coming up, Mr Miliband deserves praise for his commitment. Climate diplomacy depends on politicians having the courage to face down opponents – and convince the public that a safe and secure energy future is within reach.

This is the prospect held up by Mr Guterres, who hopes it will galvanise much-needed action. The goal, agreed two years ago, of tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030, is nowhere near being reached. With the UN climate summit nearing, all eyes are on China – the key player in the global renewables boom and the fight to stay within climate limits.

Internationally, and domestically, renewables are the right choice. Colonial rule saw Carbon Brief rank the UK as the world’s fourth-largest historical emitter, behind only the US, China and Russia. To keep UK public support strong for green policies, energy ministers – notably Mr Miliband – must ensure a well-planned green transition to bring down prices. Grids need upgrades to handle wind turbine growth. Supply chain bottlenecks and concerns about human rights in critical minerals mining must be addressed.

In Britain, proposals from Labour MPs to reform energy billing – cutting costs for low-income households that use less power – aren’t just about lowering inflation. They raise a deeper question of fairness, and deserve serious attention as a step toward a more equal energy system, potentially through a social tariff. Ultimately, reforms should cut gas’s sway over electricity prices and couple optimism on renewables with honesty about the challenges.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27525c583ea4385e57503af74841580715aa553b/619_0_4640_3712/master/4640.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=300bed32e55615d6056ae9d51ebef460",N,,2025-08-02 14:02:57.750416

Lexington, Kentucky, has emerged as a prime example of this trend, with its proposed solar farm on the decommissioned Haley Pike Landfill. This project, which aims to convert 400 acres of the 618-acre site into a 100,000-megawatt-hour-per-year solar facility, offers a compelling case study for investors and policymakers alike. By analyzing the financial structure, regulatory context, and comparative performance of similar projects, this article assesses the viability of brownfield solar development as a long-term investment.

The Lexington Model: Lease Revenue and Tax Incentives

The Haley Pike Landfill project, spearheaded by Edelen Renewables, is structured to minimize upfront costs for the city while maximizing long-term returns. The Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) will lease the land for 30–40 years, generating annual revenue between $171,000 and $265,000. This model avoids direct city investment, relying instead on the developer to finance construction and operations. Crucially, the project aligns with the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)'s tax incentives, which offer up to 10% additional credits for renewable energy developed on brownfields. To qualify, construction must begin by July 2026 or operations must start by December 2027—deadlines Edelen aims to meet.

The project's financial appeal is further bolstered by its projected energy output. Once operational, the facility will supply clean power to Kentucky Utilities, generating revenue through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and renewable energy certificates (RECs). With solar's average ROI at 13.52% for commercial installations (per 2024 data), and the IRA's tax credits reducing capital costs by up to 30%, the project's internal rate of return (IRR) could reach 8–10%, rivaling traditional infrastructure investments.

Comparative Case Studies: Proving the Model's Scalability

Lexington's approach mirrors successful brownfield solar projects in other mid-sized cities. For instance, Vermont's Elizabeth Mine Solar Project (2016), developed on a former copper mine site, generates 5 MW of electricity—enough to power 1,000 homes—while avoiding greenfield development. Similarly, Illinois has incentivized solar on over 40,000 acres of brownfields, with projects like those supported by the Great Plains Institute demonstrating 15–20% ROI through state and federal grants.

These examples highlight a key advantage of brownfield sites: pre-existing infrastructure. Unlike greenfield projects, which require costly site preparation, brownfields often have grid access, flat terrain, and existing roads. For example, the 2021 feasibility study for the Haley Pike Landfill noted its 312 acres of suitable land, with no need for agricultural land conversion—a critical factor in states like Indiana, where 150,000 acres of mine land are being evaluated for solar.

Risk Mitigation and Regulatory Navigation

While brownfield projects face unique challenges—such as environmental remediation and zoning disputes—Lexington's strategy mitigates these risks. The city has already allocated $250,000 for a second feasibility study, ensuring technical and regulatory hurdles are addressed before construction. Additionally, the project's lease structure transfers operational and financial risks to the developer, shielding the city from liability.

Regulatory alignment is another strength. The project complies with Kentucky's Public Service Commission guidelines and avoids conflicts with local zoning laws, which prohibit solar on agricultural land. This contrasts with the city's legal battle over a 384-acre solar farm on Hisle Road, underscoring the importance of jurisdictional clarity. For investors, this regulatory predictability reduces uncertainty, a critical factor in long-term ROI calculations.

Financial Metrics and Long-Term Viability

The Haley Pike project's financials align with industry benchmarks. Solar farms typically achieve payback periods of 10–15 years, with revenue streams lasting 20–30 years post-construction. Given Lexington's projected lease revenue and the developer's access to tax credits, the project's net present value (NPV) is likely positive, even at conservative discount rates.

A reveals that brownfield projects outperform their greenfield counterparts by 2–3 percentage points, driven by lower site preparation costs and tax incentives. For example, Pennsylvania's commercial solar installations averaged a 14.45% ROI in 2024, while Delaware's lagged at 10.88%, illustrating the impact of state-level incentives.

Investment Implications and Strategic Recommendations

For investors, brownfield solar projects like Lexington's represent a dual opportunity: financial returns and environmental impact. The sector's resilience—solar costs have fallen 82% since 2010—further strengthens its appeal. To capitalize on this, investors should prioritize projects with:

1. Strong lease agreements ensuring steady revenue for 30+ years.

2. Access to federal and state incentives (e.g., IRA tax credits, state grants).

3. Proximity to transmission infrastructure to reduce interconnection costs.

4. Robust feasibility studies mitigating technical and regulatory risks.

Mid-sized cities with brownfield sites, like Lexington, offer a unique sweet spot: sufficient land for utility-scale projects without the high costs of urban development. As the sector matures, early movers in this niche—such as developers targeting the 43 million acres of EPA-identified brownfields—stand to benefit from both market growth and policy tailwinds.

Conclusion: A Blueprint for Sustainable Urban Development

The Haley Pike Landfill project exemplifies how post-industrial cities can leverage underutilized assets for clean energy. By combining lease revenue, tax incentives, and environmental remediation, Lexington's model offers a replicable framework for other mid-sized cities. For investors, the key takeaway is clear: brownfield solar projects are not just a sustainability play—they're a financially viable, long-term investment in the energy transition. As the IRA and similar policies expand, the ROI on these projects will only grow, making them a cornerstone of the renewable energy economy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 15:00:35.295205

The Trump administration recently released an “AI Action Plan,” which vowed to expedite permitting for the construction of energy-intensive data centers. During the unveiling of the plan, President Donald Trump acknowledged the growing need for power to run these data centers, which are being built across the country by companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft.

New reporting by the Washington Post suggests consumers are seeing a spike in their energy bills because of these data centers. According to the report, customers in the areas serviced by PJM Interconnection have seen their electricity bills increase. In Ohio, prices are up between 10% and 15%, while in New Jersey, prices have increased 20%.

Experts have told NewsNation that a 5-gigawatt data center could use more energy a year than many states — but they insist Big Tech growth isn’t solely to blame for the recent price increases.

“Data centers are affecting electricity, but they are affecting electricity planning at this point. They are not necessarily affecting electricity bills,” said Tricia Pridemore, president of the National Association of Regulatory Commissioners. “These large AI data centers that you keep hearing about on the news, they are in the planning and construction phase at this point.”

Supply and demand are believed to be behind cost increases in the PJM territory. PJM is a reorganized market; they have a capacity auction in which power industries bid to supply enough electricity in the future. Right now, there is a greater demand because more supply will be needed for these data centers. At PJM’s recent auction, prices went up a record 22%, according to Reuters.

“Within reorganized markets such as PJM, MISO, SPP, they go out and use independent power producers to generate electricity. Based upon the electricity that is available, those market prices drive the cost of the electricity to anyone in the system, whether it’s a residential customer or a commercial or a business customer,” Pridemore said.

According to Pridemore, data centers can reduce their power usage and cost by using renewable energy, and some are already tapping into solar energy.",https://www.counton2.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/08/AP21050650262509-e1754146560897.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-02 14:04:13.024654

CRE could allow private developers to construct nuclear power plants closer to “business speed” and free from as much red tape as possible.
If the recent nuclear energy summit is any indication, there is demand for new nuclear energy and new investment in the Show-Me State.","On July 17, Gov. Mike Kehoe convened Missouri’s first nuclear energy summit — a wide-ranging discussion of nuclear power in the Show-Me State. The gathering featured engaging speakers, thoughtful discussion, an excellent venue, and, unexpectedly, some top-notch cinnamon rolls. However, what stood out to me was the sense of momentum, as the event was charged (no pun intended) with hope and ambition. Throughout the approximately seven-hour summit, a few key themes repeatedly emerged:

The urgent need for new nuclear power to meet soaring electricity demand, especially among businesses;

Progress on regulatory reform in Washington, D.C.;

The opportunity for Missouri to attract investment with abundant, reliable nuclear energy.

But even with all the great ideas discussed at the summit, I think one promising solution was missing: consumer-regulated electricity (CRE).

Bringing 'business speed' to nuclear energy

CRE is a policy concept that would allow private investors to create new, independent electric power systems (encompassing both generation and transmission) using their own capital. In theory, to operate outside of Missouri Public Service Commission (MPSC) oversight, CRE systems would need to be unconnected from the main grid and only serve new, large commercial and industrial customers such as AI data centers or energy-intensive manufacturers (which are driving much of the growth in demand).

These entities would still be subject to federal regulation, including safety and licensing oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for nuclear projects. Essentially, CRE would reduce some state-level red tape without compromising safety standards. In the sea of regulations that nuclear power developers must navigate, this streamlining could make a noticeable difference.

The concept came to my mind early in the summit, when Governor Kehoe spoke of the need for new nuclear development to progress at “business speed,” not “bureaucratic speed.”

Bureaucratic speed, sadly, has been the pace of American nuclear power development for the past few decades. With growing electricity demand and bipartisan support, federal reform is taking place in the sector. These reforms should be beneficial, and public utilities will play a key role in bringing advanced nuclear power onto the grid. However, CRE could also allow private developers to help meet state and national needs.

As demonstrated by Microsoft, Meta, and Google, many big businesses are looking for available, consistent nuclear energy to power their endeavors — and they need it quickly. CRE could allow private developers to construct nuclear power plants closer to “business speed” and free from as much red tape as possible.

During a discussion on economic development, one panelist noted that a key driver in site selection is how quickly a power plant can be ready for a prospective company. CRE could position Missouri to deliver quickly, not just with nuclear energy, but with natural gas, solar power, newly built or reactivated coal, or hybrid systems as well. The key is letting private developers respond rapidly and efficiently to the needs of large customers.

However, CRE is not only about speed. It could also relieve strain on the primary grid without burdening ratepayers. Rather than relying on ratepayers to fund new power plants to accommodate rising electricity demand driven by large consumers, CRE could provide a targeted, private-sector solution. New Hampshire moved forward with CRE this past session, and Missouri may benefit from evaluating how its statutes could be amended to allow for such innovation.

If the recent nuclear energy summit is any indication, there is demand for new nuclear energy and new investment in the Show-Me State. To move toward these goals while taking advantage of ongoing federal reform, Missouri should allow private developers to help meet this demand and bring new energy online at business speed.

From 2022 to 2024, the popularity of battery EVs (BEVs), plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) and hybrid EVs (HEVs) in Thailand surged.
To qualify for a 2% excise tax rate, manufacturers must use domestically produced parts as specified.
If they do not use the required locally produced components, the excise tax rate will be 10%, said the source.
By 2030, automakers must use inverters manufactured domestically to qualify for the lower excise tax rate.","Former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra said during a recent conference that the government should impose a high excise tax on imported electric vehicles (EVs) that use a low proportion of local content.

Thailand's free trade agreements (FTAs) with some countries have resulted in a 0% import tariff on EVs, which hampers the domestic auto industry.

Thaksin said imported EVs should be required to use a minimum level of local content, such as car seats, to protect the domestic industry.

Thailand signed an FTA with China primarily using the Asean-China FTA framework around 20 years ago, setting zero tariffs on imports, including EVs.

Following the speech, the Excise Department is preparing to adjust the excise tax structure for vehicles, linking it to the use of local content.

Imported EVs with a high proportion of domestically manufactured components will, in principle, be eligible for a lower excise tax rate than those with a smaller proportion of local content.

Fully imported vehicles or completely built-up units would be subject to higher excise taxes.

According to Deputy Finance Minister Paopoom Rojanasakul, the goal is to support the domestic auto parts industry by encouraging the automotive sector to increase the use of domestically manufactured parts via tax incentives.

However, pundits say it is likely such attempts partially stem from ongoing US tariff threats.

Will lower import tariffs give American cars a competitive edge?

Thailand's automotive industry is unlikely to be affected by the reduction of import tariffs as American vehicles do not have any advantages over cars produced in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand, in terms of parts prices, quality, or the speed of model updates, said Sompop Manarungsan, an analyst on the Chinese and American economies.

Chinese and Japanese automakers tend to update models faster, responding to consumer demand more effectively than US automakers, he said.

Mr Sompop said American cars have always struggled to penetrate foreign markets, even when import tariffs were low. For example, in Japan American cars have a limited market share due to these reasons. The global automotive industry is also transitioning towards EVs.

In the US, Tesla is the only major EV manufacturer as the first administration of US President Donald Trump ended policies promoting EVs, hindering the development of the country's EV industry.

Meanwhile, Southeast Asia's auto industry, particularly Thailand, is increasingly shifting to EVs. As well as being more affordable, there is a wider range of attractive models and they are more energy-efficient than cars powered by internal combustion engines (ICE), said Mr Sompop.

From 2022 to 2024, the popularity of battery EVs (BEVs), plug-in hybrid EVs (PHEVs) and hybrid EVs (HEVs) in Thailand surged.

EV registrations rose from 84,500 units in 2022 to 206,000 units in 2024. During that period, 644 projects applied to the Board of Investment (BoI) for investment promotion for EV production and parts, with a combined investment value exceeding 280 billion baht.

In the first half of 2025, 57,289 new BEV passenger cars were registered in Thailand, a 52% increase year-on-year, accounting for more than 15% of all new car registrations, the highest proportion in the region.

Thailand has more than 203,000 registered BEV passenger cars, 71,900 electric motorcycles, 3,800 electric buses and trucks, and 1,000 electric three-wheelers.

What is the state of the EV market in Thailand?

Many Chinese EV brands built manufacturing plants in Thailand, including battery factories. However, intense price competition forced some EV brands out of the market, requiring them to return government incentives, such as EV purchase subsidies of up to 150,000 baht per car and excise tax reductions, in addition to tax penalties.

Due to this fierce competition, the National EV Policy Committee, also known as the EV Board, was compelled to adjust the production-to-import compensation measures to prevent an EV glut in the domestic market.

The board last week eased production requirements for EV manufacturers participating in EV incentive schemes if they produce BEVs for export, in an effort to promote Thailand as an EV export base.

The two schemes -- EV3.0 and EV3.5 -- require manufacturers to produce EVs locally to compensate for imported vehicles since the start of the schemes in 2022 prior to commencing local production.

These production requirements have become an uphill task for companies as the domestic market stagnates.

Under EV3.0, companies that started producing BEVs in 2024 are committed to a 1:1 ratio target, meaning they must produce one BEV domestically for every EV they import.

If commencing production in 2025, the ratio is set at 1.5 locally produced BEV for each imported BEV. The ratios are set at 1:2 and 1:3 for manufacturers under the EV3.5 programme, which is aimed at propelling EV industry growth between 2024 and 2027.

This approach, proposed by the Federation of Thai Industries, is expected to increase the number of EV exports to roughly 12,500 units this year and 52,000 units in 2026.

What is the goal of the tax promotion measures for EVs?

Thailand clearly wants to shift from being a leading producer of ICE-powered vehicles -- ranked 10th globally in 2023 -- to production of EVs.

To support this transition, the Excise Department designed tax measures to attract automakers to establish EV production bases in here, especially for EV components, such as inverters, which convert direct current (DC) into alternating current (AC); batteries; battery management systems, which monitor and control the battery system to ensure safety, performance and lifespan; and drive control units, which manage the propulsion of electric motors by processing inputs from the accelerator, steering, and braking systems and sending commands to the inverter.

A source from the Excise Department who requested anonymity said after the EV promotion measures expire in 2025, the department plans to implement tax measures to make Thailand a production base for EVs, particularly for the manufacturing of key components.

To qualify for a 2% excise tax rate, manufacturers must use domestically produced parts as specified. If they do not use the required locally produced components, the excise tax rate will be 10%, said the source.

The requirement to use locally made components will be implemented in stages, noted the source. Starting in 2026, automakers wishing to benefit from the lower tax rate must use batteries manufactured within the country, whether at the cell, module or pack level.

All EV manufacturers with facilities in Thailand are capable of producing batteries at the pack level.

By 2030, automakers must use inverters manufactured domestically to qualify for the lower excise tax rate. However, if a car manufacturer invests in a battery cell production facility, it is not required to invest in an inverter production plant.

By 2035, manufacturers are required to invest in the production of battery management systems and drive control units.

As for fully imported vehicles from China that avoid import tariffs under the Asean-China FTA, the Excise Department plans to coordinate with the BoI for the latter to issue support measures for EVs that use local content, according to the source, meaning imported EVs meeting the specified proportion of local content will be eligible for a lower excise tax rate.

Investment promotion for EV production, key components, charging stations, and battery swapping stations tallied a cumulative value of 138 billion baht, including: 21 BEV manufacturing projects with a total investment of 41 billion baht and a combined production capacity of 386,000 units per year; 16 electric motorcycle manufacturing projects with a total investment of 990 million baht and a combined production capacity of 810,000 units per year; and three electric bus and truck manufacturing projects with a total investment of 2.20 billion baht and a combined production capacity of 4,800 units per year.

For battery manufacturing plants, there were 53 projects with a total investment of 80.1 billion baht. Production of other key components such as traction motors, battery management systems, drive control units, and on-board chargers tallied 42 projects with a total investment of 6.52 billion baht.

EV charging stations garnered 29 projects with a total investment of 5.56 billion baht to install 20,080 charging points, including 7,360 quick-charge points. There were five battery swapping station projects with a total investment of 1.28 billion baht, comprising 555 stations for motorcycles, seven stations for large commercial vehicles, and six stations for passenger cars.

As of March 2025, there were 3,720 public EV charging stations with 11,622 charging points nationwide. These consist of 6,524 DC (fast) chargers and 5,098 AC chargers, with coverage across all regions of the country.

Government support for the transition from ICE vehicles to EVs included an excise tax reduction for hybrid vehicles that emit no more than 100 grammes per kilogramme of CO2 to 6% for seven years.

Tax incentives were also revised for PHEVs, which can be developed into EVs in the future. The previous qualification for the 5% excise tax rate had two conditions: an electric range of at least 80 kilometres per full charge and a fuel tank capacity not exceeding 45 litres.

The fuel tank capacity condition was eliminated to better align with vehicle design considerations.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/08/02/5724689_700.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 18:01:53.433080

Mobile charging services are helping ensure that future is also convenient and accessible for everyone.","San Diego has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to sustainability and innovation. From the solar panels dotting rooftops in Hillcrest to the wind turbines visible from Interstate 8, the region embraces clean energy. So it's no surprise that electric vehicles have found a welcoming home here, from the beach communities of La Jolla to the suburban neighborhoods of Poway and everything in between.

But anyone who's driven an EV around San Diego County knows that our beautiful, sprawling region presents unique charging challenges. Whether you're commuting from Carlsbad to downtown, heading to Balboa Park for the weekend, or making the trek to Mission Beach, finding convenient charging can sometimes feel like a puzzle.

Enter mobile EV charging – a service that's starting to reshape how San Diegans think about powering their electric vehicles. Instead of driving to a charging station, the charging comes to you, wherever you happen to be parked across the county.

The process is elegantly simple: when your battery runs low, you request charging through an app or phone call. A trained technician arrives with portable charging equipment or a van loaded with battery packs. They handle the connection and monitoring while you go about your business – whether that's working, shopping, or enjoying one of San Diego's countless outdoor activities. Payment happens automatically through the app.

What struck me most about this concept is how perfectly it fits San Diego's lifestyle. This is a region where people are constantly on the move, often in beautiful but spread-out locations. Having charging adapt to your schedule rather than the other way around feels like a natural evolution for a tech-savvy, environmentally conscious community.

The service addresses something that goes beyond mere convenience. Range anxiety – the worry about running out of battery – often isn't about actual range limitations. It's about the mental load of constantly planning around charging stops. Mobile charging removes that cognitive burden, giving drivers confidence to explore everything San Diego has to offer without constantly checking their battery level.

San Diego's Charging Landscape

San Diego County actually has solid charging infrastructure for a region of its size. Hundreds of public charging stations dot the area, from Electrify America's fast-charging networks to ChargePoint stations at shopping centers and office buildings. Many employers now offer workplace charging, and apps help drivers navigate the growing network of options.

But San Diego's geography creates interesting challenges. The county spans from oceanfront communities to mountain towns, covering nearly 4,500 square miles. What works in compact Gaslamp Quarter doesn't necessarily translate to a day trip to Julian or a business meeting in Escondido. Charging stations aren't evenly distributed, and some of the county's most beautiful destinations remain underserved.

I've spoken with EV owners who describe the particular frustration of charging during peak tourist seasons. Popular spots near the beach or in Balboa Park can have wait times, especially on weekends when both locals and visitors are competing for the same charging infrastructure.

The housing reality also plays a role. While many San Diego residents have garages or driveways where they can install home chargers, others live in apartments, condos, or older neighborhoods where installation isn't straightforward. The region's many military families, who often live in base housing or rent short-term, particularly benefit from alternatives to permanent charging installations.

Mobile charging seems especially valuable for San Diego's outdoor-oriented lifestyle. Whether you're heading to Torrey Pines for hiking, taking the family to the Safari Park, or spending the day at Sunset Cliffs, mobile charging means you can focus on enjoying these experiences rather than worrying about finding a charger afterward.

The service also fits well with the county's significant business travel and conference activity. San Diego hosts numerous conventions and business events throughout the year. Having mobile charging available means visitors and locals alike can keep their vehicles powered while attending meetings or events without having to factor charging stops into already packed schedules.

From a regional planning perspective, mobile charging offers intriguing possibilities as San Diego continues growing and evolving. Rather than trying to predict exactly where new charging infrastructure should go, mobile units can adapt to actual demand patterns and serve different communities as needs change.

The future of transportation in San Diego is clearly electric, supported by the region's commitment to clean air and sustainable living. Mobile charging services are helping ensure that future is also convenient and accessible for everyone.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/688e1ca6e0bcca001cdf8cfe.jpg",N,,2025-08-02 14:04:51.373829

There’s an ironic literary parallel for an Environmental Protection Agency — under leadership of the Trump administration’s Lee Zeldin — that now ignores the first two words in its name: The “firemen” in Ray Bradbury’s classic “Fahrenheit 451” don’t put out fires; armed with flamethrowers, they torch libraries and piles of books.

Zeldin announced last week that the Environmental Protection Agency would seek to rescind the 2009 declaration, made during the Obama administration, known as the endangerment finding. The finding, following years of review of scientific research, concluded that six greenhouse gases, among them carbon dioxide and methane, were warming the planet and posed a threat to public health. That finding was used as the basis by the Obama and Biden administrations under the Clean Air Act to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions for vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources of pollution. Those regulations and tools are, for the moment, projected to limit billions of tons of emissions from entering the atmosphere that would continue to contribute to the rise of global temperatures, creating conditions that are raising sea levels, melting ice caps and glaciers and strengthening the intensity of climate events, including extreme heat events, flooding, droughts, storms and more.

The long-lasting danger in this latest Trump administration undoing of norms is that rescinding the finding is much easier — even though it likely faces a long court challenge — than it will be to reinstate such a standard, hobbling future administrations’ efforts to again regulate emissions and limit the worst of the climate crisis.

Zeldin and the Trump administration believe ending the endangerment finding will unfetter the U.S. economy. Zeldin told a conservative podcast this week that the deregulation he seeks will save U.S. businesses more than $1 trillion; impressive, maybe, until you take a wider view.

As Bloomberg Opinion climate columnist Mark Gongloff noted this week, that $1 trillion will come at a huge expense to Americans and the U.S. economy. A recent estimate from researchers at the Chicago Booth School of Business and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School estimate that the carbon emissions released by Zeldin’s rescission of the endangerment finding will result in a loss of $87 trillion through 2050; globally the losses could be some $192 trillion by 2050.

And those losses will come alongside damage felt more locally.

The abdication of federal responsibility, if successful, will significantly set back efforts to reduce emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change. Yet that only increases the duty for that work to continue at the local, state and international levels.

That work is underway, notably this week with the continuation of a Snohomish County initiative to develop its Community Wide Climate Resiliency Plan, which last week gathered county residents for an open house to start review of how communities can better strengthen themselves against climate change’s impacts and respond to its effects. (A similar state plan also is in development.)

“Unfortunately, we are already experiencing climate impacts and extreme weather events,” said Alyssa Rodriguez, with Cascadia Consulting, leading Wednesday’s open house at Mariner High School. “Our communities here in Snohomish County are feeling the consequences and the effects of these events through our health, economy and environment.”

Rodriguez started with definitions for climate vulnerability and climate resilience:

“We are defining climate resilience as the ongoing process of preparing and adapting for changes in climate while minimizing negative impacts to people, natural systems and infrastructure,” she said. “Climate vulnerability means how likely will people, places, systems, animals or plants be harmed by climate change impacts?”

The effort is evaluating six key impacts for the county, drawing largely from a report on climate vulnerability completed by the county last year:

Extreme heat: Snohomish County can expect eight to 20 more days of extreme heat each year.

Storms: An increase in frequency and strength of storms.

Flooding: An increase in heavy rainfall events that will contribute to flooding.

Sea level rise: Estimated to rise by 1.5 feet by 2050.

Wildfires: An increase in wildfires and impacts on air quality from smoke.

Reduced snowpack: An expected 45 percent reduction in snowpack in the county’s watersheds by 2050.

Those concerns are then used to determine vulnerability throughout the county — down to the census block — with help of a Climate Vulnerability Tool, developed by the county, that examines population density, demographics, health factors, infrastructure and more.

Wednesday’s open house gathered discussion on areas of review for the draft resiliency plan, including strengthening collaboration among local governments, agencies and community organizations; response and recovery from climate events and disasters; investments in infrastructure; planning for climate impacts; and the protection and restoration of natural systems.

Those conversations will be included in a process involving a survey and comments on a draft that will produce a plan by this winter to outline needs, priorities and solutions for future adaptation and response in the county.

“We’re specifically hoping to coordinate and connect all the varying resiliency efforts that are happening in the county into one place, identify and address climate related challenges, inform disaster preparedness, recovery, adaptation and mitigation plans to reduce impacts, reflect community priorities, values and ensure social equity and align with state, regional and other local priorities,” Rodriguez said.

As dystopian as the ending of Bradbury’s “Fahrenheit 451” is, included its final scenes are a community of nomads who have committed significant works of literature to memory, preserving ideas and hope.

“If we can’t see an eventual path to a market-driven business, we won’t move forward with the project,” Chief Executive Officer Darren Woods said in a call with analysts Friday. He also warned of possible delays in low-carbon gas for AI data centers and lithium.

Exxon announced plans for a multitude of low-carbon projects over the last few years as the company sought to be an early-mover in mitigating industrial emissions and counter criticism over climate change. But the Trump administration’s withdrawal of Biden-era subsidies threatens to reduce the profitability of such projects and halt progress.

The hydrogen project in Baytown, Texas, would produce 1 billion cubic feet of hydrogen per day and 1 million tons of ammonia a year from natural gas. Some 98% of the associated carbon dioxide would be captured and buried underground. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. agreed to take a 35% stake in the project while JERA Co., Japan’s biggest power provider, signed a non-binding agreement to buy half of the ammonia. Air Liquide SA said the project could use its pipelines.

But Trump’s tax bill narrowed the window within which companies could claim the 45V tax incentive from 2033 to 2028. Woods has always maintained that Exxon’s participation in low-carbon will only come if the company sees a pathway to investor returns.

“While our project can meet this timeline, we’re concerned about the development of a broader market, which is critical to transition from government incentives,” he said.

Further, the cost of hydrogen appears to be putting off potential customers, a major hurdle to Exxon making a final investment decision that would commit billions of dollars of funding.

“The price of the product is a big variable with respect to buyers,” Woods said. “We haven’t FID’d it and we’re not going to until we’ve got secured offtakers so that we have a lot of confidence in the returns that we’re going to generate.”

Exxon also sees potential delays in supplying low-emission natural gas to power data centers. Big Tech initially had a preference for low-carbon electricity sources for AI, but companies now appear to be focusing on securing large power sources irrespective of their CO2 content. Exxon’s plans in this area “may end up slipping as well,” Woods said.

Likewise, lithium is proving a challenge. Exxon had planned to produce the battery-material by 2027 but is still working on bringing down costs, which has become more important as prices collapsed by nearly 90% since 2022.

“That may take longer than we had anticipated just to get our cost down,” Woods said.

Exxon still plans to spend $30 billion in low-emissions investments from 2025 to 2030, in part to be well-positioned if the world moves away from oil and gas. Woods sees “good value propositions” in low-carbon but cautioned: “These things don’t all move in a straight line.”

Investment Implications For investors seeking resilient energy sector opportunities, Chevron and Exxon offer a compelling mix of stability and innovation.
Conclusion Chevron and ExxonMobil's strategic alliances are redefining what it means to be an oil supermajor in the 21st century.","The energy transition has long been framed as a battle between fossil fuels and renewables. But for oil supermajors like Chevron (CVX) and ExxonMobil (XOM), the path to long-term resilience lies not in choosing sides, but in strategic alliances that blend traditional strengths with emerging opportunities. Over the past year, these two industry titans—once fierce rivals in the “seven sisters” era—have demonstrated a surprising willingness to collaborate, even as they compete for market share. Their joint ventures in offshore Guyana, lithium extraction, and carbon capture underscore a broader shift: oil companies are no longer just energy producers but infrastructure builders for the 21st-century energy system.

The Stabroek Block: A Model for Collaborative Growth

Chevron's $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation in July 2024, which gave it a 30% non-operating stake in the Stabroek Block, is a case study in how strategic alliances can drive shareholder value. The Stabroek Block, operated by ExxonMobil and co-developed with CNOOC, is one of the most prolific oil discoveries of the century, with over 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent in reserves. By acquiring Hess's stake, Chevron resolved a contentious dispute with ExxonMobil (which had contested the deal via arbitration) and secured access to a project projected to produce 750,000 barrels per day by 2027.

This move is not just about oil—it's about securing a low-cost, high-margin asset in a region where production costs are less than $10 per barrel. For investors, the Stabroek Block represents a rare combination of near-term cash flow and long-term growth. Chevron's production from the block is expected to reach 186,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2024, with ExxonMobil's stake contributing to Guyana's oil output of over 1.3 million barrels per day by 2027. The project also aligns with broader trends: Guyana's government will receive annual royalty payments exceeding $10 billion by 2030, creating a stable regulatory environment for operators.

Lithium and the Energy Transition: A New Frontier

While the Stabroek Block anchors Chevron and Exxon's traditional energy portfolios, their forays into lithium highlight their adaptability. Both companies have staked claims in the Smackover Formation, a lithium-rich brine resource in the U.S. South. Chevron acquired 125,000 net acres in Texas and Arkansas, while Exxon entered the region in 2023 with a 120,000-acre purchase. Using direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology, they aim to leverage their drilling expertise to become major players in the EV battery supply chain.

Exxon's goal is to supply lithium for over 1 million EVs annually by 2030, a target backed by a nonbinding agreement with LG Chem for 100,000 metric tons of lithium carbonate. Chevron, meanwhile, is allocating 10% of its $15 billion annual capital budget to lower-carbon initiatives, including lithium. These moves reflect a calculated bet on electrification: by 2030, lithium demand is projected to grow 10-fold, driven by EVs and energy storage. For investors, the key question is whether these oil giants can replicate their operational efficiency in a new sector. Early signs are promising: Exxon's first Smackover well in 2023 demonstrated the feasibility of DLE, while Chevron's acquisition of Hess's U.S. onshore assets provides a platform for scaling lithium production.

Capital Optimization and Shareholder Returns

Chevron and Exxon's strategic alliances are underpinned by a shared focus on capital discipline. Both companies have trimmed costs aggressively, with Chevron's Q1 2025 adjusted earnings at $3.8 billion despite a 10% drop in oil prices. Exxon's 2030 Corporate Plan includes $140 billion in major project investments, with a focus on high-return, low-cost-of-supply assets. These strategies have translated into robust returns for shareholders: Exxon returned $9.3 billion in dividends and buybacks in Q2 2025, while Chevron reaffirmed its $10–$20 billion annual buyback plan.

The Stabroek Block and lithium ventures are particularly accretive. Chevron's acquisition of Hess is expected to boost free cash flow by $1.5 billion annually by 2026, while Exxon's $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources is projected to generate $3 billion in annual synergies by 2030. These figures highlight a critical insight for investors: oil companies are not just defending their core businesses—they are reinventing them to capture value in the energy transition.

Strategic Risks and Opportunities

While the Stabroek Block and lithium ventures offer compelling upside, investors must also weigh risks. Regulatory scrutiny of oil majors remains intense, and the energy transition's pace could accelerate faster than these companies' timelines. Additionally, lithium extraction in the Smackover Formation is still unproven at commercial scale, with technical challenges like brine salinity and environmental impact assessments.

However, both Chevron and Exxon are mitigating these risks through collaboration. For example, Exxon's partnership with SLB in Chile diversifies its lithium exposure, while Chevron's joint ventures in the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., the Blind Faith platform) demonstrate its ability to integrate new technologies. Their investments in carbon capture and hydrogen production further insulate them from decarbonization pressures, with Exxon's $17 billion plan through 2027 and Chevron's Bayou Bend and Gorgon projects positioning them as leaders in CCUS.

Investment Implications

For investors seeking resilient energy sector opportunities, Chevron and Exxon offer a compelling mix of stability and innovation. Their strategic alliances in Guyana and the Smackover Formation provide exposure to both near-term cash flow and long-term energy transition themes. Key metrics to monitor include:

- Production growth: Chevron's target of 4.31 million boe/d by 2030 versus Exxon's 5.4 million boe/d.

- Lithium output: Exxon's 2027 commercial production timeline and Chevron's Smackover drilling results.

- Capital efficiency: Free cash flow margins and ROIC trends, particularly as oil prices fluctuate.

These companies are also well-positioned to benefit from policy tailwinds, such as the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for carbon capture and lithium. For a diversified portfolio, investors might consider overweighting these names relative to peers, given their disciplined capital allocation and strategic foresight.

Conclusion

Chevron and ExxonMobil's strategic alliances are redefining what it means to be an oil supermajor in the 21st century. By combining their expertise in high-return oil projects with bold bets on lithium and carbon capture, they are creating a bridge between the energy of the past and the energy of the future. For investors, this dual focus offers a rare combination of resilience and growth—provided they can navigate the risks of a rapidly evolving landscape. As the energy transition accelerates, the companies that adapt fastest will be the ones that thrive.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 14:03:50.778256

A new survey by EcoFlow and Horowitz Research reveals that 61% of homeowners are feeling the pinch of monthly utility costs, while 74% expect electricity rates to increase in the near future. Another 75% said they are always looking for ways to lower their bills.

These findings come at a time of heightened concern about extreme weather and an aging grid. Nearly half of homeowners in California, Texas, and Florida, the three states included in the survey, anticipate more frequent outages in the years to come.

In recent years, these states have experienced some of the country's most extreme climate events. In July, Texas experienced the second-deadliest flash flood in the state's history. Florida is expected to suffer due to the rising sea level, and California has swung between extreme floods and extreme drought.

One of the best ways to protect yourself from rising utility costs while helping the planet is by going solar. Solar panels can dramatically reduce long-term energy costs and lower the amount of planet-overheating pollution your home produces. But for many families, the upfront costs of a solar installation can be daunting.

At the current administration's rate of decision-making, turning your home into a sustainable paradise may soon be prohibitively expensive.","The Inflation Reduction Act was a landmark bill for numerous reasons, but specifically as it pertains to climate policy. Simply put, it represented the largest investment in clean energy in American history and would have come close to the previous administration's stated goal of halving emissions by 2030. But in the blink of an eye, the pendulum has swung all the way back, and all of that potential progress is now in grave danger.

In place of the IRA now sits the Big Beautiful Bill, which is poised to undo virtually all of the environmental regulations and tax credits signed into law just three years ago.

Among the bill's many extreme implications, it doubles down on dirty energy sources despite the clean energy market's increasing cost-efficiency, and earned the ire of Tesla CEO and one-time Donald Trump ally Elon Musk for eliminating all financial incentives to purchase electric vehicles. Suffice it to say, the American environmental lobby has been dealt a major setback.

These changes are not immediate, however.

For instance, many of the IRA's tax credits expire at the end of 2025, so there is still nearly half a year left to take advantage of their offerings. For instance, one incentive that remains is a $840 rebate on induction ranges, which have rapidly become the superior option on the stove market.

They're safer than gas stoves, heat quicker, and are much more eco-friendly. Plus, for renters or people who cannot afford a major kitchen renovation, plug-in induction burners are excellent secondary options. They are relatively cheap compared to their full-stove counterparts (starting at $50).

Some of the clean appliance rebates from the IRA will remain after the passing of the BBB (including those for induction stoves, in fact). However, taking advantage of the incentives earlier rather than later could be worth thousands of dollars. At the current administration's rate of decision-making, turning your home into a sustainable paradise may soon be prohibitively expensive.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Inflation-Reduction-Actimage-recTdVoNhx0vPsDDc-e1754082785271.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 13:08:26.273588

You are receiving the notice because you own property within the Chapter 312 Tax Abatement reinvestment zoned established on November 15, 2023.
“I stand firm in my opposition to a tax abatement to Intersect Power.
“As everyone at this table already knows, we are in negotiations and have not negotiated a tax abatement,” Judge Porter said.
Next was to consider approving the Gray County Tax Accessor and Collector’s Collection Agreement, which was approved.","The Gray County commissioners and Judge Porter held their first meeting for the month of August, starting with public comments regarding the tax abatement negotiations with Intersect Power.

First citizen to speak was Denise Howard.

“We received a letter yesterday stating, ‘July 29, 2025, dear neighbor, this is a courtesy letter that is to inform you that the Gray County Commissioners Court meeting originally scheduled for August 1, 2025 to consider an updated tax abatement for the Meitner Project is being rescheduled. We will reach back out when a new hearing date has been confirmed. For all previous notice, Intersect Power is planning to develop an air-cooled data center instead of a hydrogen facility and will seek a new abatement to replace the existing hydrogen abatement that was executed on March 7, 2024. You are receiving the notice because you own property within the Chapter 312 Tax Abatement reinvestment zoned established on November 15, 2023. Being within the reinvestment zone does not necessarily mean your property is part of or immediately adjacent to any project facility. Our project infrastructure will be cited on private property under agreement with Intersect Power. We are still in the process of planning, including finalizing the exact locations of the project. Facilities will then share more information with the community as it becomes available. If you have any questions or would like to discuss this proposed project, we can be contacted using the information below. We welcome your feedback.’ Of course, we all know the listed information below is a dead end. My question is: if there’s supposed to be a request for consideration today from Intersect Power for a 30-day extension date for September 2, why are we already getting letters stating that they already have the extension?”

Next to speak was Justin Holman.

“First thing I want to lead off with is Intersect-Mr. Hudson knows that I’ve had trouble getting information out of them, and Mr. Haley has been concerned with that. I have yet to receive the letter they sent out. They were supposed to have sent one out after the last commissioners meeting, but I haven’t received it. They did in fact call me from an unlisted number. I did advise them it’s probably not a good idea to call from unlisted numbers, but it was just happenstance that I decided to pick it up. She didn’t answer any of my questions. She did tell me about this today, which I already knew about. I learned after the last commissioners meeting that they now have an unnamed partner. If they are going to be an applicant on this abatement, it is my understanding of the law, that should be public knowledge whoever the applicant may be. I just wanted to throw that out there in case you missed it. I’m against this, you already know that. There’s no sense in me saying anymore.”

Next to speak was Michael Pickens.

“I am out of Dike, Texas in Hopkins County, about 100 miles east of Dallas. I run one of the largest grassroots organizations in the state of Texas for the past five years, me and my mother have, out there in east Texas fighting a French company solar farm. It’s been a really bad deal. My connection up here is I have family that’s been in Dumas since the Civil War and other family that’s been rangers out of Amarillo before the Civil War, so I love the panhandle and it’s sad to see so much of this renewable energy stuff come up here that we have been fighting out there in east Texas. So one of the questions that I have about so much of the solar and wind coming in, is that the local politicians in these counties are Republicans, and the head of your party is President Trump. I didn’t vote for him, but I kind of like what he’s done with killing the money coming for solar and wind. I like the comments he’s made about solar and wind, how destructive it can be and how he doesn’t want it in this country. So I would imagine the Republicans that run all these counties would fight the solar and wind coming in and get aligned with the President of the United States. That doesn’t seem to be happening and it’s odd to me. I will tell you guys that a solar farm that was built across my mother’s fence in Dike has been a nightmare. No one ever got a job in the county at that farm. There was a crew from Minnesota and Montana that came in and built it and one guy out of Montana runs it. We sued the county on a 312 tax abatement about four years ago. It was done illegally and the county commissioners had gotten an abatement that was beneficial to the company but detrimental to the county. It’s a mess. I had testified down in Austin this year to try to keep solar and wind out of the 312s. It made it in the Senate, but died in the House, but we will try again in two years. I tell you guys that I’m teamed up with Denise’s group here in the panhandle and will do everything I can to protect this gorgeous part of the country. Thank you.”

Next to speak was Mayor Mike Borger.

“I’m here to speak in favor of this abatement. The wisdom of the commissioners court approved an abatement for this reinvestment zone previously for a hydrogen plant, which frankly had many head-winds and wasn’t as well-funded as what you’re considering now. This is well-funded, it’s cleaner, it’s quicker and adds more value to the tax base of Gray County. The last meeting when I was here, there was some concern that the tax base of Gray County as $1.5 billion, and this would add $3 billion, so it would triple the tax base and provide a lot of revenue for you gentlemen to get things done in the county. There are those who are against that, but I would challenge them to come up with a better plan in 10 years to triple the tax base in Gray County. This is a unique and rare opportunity. Who knew that out there in that flat land, parched by the sun with the wind blowing, it had so much potential? These days it does. We have naysayers that based on misinformation have all kinds of concerns about it, but I want to tell you that my sister lives in Abilene and has for a long time, and they have one of the largest data centers. I asked her how it was going, and she said, ‘Abilene is doing great and prospering like never before.’ They were a community like us tied primarily to oil and gas, but because production had dropped, so did their income and livelihoods. But she says that Abilene is doing great and there’s money there to do infrastructure projects and things they’ve needed for a long time. I said, ‘what about the trouble, is there trouble?’ She said she wasn’t seeing any trouble. These things that naysayers are bringing up are overblown and I think they have other motives. Maybe they already have land, cattle, and everything they need, so they’re not concerned with the income of others in Gray County. The fact is, the State of Texas which include a lot of impovershed areas that median income is almost $70,000, right here it is $48,000. That’s our challenge, and we have a great opportunity here to do something about. I encourage you guys, you were bold the first time and even bolder on this one. It’s a good deal. Intersect has been good community partners that give money to the important things here, and they’re going to stick around. People that haven’t done large transactions don’t understand that you have to protect yourself until the right time. I encourage you to approve this extension.”

Next to speak was Secora Belknap.

“I was born and raised, and have lived here in Pampa for 45 years. I’m against a proposed tax abatement. If it passes, me and my family will have to make decision to stay or go. I went on public record that I am against this deal. Intersect is promising Pampa a booming start, but they can’t deliver on that. Historically, businesses that come into Pampa fail. I am a product of that. I worked for a medical billing place for almost five years before they laid me off because they were losing clients. There’s too many unanswered questions by Intersect. This project has serious consequences that will be long-lasting even after Intersect leaves Gray County. Gentlemen, you make your decision and I’ll make my decision about what is best for my family.”

Next to speak was Sena Brainard.

“As I was driving here this morning, it crossed my mind: why did the Gray County commissioners put private property owners in the reinvestment zone when they had no desire to be in it? Our country was founded on the rights of the individual over the group. If you don’t know that, then you didn’t study your political science in school and I suggest you read it. Numerous people from the beginning told y’all, ‘we are not doing this, we are not participating with Intersect Power, and we want nothing to do with it,’ and then you included their private property in this line. You trampled on them, you did not listen to them. You could’ve struck your property off this line. They did not come to you and ask to be put on this. A company that preys on communities like ours came and asked you to put private property in these notes. You all say we don’t have to worry about imminent domain? Yes, you do, because you do not know that Intersect Power is known for selling their projects over and over again. They admitted it in the last meeting. They said they owned three, but you don’t know who they might sell this project to. It could be a public utility, and a public utility has imminent domain. There’s a lot that needs to be thought about and in the future, I hope when a private property owner appears before and says, ‘I don’t want this and I don’t want to be a part of this,’ you strike them off. It’s not right that you included their property into this stuff when they have no desire to be part of it. It’s not like they’re a block within the city like I am, these are individual private property owners dating back to the earliest settlers of this county and you put them in there without their permission. And they have appeared here meeting after meeting saying, ‘I don’t like this, this is what they’re doing to me.’ Their rights, individual, comes before the whole, and if you believe the whole comes before the individual, that is known as National Socialism and everyone should be against that.”

Next to speak was Rick Amerson.

“I stand firm in my opposition to a tax abatement to Intersect Power. What is this company bringing to Pampa? One million solar panels, 180 wind turbines, and three massive air-conditioned barns packed with high-powered computing equipment. What else? Jobs? Well, maybe a handful, but most Intersect employees work from home by company policy from the initiation. If a job can be done remotely, it will be. We’ve been down this road before: remember the pig farm? They promised to bring jobs in exchange for a tax abatement. How’d that work out? Where’s the pig farm today? Gone! That is, the pigs and jobs are gone, but the vacant barns remain. Their interest in Pampa expired when the tax abatement expired, leaving Pampa to deal with the detritus left behind. Will history repeat with Intersect’s barns? The AI equipment they install in the barns won’t last five years before requiring costly upgrades. Maybe they’ll upgrade once, maybe twice, but then what? AI technology is advancing so rapidly, it’s obsolete before a cowboy bucked off a bull even hits the ground. You rode the Intersect bull and it threw you before the 8 second-or rather 30-day-buzzer sounded. Intersect is offering a re-ride-don’t take it. Intersect says they’re constructing $3 billion worth of barns, plus solar panels and wind turbines. They’ll recover half that in tax credits. Billions of dollars held up waiting on a ten million dollar tax abatement from Gray County. Wow. ‘A dollar waiting on a dime,’ as my friend Wes Green says. AI is slipping through Intersect’s fingers faster than a greased pig at a dying pig farm. China’s DeepSeek changed AI, literally overnight. The Wall Street Journal says more overnight changes are on the way. That data center may be obsolete before they even paint the Pampa logo on the front door. If Intersect wants to come to Pampa, let them come as full-fledged, tax-paying citizens, just like the rest of us. No one here gets a tax abatement-I know I’m not-how about you? No need to push out the decision 30 days, because you already know the answer: just say no. What we get is a blight on our land, potential future issues with water and power, and higher utility rates. Are they helping to fund Pampa’s upkeep? Nope-you’re going to abate taxes for that. Road wear and tear? Nope. Same. You’re letting a homeless nephew move into our bedroom rent-free. He won’t mow the grass nor do the dishes, but he sure eats a lot, and drives our pickup using our gas. Does Pampa need another pig arms, this time with AI pigs? Many Pampa residents here join me in saying, ‘No way, no how, not now, not ever!’”

Next to speak was Kathy Amerson

“I want to start off by saying that I absolutely hate wind turbines. They are an aging, soon-to-be-obsolete technology that’s been propped up by federal subsidies, as part of the Democrat’s so-called ‘green energy’ intitiatives. Plus, they are incredibly ugly-a blight on the land. Wind turbines are also horrible for the environment, using much more fossil fuel to manufacture, transport, install and operate than they ever produce. They are dangerous to migrating birds who get killed and maimed by the blades. The blades themselves wear out all too quickly and can’t be recycled, so they are buried in deep pits in the ground, staying there forever. I understand that under Texas law, Intersect will supposedly be responsible for removing the wind turbines from the land when they decide to abandon the project. However, they are only responsible for taking out the first three feet of concrete support, leaving the other 12 feet of concrete in the ground. So once wind turbines are put in place, they can never really go away. The land will never be the same. As a CPA, I’ve been studying the tax provisions of Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill. As I understand it, this new law eliminates the clean electricity production credit and investment credit for projects placed in service after 2027, except for projects that begin construction within 12 months of the bill’s passage. So that tells me that Intersect only has until July 4, 2026 to begin construction of these horrible wind turbines. There are many companies out there building data center. I really hope that we did extensive due diligence in selecting Intersect Power. Intersect uses an LLC model for every different phase of their operations, which lets them easily wiggle out of any restrictions we may try to put on them. The land east of Pampa is incredibly beautiful. Open spaces, well-managed grasslands, and thriving crops. And yet, we are considering destroying this precious heritage by putting in forests of unsightly wind turbines, lured by Intersect’s promise of huge monthly payments to the landowners. But these huge payments may never materialize. As Intersect loses interest in this project, or as technology changes, we may be left with empty buildings, broken solar panels, and incredibly ugly silent wind turbines. If denying Intersect a tax abatement causes them to abandon this ill-fated project and go elsewhere, I will not shed a single tear.”

Next items on the agenda were to approve the minutes of the previous meeting, pay the bills as presented by the County Auditor, and consider any line-item transfers or budget amendments; all were approved.

Next was to consider a request from Intersect Power for a 30-day extension to September 2nd, 2025, at the Gray County Commissioners Court Regularly Scheduled Meeting, for consideration of a tax abatement for a data center.

“As everyone at this table already knows, we are in negotiations and have not negotiated a tax abatement,” Judge Porter said. “Because of that, Intersect has requested a 30-day extension for negotiations. If we do not approve the negotation 30-day extension, negotiations stop and we cannot continue unless they resubmit and application which starts the process all over again with a 30-day cooling period.”

“We have an executive session scheduled for August 18 and if we are to pass this extension, my understanding is that their partners will be here to talk to us in that executive session and all of us will be required to sign non-disclosure agreements until the abatement is resolved.”

The motion was approved for the extension.

Next was to consider raising the TCDRS rate from 11.0 to 11.01, which was approved.

Next was to consider approving no change to the sheriff’s and constable’s fees for Fiscal Year 2026, which was approved.

Next was to consider approving the Gray County Tax Accessor and Collector’s Collection Agreement, which was approved.

Next was to consider approving the changing the name of the bank account for the Vehicle Inventory Tax Account to the Special Inventory Tax Acount, which was approved.

The last item on the agenda was to accept the Continuing Education hours from the Tax Accessor and Collector, which was approved.

The meeting was adjourned with no further items to discuss.",https://delta.creativecirclecdn.com/pampa/original/20250801-173516-8f3-GrayCountyCourthouse.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 13:08:36.696055

The ITER project has successfully completed the sixth and final component of its central solenoid, a magnet so powerful it could levitate an aircraft carrier. This technological feat not only marks a significant advancement in energy production but also underscores the importance of global collaboration in addressing worldwide challenges.

Understanding the Role of the Central Solenoid

The central solenoid is a critical component of the ITER Tokamak reactor. As the pulsating core, it drives the fusion process necessary for generating energy. This superconducting magnet is essential for creating and sustaining the superheated plasma required for nuclear fusion. The ionized hydrogen gas that forms the plasma core reaches temperatures of 150 million degrees Celsius, which is ten times hotter than the sun’s core.

Inside the reactor, this extreme heat causes atomic nuclei to fuse, releasing a significant amount of energy in what is known as a fusion reaction. The solenoid itself, once fully assembled, will weigh nearly 3,000 tons, standing at 42.6 feet tall and 13.1 feet wide. It works in concert with other magnetic systems to create a magnetic “cage” that confines the plasma and allows engineers to control the fusion reaction. At its peak performance, the solenoid will endure forces equivalent to 13.5 million pounds, exemplifying the engineering marvel that makes this fusion breakthrough possible.

The Significance of a Magnet That Can Levitate an Aircraft Carrier

The extraordinary power of the central solenoid lies in its ability to produce magnetic fields strong enough to suspend plasma in mid-air, a necessity given the extreme conditions required for nuclear fusion. The temperatures inside the reactor are so high that no material container could withstand them, making magnetic fields essential for preventing contact between the plasma and reactor walls. The central solenoid plays a vital role in this process, providing the magnetic force needed to suspend the plasma for durations of 300 to 500 seconds.

This capability to levitate an aircraft carrier is not just a measure of power; it is a critical requirement for achieving effective fusion. The solenoid’s magnetic energy, quantified at 6.4 gigajoules, is a testament to its immense capacity. With this technology, the ITER project aims to produce 500 megawatts of power with an input of only 50 megawatts, highlighting the potential for a future where clean, abundant energy is a reality.

In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Capital Clean Energy Carriers today.
On that note, you'll want to research what risks Capital Clean Energy Carriers is facing.
For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Capital Clean Energy Carriers (1 is a bit concerning) you should be aware of.","Capital Clean Energy Carriers Corp. (NASDAQ:CCEC) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in couple of days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves a full business day. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Capital Clean Energy Carriers' shares before the 4th of August in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 8th of August.

The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.15 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$0.60 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Capital Clean Energy Carriers stock has a trailing yield of around 2.7% on the current share price of US$22.36. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Capital Clean Energy Carriers's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Capital Clean Energy Carriers has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.

Trump has pledged to ""unleash"" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.

Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Capital Clean Energy Carriers paid out a comfortable 33% of its profit last year. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out more than half (61%) of its free cash flow in the past year, which is within an average range for most companies.

It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Stocks in companies that generate sustainable earnings growth often make the best dividend prospects, as it is easier to lift the dividend when earnings are rising. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Capital Clean Energy Carriers, with earnings per share up 5.7% on average over the last five years. Decent historical earnings per share growth suggests Capital Clean Energy Carriers has been effectively growing value for shareholders. However, it's now paying out more than half its earnings as dividends. If management lifts the payout ratio further, we'd take this as a tacit signal that the company's growth prospects are slowing.

Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Capital Clean Energy Carriers's dividend payments per share have declined at 21% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring. Capital Clean Energy Carriers is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.

The Bottom Line

Should investors buy Capital Clean Energy Carriers for the upcoming dividend? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Capital Clean Energy Carriers paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Capital Clean Energy Carriers today.

On that note, you'll want to research what risks Capital Clean Energy Carriers is facing. For instance, we've identified 4 warning signs for Capital Clean Energy Carriers (1 is a bit concerning) you should be aware of.

Pabineau First Nation Chief Terry Richardson supports the New Brunswick government's proposals, which include an expansion of nuclear power generation in the province.
Wind power prices in a recent U.S. bidding process were far higher than what Ontario customers are now charged on their residential power bills, Leslie says.
The province's existing nuclear power plant, Point Lepreau, has been plagued with costly problems since it began operating in 1983.
""We all get nuclear power bills of a size that no one is happy with because of the extremely expensive cost of owning a nuclear power plant.""","On a gravel road by the side of the Trans-Canada Highway, New Brunswick's natural resources minister, John Herron, gazes down a long clearing cut through the forest.

He sees poetry — national poetry, that is.

Herron hopes one of New Brunswick's proposed ""projects of national interest"" will connect to an existing natural gas pipeline running under that clearing.

""This is a nation-building project that checks every box,"" Herron says.

The plan is to extend a gas line that now ends in Quebec City into New Brunswick to link with the Maritimes and Northeast Pipeline beneath the minister's feet.

The line carries Alberta gas routed through the United States, or gas extracted in the U.S., into Atlantic Canada.

But the Quebec extension would bypass American territory completely, creating an all-Canada route.

""The poetry kind of goes like this: You have Western Canada gas going into Ontario, through the province of Quebec, [by] adding additional pipe from Quebec City into Atlantic Canada,"" the minister says.

""That additional pipe, aspirationally speaking, would be made of Ontario steel.… This is a made-in-Canada solution. This is energy sovereignty.""

The proposal is on New Brunswick's list of projects submitted to Mark Carney's government for expedited regulatory approval under Bill C-5, which was adopted into law in June.

Carney underscored his own build-Canada agenda again on Friday, after the deadline passed for a trade agreement with the U.S. and U.S. President Donald Trump raised tariffs on many Canadian exports.

""Canadians will be our own best customer,"" Carney said in a statement.

The Eastern Energy Partnership

The prime minister's call for proposals has stirred interest from provincial governments across the country, not least in Atlantic Canada, where premiers see a new opportunity to boost their economies and meet a growing demand for electricity.

Many of their proposals fall under the label of the Eastern Energy Partnership, which envisions the four Atlantic provinces generating more electricity and transmitting it to each other, to Quebec and to other buyers.

They range from upgrading the subsea cable between Prince Edward Island and the New Brunswick mainland — likely one of the quicker, simpler projects — to a Nova Scotia proposal to build enough offshore wind turbines to generate a quarter of Canada's electricity needs.

Winning the ""project of national interest"" designation gets proponents a faster regulatory review process but doesn't guarantee federal funding.

It's also not a sure thing that Ottawa will approve the Eastern Energy Partnership projects as a whole.

""I don't want the perfect to be the enemy of the good,"" says Nova Scotia Liberal MP Sean Fraser, the minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.

""I think we have an opportunity — and in fact an obligation — to move as quickly as possible on the components of the partnership that are ready,"" he says.

Many of the projects face obstacles.

Bill C-5 has provoked a skeptical reaction from some First Nations leaders concerned that accelerated reviews will compromise their right to be consulted.

In New Brunswick, however, some chiefs are open to making deals.

Pabineau First Nation Chief Terry Richardson supports the New Brunswick government's proposals, which include an expansion of nuclear power generation in the province.

""I'm OK with it, because we need a solution. We need a baseline source of energy and right now we don't have any,"" says Richardson.

""I mean, renewables are great, but what do you do when the wind don't blow, the sun don't shine, and the water don't flow?""

Assembly of First Nations regional chief Joanna Bernard says many bands are keeping an open mind but will insist on equity stakes in projects.

""Back in the day, it was 'Here's some scholarships,' or 'Here's capacity building so maybe your people can work on the pipeline.' Those days are gone,"" Bernard said.

""We're going to own part of the company. We're going to be there on the ground, making sure environmental issues are of the highest priority. And the profits will go to the First Nations.""

Wind and nuclear power

Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston's Wind West plan to develop thousands of offshore turbines and export the electricity to other provinces could be a boon for national efforts to decarbonize its power sources, if it came to fruition at that scale.

Scott Urquhart, the Cape Breton-born CEO of a Copenhagen-based wind energy company, says the project is doable, with the wind off Nova Scotia being ""pretty much best in the world.""

But it may take a decade or more to get turbines turning, and at a considerably higher cost than the $5 to 10 billion the premier is forecasting, according to Halifax energy consultant Heidi Leslie.

""The estimate is really low,"" she says.

Wind power prices in a recent U.S. bidding process were far higher than what Ontario customers are now charged on their residential power bills, Leslie says.

At that rate, ""you're losing money on every kilowatt"" from Wind West, she says.

""And the further away it is from the place that's using it, the more expensive it is, because you need to build the transmission to get it there.""

New Brunswick and Nova Scotia are doubling their transmission links, but ""that will certainly not be enough to handle what is required,"" says Larry Hughes, an energy expert at Dalhousie University in Halifax.

New Brunswick's ambition to expand nuclear generation is also provoking questions.

The province's existing nuclear power plant, Point Lepreau, has been plagued with costly problems since it began operating in 1983. It is responsible for a large part of the provincial power utility's $5-billion debt.

More nuclear power — whether that is a second large reactor at Point Lepreau or small modular reactors — will only add to the financial burden, says David Coon, leader of New Brunswick's Green Party.

""It's insane,"" Coon says.

""We all get nuclear power bills of a size that no one is happy with because of the extremely expensive cost of owning a nuclear power plant.""

Affordability top of mind

New Brunswick Premier Susan Holt says she gets it.

Holt won a big majority last year after campaigning on affordability issues, and she's already faced blowback from residents about their power bills.

She hopes neighbouring provinces will share the expense of more nuclear generation in exchange for some of the electricity that will be produced.

""When I'm trying to deliver affordability for New Brunswickers, I'm looking at who's shouldering the burden with us,"" she says.

""How do we reduce the cost to New Brunswick ratepayers while still pursuing our objectives of clean power and reliable power?""

In addition to nuclear power, New Brunswick's electricity is generated by a combination of fossil fuels, hydro, and to a lesser extent, wind and biomass.

Without its emissions-free nuclear reactor, the province would need to burn four times as much coal, making it even harder to lower emissions, says Brad Coady, its vice-president of business development.

Meanwhile, the province's largest hydro dam, Mactaquac, needs a major upgrade that could cost up to $9 billion.

Lori Clark, the CEO of N.B. Power, says there's an onus on the federal government to help defray the costs of decarbonizing the power supply, rather than passing costs on to customers.

""I do really believe that the federal government has a role to play in this as well. They've set the deadlines for net zero,"" Clark says.

Herron is also looking for federal support, invoking the possibility of a government ownership stake in the natural gas line extension.

""I think there's an opportunity to de-risk the project if the project is initially state-owned and First Nation-owned,"" he says.

That would speed up permitting ""and it de-risks that investment for the private sector at a future date.""

Fraser would not commit to that — but he didn't close the door either, citing the precedent of the federal government's 2018 takeover of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project in British Columbia.

""More often, the right outcome will be that we create the environment that will incentivize investment, that will allow private companies to set up to succeed and to employ people in the region,"" he adds.

""But we don't want to write off the possibility that certain kinds of investments may be required for particular projects to make them viable if we believe the long-term interests of Canadians will be served.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7552150.1749070142!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/fedelxn-liberals-20250425.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-08-02 12:04:52.426803

The webinar, Transitioning to EV Fleets: Best Practices & Decision Tool, is calling attendees to register now for a spot in what's sure to be an insightful dialogue on an energy-conscious future.

The terrain toward electric has its share of obstacles: driving range anxieties, the puzzle of charging infrastructure, behavior, adaptation within organizations, and cost considerations are all part of the mix. These challenges are not just theoretical—they've been gleaned from actual feedback. Two surveys, executed as part of a Minnesota Local Road Research Board project, tapped into the collective brains of various state agencies, turning up data on the human element as well as the nuts-and-bolts tech and operational issues that come with fleet electrification.

Insightful analyses pegged to the nitty-gritty, like mileage studies, the optimal sizing of fleets, and strategic charger placements will augment the presentation, equipping agencies with tangible examples of how to foster EV adoption. This webinar isn't just about the 'why' – it's about the 'how'.

W.R. Grace operated the facility for 14 years, closing it in December 2024. But EPA investigators say over a five-year period starting in 2019, the company didn’t have a permit for treating, storing, and disposing of hazardous waste. The agency also said chemical solvents were improperly stored and handled.

This led the EPA to issue a civil penalty for $500,000, saying Grace violated the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, enacted in 1976.

In its Consent Agreement with W.R. Grace, the EPA detailed other offenses, including:

“During the Relevant Time Period, (W.R. Grace) stored hazardous waste in certain Totes and other containers…without visibly marking for inspection the date upon which each period of accumulation began and did not label or clearly mark each container with the words “Hazardous Waste.” During the Relevant Time Period, Respondent did not label or clearly mark each of the 8 Tanks listed…with the words “Hazardous Waste.” Respondent did not meet the permit exemption conditions for tanks and containers pursuant to OAR 340-102-0034 and 40 C.F.R. § 262.34(a)(2) and (3) during the Relevant Time Period.”

In an email to KLCC, a Grace spokesperson said the company chose to settle the matter to move forward, adding that there was no risk to human health or the environment. They said the issue didn’t involve any spills, releases, or improper disposal.

“The matter primarily involved a technical question about when certain material had to meet particular waste management requirements while it was onsite. We followed the required procedures for handling, storing, and disposing materials based on our understanding of when in the process they became subject to procedures under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.”

Grace argued the issue wasn’t about improper handling, but was about timing. The spokesperson also highlighted a settlement term in the 36-page Consent Agreement with the EPA, that they (“Respondent”) neither admit nor deny “specific factual or legal allegations” contained in the document.

Grace is based in Columbia, Maryland. It sold the facility to Lacamas Laboratories of Portland last year.

The University of Sheffield’s innovative approach bypasses this challenge. Instead, it uses renewable energy and advanced carbon capture technologies to create synthetic fuel.

At the core of this approach is a method known as Power to Liquid (PtL), which combines renewable electricity and atmospheric or industrial carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen. These elements are then converted into synthetic hydrocarbons, which are refined into SAF.

The process not only holds promise for reducing aviation emissions but could also offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for decarbonising other industrial operations.

NextGen-SAF plans to build the world’s first demonstration plant integrating two breakthrough technologies: a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The MCFC is capable of both generating hydrogen and capturing CO₂, while the AFT reactor transforms these components into synthetic fuel. The demonstration plant will test the full system’s performance, with the goal of scaling it up for commercial use.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

“We are proud to lead this pioneering project, made possible through crucial government funding, to develop a new route for producing sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is vital for cutting emissions in aviation, and this work represents a significant step in scaling up domestic SAF production. This project not only aligns with national sustainability goals but also strengthens the UK’s fuel production capabilities and long-term economic growth.”

The announcement comes as part of a wider £63 million funding package from the Department for Transport, supporting 17 projects across the UK aimed at boosting SAF innovation.

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution,” said Aviation Minister Mike Kane. “We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and cementing the UK’s place as a global leader in sustainable flight.”

The University of Sheffield is internationally recognised for its leadership in SAF research. Its Energy Innovation Centre is equipped with state-of-the-art pilot-scale testing facilities, enabling close collaboration between researchers and industry to trial clean energy technologies before they’re brought to market.

The university is also home to the UK SAF Clearing House, one of only two centres globally that support fuel producers in gaining certification for SAF to be used in commercial aviation.

Sheffield played a key role in the world’s first transatlantic flight powered entirely by SAF. Its researchers assessed the impact of the fuel on particulate emissions and contrail formation, with findings showing a reduction in emissions of up to 70%, thanks to testing conducted at the Energy Innovation Centre.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-8.png,N,,2025-08-02 15:00:29.386377

The liquified form of natural gas can help meet energy-product demand - but can the U.S. meet the challenge?

The European Union and South Korea have pledged to buy billions of dollars' worth of energy products under trade deals with the Trump administration, as the White House aims to capitalize on the role of the U.S. as the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. But are U.S. producers up to the challenge?

LNG - the liquid form of natural gas (NG00) - accounts for a sizable share of U.S. energy imports to both the E.U. and South Korea. That's why the new trade agreements ""represent a significant step-change"" for the U.S. market, said Rob Thummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital.

In 2024, the U.S. was the largest supplier of LNG to the E.U., accounting for almost 45% of total LNG imports, according to E.U. data. The U.S. also provided 12.2% of South Korea's total LNG imports that year, according to S&P Global.

The U.S. is poised to see $750 billion in energy-product purchases from the E.U. over a three-year period, or roughly $250 billion per year, and South Korea pledged to buy $100 billion in U.S. energy products over four years, or about $25 billion worth per year.

These deals encompass all forms of U.S. energy exports, not just LNG, but LNG exports are expected to ""at least double, and potentially more than double, over time,"" Thummel said.

The E.U. and South Korea are already major buyers of U.S. LNG, and U.S. exports of the fuel have been climbing since 2016, save for a period during the pandemic when energy demand sharply dropped, U.S. Energy Information Administration data show.

The E.U. is increasingly dependent on U.S. LNG, said Ed Cox, LNG specialist and editor at Independent Commodity Intelligence Services. He expects U.S. LNG to ""maintain and to grow its share in overall European supply in the absence of Russian gas over the next five years,"" but he said the idea of an annual $250 billion E.U. target for U.S. energy-product purchases is ""unrealistic.""

He said the global LNG market currently has a complete annual value of around $200 billion, including all supply, so it's ""hard to imagine"" how U.S. LNG alone could help bring that value close to the $250 billion annual target for the E.U.

Timing

The purchase commitments come at time when ""low-cost energy is essential for continued U.S. economic growth,"" said Thummel.

Read: Surging electricity demand is just one reason natural gas looks so appealing to investors this summer and beyond

""As we enter the age of electricity, electricity demand is projected to rise steadily for decades,"" he said. ""Natural gas, thanks to its reliability and scalability, will play a central role in meeting this demand.""

'As we enter the age of electricity, electricity demand is projected to rise steadily for decades. Natural gas, thanks to its reliability and scalability, will play a central role in meeting this demand.'Rob Thummel, Tortoise Capital

If U.S. LNG exports double or more, and natural gas continues to fuel electricity generation, domestic natural-gas demand could rise 30% by 2030, said Thummel. His company manages the Tortoise Energy Fund TNGY, which focuses on companies that benefit from rising U.S. energy exports as well as increasing demand for electricity,

U.S. energy production will need to ""accelerate"" to meet growing short-term demand, and U.S. shale producers have ""risen to the challenge before,"" Thummel said. He also said the U.S. operates the world's most ""extensive energy infrastructure and pipeline network.""

So ""if the world demands more U.S. energy, the foundation is already in place to meet that demand over the long term,"" he said.

In the short term, however, that challenge may not be quite as easy to overcome.

The U.S. has limited ability to increase its output of energy products, especially petroleum-based products, said Gary Cunningham, director of market research at Tradition Energy. And when it comes to LNG, most U.S. export facilities have standing contracts for their output already in place, which are ""key to them receiving financial support and reaching [a final investment decision] to start construction years ago.""

Most of these agreements are with Asian buyers, because European emissions rules, which had some prohibitions against using gas sourced by hydraulic fracturing, made U.S. facilities ""untenable"" for European utilities, he said.

That implies that for Europe to buy more U.S. LNG, it would either have to buy it on the secondary market, limiting the benefit to U.S. businesses, or commit to contracts for the next wave of LNG buildout, ""which is many years away, so they fall outside [that] three-year window,"" Cunningham said.

So the E.U. and South Korea commitments are a ""great gesture, but are likely not realistic to actually be met,"" he said.

Korean utilities, including Korea Gas Corp., or KOGAS, have longstanding contracts with LNG terminals such as Sabine Pass in Louisiana, so their commitment to buy more could ""manifest in them taking more deliveries of the cargoes rather than simply holding rights to the output from the terminals,"" he said. ""That does bring some firmness to export-related demands, but not much since the terminals rarely face periods where they decrease output due to a lack of demand.""

Meanwhile, he said, ""Europe can certainly strive to source more resources from the U.S., but how much will it need on a monthly or annual basis will change over time based on economic factors, weather and social shifts in consumption.""

Production limits

Questions about whether the U.S. even has the ability to meet such large demand for energy products were raised when the Trump administration announced that its trade deal with the E.U. included a $750 billion purchase of U.S. energy products by 2028.

Read: The E.U. to buy $750 billion of U.S. energy products. Why that's 'absurd.'

Cox said U.S. LNG production will double by the end of the decade, but that goes beyond President Donald Trump's period in office and is also based on projects that are already under development, with contracts in place that were signed over the past five years.

The trade deal with South Korea announced on Wednesday includes a commitment by that country to buy $100 billion of U.S. LNG and other energy products, according to a post by Trump on Truth Social. Along with that, he wrote, ""South Korea will give $350 Billion Dollars for Investments owned and controlled by the United States and selected by myself, as President.""

Investment in energy infrastructure could certainly help the U.S. meet the higher demand for energy products outlined under the trade agreements.

Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities USA, suggested in a recent note that the E.U. could invest in U.S. energy infrastructure, including domestic production of oil and gas, pipelines and LNG export facilities.

""That is not a new concept, and many U.S. energy projects are already owned by multiple energy partners, including international partners,"" he said.

U.S. conglomerate Koch Industries and South Korea's National Pension Service, for example, own stakes in the Colonial Pipeline, the largest pipeline for refined petroleum products in the U.S. In April, however, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners announced it had reached a deal to acquire the asset portfolio of Colonial Enterprises, which includes the pipeline.

""There are endless possibilities for the development of U.S. energy resources, and with the sudden explosion of energy-hungry [artificial intelligence], even a building of nuclear assets is a possibility,"" Yawger said.

Read: Trump and Meta's nuclear deals address the AI-fueled energy crisis. But can U.S. uranium supply meet demand?

An E.U. buildout of U.S. energy infrastructure, in partnership with U.S. firms, may be the ""piece of the puzzle that puts the $250 [billion] per year number within reach,"" he said.

Investors looking to benefit from this onslaught of energy-product demand can consider energy-infrastructure companies that operate export facilities or facilitate exports, Thummel said. Those include Cheniere Energy Inc. (LNG), Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB).

Those carbon savings are sold as voluntary credits to companies and are verified by third-party auditing.
Landowners earn credit royalties while still being able to harvest some of their timber, NativState officials said.
Louisiana landowners have already started earning royalty payments from earlier deals, company officials said.
Corporate officials from Indonesia, Japan and other countries have visited Arkansas and Louisiana prospecting for carbon deals, he said.","More than 63,000 acres of north Louisiana forestland are part of a new 10-year deal to sell carbon credits to a French petrochemical and natural gas exporter with operations in the Baton Rouge area and southwest Louisiana.

And the chief executive officer of the carbon credit company that was part of the deal says he expects continued interest from big industrial companies in voluntary credit sales involving Louisiana forests, though U.S. environmental policy is beginning to shift away from climate regulation.

TotalEnergies has inked the deal with the Arkansas-based NativState to enroll in 13 long-term forest management plans across 247,000 acres in Louisiana and three other states, officials with both companies said.

TotalEnergies says it is trying to avoid or cut greenhouse gas emissions where it can — including with permanent underground carbon storage — and offset the rest by investing $100 million annually in projects that will be able to generate at least 5 million metric tons of carbon credits per year by 2030.

The NativState deal, the value of which was not disclosed, is part of TotalEnergies' buildout of that carbon offset portfolio, which is also expected to include agriculture and wetlands protection projects, company officials said in a statement.

""We are working to build a high-quality portfolio and are paying close attention to the integrity and permanence of the emissions reductions and sequestration achieved by the activities financed in this way,"" said Gabin Poizat, a TotalEnergies spokesperson.

'Some give and take'

The company, which has the world's largest combined styrene and polystyrene manufacturing plant in Carville, says it already has 1 gigawatt of renewable energy under development to supply electricity to U.S. petrochemical sites, including in Carville, a Port Arthur, Texas, oil refinery, and plastics manufacturing in LaPorte, Texas.

NativState aggregates smaller timber properties to create economies of scale and, in long-term deals reached with landowners, sets up reduced harvesting practices to create a net savings in carbon emissions.

The deal with TotalEnergies involved more than 280 landowners in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee in a portion of the nation where there is aggressive timber harvesting, NativState officials said.

Landowners agreed to 40-year sustainable management programs with help from NativState's foresters and wildlife biologists that will reduce but not eliminate harvests.

Those carbon savings are sold as voluntary credits to companies and are verified by third-party auditing. Landowners earn credit royalties while still being able to harvest some of their timber, NativState officials said.

""So, there's some give and take there, but, in the end, in most cases, that landowner is getting as much, if not more, between the carbon credits and timber revenues on these properties,"" said Stuart Allen, founder and chief executive officer of NativState.

'Political pressures'

The TotalEnergies agreement is NativStat's fourth large credit deal. Louisiana landowners have already started earning royalty payments from earlier deals, company officials said.

The companies announced the latest deal late last month shortly before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it was planning to rescind the so-called endangerment finding for greenhouse gases known to contribute to climate change.

The finding is a key underpinning for the climate regulations that have followed in the 16 years since it was reached in 2009. The proposed change is part of a wider deregulatory effort by the Trump administration to spur energy and industrial production and cut consumer prices.

Allen, the NativState CEO, said Thursday that while shifting U.S. regulations may affect interest in carbon credits from smaller, domestic companies, it's not affecting the large international companies with which he is dealing.

They have 25-year planning horizons, he said, that extend past any single administration and face different business pressures than in the United States. Corporate officials from Indonesia, Japan and other countries have visited Arkansas and Louisiana prospecting for carbon deals, he said.

""And we bring groups in and their view on carbon and climate change and the political pressures on them or corporate investor pressures are considerably different than what we've seen here in the U.S., in some cases. And so I think the majority, we're not seeing any lack of demand from global players,"" Allen said.

These developments come amid India’s ambitious climate goals and its EV30@30 target—to achieve 30% EV penetration by 2030.

PM E‑DRIVE: The New National Anchor

Leading the charge is the PM E‑DRIVE Scheme, launched in late 2024 with an outlay of ₹10,900 crore until March 2026. It serves as the successor to the FAME-II scheme, focusing on demand incentives for e-two-wheelers, three-wheelers, electric trucks, buses, and ambulances. It also supports charging infrastructure, testing facilities, and domestic EV technology development.

Complementing it is the FAME-II Scheme, still in effect, which was launched in 2019 with a budget of ₹10,000 crore. It provides direct subsidies to EV buyers and encourages local EV manufacturing through phased manufacturing programs and battery production support.

Production-Linked Incentives Fuel Manufacturing

Two major PLI schemes are further strengthening the ecosystem:

The PLI for Automobiles and Auto Components, with a ₹25,938 crore budget, aims to increase domestic value added in EV manufacturing.

The PLI for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) with ₹18,100 crore promotes the creation of 50 GWh of domestic battery storage capacity.

Another recent addition, the SPMEPCI policy (Scheme for Promoting the Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars in India), offers concessional import duties to automakers investing at least ₹4,150 crore and achieving 50% domestic value addition within five years.

Tax and Infrastructure Reforms Support Rollout

India has reduced the GST on EVs and chargers to 5%, offers income tax deductions up to ₹1.5 lakh under Section 80EEB, and rolled out vehicle scrappage incentives. Norms now mandate one public charging station every 3 × 3 km grid and every 25 km along highways. A national battery-swapping policy is also in the works.

The BHEL EV Super App, currently being developed by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, will serve as a one-stop digital platform for charger bookings, payments, and station status updates.

State Governments Join the Green Push

Several states have aligned with the national vision by introducing their EV policies:

Uttar Pradesh EV Policy 2022 aims for 10 lakh EVs and 1,000 electric buses by 2030, offering strong purchase and registration incentives.

The Jharkhand EV Policy 2022 targets a 10% EV share in new vehicle registrations by 2027, with up to 70% subsidies for solar-based charging stations.

Haryana and Uttarakhand are pushing for 100% electrification of government fleets and commercial vehicles.

West Bengal supports EVs through discounted tariffs, green zones, and battery-swapping infrastructure.

Surat’s Green Vehicle Policy 2025 aims for 50% EV adoption by 2030, with plans to deploy over 460 public charging points.

Chandigarh recently expanded its EV incentives, raising the subsidized e-car quota and launching a pilot to power EV stations with solar energy.

Charging Network Expands Rapidly

India now boasts over 25,000 public EV charging stations, with Karnataka leading at 5,765 , followed by Maharashtra with 3,728 and Uttar Pradesh with 1,989. Both public and private players support these networks under government-backed guidelines.

The “Canary Solar Grid” project in Jackson County, just outside of Ravenswood, will help power a titanium manufacturing facility. A solar microgrid is an innovative, popular energy technology that’s giving businesses and communities access to cleaner and more reliable power. Energy generated by the solar array can be stored in a battery storage system for use during times when the sun doesn’t shine. This project is notable as one of the first where a large industrial plant is directly powered by a solar-plus-storage microgrid. It’s also supporting and strengthening domestic renewable energy initiatives and supply chains; 100% of the solar panels are sourced and manufactured in Ohio, and 100% of the steel used is made in the U.S. The project is a collaborative effort between BHE Renewables and Precision Castparts Corp.(PCC), specifically their Titanium Metals Corporation facility (TIMET). The companies are part of the Berkshire Hathaway diverse portfolio of businesses.

For 50 years, the 2,000 acre site was home to Century Aluminum. Their giant smelter was idled in 2009 and permanently closed in 2015. Since then the site has been an empty expanse along the Ohio River. Now PCC has started construction on the facility that will melt titanium while BHE Renewables is installing arrays of solar panels and large battery systems, which will form the microgrid that connects to the titanium facility. Demand for titanium products is rising in the U.S., driven largely by the aerospace and defense industries. As a metal, titanium is twice as strong as aluminum and weighs nearly half as much as steel, while still having a similar strength. It is durable, highly corrosion-resistant and used in industrial applications such as airplane wings and military armor as well as high-end consumer products like golf clubs and iPhones. Many people have titanium fused into their bodies, in the form of joint replacements, dental implants, and pacemakers. Transforming titanium minerals into a sturdy metal requires enormous amounts of electricity. The solar-plus-battery system will provide the reliable power supply the melting furnaces require at a cost that compares to traditional power sources.

The cost of building the solar microgrid system is eligible for investment tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August of 2022. The IRA provisions included clean energy production initiatives that addressed the crisis of global warming by helping the U.S. reach critical climate emissions goals of the Paris Agreement. BHE Renewables is constructing the microgrid in phases that match TIMET’s energy needs as it develops and operates its facility. Initially, the melting plant is expected to need around 18 megawatts of power to operate before ramping up to its full capacity by the end of 2027. The first phase began operations in May 2025 when the first solar microgrid panels were installed at the Ravenswood Business Park. Each phase contains part of the solar array and part of the battery system. PCC will have their TIMET facility use the solar energy to produce titanium products, creating the start of an industrial hub. It’s designed to serve 70% of TIMET’s expected energy demand. When fully built, the BHE Renewables project will include a 106 MW solar array and a battery energy storage system with a capacity of 50 MW, or 260.5 megawatt-hours. The project is expected to be a model for future industrial facilities seeking to utilize renewable energy.

Another company based in Michigan, ONE (Our Next Energy), will also be building a new factory on the site. ONE debuted a new utility scale battery storage system in February 2023 and will make the batteries the BHE Renewables facility will need right on site. And the company will continue to manufacture their utility scale battery storage system to market to other interested businesses. The batteries deploy lithium iron phosphate technology, a lower-cost chemistry that’s catching on for stationary storage.

This project may be the first to show that a microgrid can meet an industrial customer’s demands as well as create economic revitalization through manufacturing without polluting the environment.

With all of West Virginia’s members of Congress racing backwards towards the fossil Fool industry, my hope is more solar projects will materialize in our state’s future.

Favored oil, gas, coal and nuclear power

Cut back incentives for solar and wind

Reduced funding for clean energy research

Trump wrote that weak and intermittent energy supply puts the nation at risk. He said the grid is “precariously inadequate” and needs fast action.

Local Impact in New Mexico

In Santa Fe, crews from Positive Energy Solar work on a rooftop system at the New Mexico Finance Authority building. Technicians Francisco Visarraga and Russ Kazar ran wires from the panels to the inverter. But a sudden storm cut their day short.

Still, solar jobs matter in New Mexico: as of 2024, about 13,400 people worked in the clean energy sector. These jobs include panel installers, engineers, and maintenance crews. State leaders worry that federal cuts could slow this growth.

Aspect Before Cuts After Cuts Clean Energy Tax Credits $500 B (2022 IRA) $0 Private Investments $800 B committed Still in progress Federal Grants High Low

Strains on the Grid in Washington

Seattle’s Denny Substation sits under tall towers built in the last 20 years. Joe Nguyen, Washington State Commerce director, says utilities plan for decades ahead. But when federal help ends, those plans can stall.

Lines and transformers age. AI data centers now use more power, leaving less backup. Hot spells push capacity to the limit. If Washington and California both bake at once, power shortages could hit.

Rising Costs for Consumers

Dawn Lindell, CEO of Seattle City Light, warns rates will climb. She says:

“Grants and tax credits cut at the federal level raise construction costs. We must pass them on to customers.”

Supply chain snags and new tariffs also drive prices up. Lindell expects rate hikes to last 10–12 years, affecting homes and businesses alike.

National Industry Perspective

On July 4, President Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act. It removed about $500 billion in clean energy tax credits from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. At the same time, the EPA moved to roll back older climate rules.

Those 2022 credits had spurred more than $800 billion in private clean energy investments. Public surveys showed strong support for renewable subsidies. Now, with federal help gone, states and companies face new challenges.

Why the Green Transition Will Survive

Nils Kupzok, a Columbia University scholar, says clean energy will keep moving forward. He notes that technology costs have dropped:

Solar panel prices down by over 70% since 2010

Battery costs fell by nearly 90% in the last decade

Businesses see long-term savings, so they keep investing. And many states offer their own tax breaks and grants. Because of this, wind and solar growth may slow, but it won’t stop.

Private Sector Resilience

In San Jose, California, Mary Powell leads Sunrun, a solar services firm in 22 states. She visits a customer who leased panels and batteries.

“It keeps my lights on during outages, and it costs less than the grid.”

This real example shows why families and businesses value clean energy. When it cuts bills and adds reliability, demand stays strong—no matter what Washington does.

Looking Ahead

What’s next? The clean energy sector must adapt. States may:

Offer local tax credits

Provide low-interest loans

Fund new grid upgrades

Meanwhile, companies will:

Build microgrids

Invest in energy storage

Sign long-term power purchase deals

In short, federal cuts create hurdles, but they don’t stop progress. Clean energy has real benefits—jobs, savings and a more stable grid. And that means it’s here to stay.",https://microgridmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_2514979649-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 07:59:33.444023

Jonathan Fritz, R-Honesdale, state legislators and industry leaders Thursday for a series of facility tours and a roundtable discussion focused on positioning Pennsylvania as a national leader in the domestic production of critical minerals like lithium and rare earth elements.

The day began with site visits to two pioneering lithium extraction facilities that use produced water from the Marcellus Shale.

“The Avonlea/Kendra II facility in Springville and the Gradiant/C2G facility in Montrose showcased groundbreaking technologies that recover lithium from fracking brine — reducing environmental waste while strengthening America’s energy independence,” the news release said.

“These facilities represent the future of American energy,” said Meuser, according to the news release. “What we saw today is innovation in action — private sector ingenuity transforming waste into strategic resources. They’re proving that we don’t need to look overseas to meet our energy needs. By responsibly tapping into what’s available domestically, we can create jobs, protect the environment, and secure our national supply chain from adversaries like China.”

Following the tours, Meuser participated in a roundtable hosted by Fritz at The Community Foundation of the Endless Mountains. The discussion focused on how federal and state policymakers can work with private industry to expand critical mineral production, streamline permitting, and create rural economic opportunities.

Meuser also announced that he will soon introduce legislation to establish a production tax credit for companies extracting critical minerals — including rare earth elements from coal byproducts and lithium from fracking brine, according to the news release. These credits are aimed at unlocking overlooked domestic resources, strengthening U.S. manufacturing, and turning existing waste into valuable supply chain inputs.

“America imports nearly 90% of our critical minerals — many of them from foreign adversaries. That is unacceptable,” Meuser said. “My legislation will help reverse that dependency by turning underutilized materials like coal ash and brine water into strategic assets. It’s about pairing innovation with environmental reuse — converting industrial waste streams into sustainable inputs for clean energy, defense systems, and advanced manufacturing. … This is a win-win for Pennsylvania. We bring new opportunity to our legacy energy regions, revitalize local economies, and help the U.S. lead the next industrial revolution.

This story was originally published by Inside Climate News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Liquefied natural gas vessels are fueled by their cargo—they’re built specifically to make use of the gas boiling off from their tanks. Now Cheniere Energy, the largest US exporter of LNG, is seeking “alternative fuel” tax credits for that.

The claim has baffled shipping experts, because what Cheniere Energy is doing isn’t, in any real sense, an alternative. It would also provide little climate benefit over fueling the vessels with diesel, and seeks to use the credit in a way that tax specialists say was never intended.

Yet if approved by the IRS, the claimed tax credits could yield a payout for the company exceeding $140 million, an Inside Climate News analysis found.

In its annual report filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission in February, Cheniere disclosed that it is “actively pursuing” alternative fuel tax credits for its use of LNG in its shipping vessels from 2018 to 2024, the year the credit expired. The IRS is reviewing those claims, the filing said.

The alternative fuel excise tax credit was signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2005. It was intended to incentivize the use of fuels other than gasoline and diesel—including biofuels, LNG, and liquid fuels derived from coal—for use in motor vehicles, and it set no requirements for the relative cleanliness of these fuels.

Cheniere noted in its financial report that LNG is a cleaner-burning fuel than diesel or heavy-fuel oils and that the use of LNG was part of an ongoing effort to mitigate emissions from the company’s shipping operations. However, critics point out that fueling LNG tankers with diesel would be absurd, given that the gas continually boiling off from the refrigerated liquid cargo would have to be burned off anyway, or re-liquefied, if it wasn’t used for propulsion.

“It makes no sense not to use the fuel that you already have because of boil-off,” said Kirsten Sinclair Rosselot, an environmental performance analyst who runs the consultancy Process Profiles and was the lead author of a 2023 study that assessed fuel use and emissions from LNG vessels. “It’s not an alternative fuel.”

Cheniere declined repeated requests for comment from Inside Climate News. The American Petroleum Institute, a trade association representing the US oil and gas industry, also declined to comment.

Cheniere’s eligibility for the tax credit may hinge on how the IRS interprets one word: motorboats. The statute states that tax credits can be claimed for the use of LNG and other alternative fuels “in a motor vehicle or motorboat.”

“It’s a very aggressive tax position,” William Henck, a former IRS tax attorney and agency whistleblower, said of Cheniere’s alternative fuel tax credit claim. “It just seems like they’re pushing the envelope here.”

The tax law doesn’t define what constitutes a motorboat. However, federal shipping regulations state it is a vessel no more than 65 feet long. LNG tankers typically extend nearly 1,000 feet. “They’re talking about a tanker,” Henck said. “Does that sound like a motorboat to you?”

If the IRS approves Cheniere’s claim, the company would be eligible for a 50 cent tax credit for each diesel gallon equivalent of fuel used. Cheniere declined to reveal the size of the tax credit it is claiming. However, according to calculations by Inside Climate News, it could exceed $140 million.

From January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2024, Cheniere used company-chartered vessels to export LNG on more than 750 departures from its terminals in Sabine Pass, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi, Texas, according to shipping data from Kpler, a global trade analytics firm. The data was analyzed by Data Desk, which conducts investigative research on the oil and gas industry, and Inside Climate News.

Adapting methods used for an earlier Inside Climate News investigation of emissions from LNG tankers, ICN calculated that those export journeys burned about 770,000 metric tons of gas in the vessels’ main engines and generators. Applying the conversion factor approved for the tax credit, that corresponds to more than 280 million diesel gallons equivalent or a credit of roughly $140 million. These calculations do not include LNG used on the subsequent return journeys by the same vessels, which are fueled from a small quantity of the cargo retained for that purpose. If Cheniere is also claiming credits for these journey legs, the payout could nearly double.

ICN also calculated the total greenhouse gas emissions using LNG fuel, compared to a hypothetical situation in which ships were powered by the 280 million diesel gallons equivalent and simply flared the LNG boiling off from their cargo. Using LNG did reduce total CO2 equivalent emissions compared to the hypothetical diesel-fueled journeys, but only by about 12.5 percent. (LNG tankers have relatively high total emissions because of the methane that slips unburned through their engines.)

Companies should only assume the effects of a tax position in their financial projections when there is a 50 percent or more likelihood that their claims will be sustained after the IRS weighs in, according to guidance by the accounting firm PwC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets accounting standards for companies.

Cheniere stated in its SEC filing that it hasn’t included the tax credits in its projections. The company added that “we believe we qualify and are entitled to claim such credits” but acknowledged “there is ongoing uncertainty regarding the final determination of our eligibility.”

Anthony Burke, a spokesperson for the IRS, declined to comment, stating that “by law, federal employees cannot disclose tax return information.” He did not respond to follow-up questions about whether the IRS has received requests for guidance on the use of LNG in export vessels related to alternative fuel tax credits or whether the agency has provided such guidance to companies.

Lukas Shankar-Ross, deputy director of the climate and energy justice program at Friends of the Earth, said approval of the tax credit by the IRS would raise red flags. “If the IRS decides that Cheniere’s globe-spanning charter vessels the length of a city block are equivalent to 65-foot motorboats, then the independence of the IRS is obviously in question,” said Shankar-Ross, who drew Cheniere’s claim to the attention of ICN.

Fuel tax credits have long been a focus of controversy. Henck’s whistleblowing involved a situation in which the IRS began approving alternative fuel tax credits to paper mills for their use of something called black liquor.

That byproduct from pulp manufacturing has been burned as fuel in paper mills for nearly a century. Adding in a small amount of diesel—as little as a few drops—qualified the blend for alternative fuel mixture credits that resulted in the use of more diesel, rather than less, and were ultimately worth $8 billion, according to the Washington Post.

“It was aggressive enough that they got the credit in the first place,” said Henck, who at the time advised teams of IRS agents examining tax returns for larger companies. “But what went way over the line, and the reason why I spoke out, is they didn’t even have to report that stuff as taxable income.”

The IRS approved the paper mills’ tax refund amid lobbying by the paper companies. Shankar-Ross said he worries something similar may be happening now with Cheniere, whose claims may get a sympathetic hearing from the fossil-fuel friendly Trump administration.

Company CEO Jack Fusco attended a private meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April 2024, when then presidential candidate Donald Trump urged oil and gas executives to donate $1 billion to his campaign, according to reporting by the New York Times. Trump said the money would more than pay for itself in saved taxes and legal expenses, the Times reported.

Two months later, Fusco donated a total of nearly $500,000 to a Trump political action committee and the Republican National Committee, according to Federal Election Commission data. “If Cheniere is looking for a return on investment in its very generous contribution to the Trump campaign, this is certainly an excellent opportunity,” Shankar-Ross said.

Shankar-Ross said he worries that if Cheniere receives tax credits for its use of LNG, others will follow. That happened with paper mills, Henck said.

“You can rest assured that if Cheniere gets approved, anyone else in the same situation will file refund claims,” Henck said. “I guarantee you that.”

Cheniere spent just over $1.7 million lobbying Congress and the administration with its in-house team in the first half of 2025, according to federal lobbying reports. Part of that sum was spent on lobbying the Treasury Department, of which the IRS is a part, and the Executive Office of the President on “tax issues impacting businesses and the LNG industry.”

Lobbying on tax credits, Henck has found, can make all the difference.

“I hate to say this, but the actual law or common sense has nothing to do with this,” Henck said. “If they can get inside access, one-on-one meetings with the decision makers in the IRS national office, they can get this thing through.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1531248500.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-02 08:58:48.518567

The U.S. battery manufacturing sector stands at a critical crossroads as recent policy shifts threaten to undermine years of progress in establishing domestic production capacity. With growing competition from China and new trade barriers affecting critical materials, American battery producers are navigating an increasingly complex landscape that could determine the future of energy storage in the United States.

What's Causing the Slowdown in American Battery Production?

Recent Policy Changes Creating Industry Uncertainty

The domestic battery industry had been gaining momentum through supportive policies and incentives that helped close the competitive gap with Chinese manufacturers. However, recent policy reversals have created a climate of uncertainty that threatens this progress. Tax credit reductions, regulatory changes, and Trump's critical minerals order have collectively disrupted investment plans and production timelines across the sector.

Battery manufacturers who had made long-term commitments based on expected policy stability now find themselves reassessing their strategies amid shifting regulations. This unpredictability has particularly affected early-stage projects and companies without deep financial reserves.

The Critical Graphite Tariff Issue

Perhaps the most significant challenge facing U.S. battery manufacturers is the newly imposed 93.5% tariff on Chinese graphite imports. This decision stems from accusations that Chinese suppliers are ""dumping"" graphite—selling it at artificially low prices in foreign markets to gain market share at the expense of competitors.

The tariff presents a major obstacle for U.S. battery manufacturers because:

China currently supplies almost all refined graphite used in battery production globally

Alternative supply chains remain underdeveloped and insufficient to meet demand

The tariff could add approximately $1,000 to battery production costs per unit

Domestic graphite processing capacity is years away from meeting industry needs

U.S. manufacturers face immediate cost increases without readily available alternatives

According to industry analysts cited by the New York Times, these tariffs create a challenging situation where manufacturers must either absorb significant cost increases or pass them along to consumers, potentially slowing electric vehicle adoption and grid storage deployment.

Industry Commitments vs. Current Reality

Prior to these policy shifts, battery manufacturers had collectively pledged to invest approximately $100 billion by 2030 to build a self-sufficient domestic battery industry, according to the Clean Power Association. This commitment was made with the expectation of continued policy support and incentives.

The current environment has forced many companies to reassess these plans:

Early-stage projects are being canceled before breaking ground

Ongoing construction is being paused or scaled back

Hiring plans are being reduced or frozen

Research and development investments are being reconsidered

Supply chain development efforts are slowing

This disconnect between announced commitments and current reality creates ripple effects throughout the supply chain, affecting not just battery manufacturers but also suppliers, construction firms, and communities anticipating economic benefits.

How Severe Is the Impact on the Battery Belt?

Project Cancellations and Delays

The effects of policy shifts are becoming increasingly visible across the U.S. ""battery belt""—a region spanning multiple states where battery manufacturing facilities have been concentrated. According to ""The Big Green Machine,"" a Wellesley College-affiliated tracking project, projects are being paused or canceled at six times the rate seen in 2024.

The scope of the slowdown is substantial:

Approximately 34 major projects valued at over $31 billion are facing significant challenges

These affected projects were expected to create nearly 28,000 jobs

Larger projects are experiencing disproportionate impacts due to capital intensity

Projects that have already broken ground are being scaled back rather than abandoned completely

New project announcements have slowed dramatically in recent months

These projects include both battery cell manufacturing facilities and supporting infrastructure such as cathode materials plants, anode production facilities, and recycling operations—all critical pieces of a complete domestic supply chain.

Regional Economic Consequences

The slowdown is particularly affecting regions that had anticipated economic revitalization through battery manufacturing investments. According to Politico's analysis of affected projects, Republican-leaning districts are seeing approximately 60% of the funding decline, compared to 39% in Democratic districts—an ironic outcome given the political dynamics around trade and industrial policy.

Communities that had begun developing infrastructure, training programs, and housing to support anticipated battery industry growth now face uncertainty about whether these investments will pay off. Local economic development officials report:

Difficulty attracting ancillary businesses without anchor battery facilities

Challenges retaining talent trained for battery manufacturing roles

Uncertainty about infrastructure investments made to support planned facilities

Concerns about long-term community development strategies

The regional impact varies significantly, with some areas facing multiple project delays while others see continued progress on previously announced investments.

Investment Climate Deterioration

The combination of policy uncertainty and tariffs impact investment markets has created a challenging environment for attracting and maintaining investment in the sector:

Funding for new projects has decreased significantly as investors reassess risk profiles

Existing projects are being scaled down to conserve capital amid uncertainty

Long-term planning has become more difficult without stable policy signals

International investors are reassessing U.S. market opportunities compared to alternatives

Venture capital for battery technology startups has become more cautious

""When investors see policy changing unpredictably, they factor that risk into their decisions. For capital-intensive industries like battery manufacturing, policy stability is almost as important as the policies themselves,"" notes a financial analyst specializing in clean energy investments.

How Does This Affect U.S. Competitiveness Against China?

Widening Technology and Production Gaps

While the U.S. invented lithium-ion battery technology, China has established a commanding lead in both manufacturing capacity and technological innovation. Industry experts note this gap continues to widen under current conditions.

Bob Galyen, a retired executive who worked with both GM and Chinese battery giant CATL, offers sobering insights in an NPR interview cited by Oilprice.com: ""Unquestionably, the Chinese are ahead in manufacturing technology"" and ""Clearly, the U.S. is lagging behind."" He further notes that Chinese battery R&D ""is receiving major influxes of cash at a time when U.S. manufacturers are struggling for funding.""

This competitive gap manifests in several ways:

Chinese manufacturers continue to improve production efficiency and reduce costs

Innovation cycles are accelerating in China while slowing in the U.S.

Scale advantages allow Chinese producers to amortize R&D costs more effectively

Talent increasingly flows toward markets with greater investment certainty

Technology transfer between U.S. research institutions and manufacturers faces obstacles

Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

The U.S. battery industry remains highly dependent on international supply chains, particularly for critical minerals and components. Recent policy changes have complicated efforts to establish more resilient domestic supply networks:

Critical material processing remains concentrated overseas, primarily in China

Alternative suppliers face significant cost disadvantages without economies of scale

Domestic mining and processing projects face delays due to regulatory and financial challenges

Supply chain diversification efforts are being hampered by inconsistent policy signals

International partnerships for material sourcing face new complications

These vulnerabilities create both economic and national security concerns, as battery technology underpins everything from defense applications to grid stability and transportation electrification.

Innovation Challenges

The uncertain policy environment is affecting not only manufacturing but also research and development activities:

Reduced investment in next-generation battery technologies such as solid-state batteries

Talent recruitment and retention difficulties as researchers seek more stable environments

Decreased collaboration between industry and research institutions due to funding constraints

Slower commercialization of new battery innovations as pilot projects face delays

Risk aversion favoring incremental improvements over breakthrough technologies

This innovation slowdown could have long-lasting consequences as the battery technology landscape continues to evolve rapidly globally.

What Are the Broader Economic Implications?

Impact on Clean Energy Transition

The battery manufacturing slowdown has implications beyond the immediate industry, potentially affecting the broader clean energy transition:

Grid storage projects may face delays or cost increases, affecting renewable energy integration

Electric vehicle manufacturers may experience supply constraints or higher component costs

Energy storage costs could rise, affecting the economics of renewable energy projects

Clean energy job creation projections may need downward revision

Deployment timelines for critical infrastructure modernization could be extended

This timing is particularly challenging as utilities and grid operators increasingly rely on battery storage to manage intermittent renewable energy sources and improve grid resilience.

Global Market Position

The U.S. position in the global battery market is being reassessed in light of recent developments:

Market share projections are being adjusted downward for U.S. manufacturing

International partnerships are being reconsidered as global companies evaluate options

Competitive advantage in certain battery technologies is eroding without sustained investment

Strategic positioning in future technology standards may be compromised

These shifts could have long-term implications for American industrial competitiveness in a critical technology sector that underlies multiple industries.

Consumer Cost Considerations

The combination of tariffs, reduced incentives, and supply chain disruptions is likely to affect consumer-facing products:

Electric vehicle prices may increase or price reductions may slow

Home energy storage systems could become more expensive, affecting residential solar economics

Grid-scale storage projects may face higher costs, potentially increasing electricity rates

Price competitiveness with conventional alternatives could deteriorate

Total cost of ownership advantages may be diminished temporarily

While long-term cost trajectories still favor battery technologies, the current disruptions could slow adoption rates and create economic inefficiencies during the transition.

FAQ: U.S. Battery Industry Challenges

How significant is the Chinese advantage in battery production?

China currently dominates global battery production, controlling approximately 75% of battery cell manufacturing capacity and processing the vast majority of critical minerals needed for batteries. The technological gap has widened in recent years, with Chinese companies now leading in many advanced battery technologies. As Bob Galyen noted, China maintains clear advantages in manufacturing technology and R&D funding that will take years of focused investment for the U.S. to overcome.

Could alternative materials replace Chinese graphite?

While synthetic graphite production and alternative anode materials are being developed, scaling these alternatives requires significant time and investment. Current alternatives generally offer lower performance, higher costs, or both compared to established graphite anodes from China. Companies pursuing alternatives face both technical challenges and economic hurdles without established supply chains. Some promising alternatives include silicon-based anodes, which could reduce graphite requirements but face their own manufacturing challenges.

How many jobs are at risk in the battery sector?

The battery industry and its supply chain were projected to create over 100,000 jobs by 2030. Current disruptions put a significant portion of these jobs at risk, with approximately 28,000 jobs from major projects already facing uncertainty according to Politico's analysis. These jobs span manufacturing, engineering, construction, and support services—many offering higher wages than regional averages. The geographic distribution of these jobs makes the impact particularly significant in certain communities counting on battery investments for economic development.

Are any regions particularly vulnerable to these changes?

The so-called ""battery belt""—spanning states including Georgia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Michigan, and Ohio—is experiencing the most significant impacts. Many communities in these states had based economic development plans on battery-related investments. The impact extends beyond direct manufacturing jobs to affect construction, logistics, and service industries that support these facilities. Some communities have already invested in infrastructure improvements, workforce training programs, and housing development in anticipation of battery industry growth.

What would it take to establish a fully independent U.S. battery supply chain?

Creating a completely self-sufficient battery supply chain would require coordinated investments across mining, processing, component manufacturing, and recycling. Industry estimates suggest this would require sustained investment of over $200 billion and at least 5-7 years of focused development. Key challenges include establishing domestic processing capacity for critical minerals, developing technical expertise in advanced manufacturing techniques, and achieving competitive scale. A transitional approach might involve strategic partnerships with allied nations while domestic capabilities develop.

The Path Forward for American Battery Production

Despite current challenges, the fundamental drivers behind battery industry growth remain strong. Energy storage represents a critical technology for addressing climate change, improving grid resilience, and enabling the next generation of electric transportation. The question is not whether battery production will grow globally, but whether the United States will maintain a competitive position in this strategic industry.

The coming months will be critical as manufacturers, investors, and policymakers navigate the current uncertainty. Those companies able to weather the current disruptions while continuing to invest strategically may emerge in stronger competitive positions as the market inevitably expands. For the broader economy, the stakes extend beyond any single industry to affect America's position in the clean energy transition and advanced manufacturing landscape.

Furthermore, innovations in battery recycling breakthrough technologies and the development of new battery-grade lithium refinery facilities could help address some of the supply chain challenges, while investment in critical raw materials facility development remains crucial for long-term industry resilience.

While the revocation of climate-focused policies and the rollback of EV mandates have introduced short-term volatility, the underlying momentum of the clean energy transition remains unshaken. For investors, the interplay of industrial policy, technological advancement, and market-based climate solutions is creating a compelling case for renewable infrastructure and technology firms—particularly those positioned to meet the surging demand from cleantech and data center industries.

Industrial Policy: Deregulation Meets Resilience

The 2025 executive order, which rescinds prior climate directives, signals a shift toward deregulation and traditional energy expansion. However, this does not negate the foundational role of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in shaping a robust clean energy supply chain. Since 2022, quarterly clean manufacturing investment has tripled to $14 billion, with the IRA's Section 45X tax credits underpinning growth in battery cells, solar modules, and wind turbines.

Despite the policy uncertainty, domestic battery and solar manufacturing capacity now exceeds current deployment levels and is projected to align with demand through 2035. ZEV production capacity could reach 6.84 million units annually by 2035, a figure matching 60-67% of projected sales. Yet, wind manufacturing lags, underscoring the need for targeted investment in underperforming sectors.

The IRA's tax credits and green banks have insulated the sector from immediate policy shocks, but rising tariffs and project cancellations—$9 billion in Q1 2025 alone—highlight the fragility of this growth. Investors must balance the risks of a shifting regulatory environment with the long-term tailwinds of decarbonization.

AI-Driven Innovation: Accelerating Efficiency and Deployment

AI is the unsung hero of the 2025 energy transition. From optimizing supply chains to enabling next-generation technologies, artificial intelligence is reshaping how renewable infrastructure is designed, deployed, and operated.

For example, AI-powered robots are now installing large solar farms in desert regions, powering data centers with minimal human intervention. The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's PolicyAI project has streamlined permitting by digitizing environmental impact studies, reducing project timelines by 30%. Meanwhile, AI-driven predictive maintenance tools are cutting downtime in battery storage and wind turbine operations, enhancing return on investment.

On the demand side, AI is enabling virtual power plants that integrate distributed energy resources, smart grids, and real-time load management. These systems are critical for meeting the surging energy needs of data centers, which now account for 3% of U.S. electricity consumption. Companies leveraging AI to optimize energy use—such as those deploying smart meters and advanced analytics—stand to dominate this market.

Carbon Monetization: From Offsets to High-Integrity CDR

The U.S. carbon market is evolving rapidly, with 84% of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) credits now tied to renewable-powered technologies like direct air capture (DAC) and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The DOE's DAC Hubs program, funded by the IRA, is a case in point, but these facilities face a critical bottleneck: competing with data centers for clean energy.

The shift from voluntary carbon offsets to high-integrity CDR credits is creating a new asset class for investors. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, part of the IRA, has allocated billions to sub-federal initiatives, including the Solar for All program and Climate Pollution Reduction Grants. These programs are projected to deploy 36 GW of renewables and storage by 2030, further solidifying the link between carbon monetization and clean energy infrastructure.

Investment Opportunities: Where to Focus in 2025

The intersection of industrial policy, AI, and carbon monetization points to three high-conviction investment themes:

Battery and Solar Manufacturing: Firms with IRA-backed tax credits and vertical integration capabilities (e.g., companies producing both cells and modules) are well-positioned to outperform.

AI-Enabled Infrastructure: Startups and established players deploying AI for predictive maintenance, grid optimization, and deployment automation will benefit from surging demand in data centers and smart cities.

Carbon Management Technologies: Companies developing DAC, BECCS, and high-integrity CDR platforms are set to capitalize on the $50 billion global CDR market, which is expected to grow 20% annually through 2035.

Navigating the Risks

While the long-term outlook is bullish, investors must remain vigilant. Policy uncertainty and project cancellations could disrupt near-term growth. However, the underlying trends—rising energy demand, AI-driven efficiency gains, and the commodification of carbon—remain intact. Diversifying across sectors and geographies, while prioritizing firms with IRA tax credit eligibility and AI-driven operational models, will mitigate these risks.

In conclusion, the U.S. energy transition in 2025 is no longer a binary choice between fossil fuels and renewables. It is a dynamic ecosystem where industrial policy, technological innovation, and market-based solutions are converging to redefine the rules of the game. For investors, the path forward lies in embracing this complexity—and capitalizing on the opportunities it creates.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 06:58:47.507989

But one energy expert revealed the sweet spot for cooling efficiency isn’t as chilly as most people believe.
Gilgan explained each degree you raise the thermostat saves about three per cent on your monthly energy bill during peak summer.
“These tips work together with the right temperature setting,” Gilgan pointed out.
“You're not just changing a single thing, but creating a system that keeps you comfortable while your AC runs efficiently.”","AS summer heatwaves grip the nation, millions of Americans are cranking up the AC to stay comfortable – and watching their electricity bills soar.

But one energy expert revealed the sweet spot for cooling efficiency isn’t as chilly as most people believe.

Corey Gilgan, owner at Oregon Generators, said: “Most people think they need to set their AC to 68 or 70 degrees to stay comfortable, but that's actually costing them hundreds of dollars unnecessarily.”

The magic number, according to Gilgan, is 78°F (25.5°C) when you’re home during the day.

“Setting your thermostat at 78°F instead of lowering it to 72°F can cut your cooling costs by up to 10 per cent,” he explained.

“Your AC works exponentially harder the lower the temperature you set it to.

”Every degree below 78°F forces your system to remove more heat from your home, which requires significantly more energy.”

Think you’ll toss and turn if it’s warmer at night?

Not so, said Gilgan. He advised raising the temperature to 82°F while you sleep.

“Most people sleep better in slightly warmer temperatures anyway,” he notes.

“Your body temperature drops naturally at night, so that 82-degree setting feels perfectly comfortable under a light sheet or blanket.”

Every degree matters. Gilgan explained each degree you raise the thermostat saves about three per cent on your monthly energy bill during peak summer.

“People don't realize how much that one-degree change impacts their monthly bill,” he said.

“We're talking about real money here, sometimes as much as $30 to $50 per month for the average household.”

Stay cool without cranking the AC

To stay cool without blasting the AC, Gilgan recommended using ceiling fans strategically.

Run them counterclockwise in summer, he said, because the wind-chill effect makes it feel three to four degrees cooler than the actual temperature.

Another simple trick is to close blinds during peak sun hours.

Keeping them shut on south and west-facing windows between 10am and 4pm can slash indoor temperatures by up to 15 degrees in the hottest parts of the day.

He also advised timing your cooking wisely.

Avoid firing up the oven or stovetop during the afternoon heat and instead cook early in the morning, later in the evening, or take it outside to the grill to prevent adding extra heat indoors.

Finally, Gilgan urged homeowners to seal air leaks around windows and doors.

Even small gaps can let cool air escape and force your AC to work harder, but inexpensive fixes like weather stripping and caulking deliver immediate results.

“These tips work together with the right temperature setting,” Gilgan pointed out.

In a statement, Cox said it will invest more than US $10.7 billion in Mexico between 2025 and 2030.
Cox referred to Mexico as the second most-important electricity market in Latin America (only Brazil has a larger consumer market).
At the time of that announcement, the assets for sale were valued at US $4.7 billion.","Madrid-based Cox Energy has agreed to acquire Iberdrola México in a deal valued at US $4.2 billion including debt, the two companies announced on Friday.

President Claudia Sheinbaum called the acquisition “a sign of certainty in our country, of confidence and of a desire to keep investing,” at her Friday morning press conference.

“I have spoken to Cox management and they are very committed to investing in Mexico and to the development of various projects,” Sheinbaum said.

Cox, an 11-year-old water and renewable energy company with a market capitalization of around US $958 million, will buy Iberdrola’s 15 power plants. The news agency Reuters said 75% of the deal will be funded with debt and the remainder with equity.

Reuters said closing is expected by the first quarter of 2026. Approval is virtually assured since shareholders representing 84% of the company’s capital have already expressed support for the acquisition.

In a statement, Cox said it will invest more than US $10.7 billion in Mexico between 2025 and 2030.

The company defined the deal as a landmark acquisition, adding that it “aims to leverage [our] established presence and in-depth knowledge of the Mexican market, reinforcing its position in high-growth strategic markets.”

The company said it sees Mexico as a strategic market “thanks to its strong legal certainty” under the new energy regulatory guidelines in the government’s Plan México.

Cox referred to Mexico as the second most-important electricity market in Latin America (only Brazil has a larger consumer market). It highlighted the country’s “solid macroeconomic fundamentals and an investment-grade economy underpinned by a responsible fiscal policy.” It also lauded Mexico’s banking system as “sound and stable.”

The acquisition of Iberdrola’s platform offers vast potential for increased penetration and growth in Mexico’s power sector, Cox believes, especially due to “a rising demand for energy” that is driving investment.

The company’s five-year investment target not only includes the Iberdrola acquisition, but also “more than US $4 billion in new energy assets, up to US $1.5 billion in water concession assets and the development of a hub focused on Mexican welfare.”

Cox said it also hopes to co-invest in new energy projects alongside Mexico’s Federal Electricity Commission (CFE), the state-owned electric utility.

The company says the deal creates “significant synergies within its strategy to make Mexico one of its key business hubs in Latin America by integrating water and energy solutions.”

Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility which has operated in Mexico since 1999, announced its intention to sell its remaining Mexico assets last week, hiring Barclay’s Investment Bank to manage the sale. At the time of that announcement, the assets for sale were valued at US $4.7 billion.

The 15 power plants being sold — six wind parks, three solar parks and six gas and cogeneration plants — have a combined 2.6 gigawatts (GW) of capacity..

The acquisition also includes a pipeline of 11.8 GW of various renewable energy sources. Cox says 1.4 GW of the renewable energy projects in the pipeline are at an advanced stage of development and may start commercial operations in 2027-28.

Iberdrola began divesting its assets in Mexico, including a US $6 billion sale to the government in 2023, as it became a frequent target of then-President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s attacks.

The Cox sale will complete Iberdrola’s exit from the country.",https://mexiconewsdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 14:03:27.744412

Without the state’s wildfire fund, Edison would probably need to declare bankruptcy.
PG&E’s stock has fallen considerably since January because of the concern that the wildfire fund will be depleted.
The current proposal involves channeling an additional $18 billion to the state’s fund.","California lawmakers are crafting legislation to replenish the state’s wildfire fund as Southern California Edison’s liabilities stemming from the Eaton Fire threaten to wipe it out.

This pool of money was created in 2019 after PG&E filed for bankruptcy as it faced billions of dollars in liabilities from two years of devastating Northern California wildfires ignited by its equipment.

The wildfire fund is meant to help utilities avoid bankruptcy in the future by giving them something to draw on when they’re sued because their electrical equipment started a wildfire.

Last week, SoCal Edison announced it was creating a claims fund to have a pot of money to pay people impacted by the Eaton fire. While CalFire hasn’t officially ruled on the cause of the fire, the announcement is a reasonable signal that the utility thinks it started the fire.

Without the state’s wildfire fund, Edison would probably need to declare bankruptcy. Once it’s gone, other utilities that are parties to the fund — San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric — will have no cushion if their equipment starts a bad fire.

“The utilities have been calling loudly for some sort of a fix, PG&E in particular,” said Michael Wara, an energy expert who is familiar with the discussions.

PG&E’s stock has fallen considerably since January because of the concern that the wildfire fund will be depleted.

Gov. Gavin Newsom would also like to see a fix, said Wara, although he did not address it Thursday during public comments about California’s firefighting capabilities.

“It’s bad for California when utilities go bankrupt,” Wara said, who directs the Climate and Energy Policy Program and is a senior research scholar at the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford University.

The current proposal involves channeling an additional $18 billion to the state’s fund. Half of that is to come from the utility companies. Half coming from ratepayers. Currently, utility customers see a fee on their monthly bill, which is called “non-bypassable charges,” that are set to end in 2035. For the average California ratepayer, this is $2.50 per month. The proposed legislation would extend these charges to 2045.

The utilities — despite needing the funds to be fixed — do not like the proposal that their shareholders pay half of the contributions and would prefer ratepayers to contribute the entire amount, according to reporting in Bloomberg.

“This is a negotiation and they are negotiating,” Wara said, noting that back in 2019, utilities said they could not pay so much money into the fund but found a way to do it. “Otherwise, their shareholders would be in an untenable situation.”

A second, and possibly more significant aspect of the agreement being hammered out is that it places limits on how much money insurance companies can recover against fire-sparking utilities. Currently, those settlements are a negotiation, generally 50 to 70 cents on the dollar. This agreement would cap that at 40 cents on the dollar. So, if State Farm paid out $1 million to a policyholder for a loss on a utility-caused fire, they could recoup a maximum of $400,000 from that utility.

The Trump administration is advancing major rollbacks of climate change regulations, including plans to revoke the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health, a CNN article revealed. This move would eliminate the legal foundation for many climate-related regulations under the Clean Air Act.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the action as the “largest deregulatory action in U.S. history.” The administration has also signed orders to boost the coal industry and end pollution limits on coal- and gas-fired power plants. Tax credits for electric vehicles are set to expire next month, and federal incentives for renewable energy projects have been curtailed, potentially increasing electricity costs.

Legislation has stripped California of its authority to ban new gas-powered vehicles by 2035, and national tailpipe emission standards are expected to be overturned. A congressionally mandated climate report authored by five climate skeptics supports these policy changes, though it has drawn criticism for disregarding scientific consensus.

The paper was written by a working group including John Christy and Judith Curry, who both have past links to The Heartland Institute, an advocacy group that frequently pushes back against the scientific consensus on climate change, which AFP has investigated.

It ""completely misrepresents my work,"" Benjamin Santer, atmospheric scientist and honorary professor in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia in Britain (archived here), told AFP on July 31.

Santer said a section of the report on ""stratospheric cooling"" contradicted his findings while citing his research on climate ""fingerprinting,"" a scientific method that seeks to separate human and natural climate change, as evidence for its analysis.

Similarly, climate scientist Zeke Hausfather (archived here) said some of his findings were discarded entirely ""as not fitting their narrative.""

His work is cited throughout the paper and on July 31 he told AFP the references to models historically overestimating future CO2 concentrations (Hausfather et al., 2019) and to a scenario representing high greenhouse gas emissions throughout the 21st century (Hausfather and Peters 2020) are ""not too badly misrepresented."" But he said they ""neglected to mention how the paper on models also showed how accurate historical climate models have been"" (archived here and here).

""They also appear to have completely ignored my paper (Hausfather et al 2013) showing minimal urban heat island biases on temperatures, and instead only featured the small number of papers finding a larger regional effect"" (archived here).

Planetary scientist and astrobiologist Joshua Krissansen-Totton said on July 31 his research (archived here) on climate and ocean pH of the early Earth -- meaning billions of years ago -- was cited to draw misleading parallels to modern ocean acidification.

AFP and other media, including NOTUS (archived here), a US digital news website affiliated with the nonprofit Allbritton Journalism Institute, found inaccurate citations, flawed analysis and editorial errors across the document.

This is the third time since January, when Donald Trump took office, that scientists have told AFP a government agency has misrepresented academic work to defend their policies.

Previous instances included made up citations in the government's ""Make America Healthy Again"" report, which the administration then rushed to edit.

""I am concerned that a government agency has published a report, which is intended to inform the public and guide policy, without undergoing a rigorous peer‑review process, while misinterpreting many studies that have been peer‑reviewed,"" Bor-Ting Jong, an assistant professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands, told AFP on July 31 (archived here).

Jong said the paper made false statements about the climate model her team examined and used different terminology that led to a flawed analysis of her findings.

Call for a coordinated response

On Bluesky, the budding social media platform favored by academics, other researchers in atmospheric and extreme weather fields also deplored that the DoE document cherry-picked data and omitted or plainly distorted their academic findings (archived here).

Climate scientist Andrew Dessler (archived here) on July 31 initiated (archived here) a call for a coordinated response from academics specialized in areas mentioned in the report.

James Rae (archived here), a climate researcher at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, who said his work is also misrepresented in the report, told AFP on July 31 the shift in how the department uses scientific research ""is really chilling.""

According to AAA, the average price of standard, or regular grade, gas in Washington is $4.39 per gallon as of Friday morning, up slightly from last week’s $4.388. However, prices have increased substantially compared to last year, when gas was $4.243.

Only California and Hawaii have higher gas prices than Washington.

The national average for a gallon of regular gas is $3.151.

The new gas tax increased the price by 6 cents per gallon, bringing the state’s per-gallon tax rate from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. To adjust for inflation, per-gallon gas prices will rise 2% every year.

The diesel tax went up 3 cents per gallon at the beginning of July. Diesel will increase by 3 cents more in two years; then in 2028, it will increase by 2% a gallon each year. Factoring in future increases and inflationary adjustments translates into a 9-cent climb from 49.4 cents per gallon to 58.4 cents per gallon.

State lawmakers faced a projected $1 billion shortfall in the two-year transportation budget and an $8 billion gap over the next six years. The deficit was largely attributed to rising construction costs and a decline in gas tax revenue due to increased fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles.

The gas tax increase, along with other revenue measures, is expected to generate approximately $3.2 billion over the next six years, with the gas tax specifically bringing in $1.4 billion over that period.

Also impacting the price at the pump in Washington is the state’s cap-and-trade program, established by the Climate Commitment Act in January 2023 and run by the Washington State Department of Ecology. The program has generated approximately $3.2 billion so far. The money goes to projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean energy initiatives.

Larry Behrens, communications director with the energy advocacy organization Power The Future, didn’t hesitate to express his opinion on Washington’s energy policies related to gas prices.

Toyota's strategic depth—rooted in operational discipline, localized production, and hybrid dominance—suggests it is uniquely positioned to outperform in a volatile industry.","In 2025, the global automotive landscape is defined by two seismic forces: the uneven transition to battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and the geopolitical turbulence reshaping trade dynamics. Amid this volatility, Toyota has emerged as an outlier—not by betting on disruption, but by doubling down on its hybrid expertise. With hybrid vehicles accounting for nearly half of its global sales and 46.8% of U.S. sales in June 2025, the automaker has turned its decades-old technology into a strategic moat. This is not a temporary advantage but a calculated hedge against the fragility of the EV market and the unpredictability of trade policy.

The Hybrid Resilience Play

Toyota's hybrid dominance is rooted in a simple yet powerful economic reality: hybrids generate twice the profit per unit compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. In 2024, hybrid models contributed 40% of the company's U.S. profits, creating a cash buffer critical for funding R&D in hydrogen and solid-state battery technologies. This financial flexibility contrasts sharply with the cash-burning models of EV-first automakers like Tesla and Rivian, whose stock valuations have become increasingly decoupled from fundamentals.

The company's production agility further amplifies its advantage. While rivals like Nissan and Honda struggle with supply chain bottlenecks and price hikes, Toyota has localized 80% of its U.S. production under the USMCA agreement. This not only reduces exposure to tariffs but also allows the company to absorb the 15% U.S. tariff on Japanese imports with minimal price increases (0.7% of average unit price, versus double-digit hikes for competitors).

Navigating Trade Policy Uncertainty

The U.S.-Japan tariff agreement of 2025, which reduced automotive import tariffs from 25% to 15%, was a mixed blessing for automakers. While it eased some pressure, it also highlighted the fragility of global supply chains. Toyota's response? A $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina, paired with a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) that prioritizes regional self-sufficiency. This strategy ensures operations can continue even during trade wars or natural disasters—a stark contrast to the just-in-time supply chains that left rivals like Ford and GM vulnerable in 2023.

In India and China, Toyota is diversifying further. A 32,000-unit annual production boost in India and a 100,000-unit expansion plan demonstrate its commitment to in-country manufacturing. In China, where BEV competition from BYD is fierce, hybrid sales grew 27% in 2024, outpacing the automaker's overall sales decline.

The EV Dilemma: Prudence Over Panic

While Toyota is investing in EVs, it has avoided the overcommitment that has destabilized competitors. Its $6.8 billion U.S. electrification investment is concentrated on high-margin battery production, aligning with the Inflation Reduction Act's incentives. Meanwhile, the company has delayed its Fukuoka battery plant, signaling a wait-and-watch approach to an EV market still grappling with soft demand and supply chain instability.

This measured strategy is paying off. Toyota's 10% operating margin—double that of Honda and Nissan—provides a buffer to withstand EV market corrections. Its debt-to-equity ratio of 0.3x (versus 0.8x for Nissan) ensures flexibility for R&D and capital expenditures, even as Chinese EVs like the BYD Han and Tesla Model 3 flood global markets.

Investment Implications

For investors, Toyota represents a rare combination of defensive resilience and offensive innovation. The company's hybrid leadership is not a relic but a forward-looking strategy that positions it to dominate markets where EV adoption remains constrained—particularly in regions with inadequate charging infrastructure or regulatory uncertainty.

Key metrics to watch:

- Hybrid sales growth in the U.S. (currently 22% of light-duty vehicle sales in Q1 2025).

- Delivery lead times in key markets, which have improved modestly but remain a near-term challenge.

- Solid-state battery commercialization timelines (2027–2028) and their impact on production costs.

Toyota's strategic depth—rooted in operational discipline, localized production, and hybrid dominance—suggests it is uniquely positioned to outperform in a volatile industry. While EVs will eventually redefine transportation, the transition is proving far messier and slower than anticipated. For now, Toyota's hybrids are not just a bridge to the future—they are a fortress against the uncertainties of today.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 08:58:27.107751

BMW is investing over a billion euros by 2030 to expand e-drive development and production at Steyr. This investment ensures that Steyr remains a key location for drivetrain expertise within the BMW Group. The plant has been producing internal combustion engines for over 40 years and will continue to do so alongside electric motors.

The Gen6 electric motor represents a fully-electric drivetrain produced at Steyr. It will be distributed across the production network, powering the Neue Klasse models. The plant's extensive experience makes it ideal for manufacturing these advanced motors while maintaining flexibility in engine production.

Core components like rotors, stators, transmissions, and power converters will be manufactured at Plant Steyr. The aluminum housings will be cast at Plant Landshut and processed further in Steyr. This marks an entry into electrical engineering for the Austrian facility.

The Gen6 e-drive follows a modular system approach, allowing flexible production of various drivetrain derivatives for Neue Klasse models. This modularity results in cost savings and improved scalability of production volumes while keeping supply networks adaptable.

Technological Enhancements

The Gen6 electric motor has undergone comprehensive improvements. Its rotor, stator, and power converter are designed for an 800-volt architecture to enhance performance and efficiency. Geometry and cooling enhancements optimize the two-stage spur gearbox while refining acoustics for better customer experience.

The power converter uses silicon carbide technology to boost efficiency by converting DC from high-voltage batteries into AC for the motor. These advancements lead to reduced weight, costs, and energy loss, significantly increasing vehicle efficiency by about 20% compared to previous models.

BMW's U.S. Presence

BMW of North America was established 50 years ago to support sales and distribution in the U.S. Over time, it expanded with facilities like BMW Manufacturing Co., LLC in South Carolina and MINI USA. Today, BMW operates nearly 30 locations across 12 states with a strong corporate presence.

Since then, the EU has significantly ramped up LNG imports, especially from the US, while accelerating investments in renewables and energy efficiency.
Increased purchases from the US helped drive this shift, with the US now accounting for nearly 20% of the EU's overall gas imports and half of all LNG imports.""
In gas, US LNG will certainly grow in importance and will dominate European LNG imports.""","US President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced a sweeping trade agreement with the European Union, under which the bloc will increase energy imports from the US by 2.5 times, purchasing $750 billion worth of American energy products and investing $600 billion into the US economy.

The White House described the agreement as a ""historic realignment"" of transatlantic economic ties.

The European Union is expected to spend an average of $250 billion per year over the next three years on energy imports from the United States, up from the current $90–100 billion annually, under the deal.

The increase includes projected rises in oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and nuclear fuel imports, as the EU continues efforts to reduce dependence on Russian energy.

The bloc had historically relied heavily on Russian fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, to meet its energy needs.

As part of its response to the energy crisis, the EU launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022, aiming to cut Russian gas imports by two-thirds by the end of that year and to achieve full independence from Russian energy ""well before 2030.""

Since then, the EU has significantly ramped up LNG imports, especially from the US, while accelerating investments in renewables and energy efficiency.

By 2023, Russian pipeline gas exports to the EU had dropped by over 80%, according to official data.

- ‘Europe has largely pivoted away from Russian energy’

Speaking to Anadolu, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said the war in Ukraine prompted the EU to diversify its energy sources.

""Europe has to a large extent already pivoted away from Russian energy, with Russia's share of EU gas imports falling from more than 40% before the invasion of Ukraine to below 20% now. Increased purchases from the US helped drive this shift, with the US now accounting for nearly 20% of the EU's overall gas imports and half of all LNG imports."" said Zandi.

Zandi noted that increased US purchases helped drive the shift, with the US now accounting for nearly 20% of the EU’s total gas imports and half of all LNG imports.

However, he expressed skepticism about the EU’s ability to meet the new targets.

""In 2024, the EU imported only around $75 billion of energy products from the US, of which about $15 billion was LNG. It would take a huge increase to meet the new targets."" he said.

Zandi also highlighted institutional limitations, saying the EU lacks the power to enforce such massive spending.

""It's also worth highlighting that the EU ultimately lacks the power to direct this kind of spending, which will instead need to come from national governments or even private companies. That's even more relevant to the suggestion that the EU will invest an additional $600bn in the US over the coming years, which we suspect will prove to be a fairly empty promise,"" said Zandi.

- US to become key LNG supplier for EU

John Roberts, an energy security specialist at Methinks Ltd, told Anadolu that the agreement represents a significant step forward in transatlantic energy cooperation, positioning the US as a dominant LNG supplier to Europe.

""But only if Europe is defined as the EU and if Norway is excluded from such calculations. In gas, US LNG will certainly grow in importance and will dominate European LNG imports."" he said.

While US LNG is set to lead Europe’s liquefied gas market, most of Europe’s oil will still come from the Middle East and North Africa, he said.

""In 2024, Norway exported twice as much gas to the rest of Europe as US, (124.7bcm vs 60.7 bcm) while Algeria also supplied 44.9 bcm"" he noted.

""European investment in the US will be shaped by Trump supporting legislation and regulation that favors fossil fuels. But in the other direction, US technology companies will be seeking outlets in European renewables projects,"" Roberts said.

Roberts pointed to limitations on government influence on the projected $750 billion in EU investments,

""Neither the EU, meaning the European Commission, nor EU member governments can compel their industries to make overseas investments, unless they are state-owned. So much will actually depend on what the US itself offers companies to attract investment. I remain sceptical that the surge of European investment into the US envisaged in the deal, which has still to be both detailed and ratified, will result in such a massive increase."" he said.

The long-term impact of the deal will depend not only on political will but on economic conditions and regulatory environments on both sides of the Atlantic, he said.

Crucially, does the Interior expect that by choking off the flow of permits, cities and companies will just pony up to build what the Trump administration considers “reasonable alternatives” instead?

Hypothetically, this could kill off any solar or wind project going through permitting that is sited on federal lands, because these facilities would technically be less energy dense than coal, gas, and nuclear plants. This is irrespective of the potential benefits solar and wind may have for the environment or reducing carbon emissions – none of which are mentioned in the order.

“Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving U.S. Energy Dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement included in a press release announcing the move. “By considering energy generation optimization, the Department will be able to better manage our federal lands, minimize environmental impact, and maximize energy development to further President Donald Trump’s energy goals.”

Here’s how this new regime, which I and many in the energy sector are now suddenly trying to wrap their heads around, is apparently going to work: solar and wind facilities will now be evaluated based on their “capacity density,” which is calculated based on the ratio of acres used for a project compared to its power generation capacity. If a project has a lower “capacity density” than what the department considers to be a “reasonable alternative,” then it may no longer be able to get a permit.

“On a technology-neutral basis,” the order states, “wind and solar projects use disproportionate Federal lands relative to their energy generation when compared to other energy sources, like nuclear, gas, and coal.” The document going on to give an example, claiming that data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows an advanced nuclear plant uses less federal acreage than an offshore wind farm and “thus, when there are reasonable alternatives that can generate the same amount of or more energy on far less Federal land, wind and solar projects may unnecessarily and unduly degrade Federal lands.” The order also includes a chart comparing the capacity density of wind and solar facilities to conventional nuclear, gas, and coal, as well as geothermal, and claims that these sources are superior as well. The document does not reference hydropower.

There’s also a whole host of other implications in this order. Crucially, does the Interior expect that by choking off the flow of permits, cities and companies will just pony up to build what the Trump administration considers “reasonable alternatives” instead?

Nexans, a leader in the world’s energy transition which invested in the U.S. with its subsea transmission cable manufacturing facility in South Carolina, today announces an innovative partnership with Crowley Wind Services, a leading American shipping and logistics company, to develop and operate a Jones Act compliant cable lay barge.

Dedicated to supporting the installation of subsea transmission lines necessary for offshore wind energy, telecommunications and other major industrial applications, this collaboration underscores both companies' commitment to providing solutions for the expansion of U.S. energy sources and other industrial uses that require underwater cabling.

The 300-foot, U.S.-flagged barge, built in Louisiana and tested in the U.S. Gulf to Nexans specifications, will be crewed by American mariners under Crowley’s operation. The vessel will play a critical role in laying and burying the subsea cables needed to deliver energy from offshore to the grid onshore. The barge is the first to have vertical injectors along with a dynamic positioning system and a multiple-anchors positioning system, which allow for accurate and efficient cable placement, even in challenging conditions.

The barge boasts a 3,500-ton capacity carousel to lay and bury subsea cable using burial tools such as a vertical injector, a jet sled, or a jetting ROV, with the potential to be upgraded to 7,000 tons with two carousels for bundle cable lay and burial. The barge is positioned to support Equinor’s Empire Wind offshore wind farm for New York and can be configured to lay or repair cable for a multitude of other subsea applications.

""This barge will support our existing fleet of cable laying vessels, the Nexans CLV Aurora, Nexans C/S Skagerrak and Nexans CLV Electra, and we are pleased to be working with Crowley on developing the capability to lay nearshore subsea cable in the U.S.,"" said Pascal Radue, executive vice president of Nexans' PWR-Transmission Business Group, highlighting the significance of the partnership.

“The cable lay barge will provide a productive supply chain solution for offshore energy, telecommunications and other sectors,” said Graham Tyson, vice president of operations, Crowley Wind Services. “Coupled with our U.S. maritime fleet and mariners providing feedering services and other logistics and project management capabilities, we could not be better equipped to serve the needs of industries seeking subsea cable solutions.”

The vessel will be operated by a crew of U.S. mariners, supporting maritime investment and employment goals.

“AMO is proud to be the leading source for United States Coast Guard licensed officers in the wind farm space. Our long-lasting partnership with Crowley, and our new relationship with Nexans, will help to provide clean, affordable and sustainable energy to millions of Americans and will open the door to future offshore projects,” said American Maritime Officers National President Willie Barrere.

“The SIU welcomes this exciting opportunity and looks forward to providing dedicated, well-trained mariners to help ensure the new vessel’s success,” said Seafarers International Union President David Heindel. “SIU members have sailed aboard cable-laying vessels for decades, so we are more than up to the task. This is a worthwhile project that will boost American shipboard manpower while reinforcing the great importance of the Jones Act, which has protected United States national, economic and homeland security for more than a century.",https://maritime-executive.com/media/images/article/Photos/Vessels_Large/Crowley-Cable-Lay-Barge-AMO.4f51d6.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 14:04:47.118314

Illinois has made major progress in clean energy with the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), supported by the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.
More than $263 billion of this is wind, solar and energy storage facilities, while $110 billion of announced clean energy manufacturing is at risk.
Wind Industry Wind energy is also facing serious setbacks.
The Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois Act (REV Illinois Act) can help bolster Illinois manufacturing in the electric vehicle and renewables sectors.","At the Climate Jobs Institute, we’ve been hearing the same urgent question: What will the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) mean for Illinois? The answer: fewer jobs, higher household energy costs, and stalled clean energy development — threatening hard-earned gains from years of public and private investment.

Illinois has made major progress in clean energy with the state’s Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA), supported by the federal Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These policies sparked momentum across clean electricity, vehicle electrification, and manufacturing in Illinois. But OBBBA risks unraveling this progress by rolling back critical tax incentives, stifling development, and injecting uncertainty into investment planning.

These rollbacks will threaten confidence in an already volatile clean energy economy.

We have looked at a number of economic analyses from researchers across the United States, and the projections are stark. According to Energy Innovation, Illinois could lose 21,000 potential jobs by 2030. By 2030, households could face average energy bill increases of $110 annually, rising to $180 by 2035.

Nationwide, the Princeton Zero Lab projects that the bill will lead to $500 billion less capital investment in electricity and clean fuels and a decrease in “clean energy generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours — more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to our electricity supply today.”

With the changing tax credits, the Rhodium Group estimates that $522 billion in planned clean-energy investments are now at risk. More than $263 billion of this is wind, solar and energy storage facilities, while $110 billion of announced clean energy manufacturing is at risk. This will have direct implications for Illinois.

These changes have come at a time when electricity demand is increasing from data centers, onshoring manufacturing, and building and transportation electrification. The bill will make it more difficult to meet growing demand with low-cost renewables, leading to a 10-18% increase in consumer electricity rates by 2035, according to Energy Innovation.

Solar Industry

Illinois’ growing solar market and workforce – roughly 7,000 workers, according to the U.S. Energy Employment Report 2024 – are directly threatened.

OBBBA shortens the timeline for the Clean Electricity Production Tax Credit (45Y) and Investment Tax Credit (48E) — previously extended through at least 2032 — now only available to projects that begin construction within 12 months of OBBBA’s enactment or are completed by 2027. This abrupt deadline leaves developers scrambling and investors hesitant. It creates renewed urgency to address project delays from interconnection queues, permitting, and lengthy application processes.

The rollback of residential solar tax credits (25D), which are now set to expire in 2026 instead of 2034, threatens further market disruption and consumer pullback.

According to Energy Innovation, the state could see 1.3 fewer gigawatts of new solar capacity by 2035, with thousands of solar jobs on the line. The actual impact will depend on the industry’s ability to pivot and the state’s ability to mitigate these impacts.

Wind Industry

Wind energy is also facing serious setbacks. OBBBA shortens the timeline to take advantage of production and investment tax credits and adds tariffs and sourcing restrictions from “foreign entities of concern,” further limiting access to affordable turbine components. This is likely to stifle wind development in Illinois – around 2.7 fewer gigawatts of wind capacity is likely to be lost in Illinois by 2035, according to Energy Innovation.

Today, the US Department of Energy estimates that there are around 9,300 wind jobs in Illinois. With wind developers facing the dual challenge of condensed construction windows and increased costs, delays and cancellations are already likely. The policy changes will slow down new capacity and threaten labor demand and local tax revenues.

Clean Energy and EV Manufacturing

OBBBA will also impact electric vehicle and battery manufacturing — sectors where Illinois has made recent major gains.

A year ago, Illinois appeared to be on its way to thousands of new EV facility jobs, but projects from Stellantis in Belvidere and Lion Electric in Joliet have already been cancelled. The early sunset of EV tax credits — new and used EV credits (30D and 25E) now expire in September 2025 — will likely impact investment in new EV facilities, as well as demand for EVs like those manufactured at the Rivian plant in Normal.

Additionally, the repeal of the 45X manufacturing credit for battery and component production threatens momentum on that front. Without stable, long-term incentives, Illinois could miss out on next-generation battery plants, stalling its progress as a national clean manufacturing hub and endangering jobs tied to new federal contracts and programs.

What Illinois Must Do Next

Illinois is better positioned than many states. With CEJA as our foundation, Illinois offers solar, wind, and EV incentives that will buffer the federal impact and ensure that many clean energy projects can continue. The Reimagining Energy and Vehicles in Illinois Act (REV Illinois Act) can help bolster Illinois manufacturing in the electric vehicle and renewables sectors. Indeed, our policies may attract clean energy businesses and investors from less favorable states to Illinois.

Still, it is urgent that Illinois take steps to stabilize the clean energy economy and workforce.

First, Illinois must help solar and wind projects meet construction and energization deadlines to take advantage of the sunsetting federal tax credits. Now is the time to streamline application and permitting processes and put pressure on Regional Transmission Operators to speed up the interconnection queue.

Second, it is more important than ever that the new CEJA workforce and contractor programs coordinate with industry leaders, unions, and employers to align workforce supply with demand. Through CEJA, Illinois has made significant investments in building a clean energy workforce — particularly for individuals in disadvantaged communities and those reentering society after incarceration. But with the anticipated project losses, these programs will need to make sure that jobs are still available. CEJA administrators and grantees will need to coordinate with labor and industry to understand how they are responding to these changes. Workforce programs may need to adapt their training or offer different options to ensure that jobs people are counting on are within reach.

Over the next few years, the state has many options to address the impact of these federal rollbacks, from increasing state-level incentives to offering more financing and loan programs to offset the increased costs of clean energy projects. Solar companies may want to pivot to solar leases or diversify their offerings, perhaps by entering the growing energy storage sector. State agencies and municipalities will need to consider how to close funding gaps for affected projects to protect against layoffs and dislocation.

To avoid backsliding, Illinois will require leadership, creativity, and coordinated response from state lawmakers, communities, agencies, industry, and labor.

We’ll continue to track developments, share analysis, and uplift voices of affected people — but one thing is clear: we must act now to protect our clean energy future.",https://ler.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/shutterstock_1297781557-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 08:58:16.247433

As sustainability and decarbonisation emerge as key strategic objectives, significant strides are being made in various sectors, including electrification, materials transformation, manufacturing and digital evolution.

According to PwC, automotive manufacturers are optimising products and procedures to lessen environmental impact and progress towards carbon neutrality.

Electrification and hybridisation in focus

As per insights from AutoLeap, a prominent auto repair shop management software, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are broadening their EV portfolios and investing in battery developments that enhance driving ranges, reduce charging times, and improve recyclability.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) remain pivotal, particularly in regions where complete electrification is yet unavailable.

Dentons, an international law firm, suggests that hybrids offer practical emission reduction solutions as infrastructure continues to develop.

Sustainable materials and the circular economy

The movement towards a circular economy is intensifying. Deloitte points out the increased employment of recycled aluminium, bio-based plastics and eco-friendly interiors across the industry.

According to Research and Markets, market intelligence on OEMs indicates that integrating circularity within vehicle design and implementing end-of-life strategies focusing on recycling, remanufacturing and resource retrieval is becoming a regular practice.

Martijn Karrenbeld, Global Market Sector Director, Industrial Manufacturing at Arcadis, says: “The potential for decarbonisation in industrial manufacturing is enormous.

""It is a major global consumer of energy and contributor of carbon, so every sustainability gain we make really matters.”

Measuring industry progress

Deloitte indicates that European automakers have achieved a 20% reduction in operational emissions since 2021, despite increasing production volumes.

Globally, the automotive sector is eyeing a 90% reduction in emissions by 2050 as part of broader net zero commitments.

Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) are anticipated to compose 20-24% of the EU's new car sales by 2025, per Transport & Environment, with sales likely to increase as infrastructure enlarges and vehicles become more affordable.

The automotive sector is at a critical juncture. Deloitte and PwC suggest that the next chapter in automotive sustainability will focus on scaling EV adoption, integrating circular design throughout, and establishing transparent, low-carbon supply chains.

Aligning all stakeholders, as noted by PwC, is essential to crafting resilient and sustainable mobility systems.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b7369878a393f58e839fb823389df241:9621d3a15b4692ce8ab2ee2ee556f264/an-ev-vehicle.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 09:58:08.919780

The electric motor for the sixth generation of BMW eDrive (Gen6) is the first fully-electric drivetrain to be produced at the Steyr location in Austria. From there, it will be shipped throughout the production network, providing the drivetrain for the Neue Klasse.

Between the project launch in 2022 and 2030, BMW is investing more than a billion euros in expanding development and production expertise for e-drives at the Steyr location. This capacity expansion will ensure the plant remains the BMW Group’s leading location for drivetrains. For more than 40 years, the plant has developed and manufactured internal combustion engines for the BMW and MINI brands. This extensive experience and wealth of expertise in drivetrains make the engine plant the ideal facility to produce the Gen6 electric motors, the company said. The site will continue to manufacture diesel and gasoline engines in parallel.

Around 1,000 employees will work in the new electric motor assembly. Depending on global demand, half of the Steyr location’s total workforce could be employed in e-mobility by 2030.

The core components of the e-drive—rotor, stator, transmission and power converter—will be manufactured at Plant Steyr. The housing for the electric motor will be cast at Plant Landshut’s aluminum foundry and further processed in Steyr. The power converter will be produced in a new in-house clean-room environment, marking the Austrian engine manufacturer’s entry into the field of electrical motorering.

E-drive components from Steyr will be assembled on two new lines. The overall production concept for the Gen6 e-drive follows the principle of a modular system, making it possible to produce different highly flexible electric drivetrain derivatives for the entire range of Neue Klasse models. The modular concept generates positive economies of scale and cost savings in both development and production. It also improves the scalability of production volumes. The modular approach keeps production, supply networks and procurement highly flexible.

The electric motor has undergone significant further development for Gen6; the rotor, stator and power converter have all been holistically designed for the Gen6 technology’s new 800-volt architecture, maximizing the performance capabilities and the efficiency of the drive system.

Improvements in geometry and cooling, along with reduced friction, optimize the two-stage spur gearbox. Customer-friendly acoustics have also been further refined. In the e-drive’s power converter, 800-volt technology and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor technology are now being used to boost efficiency. Fully integrated into the electric motor housing, the power converter converts direct current (DC) from the high-voltage battery into alternating current (AC) for the electric motor.

Comparing one of the future models of the Neue Klasse with a Gen5 xDrive model shows the improvements in the electric motor.

Energy loss is reduced by 40 percent, costs by 20 percent, and weight by 10 percent. All this makes a significant contribution to the approximately 20-percent increase in overall vehicle efficiency. The efficient design of the powertrain together with the high energy content of the high-voltage battery, enable a range of up to 800 km (WLTP) in the BMW iX3, the first model of the Neue Klasse.

One leading energy company is turning that question into a major opportunity — and helping build a cleaner, more circular energy future in the process.

As reported by EnergySage, Qcells, a Korean solar manufacturer with two factories in Dalton, Georgia, has announced plans to launch EcoRecycle, a first-of-its-kind solar recycling facility based in Cartersville. The company will start by recycling up to 250 megawatts of used panels each year and aims to grow its recycling network across the United States.

With this move, Qcells becomes the first producer of crystalline silicon (C-Si) solar panels to handle the entire process — from manufacturing to recycling — within the country. Kelly Weger, the company's senior director of sustainability, called it a vital step: ""Effectively managing solar waste is essential to ensure the long-term sustainability and resilience of the clean energy sector.""

The move reflects a growing need. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, most solar panels last 25 to 30 years, and by 2030, retired panels could contain up to $450 million worth of recoverable raw materials. This is roughly the amount needed to produce 60 million new panels.

While most panels in use today were installed after 2017, early signs of panel retirements are emerging — and as EnergySage puts it, Qcells' move is ""happening not a moment too soon.""

Meanwhile, for households, solar technology continues to reduce both utility costs and planet-heating pollution. EnergySage, an independent platform for quotes from vetted solar installers, offers tools that clarify pricing, system options, and incentives.

Through the platform, the average user can access nearly $10,000 in savings through available rebates and tax credits. Its state-by-state solar map shows typical installation costs and incentives by region.

However, in switching to solar power, time may be a factor. Solar Builder and NPR both shared that the 30% solar tax credit is set to expire after 2025, with Congress voting to phase it out. To qualify for the credit, installations must be completed by January 1, 2026. This change could significantly affect savings.

Qcells' move reflects a broader shift toward full-cycle sustainability in solar, not just how panels are made and used, but what happens after retirement.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Qcellsimage-recZTL4eXZ4bai5mE.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 03:59:00.098682

These firms gain first refusal on substation projects in their designated areas, giving them a clear pipeline of work to plan around.

Tony Wilson, Managing Director at Balfour Beatty Power Transmission & Distribution, says: ""We’re proud to be a regional delivery partner for National Grid’s Electricity Transmission Partnership and especially to be entrusted with the North East, an area where we have a strong presence and a long-standing commitment, having delivered major energy infrastructure projects across the region for decades.

""This appointment recognises our proven track record in delivering critical infrastructure and our ability to mobilise skilled teams and innovative solutions at scale.

""The new model is a bold and timely step that will strengthen National Grid’s supply chain and accelerate the UK’s journey to net zero.""

Infrastructure delivery with local impact

The ETP model isn’t only about high-voltage infrastructure.

Simon Smith, Managing Director of Morgan Sindall Infrastructure, says: ""This latest investment cycle from National Grid will not only be pivotal to the UK by further strengthening the energy network for current and future resilience, but it brings so much for local communities with diverse career opportunities and the utilisation of local supply chain.""

With an emphasis on including regional businesses in its supply chain, the ETP fosters development of local capability.

The programme not only supports the UK's transition away from fossil fuels but also promotes energy independence, by ensuring that supply chains involved in clean energy projects are built to last.

Building resilient supply chains for net zero goals

In tandem with the ETP, National Grid is running additional initiatives aimed at making its supplier ecosystem more robust.

These include the Great Grid Partnership (GGP) and a high voltage direct current (HVDC) supply chain framework.

Together, these programmes aim to introduce better resilience, deeper capacity and greater national reach in energy construction.

The inclusion of HVDC technology, used to transmit electricity over long distances with minimal loss, demonstrates National Grid’s intent to upgrade both the physical grid and the technical competence of its supply chain.

This matters not just for delivering on green goals, but also for ensuring the system can handle increased demand as the UK electrifies heating, transport and other sectors.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/57d06ae898ff271ca840e6ad92d7bb88:09dee751d81954a6b96096929cc73be6/electricity-pylon-3916956-1280.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 03:58:26.570126

Though there are hundreds of Colorado rebates, local municipality rebates and utility company rebates.

The rebates cover electric lawn equipment, smart thermostats and heat pumps, among other energy-efficient home upgrades. While federal rebates are ending, state and local rebate programs funded by local tax dollars will continue, though those funds shrink over the years.

Colorado has launched a new website designed to help residents navigate the hundreds of available rebate programs without extensive research.

""Nobody should be expected to have to research 600. Just plug it in, make sure you get everything you are entitled to, to save you money and reduce your utility costs,"" Gov. Jared Polis (D) said.

The website requires users to provide personal information to access customized rebate options. Users must enter whether they are homeowners or renters, their zip code, birth month and year, income level, and birth months and years for all household members, including children.

Elena Torres, who was shopping at Home Depot for upgrades to her rental property, was unaware she could qualify for rebates based on her purchases. When asked if spending 10 minutes on the website would be worthwhile, Torres said, ""It certainly could, depending on what the rebate is.""

The website serves a dual purpose beyond finding energy rebates. The website also provides details on programs for families needing help paying utility bills, which explains the household demographic questions.

""It's like if you add additional search terms in one of the search engines, let's say Bing or Google or Yahoo or wherever else, it will return you more specific results,” Steve Beaty, a computer science professor at MSU Denver, said.

Beaty reviewed the website’s privacy policy and said it is one of the better ones he has seen.

""This one was pretty good, actually,"" he said. ""It wasn't all that long. There wasn't a whole lot of legal jargon.""

The privacy policy includes several consumer protections.

""They say they're not going to sell your data to a third party, big upside there,"" Beaty said.

He found one particularly noteworthy aspect.

""I thought it was also interesting and unusual that if they are ever bought or merge, or whatever, they explicitly say whoever purchases them or merges with them must abide by the privacy policy that's currently in place,” Beaty said.

What is the big deal with zip code, income level and birth months and years of household members anyway?

Beaty said if that information were sold, it could be combined with other data purchased from the dark web that could identify specific people, leading to data aggregation. It could give someone enough information to know a person’s name and birth month and year, which could compromise medical data and records that rely on someone’s name and birth date.",https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/fbffe4ba-8434-4711-b196-fb88fad859d9/20250802T000947/fbffe4ba-8434-4711-b196-fb88fad859d9_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 03:58:30.749862

The Gulf of America’s “dead zone” has shrunk significantly this summer, with scientists measuring a hypoxic area of just over 4,400 square miles — roughly a third smaller than last year and far less than the long-term average, federal officials announced Wednesday.

The dead zone, a stretch of oxygen-depleted water that forms annually off the Louisiana and Texas coasts, is caused primarily by excess nutrients washing into the Gulf from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin.

This year’s zone, measured during a July 20–25 survey aboard the research vessel Pelican, was 4,402 square miles — 21% smaller than NOAA’s early-season estimate and the 15th smallest on record, according to NOAA-supported scientists from LSU and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium.

“This year’s significant reduction in the Gulf of America’s ‘dead zone’ is an encouraging sign for the future of this area,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “It highlights the dedication and impactful work of NOAA-supported scientists and partners, and serves as a testament to the effectiveness of collaborative efforts in supporting our U.S. fishermen, coastal communities, and vital marine ecosystems.”

The measured area is equivalent to roughly 2.8 million acres of bottom habitat temporarily made unavailable to marine life such as fish and shrimp due to low oxygen levels.

That marks a 30% drop from 2024, when the zone spanned a massive 6,703 square miles — more than 1.3 times the long-term average and nearly 3.5 times larger than the target goal of 1,930 square miles set by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force.

Despite this year’s improvement, the five-year running average remains high at 4,755 square miles—still more than double the federal benchmark.

Dead zones emerge when excess nutrients — mostly nitrogen and phosphorus from upstream agriculture and wastewater — fuel algae blooms. As algae die and sink, their decomposition consumes oxygen in bottom waters. Without sufficient oxygen, marine species must flee or perish.

In 2024, the area west of the Mississippi River experienced heavy hypoxia with extremely low oxygen readings and little water mixing, according to NOAA.

“The stratification of warmer surface water over cooler, saltier bottom water was strong enough to prevent oxygen replenishment,” researchers wrote in a followup report.

Some bottom waters saw oxygen drop across the lower five meters of the water column.

Even with relatively low chlorophyll readings — indicating modest live algae near the surface — researchers noted high concentrations of degraded algae and organic detritus near the seafloor, still enough to drive significant bacterial oxygen consumption.

The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force, a coalition of federal and state agencies, has worked for over two decades to reduce nutrient pollution flowing into the Gulf. The EPA established a dedicated Gulf Hypoxia Program in 2022 to accelerate these efforts.

“The Gulf of America is a national treasure that supports energy dominance, commercial fishing, American industry, and the recreation economy,” said Peggy Browne, acting assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Water. “I look forward to co-leading the work of the Gulf Hypoxia Task Force to assess evolving science and address nutrient loads from all sources.”

So far, nitrogen loading from the Mississippi River has not declined since the 2001 adoption of the Hypoxia Action Plan, scientists noted. NOAA’s June 2025 forecast, which had predicted a dead zone of 5,574 square miles, was based on U.S. Geological Survey nutrient data from spring river flows and fell within model uncertainty ranges.

NOAA’s Coastal Hypoxia Research, Ocean Technology Transition, and Uncrewed Systems programs are working to improve monitoring and prediction tools. This year, several autonomous surface vehicles were deployed alongside ship-based crews to compare mapping methods.

Researchers said ASVs may provide a more cost-effective way to track dead zones in the future.

Voting Wrongs

Texas Democrats are fighting an uphill battle to block the latest Republican-led effort to gerrymander the Lone Star state for electoral advantage, and Black and Latino voters are once again most likely to be impacted. This time around, President Donald Trump is publicly pressuring lawmakers in Texas and beyond to preemptively meddle in the midterm elections to preserve the GOP majority in the House of Representatives, saving him from becoming a lame duck as his approval ratings sink and Democrats attempt to ride in on a wave of voter backlash.

Both major parties are guilty of drawing congressional districts that prioritize political wins over fair representation, but democracy experts say the redistricting proposal unveiled in Texas this week is a dangerous escalation. A Republican majority is rushing to slice up congressional districts that were already redrawn in 2021 to maximize GOP power — creating a gerrymander of a gerrymander. Democrats are fighting back, but the battle may ultimately be decided by the courts and frustrated voters.

Civil rights groups in Texas are busy challenging current electoral maps in court for diluting the electoral power of Black and Brown voters. Roman Palomares, the national president of LULAC, a nonpartisan Latino rights group fighting intense voter suppression in Texas, said the latest redistricting push is “a hijacking of democracy in plain sight.”

“It entrenches Republican power by rewriting the rules of the game midstream,” Palomares said in a statement this week. “When you can’t win fairly, you cheat, and that is exactly what this is.”

Trump has demanded Texas Republicans draw a new congressional map. “Just a very simple redrawing, we pick up five seats,” the president told reporters in July. Gov. Greg Abbott recently called lawmakers back to Austin for a special legislative session to make it happen. A response to the deadly floods that rocked Texas Hill Country last month is also on the agenda, but Democrats say the GOP is focused instead on buoying Trump with the redistricting plan. Lawmakers released the proposed electoral map on July 30, five years earlier than districts would normally be redrawn with fresh census data.

Labor unions and nonpartisan civil rights groups quickly condemned the map as a blatantly partisan attack on Latino-majority districts. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat whose heavily Latino district in San Antonio would be carved up to make the district more favorable to Republicans, called the map an “illegal power grab” rooted in racism.

“Black and Brown communities will suffer the most; they’re getting torn up across the state,” Cuellar told reporters on Thursday. “In the last few decades, the overwhelming majority of growth in Texas has come from Latino and African American communities, and yet the number of seats that have been drawn to serve those communities has stayed flat or shrunk.”

Republicans claim the new map creates more Latino-majority districts, but the proposed map offers only the illusion of better representation, according to LULAC. The group said a close examination reveals that the new map dilutes voter power or potential turnout by carving up Latino communities where voters share common needs and political interests, or packing voters into districts that already lean heavily toward one party or the other. In Central Texas, the proposed map would eliminate the congressional district held by Rep. Greg Casar, a move LULAC said is targeting a “champion of civil rights.”

“The people of Texas, especially its Latino voters, deserve better than to be carved up and cast aside to serve the president’s agenda,” Palomares said. Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett also spoke out, saying that the new lines would mean she lived outside the district she currently represents.

Democratic state lawmakers are considering leaving the state in order to prevent the legislature from reaching a quorum and passing the proposed map, a tactic they used to delay approval of a congressional map during a dramatic redistricting fight in 2003. Democrats would have to camp out in another state to avoid being arrested and dragged back by state police while racking up a daily $500 fine. Republicans put the fees in place after another Democratic decampment from the state in 2021.

Texas voters are no strangers to redistricting fights, which have escalated over the decades since Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in an attempt to curb the Jim Crow-era suppression of Black voters. Republicans are now diving deep into legally dubious arguments in the latest showdown in hopes of securing a favorable map for Trump ahead of the midterms.

Dan Vicuña, director of redistricting and representation at Common Cause, a nonpartisan group supporting citizen-led initiatives against gerrymandering, spoke out against the “sloppy and transparent” July 7 letter that Trump’s Justice Department sent to GOP leadership in Texas. The letter alleges that the current congressional map was drawn with “unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,” which contradicts court testimony from Republicans who said the map is “blind to race.”

That letter kicked off the redistricting push to redraw the state’s “gerrymandered congressional map and somehow gerrymander it even more for Republicans, because Trump is afraid of how the midterms will go for his party,” Vicuña stated. Citing a controversial federal court ruling against a coalition of Black and Latino voters in Galveston, the letter gave Abbott a shallow pretext to put redistricting next to disaster relief on the special agenda, Vicuña said.

“Harmeet K. Dhillon, the assistant attorney general for civil rights at the U.S. Justice Department, sent the governor and attorney general of Texas a letter making the legally dubious argument claiming that a congressional map deemed by civil racial rights experts to be racially discriminatory was in fact too friendly to people of color,” Vicuña told reporters this week.

Next week will mark the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 becoming law, a major achievement of the civil rights movement. Kathleen Thompson, executive director of the Progress Texas Institute, said Republicans in Texas have fought to overturn the landmark civil rights law ever since it was implemented.

We’ll try to keep the call to roughly one hour. And in order to answer as many questions as possible, we will be limiting questions to one plus a single follow-up if necessary. We’ll be prioritizing questions from the investment community. So if you are a member of the media, please direct your inquiries to our communications team who will be happy to respond. As always, our Investor Relations team will be available following the call for any follow-up questions.

On to slide two, where I will remind you that we will be referring to forward looking information on today’s presentation and Q and A. By its nature, this information contains forecast assumptions and expectations about future outcomes, which are subject to the risks and uncertainties outlined here and discussed more fully in our public disclosure filings. We’ll also be referring to non GAAP measures summarized below. And with that, I’ll turn it over to Greg Ebel.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, thanks very much, Rebecca, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. I’m excited to share another strong quarter and highlight the progress we’ve made across all segments of our business. Last quarter, I spoke about the importance of continued dialogue with policymakers and regulators to ensure North American energy independence and security. I’m optimistic about our ongoing conversations and the alignment we’re seeing today on both sides of the border to advance projects and legislation that serve growing energy demand. And Enbridge continues to be in a great position to serve this growing demand with its large incumbent footprint across all four business units.

We’re gonna start today with a midyear check-in on financial performance, execution, and an update on our growth projects. I’ll walk through how Enbridge is effectively navigating trade conflict, legislative change, and geopolitical volatility. I’ll then touch on how Enbridge is capitalizing on rising power demand in North America before providing an update on each of our four core franchises. Pat will then review our financial results and reiterate our capital allocation priorities. And lastly, I’ll close the presentation with a few comments on our first choice value proposition before we open the call for your questions.

We’ve made significant progress on the commitments we laid out for you at the start of the year, and I’m proud of the work the team has done to execute our financial, operational, and growth priorities. We set another record for second quarter EBITDA driven primarily by contributions from the acquired US gas utilities and successful rate settlements in our gas transmission business. Our strong 2025 gives us confidence that we’ll finish the year in the upper end of our EBITDA guidance range, and we are well on track to meet our DCF per share midpoint. The balance sheet is also in great shape. As of June 30, we’re at 4.7 times debt to EBITDA, primarily due to realizing another full quarter of earnings from The US gas utility acquisitions that closed throughout 2024.

Our assets remained highly utilized during the quarter, and the mainline transported 3,000,000 barrels per day. That system has now been in apportionment for six of the first eight months of the year, including July and August. We closed an investment on our West Coast system by a consortium of 38 indigenous groups backed by a loan guarantee provided by the Canadian government. This partnership provides sustained economic benefits to First Nations and is aligned with Enbridge’s continuous goal of recycling capital at attractive valuations for shareholders. We also closed the previously announced acquisition of a 10% interest in the Matterhorn Express Pipeline in the Permian and upsized the Traverse Pipeline project from 1.75 BCF per day to two and a half BCF per day driven by strong customer demand.

As a reminder, the Traverse pipeline is part of the Whistler JV and is designed to transport natural gas between AquaDulce and the Katy area in Texas. Work on our planned liquids mainline optimizations is ongoing, and we’re pleased to announce that our recent 100,000 barrel per day open season on Flanagan South Pipeline was oversubscribed. We expect to reach FID on the first phase of the mainline optimization later this year. On the growth front, we sanctioned the $900,000,000 Clear Fork project in Texas located just outside San Antonio. The project is fully contracted under a long term off take agreement with Meta and will support its data center operations.

Meta represents a new addition to our growing list of AI and data center related customers. In gas transmission, we sanctioned expansions of Texas Eastern and Aiken Creek Gas Storage to serve growing industrial power and LNG demand across North America. Together, these renewable and gas projects highlight the competitive advantage of our all of the above approach and our ability to serve increasing natural gas and power demand through multiple business units, services, and geographies. Now let’s touch on the stability Enbridge continues to offer investors despite the ongoing volatility we are seeing today. The markets have been turbulent thus far in 2025, but the volatility has really showcased Enbridge’s stable business model and the value of our low risk commercial frameworks.

Our size, diversity, and disciplined capital allocation puts us in a great position to deliver predictable returns to shareholders in these conditions. Our exposure to tariffs is negligible across our operations, and importantly, Canadian oil and gas delivered to The US via our systems has not attracted tariffs. Roughly 80% of our EBITDA is generated by assets with revenue inflators or regulatory mechanisms for recovering rising costs, which helps to backstop our ratable and growing dividend and earnings. On the tax policy front, the extension of bonus depreciation provides benefits to Enbridge’s near term growth, and our sanctioned or late stage renewable projects are not expected to be impacted negatively by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The second quarter saw continued price volatility across commodity markets driven by geopolitical instability, but Enbridge’s low risk business model protected us from those dynamics with virtually no exposure to commodity prices and over 98% of EBITDA generated by assets with regulated returns or long term take or pay contracts.

Lastly, our footprint puts us in an ideal position to capitalize on growing energy demand in North America and beyond. We are connected to a 100% of Gulf Coast operating LNG export capacity, and our natural gas systems are located within 50 miles of 29 new data centers, 78 coal plants, and 45% of all North American natural gas power generation. Our gas distribution franchise is the largest natural gas utility business in North America, and we deliver reliable natural gas to over 7,000,000 customers every day in geographies with growing gas demand. In the crude market, our incumbency positions us as the leading operator to provide new and expanded egress options for customers, something both producers and policymakers are in fact seeking. And our renewable power business is opportunistically providing power to some of the largest AI and data center players in the world as the demand for energy across North America continues to grow.

And let’s take a couple of minutes to spotlight some of the investments we’re making related to growing power demand. As you can see from this slide, Enbridge has already won and will continue to win power demand related opportunities by deploying our all of the above approach to energy in order to serve blue chip customers across various sectors. During our investor day in March, we shared 4 to $5,000,000,000 of near term power generation opportunities across our gas and renewable businesses that we expected to begin announcing within six months. I’m pleased to say that we’re ahead of schedule with over $1,000,000,000 of recently sanctioned projects between Clear Fork Solar in Texas and the line 31 expansion in Mississippi. In addition, we can now confirm that Texas Eastern Transmission will be interconnected to the Homer City redevelopment generating facility in Pennsylvania.

We are working to commercialize opportunities to support data centers and hyperscalers in the state further adding to our growth backlog. We’ve recently completed milestone projects for solar power backed by PPAs with Amazon and AT and T and continue to advance over $5,000,000,000 of power demand projects serving a combined six gigawatts of new generation. With that being said, we can’t forget about the progress we’re making across various exciting opportunities in our liquids business, which I’ll get into now. Mainline volumes were strong again this quarter, delivering 3,000,000 barrels per day on average for the quarter and 3,100,000 barrels per day for the 2025. At investor day, we announced up to $2,000,000,000 of investment in the mainline through 2028 to support continued high utilization of the system while also extending asset life and reliability.

That investment is now underway, and we will earn attractive returns within the MTS agreement collar of 11 to 14 and a half percent. We also continue to advance mainline optimization phase one. Our full path FSP open season was oversubscribed, and the team is now working towards FID ing the 150,000 barrel per day mainline expansion later this year. Additionally, we launched an open season for the Southern Illinois Connector, which will leverage our existing footprint and our interest in the EPCO pipeline to provide full path optionality for our customers serving additional US Gulf Coast demand. Mainline investments of this nature are permit like, provide attractive economics, and will be sanctioned to meet our customers’ increasing egress requirements.

And lastly, down on the Gulf Coast, our 120,000 barrel per day Gray Oak expansion has partially entered service with full COD expected in mid twenty twenty six. Now let’s turn to gas transmission. We’ve got a number of exciting announcements this quarter spread out across our footprint. In Mississippi, we sanctioned the line 31 expansion of Texas Eastern to serve rising industrial and power demand, all secured under twenty year take or pay agreements with a well known investment grade customer. This project was among the opportunities highlighted at investor day to serve growing gas demand.

On the Gulf Coast, we’ve progressed optimization projects, including a $50,000,000 expansion of SESH to serve the growing power generation needs of a major electric utility that’s there serving data centers as well as an upgrade to the Tres Palajas storage facility in Texas. This storage upgrade is being done to increase injection and withdrawal rates and is part of a larger expansion opportunity we expect to realize later in the decade. In Canadian gas transmission, I’m pleased to announce a 40 BCF expansion of the Aiken Creek storage facility that will support the growing Canadian LNG market. That project will also optimize our other expansions underway on the West Coast system, providing customers with critical flexibility in a rapidly developing region, particularly on the LNG front. Lastly, we are updating our capital investment for wood fiber.

As a reminder, Enbridge has a contract structure that provides us the ability to earn a low double digit return, and we will now set that rate closer to the in service date. We remain excited about the growing LNG market in Western Canada as all of these projects are expected to enter service in the 2027 to ’29 time period, extending and adding visibility to our long term growth outlook. Now let’s move on to our gas distribution business. We remain excited about the long term growth outlook for our utility business and the foundational growth that helps to support the dividend. In Ontario, the phase two rebasing process was completed, setting rates through 2028.

And in Ohio, we received a decision on the rate case filed in 2023. While we didn’t get all that we asked for, I’m encouraged by the almost 10% ROE and increased equity thickness, which remains among the strongest returns within our utility franchise. Of note, existing capital riders are a great and continuing feature, ensuring quick cycle capital returns, which was part of what attracted us to the investment back in 2023. Lastly, we filed for new rates in North Carolina and Utah this quarter and expect we’ll have new rates in those jurisdictions by next year. And now I’ll turn to the renewable power sector.

Enbridge continues to advance its world class renewable portfolio using our financial strength, supply chain reach, and construction expertise under a low risk commercial model that delivers competitive returns. In July, we announced the Clear Fork solar project near San Antonio, Texas, a 600 megawatt facility that will support data center needs. All generation is sold under a long term offtake agreement with Meta Platforms. And importantly, the project is expected to meet all the requirements to fully qualify for renewable tax credits under new US legislation. Also in Texas, we are progressing the 815 megawatts Sequoia solar development.

The project is on track to partially enter service in 2025 with full production coming online in 2026. Also of importance, the one big beautiful bill act is not expected to impact any of our sanctioned projects, but we’ll continue to monitor future developments in this fast moving policy environment. It’s our view that the recent US legislative changes makes our backlog of late stage development projects even more valuable. But now I’ll pass it off to Pat to go over our financial performance.

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks, Greg, and welcome, everyone. Strong utilization across our asset base has led to another solid quarter. We’re posting record second quarter EBITDA despite continued trade uncertainty and geopolitical events. Compared to the 2024, adjusted EBITDA is up 7%, earnings per share up 12%, while DCF per share is comparable. In our Liquids segment, we saw strong volumes with the mainline transporting 3,000,000 barrels per day, although weaker results at FSP and Spearhead resulted in a slight decrease compared to 2024.

In gas transmission, strong operational performance across our pipes and storage assets in addition to revised rates on U. S. GT assets added to the segment year over year. Our Whistler JV and DBR system acquisitions, in addition to Venice Extension, entering service at the 2024 provided additional contributions. Gas distribution is up relative to last year with the acquisitions of the U.

S. Gas Utilities being the main driver. Higher rates, customers, and storage revenues at Enbridge Gas Ontario, in addition to the colder weather, also contribute to the strong results within the segment. In renewables, we saw lower contributions at our European offshore assets, which were partially offset by stronger wind resources in North America. For DCF per share and EPS, higher financing costs, current taxes and maintenance capital, primarily driven by the US Gas Utilities acquisition, partially offset the higher EBITDA contributions.

The per share metrics are, of course, impacted by the at the market issuances that were completed in the 2024 to prefund The US utility. I’m pleased to reaffirm our 2,025 guidance and growth outlook across all metrics. With our strong performance through the 2025, we’re in a great position to finish the year in the upper end of our guidance range for EBITDA. The resilience of our business model is really on display as we continue to deliver predictable returns through market volatility. The acquisition of a 10% interest in the Matterhorn Express, strong mainline volumes and the strength of The U.

S. CAD exchange rate are all tailwinds to our full year guidance, but are partially offset by higher than expected U. S. Interest rates. We remain confident in our ability to achieve our near term and medium term growth outlooks.

Now let’s touch base on our capital allocation priorities. As you would expect, we continue to be focused on disciplined capital allocation. Our balance sheet provides us with financial strength and flexibility, and our debt to EBITDA has decreased to below the midpoint of our target range over the past few quarters, as expected, following the close of The U. S. Gas utility acquisitions.

We also extended our track record of recycling capital at attractive valuations. The investment by our First Nation partners and a 12.5% stake in the West Coast system, which closed in July, generated cash proceeds of $700,000,000 and demonstrated our ongoing commitment to economic reconciliation and partnership with indigenous communities. One of the keys to our value proposition is to sustainably return capital to shareholders, and we prioritize being in the 60% to 70% range of DCF payout. Our dividend is underpinned by high quality, low risk cash flow growth, and continues to support our dividend aristocrat status. As a reminder, we’ve increased our dividend to shareholders for thirty consecutive years, and we expect to return approximately $40,000,000,000 to $45,000,000,000 over the next five years.

In terms of further growth, we will continue to make disciplined investment decisions and prioritize low multiple brownfield and utility like projects with our nine to ten billion dollars of annual investment capacity. What I especially like about this quarter is that we’ve announced or made significant progress on opportunities in each of our four business units, and those opportunities are spread throughout the end of the decade, adding even more clarity to our growth plans. And with that, I’ll pass it back to Greg for some closing remarks.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, thanks very much, Ted. And as you’ve just heard, it’s been another strong showing from all the teams this quarter. Enbridge is ideally positioned to deliver predictable results through virtually all economic conditions and cycles. Our low risk business continues to prove its value to shareholders, evidenced by the consistency of our cash flows and earnings growth. This year marks our thirtieth consecutive annual dividend increase supported by our business model.

We’ve also secured high quality and sustainable growth via our now $32,000,000,000 secured capital program, adding visibility to our expected 5% growth through the end of the decade. We will continue to evaluate accretive tuck ins and tax efficient investment opportunities that fit within our wheelhouse to diligently ensure lasting returns to shareholders. And with that, I’d like to thank you all for listening. And operator, please open the line for questions.

Speaker 3: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Speaker 4: Hi, good morning.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Good morning, Jeremy.

Speaker 4: Just wondering if you might be able to frame a little bit more, I guess, opportunities you’re seeing across your footprint as it relates to natural gas expansion to serve incremental power demand and possibly data center demand growth as well. We’ve seen news coming out of Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, a lot going on in Ohio as well. I think the slides reference other opportunities across your footprint such as in the West. So I was just wondering if you could frame a bit more the opportunity set, where you see it most across the portfolio and I guess timeline to new projects materializing. Do you see this kind of a near term or just kind of steady cadence over time?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, Jeremy, maybe I’ll start and then, Cynthia can chime in, too and maybe even yeah. I know not on the gas side, but maybe Matthew too. So it’s really all of the above. Like, we we in the, GDS business the GTM business and our renewable business, I was at the technology and economic summit you were talking about in Pennsylvania. And, obviously, out of that came a press release of a big player using the Texas Eastern system to, support Homer City, in North Carolina and Mississippi and Georgia.

We talked about on this call, Utah. All of those, we’re really starting to see, things come in. I guess the point I would make, there is two elements here. There’s one there, utility element, which I would say is most of where we’re picking up the opportunities, and you heard us talk about line 31 just a few minutes ago as well as Sesh, very much utility based. But there’s a nice smattering of behind the meter type stuff, which is what Homer City would look like.

And then let’s not forget about the renewable side. I know you’re asking about gas. So it’s right across the system. Haven’t seen that much in Canada yet, but I think that’s actually an opportunity that will come too. Cynthia, do you wanna add more from what we had laid out back at the Investor Day?

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. I’ll just build on on what you said, Greg. So if we look at what we said at Investor Day, we have, just on the gas transmission side, 35 plus opportunities to 11 BCF of gas, about, you know, 4,000,000,000, one to 2,000,000,000 of that in that late stage development. Right now, we have 10 plus specific data center opportunities in that late stage. Of course, we’re located, you know, next to the natural gas generation.

So 45% of all natural gas power generations within 50 miles of our system. And within that area too, that 50 miles, there’s 29 new data centers. And then of course, we still have the opportunities for coal to gas conversions. There’s 78 coal plants in that in that area. That’s about eight eighty gigawatts of current of current power generation.

So what I would say is we’re seeing opportunities across the system in The US in particular, and that’s not to discount the opportunities we have in the natural gas side with along US Gulf Coast to serve LNG. So we still see lots of opportunities there in Canada. We’ve done lots of expansions and as was noted with the storage at Acorn Creek that’s going to serve more LNG opportunities. And last quarter we had announced our Birch Grove expansion too. So we continue to see a lot of opportunities, Jeremy.

Speaker 4: Got it. That’s helpful. Thank you for that. And just want to pivot to wood fiber if you could, if you could provide a little bit more detail on some of the drivers in the higher cost expectations there and as well as maybe just any more detail to share. It seems like you still have the ability to earn a low double digit return, but any any color, incremental on those two points would be helpful.

Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. For sure, Jeremy. You know, I’m, and we are never that pleased when we see more capital than we originally planned. However, with wood fiber, as you mentioned, our contract structure does allow us to earn that double digit return on capital as we agree to invest in the project. Fortunately, and through the agreements with departments, we’re now gonna set that toll on the higher capital amount nearer to the projects in in service.

Our partner, which owns 70% of the project, as you probably recall, they they do take capital cost risk, but they get the benefit of selling the LNG commodity. So I think it’s a really good balance of interest there. And I guess my point being, while we’re always really focused on the capital being deployed to the couple of dozen projects we’ve got in execution right across the portfolio, we’re equally focused on the contractual and regulatory structures around that capital to ensure to the extent possible that we can make sure we get the return protected should capital cost change, particularly on multiyear projects. And I really think that combined focus is serving us well on this project. Now with respect to capital cost increases, I wouldn’t it’s not really one thing.

Right? We’ve had some changes in in building codes. Permitting delays, not a new issue for most jurisdictions. We’re adding additional flotilla, so that’s where we house our employees. So that’ll create room for another 900 approximately folks as we get into the heavy builds and then some site conditions.

So all those have really added up to this slide. Again, the key is, as you pointed out, our ability to continue to earn that low double digit return.

Speaker 4: Got it. Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks, Jeremy.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Katsaliev from CIBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Speaker 6: Hi, good morning, I was hoping, Greg, you can discuss how you’re seeing energy policy evolving in Canada. And if you could compare the prospects of a new pipeline to Tidewater compared to some of the various incremental expansion opportunities that are available in the industry on the liquids pipeline side.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Well, I think as you saw us announce today and you’ve really seen us been going hard at this since January and last fall, our customers at this point in time really wanna go south. Right? That’s the premium market, which we’re able to deliver to both PADD two and PADD three, think the Gulf Coast. And so Colin and his team have really put forward a number of really great incremental projects, and, you know, you can see those in the presentation.

That’s the first move. It’s the most valuable market. It’s the smartest way to do this. And then when that’s done and as our customer production grows, that’s when an opportunity could be created to go to the West Coast. And and there’s lots of discussion with governments on that.

And as you know, Robert, we have been a proponent of such a project in the past and, in fact, invested several $100,000,000 to get there. So the issue isn’t not one of, they’re being a proponent. The issue is one of government policy setting the conditions for that to get investment to occur. Let’s be honest. The government has not done that yet, and it’s not clear they intend to, at least from our perspective.

In particular, there’s still an emissions cap in place for our customers, which really stifles their ability to grow oil production. And then secondly, the West Coast tanker ban remains in place that, frankly, as long as that’s there, would make building a pipeline to the West Coast being a pipeline to nowhere. So and none nothing’s been deemed in the national interest yet either. So lots of us to watch from an industry perspective. We’re very active on that front, but we’re continuing to find ways to serve our customers’ needs by adding that incremental egress that they really want, which really means the Gulf Coast.

So TBD. Meanwhile, as you’re seeing south of the border, a lot of changes, accelerated permitting. We even start to see it in changes to the army corps of engineers and a desire to actually build energy sovereignty and project power. And so, hopefully, that’ll translate up here as the government gets its footing. And in the meantime, we’ll continue to provide counsel and advice to folks like the premier of Alberta who, you know, she continues to work to advance not only the province’s interest, but I actually think Canada’s energy interests and sovereignty via new energy infrastructure.

Speaker 6: That’s a very helpful response. Thank you. And I was just curious how the the Ohio rate case order impacts your strategy on rate cases in general in The U. S. Franchises and obviously Ohio in particular.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah, Michelle’s here. I’ll let her go at that. Obviously regulatory ex piece is something we’re very focused on.

Michelle Heritance, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: Sure. So, obviously, we were disappointed in the Ohio rate case, but but, really, it’s turning on a couple of, I’d call it, legal and regulatory issues. As Greg mentioned in his opening remarks, at the end of the day, the fact is we still have really strong ROE amongst the the best that you can have. We saw an increase in our equity thickness. We didn’t have any material denials into what we submitted as appropriate o and m.

All of the capital that we’ve invested is has gone into rate base. We continue to have the strong capital riders that we really like to know Ohio. So it’s still a very strong and productive jurisdiction, but we do have a couple specific issues so that we think there were errors made by the PUC in Ohio, and we filed a rehearing about a week ago a week ago today on that. So we’re we’re confident in the Ohio utility, and we’re certainly confident in its growth as as we was mentioned in an earlier question. Lots of lots of data centers, lots of generation there, so it’s a good, it’s a good utility.

But we are in rate cases in all four of our our major utilities as we mentioned. We’re coming to the tail end in Ontario, and then we would expect to see our results in Utah and North Carolina coming through in the fall. I think the big difference, though, for Utah and North Carolina is their rate cases are a matter of routine. We go every two or three years. So it’s really just a question of updating things, having a discussion about what’s the most appropriate, levels of return without the fifteen year lag that we had in Ohio.

That that really created a lot of complexity in the Ohio rate case. So we’re very confident with North Carolina and Utah. Good relationships there, transparent work. So things are good.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. So, you know, obviously, if you think back to the acquisition, which, know, we haven’t even had all these closed for a year yet, That’ll come up in September. Very consistent results and expectations. You know, we’re as you know, Rob, we’re quite conservative in the way we look at things. And I would say we’ve probably been imated the growth opportunity there, right across all the utilities and the regulatory, filings and rate cases.

That’s standard what we do across all our businesses. And, you know, sometimes you get what you want, sometimes you don’t, But it the business continues to drive forward.

Speaker 6: Excellent. Thank you.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Aaron MacNeil from TD Cowen. Your line is open.

Speaker 8: Hey, good morning all. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, but can you speak to the Cowboy Solar and Seven Stars projects? I guess I’m just trying to get a sense of if your customers are encouraging you to get these types of projects across the line, just given the changing tax credit landscape. And as it relates to other solar projects in your mid stage development bucket, are there any practical limitations that we should be thinking about in terms of your ability to get more across the line?

And then I guess finally, just given the urgency, do you have the room in your annual investment capacity to get more projects like this done?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. So we I’ll let Matthew kinda jump in here in a second. But one thing I would point out is our customer need is driven not just on the renewable side. Historically, maybe more focused from an ESG perspective. Today, the issue is the need for power, all types of power.

Right? So and you definitely see that in, like, the Metas and the AT and Ts and Amazons. Yeah. Sure. Everybody wants to kinda move forward on the sustainability front, but it’s really that need for power.

So the late stage stuff that we have continue to see, if anything, an increase. Matthew, maybe you can speak to that in request for that power. I think your question, Aaron, if I’m hearing it correctly, really, you know, post the projects we have and that are in late stage, all of which can be done within the new legislative changes in The US. It’s really after that, the next stage called later in the in the decade or the end of the decade and beyond. You know, without the tax incentives, will they be attractive?

I think that’s a TBD, but it doesn’t it doesn’t prevent the projects that we have in the backlog from moving forward. That’s for sure. And if tax incentives aren’t an element of projects on a go forward basis, they’re gonna have to compete just like everything else with capital, and we’ll see what happens macrolays. You could make an argument. What you’ll see is power prices go up, which still allows you to make your returns, but we’ll see what happens at that time.

But do you wanna speak specifically to those two projects, Matthew?

Matthew Ackman, Head of Renewable Power, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Sure. Thanks. Thanks. Just to add what to what Greg said, we do have some projects in addition to the ones we’ve announced that are late stage and with a very high probability will continue to qualify for the credits.

And we do see very, very strong customer customer demand from these blue chip type customers like Aemeta, and we’re very pleased to add them to our roster. And these are the types of customers that wanna work with Enbridge, not just in our renewable business, but frankly across our gas businesses. As Greg talked about, it’s it’s really a multiplatform strategy, to satisfy demand for electricity that’s rising rapidly. We do so I think we have visibility to some more of these projects. You mentioned a couple, that should qualify, but the key is to be very disciplined in this environment.

It’s very fluid. There’s still some moving parts. The the bill was relatively favorable on the tax credit front, but there are still some administrative actions that could occur. So we’ll be conservative, and we’ll be opportunistic, but, we’ll stick to our very strong capital discipline in renewables. As Greg said, I think one thing to note on the seven stars that you mentioned, that is actually a Canadian project.

So, I think the policy in Canada is much more stable, and predictable right now. That’s a wind project in Saskatchewan. On cowboy, we’ll see. It’s a late stage project, solar project in Wyoming. And, again, on that one, it’ll have to hit our low risk commercial model, and that’s still evolving, frankly.

So we’ll keep developing those projects, but we’ll be disciplined and low risk in our approach to FID. And, Erin, I

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: think your last point was on the capital capacity. Yeah. I mean, the projects that Matthew has spoken about and the opportunities that we talked about for renewables, at the Investor Day, very much taken into account in our financial plans, and, they would they even with those projects coming forward, remember, we always have a couple of billion dollars of incremental capacity we could invest. So it’s really not it’s not capacity. It’s more investment quality and return relative to what is a plethora of opportunities across the, the entire business.

Speaker 8: Thanks. That’s a lot of great detail. Maybe just as my follow-up, one point of clarification. You’ve mentioned Homer City a couple of times today. Looks like this project is pretty far along.

Can you just give us a sense of you know, timeline to FID, potential capital requirements, returns in service date, and any potential gating items?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Cynthia can chime in here, but, to be blunt, no. Like, I think it is it’s kind of far along from an announcement perspective, but there’s a lot of work here. Right? That’s a four gigawatt plus project towards the end of the decade.

You know, they’re working through getting their gas supply agreements in principle. There’s a lot of pieces in there. So, you know, it could be everything from a straight lateral to an expansion of Texas Eastern. But until the customer actually has determined exactly how it wants to deal with that, all I can tell you is we will get our fair share.

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for that, Greg. I would just add that we are in those discussions. These discussions had started, you know, months ago. It’ll take a little while until we get through that final design and the commitments.

But as Greg said, we will definitely have to need to participate. I would note that Texas Eastern has about 10 BCF per day of underutilized receipt potential in that Marcellus supply region. And so we can do some very economical pipeline expansions, you know, to serve Pennsylvania and Ohio along our existing right of ways. So it’s great, and we have lots of ongoing conversations with developers, power generators, hyperscalers around that area of Pennsylvania and Ohio. So more to come, and we’ll keep you posted.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. You know, Erin, I I think about this as winning by a lot of singles and maybe the odd double. You know, I think as you would well understand, say, a gigawatt plant takes, say, a 150 a day, gigawatt gas plant, you know, that’s not a massive pipeline. Right? So and you can see that with line 31.

You can see that with with the Stash. With the Stash development. So it’s a lot of incremental pieces built very economically that add up to really nice investments. So sometimes I think people looking for the big splash billion dollar pipeline projects. I think those are gonna be few and far between for individual data centers.

So I think you gotta keep watching these incremental pieces. And, frankly, as investors, I think you should so I’ll do $1,000,000,000 expansions that happened quickly, relatively permanent light, probably not cross state, even though it may involve interstate pipe, all day long versus a big, say, greenfield new billion dollar pipe.

Speaker 8: That’s helpful. Thanks, everyone. I’ll turn it back.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks. Your

Speaker 3: next question comes from the line of Praneeth Satish from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.0: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe I’ll just piggyback off of that question. You’ve talked about obviously a lot of power generation opportunity and things. But so far, the announcements on the gas pipeline side, the pace of announcements has been a bit slower compared to peers.

I mean, you talked about having excess capacity. So maybe that’s one of the reasons why your projects are maybe smaller in size than some of the larger builds that are CapEx projects that we’re seeing. But maybe you could just kind of walk us through the differences here on Texas Eastern versus some of your other competitors? And is it because you have excess capacity? Are you waiting for the right returns?

Are there dependencies tied to, you know, associated utilities? Just trying to get some more color there.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, I think it’s a bit of both. And I’m not sure I’d agree with your view that people have actually made more announcements on the other side. I think there’s people talk about stuff, but let’s go down the list. Right? You got a gigawatt and a half billion dollar projects.

And, for TVA, they were proceed with it that’s going ahead. In North Carolina and GDS. There’s a gig 1.4 gigawatts, 600,000,000 plus for a Duke facility in Utah, couple of 100 megawatts plus. In Ontario, we’re still pursuing some of those opportunities and then the stuff that we just announced today. So I’m not sure I’m not sure I’d be on the same page there.

I think some people that’s maybe all they have. And as you know, we’ve got opportunities across multiple businesses on that front. And, I mean, I don’t know, perhaps you could you have that, but I’m not aware of anybody else having signed up Amazon, having signed up Meta, having signed up AT and T on the renewable side. So I think it’s an all of the above opportunity for us, and and I’m a big believer that much of this is actually gonna be done with utilities and the power utilities. And you will know that in neither the case in Mississippi or the SESH project that we announced, which utilities, those are two.

And that’s because they’re not really keen on actually indicating exactly what we’re doing on the data center side. So I think I think, Praneeth, you’ll you’ll find I think if you if you crawl through it, I mean, we can do a better job of communicating that to you, that there’s lots of pieces that we’re knocking off. And I think we’re actually ahead of what we said in terms of announcements from the investor day when we talked about the eighteen month look forward of which we’re now, what, four months since that time frame and more to come.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.0: Yeah. No. I mean, just to kind of clarify, I think you’re definitely getting a lot of traction certainly on the renewable side and on the utility side. So I’m not saying there is an exposure to the theme, but it was more just on the gas pipeline side because you have a premier footprint there and you’re kind of in the heart of this, especially with Homer City building. Would have thought there would be more, but like you mentioned, maybe it’s TBD and we’ll definitely stay tuned.

Maybe just switching gears for my other question. Mean, mentioned OBBA and the bonus DD and A provisions there that could benefit near term growth. Guess just from a tax perspective, does that lower your cash tax burden in the near term? When do you now expect to be a meaningful cash taxpayer?

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the question. Yeah.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.1: I think, generally, it’s a very positive outcome from the various tax changes, like, as you said, extension of bonus depreciation, which affects a big portion of our overall business. I think the way to think about it is this further, you know, adds helps to the fact that we’ll now be able to grow per share kind of in line with our EBITDA guidance. The last few years, there’s been a bit of a differential because of the growing cash tax, but this will help to offset that and give us more and more confidence and clarity into that growth into the back part of the decade. So, yeah, we’re excited about it, and we think it can help to grow our our cash flows for our shareholders.

Speaker 8: Thank you.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hope from Scotiabank. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.2: Good morning, everyone. On the data center theme, can you maybe add a little bit of commentary on how you’re thinking about the contractual frameworks and contractual protections regarding who the counterparty is and how you would potentially alter it, if at all, if it’s a utility customer or a behind the fence customer?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Obviously, from a credit perspective, other than and you see this on a renewable side, the Google’s and Meadows and AT and T’s, they’re obviously super credits. And that’s why we’re actually on balancing 75% of the opportunities with utilities who are existing customers today. They’re amazing credits too. So and they like to sign up for long term ten, fifteen, twenty year contracts take or pay.

If it is with a small data center hyperscaler player, I we we look at that really carefully. And, you know, some of those folks would have to probably provide LCs, etcetera. But, you know, that’s why, as I said, I think as this get continues to move forward rapidly, I I’m a strong believer you’re gonna continue to see those utility players there because this isn’t as easy as what people think. And the commitment to sign up for a ten or fifteen or twenty year pipeline contract or renewable contract says the big players will will be there. So from a analytical perspective, with all the data center opportunities out there, the winners here, just like on the pipeline side, will be the big players with scale, and that’s the customers that will largely largely serve.

I and and when I think about it, where the smaller players may have a better opportunity is frankly from our gas utilities where, you know, there’s a much larger scope of customers we have a requirement to serve. But even in some of those cases, depending what happens, they’d have to provide aids to construct, which is, you know, is an element. So I think we’ve got it covered from the big players and on the utility relatively small behind the meter stuff. You’d see that as a typical cost of service structure inside a utility. Super safe for the investor and very fair for the customer.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.3: Does that give Appreciate that color.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.2: Yeah. Exactly. And then switching gears here, just regarding the 9,000,000,000 to $10,000,000,000 of investment capacity per year. It is looking like you’re getting towards that range for 26,000,000,000 and $27,000,000,000 based off of the recent wins. How are you thinking about the cadence of when new or the cadence of project announcements and layering further capital in the next couple of years?

Or is now the focus turning towards the kind of, we’ll call it, beyond ’twenty seven timeframe?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.1: Yeah. I can take that, Rob. Yeah. I think it’s fair to say that in ’twenty five and ’twenty six, we’ve been filling up set pretty well over the last six to twelve months, and I think that should give people more and more clarity into that kind of 2728 growth rate. And I think it’s also fair to say that, you know, you look at the projects that we announced today, know, within service dates around 2829 that we’re now starting to fill in that back piece.

We still probably have a little bit of capacity to take some of the smaller bite sized things, a quick turn capital as we go here. But I think your comment is probably right in that we I think we’ve added a lot of great projects that add that clarity, call it, to the middle of the next half of the decade, and our job is to continue to provide high return projects into the back part. So from a capacity perspective, as I think I said in my remarks, I like the way it’s spread out across our businesses, but also spread out across the the rest of the decade here. So feeling very good as we get more transparency into that.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. I’d I’d say our our business development team is very much focused on the back half of the decade, and have been. Right? So that’s about extending, the growth, which, you know, we’ve got a lot of confidence in that post ’26 period. And then as Pat says, most of what we talked about today will be very little capital in the next twelve months.

And the stuff that does have capital, like on the GDS side of things, in some cases, you’ll start to earn on it before it even goes into service. But, otherwise, it’ll actually generate EBITDA within, say, the twelve months, which, of course, then creates capacity. Right?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.4: Thank you. Thanks.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Pham from BMO. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.3: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just want to go to your backlog and returns? And as I look at some of these projects you sanctioned the last couple of years, you mentioned Woodfiber low double digit returns, T North, T South, percent returns. When I look at that and I look at the new projects you’re announcing today, much better returns, is it is the trend then for Enbridge capital allocation increasingly shifting more these higher return projects that,

Speaker 8: you know, you talked about

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.3: the singles high returns that as we look up the next twelve months, that average return is gonna start moving higher in that secured backlog?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Absolutely. I think you put a finger on the great tension inside the company. Lots of opportunities, but only those those projects and those jurisdictions that provide better returns, I e lower build multiples are gonna get serviced. Right?

So I would tell you right now, that’s a challenge to do more in a place like British Columbia or even Ontario relative to Ohio or or, say, Texas. So, you know, we wanna keep our builds, you know, in that six to eight times, and then and then Colin has tons of stuff that is even on the bottom end, if not the below that six to eight times, so very competitive. And then, of course, Michelle has higher multiples but quicker cycle. And so, yeah, it’s a you you should see, and this is very much our focus, steady, and it’s a big boat to move or a big denominator to move, increase in return on capital employed as we move up the chain in value added investments. You you hit it right on.

It’s it’s actually a really nice environment as capital allocators to be able to pick and choose the best returns so we can keep those steady and stay stable and growing earnings that you all expect from us.

Speaker 6: Okay. Got it.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.3: Maybe switching to the storage side, you have the Aiken expansion. Can you confirm, is there more white space beyond the 40 Bcf a day? And then what’s the strategy on The U. S. Storage assets?

Is it more recontract or is there opportunity to expand as well?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, Cynthia, do you want to speak to that?

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Sure. So this 40 Bcf Aiken Creek is the most accessible. There would be other opportunities, but it would be not as accessible as this 40 BCF. This was part of what we knew in the acquisition that it would be as an easier stage step to get through. As it comes to other opportunities on the Gulf Coast, we continue to look at that.

We had some open seasons for storage expansions that we launched in May, and we’ve gotten some really good interest. So we’re looking at developing our salt caverns there along The US Gulf Coast. Of course, we expanded Trace Cavern 4 that just got into service beginning of the year. We also, as Greg noted, are continuing to the structure there, but we’re looking at whether with the open season interest, we’ll be expanding more at Trace, Egan, and Moss. There’s a lot of, obviously, opportunities in that area and the continued expansions and and LNG growth just provides some really good opportunities that we’re excited about right now.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Sometimes I think it’s under you know, we’ve got 600 bees out of storage across North America. Don’t forget, you know, Cynthia’s got great elements here, and the contracting has moved out a little longer and higher. You know, all that stuff sort of more three to five year type contracts, but at a higher rates than what we’ve seen for, say, the last five years. That’s kinda changed in the last eighteen months.

And don’t forget at GDS, we have a 100 or so BCF of storage that is unregulated. And is all the needs that come in on the power projects we’re talking about, LNG, not so much on data center, but LNG, etcetera, that makes that storage all the more valuable. Right? So it’s a good time for storage on the Gulf Coast and the Great Lakes regions and obviously in Western Canada where Aitken really is the only player in BC as LNG comes on.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.5: Okay. Thanks for update.

Pat Murray, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Sam Berwold from Jefferies. Your line is open.

Speaker 8: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. This has been hit on a little bit from some other angles, but just wanted to ask what’s your appetite for greenfield gas pipeline in Canada? There’s a pending LNG project that needs a pipe and likely someone to develop it. So would that be of any interest to you if you got assurances similar to what you said you would need to underwrite a larger pipe on the crude side?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, I’ll let Cynthia speak to it, but I think there’s no doubt. Seems like gas pipelines in Western Canada or across Canada seem to have a not not easy, but an easier road than, say, liquids lines. And as you know, I think we’ve set ourselves up to do that. The West Coast system is fabulous. Indigenous participation in the West Coast system is fabulous setup.

No guarantee that that gets you consent, but very helpful in aligning interest. But, Cynthia?

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. We still have the Pacific Trails pipeline project. Our p two p project would serve, you know, onto the West Coast. So there’s future opportunities there. We’ll continue to maintain that.

It’s fully certified. Of course, you know, that would require a new large scale LNG facility in the region to proceed. But we are obviously very supportive and continue to look at opportunities. Opportunities. It would, as Greg noted, have to hunt in our overall capital allocation, but it is something, of course, with our West Coast system and that knowledge and experience.

And now with our our recent move to improve our indigenous relationships in BC, I think we’re well positioned to support that.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. I think the situation is it’s gonna any greenfield pipe in Canada is gonna gonna have to have better returns in the West Coast system because, you know, the West Coast system is great and been there. It’s a cost of service type structure, but you’re not taking on the risk you would with a with a greenfield project. So that that that would be the determining factor. And as we’ve talked about throughout the call, we’re not exactly opportunity poor.

Speaker 8: Okay. Understood. Thanks very much, guys.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Gupta from UBS. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.6: Good morning, guys. Congrats on a very strong quarter and I think it’s not appreciated enough, but you probably indicated that you’re coming in towards the top end of the guidance. So given your track record, we actually think you might beat it, but we keep our estimates within that range. My question to you is a little bit on the Southern Illinois Connector open season. Looks like a very exciting project.

Can you talk a little bit more about this project and how this what what the path forward for this project is?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: I think the guy that runs the liquids business is here. He usually gets the first question, so I’m glad he gets probably the last one.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.7: Yeah. Good morning. Good morning, Manav. And we’re we’re excited about building out the the plumbing in North America here to serve some long term pretty sticky demand. And so maybe unlike m l o one, Southern Illinois Connector is is more of a a recontracting play.

So it’s it’s it’s kind of a it’s not new egress over the Canadian US border, but but think of it as long hauling existing barrels on the system even further to serve some Louisiana refineries, you know, adding to that, you know, 75% of refineries served on the continent. So just adds another market to to the network and in an efficient way, right, using using existing pipes and and in this case, you know, partnering with existing JV partner. So process on that one is the open season will will go into August, and we’ll we’ll we’ll we’ll look to roll some contracts on on the Spearhead pipeline and and add further long term sticky paths to the mainline. So that’s it’s exciting, and we’re looking for more of those type of projects here to to complement the the low multiple build out and egress ads for customers.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.6: Perfect, guys. On top of that, so I’ll turn it over. Thank you so much.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you. Thanks, Moe.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.0: Hi, good morning. Curious what the remaining gating items are on the Mainline expansion from this point? And are you expecting based on discussions that returns on this are going to be carved out separately from the CTS?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.7: Yeah. So as as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we’re we’re we’re looking at and tracking for an FID later this year. The the primary gating item has has has been achieved, which is the open season on the Southern part of the path, Flanagan South, and that was oversubscribed. So lots of interest in in long term demand to The US Gulf Coast. The other gating item is working with with the traditional counterparties within cap, if you like, or industry on on base kind of rolling in the, like, the mainline capital into the rate base.

And there’s many precedents for that historically. We’ve expanded the mainline, you know, countless times over the years, and we’re we’re confident we’ll, come to agreement with industry on that. And so it would fit within, CTS or in rate bay or MTS or in rate base. And when when we roll, you know, the subsequent tranche of of mainline agreement beyond its expiry in 2028, that capital would be, you know, duly considered in in the rate base of the mainline going forward. So we’d earn of and on the capital in the mainline as well.

So two parts to that project, kind of the mainline and then Flanagan South and and Seaway to The Gulf, and we’ve got many precedents for doing this historically. So there’s some, you know, a little bit of gating there, but a well treaded path historically to do such.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.0: Okay. Thanks. Thanks for that. Second question, there’s there’s a few different project proposals now to bring Permian gas to other markets away from the Gulf Coast. So I’m curious what you see as the next steps for your JV with Whitewater.

Can you extend the value chain into Louisiana? Do you look more at storage? What other opportunities do you see in that JV with Whitewater the next few years?

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. Thanks, Keith. You know, we’re really pleased with how our investment in and our joint venture with Whitewater has gone. There has been obviously some upside since the original one. We continue to have expansion projects.

You know, with Traverse, we just upsized that. We still see a lot of gas that would flow or want to flow to serve the the LNG markets. And so we think that there’s further expansion opportunities there. I know Whitewater just announced with a similar project yesterday that they’ve upsized Pelican. So we’re still seeing a lot of interest in that area.

The traverse pipeline as was noted provides more interconnectivity to allow that bidirectional flow between Agua Dolce and Katy hub. So that does create that tie. It does tie you know, what we loved about that those assets is it does tie to our existing footprint, that header system that we have with Techco and, of course, Traceable Ashes storage. So, yes, we would look at all opportunities to expand to to move those volumes, and we continue to see a lot of opportunities on a go forward basis.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: And we we could do something on our

Cynthia Hanson, Head of Gas Transmission, Enbridge Inc.: own too. We could.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: So it’s not just whitewater. It’s obviously, you know, be customer driven and, you know, do we think we have a better mousetrap than maybe the JV? Although, as Cynthia says, we’ve been really pleased with the the way that’s operated together. So, yeah, I mean, anything’s on the table there. And as you know, as GORs go up in the region, the demand for that gas continues to rise.

And, you know, I as as Cynthia just said, I think it’s you witnessed that in going from a b and three quarters to two and a quarter on the Traverse pipeline. So the opportunity is there, and we’ll either use the JV or we’ll figure out something on our own.

Speaker 6: Thank you.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Maurice Choi from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.4: Thanks and good morning everyone. I’ll just stick with one question, but it’s more of a wholesome question about relationships of customers rather than delivering individual assets. If you continue to hear more record spending on AI, you know, how broad of a cooperation discussion did you have with Meta in terms of supporting their needs beyond Clearfork? And maybe even AT and T and Amazon since you touched on them earlier, recognizing that Enbridge certainly has the assets, expertise, and relationships across all energy forms?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Well, you know, maybe I’ll start, and and Matthew can chime in here. It’s that that’s actually a really great question because, you know, I would say early days, you know, you’re almost dealing with supply chain people where they see it as a a source of something they need, I e power or the case of gas, to run their operation. I think as time goes off, we’re moving up the chain in who we’re dealing with at these corporations because of the real strategic nature of energy, which we all know, but it’s not you know, that’s not something maybe the tech world or data centers were kinda thinking through in the same way that we have. So making sure we understand their long term interest, what they’re trying to do, the scalability has has caused it to move up as opposed to just be a supply chain issue. Yeah.

Matthew Ackman, Head of Renewable Power, Enbridge Inc.: I totally agree, Maurice. Thanks for the question. That’s exactly how we think of it. And, you know, we’re in the early innings of a major trend in energy that we can capitalize on across several of our business units. Renewable can be a little bit of a nexus, for for that initially.

And if you saw the quote from Meta, in our Clearfork announcement was that they were thrilled to be working with Enbridge, and we’re very pleased to be working with them. And it just goes to show that, you know, they’re signaling they wanna definitely do more, and there’s lots of conversations with these types of customers that are ongoing. And so we see those being more the types of customers we can do business with across all of our platforms.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. And and and size matters. Right? The old Russian accent that quantity has a quality all of its own. People wanna work with big players.

So, you know, Meta doesn’t wanna wanna work with a small cap energy provider. They wanna work with a major, player and someone who’s in 40 plus states and, you know, multiple countries and and all the provinces, if you will, if you think in a North American context. So that is really mattering in a big way. And I think as you see further projects FID ed and Matthew’s World and and, both on GDS and, GTM. You’ll see these players come to the fore either through a utility, but they wanna know how are they ultimately getting that infrastructure served, and can they rely on the energy?

And and that’s what we provide.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.4: No. That’s very good to hear. Thank you very much.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you.

Speaker 3: Your next question comes from the line of Theresa Chen from Barclays. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.5: Thank you for squeezing me in. I just had a follow-up on the Ohio utility. Related to the impairment of this asset, can you talk about what led to this considering that it was only recently acquired? And when we take this into account as well as the rate case decision that’s currently being appealed, longer term, does this change your view on the trajectory of growth or on the margin change the amount of CapEx you would allocate between the utilities?

Michelle Heritance, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: I’ll get things started and Pat can add if he wants to, Teresa. But the impairment the primary impairment associated with the Ohio utility, it was to do with the treatment of the pension asset, which was quite a significant asset that was in there. And and they were determined those pension assets were determined to be excluded from the calculation of rate base. The the position we had actually put forward was to have them excluded from rate base, so that’s not inconsistent with what we were looking for. We’re just asking for a rehearing with regard to how they treated the accumulated deferred income tax on that pension and where they they put that in for the purposes of calculating revenue reduction.

So it’s something we expected was going to happen. And that that’s the majority of the the write off of the regulatory asset that we recorded. And then there’s a smaller amount associated with the annual incentive plan. And in that case, again, we’re we’re applying for rehearing on that point and primarily with regard to the what we believe is retroactive rate making where they’ve gone and disallowed it from anything that was put in attributable to that piece previously. But, Pat, I don’t know if there’s anything else you’d like

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.5: to add.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.1: I think you covered the kind of the genesis of the write off. Well, I think your second question on let’s just change our capital allocation. No. I mean, I think Greg hit it quite quite clearly that it’s still a very good return, almost 10%. We actually got a higher equity thickness coming through that.

We have the main maintenance of the of the capital riders, which are important in this asset. And so I think it’s still a very positive framework to to work with for a regulatory perspective. So I think you could see us go back for hearings a little more often than they would have done historically. As you know, there was this first hearing in, like, fifteen years. So I think you’ll see some of that from a from a rate strategy perspective.

But at at the end of the day, not at all unexpected as a result of the rate case.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. And I I wouldn’t I don’t think it has anything what to do with the fundamentals of the business, your comment about a write off so soon after the acquisition. Like, frankly, we think they’ve erred in law. In fact, they may be where they’re going violates actually some federal pension laws, but we’ll take we’ll take that up with them. And if we’re right, you’re gonna see this reverse down the road.

So, that’s the way we kinda think about it.

Michelle Heritance, Head of Gas Distribution and Storage, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. The only thing I’d pass on is a lot of those pension assets actually went with Dominion. So remember, this is a rate case that was filed by Dominion in 2023. Dominion continues to carry the obligation with regard to the pensions with for all the retired employees. And because it had been fifteen years, that had really grown to quite a large piece.

That’s with Dominion. We’ve just got the current employees going forward. So all of that needs to be updated with the regulator, and our plan is to file for another rate case here likely by the end of this year just to bring all those numbers. These are these numbers date back to ’23. They date it back to pre acquisition, so there’s a lot that needs to be updated with the regulator too.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.5: Thank you for the detailed answer and we look forward to the next chapters of this development.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thanks.

Speaker 3: Your final question comes from the line of Patrick Kenny from National Bank Financial. Your line is open.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.8: Thank you. Good morning. Just back on the preference here of customers continuing to push more and more barrels to the Gulf Coast. Just wondering if we can get a quick update on Ingleside, how throughput has been trending on a year over year basis and where things are at with respect to potentially sanctioning some of the optimization and dock expansion opportunities?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.7: Hey, Pat. It’s Colin. Up until the right, I think, is the the summation to your answer. So we steadily are growing volumes through the terminal. As we’ve talked to you about its advantaged.

We’ve got some more storage coming online. I would also, yeah, point you to some longer term kind of bigger upsides and and adding docks and stuff. We’ve done all the dredging, as you know, historically, and continue to add add barrels to it. We’re adding a fungible service, which is incremental to the historic business model, which has been just, you know, dedicated term storage. So that’s incremental as well.

So I think all the the whole menu of services and variety of of smaller, you know, optimizations and tweaks. And then later on as as the Permian Basin grows, we can we can add docks. I can confirm that we have connected the the adjacent Flint Dock over and are able to load there too and optimize windows to get, you know, the smaller vessels there and the bigger vessels, VLCCs at the Legacy Dock. So plan is on track and and more to come.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: It’s interesting that we all often focus on domestic demand and things like that, but global oil demand is really, really strong. And, obviously, that’s a that’s a a great setup for Ingleside on a go forward basis as well, regardless if you see some Permian weakness later in the year.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.8: And maybe as a quick follow-up there on your point, Greg. I know you’ve been previously looking at NGL export opportunities as well at Ingleside. But I guess in light of Asian buyers perhaps looking to diversify their petrochemical supply, curious if you might be looking to pivot opportunistically at other sites across North America, including Canada’s West Coast here, especially as LNG exports continue to ramp up over time?

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.7: Yeah. You know, I’d I’d say the the strategy still is to kind of copy paste all the advantages from crude export at that terminal to other commodities at that terminal. So still NGL and potentially, you know, clean ammonia over time as well here. So that that remains the playbook. We got lots of land.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Yeah. You better move us, you know, as opposed to doing it in Canada. Think if we copy paste to a different location, probably somewhere else along the Gulf Coast, and you’ve heard us ruminate about that from time to time. And, yeah, that that’ll come to fruition over time a little further out, though.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.8: Okay. That’s great. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Greg Ebel, President and CEO, Enbridge Inc.: Thank you. And

Speaker 3: that concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rebecca Morley for some final closing remarks.

Rebecca Morley, Vice President of Investor Relations and Insurance, Enbridge Inc.: Great. Thank you. And we appreciate your ongoing interest in Enbridge. As always, our Investor Relations team is available following the call for any additional questions that you may have. Once again, thanks, and have a great day.

Speaker 3: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

The Big Takeaway The great American car isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments.","Why Did a Lada End Up in a Celebration of American Cars?

You might have seen the viral photo: a proud announcement about the return of the great American car, paired with an image of… a Lada. Yes, that Lada—the boxy, Soviet-era sedan that’s about as Russian as borscht and snow. It’s the kind of mix-up that makes you do a double-take, then laugh, then wonder how it happened in the first place.

So, what’s going on here? Was it a simple mistake, or does it say something deeper about how we view American car culture today? Let’s dig in.

What Makes a Car “American” Anyway?

For decades, the American car has been a symbol of innovation, freedom, and even rebellion. Think of the Ford Mustang tearing down a desert highway, or the Chevy pickup hauling hay bales at sunrise. But the lines have blurred. Today, many “American” cars are assembled from global parts, and some of the most reliable vehicles on U.S. roads are made by companies headquartered in Japan or Germany.

A recent report from the American University Kogod School of Business found that only about half of the top-selling cars in the U.S. are actually built here with a majority of American parts. The rest? They’re global mashups—engines from Mexico, transmissions from Canada, electronics from Korea. The Lada photo gaffe, intentional or not, highlights just how fuzzy the definition of “American car” has become.

How Did the Lada Become an Accidental Mascot?

Let’s be honest: the Lada isn’t exactly the poster child for American automotive excellence. It’s a relic of Soviet engineering, known for its simplicity and ruggedness, not its style or speed. So why did it show up in a celebration of American manufacturing?

Most likely, someone grabbed a stock photo without double-checking the details. It’s a classic case of “good enough” in the age of fast-paced digital content. But there’s an irony here that’s hard to ignore. The Lada, with its utilitarian design and no-nonsense attitude, almost feels like a tongue-in-cheek nod to the days when American cars were built for durability, not just looks.

Are We Romanticizing the Past or Facing Reality?

There’s a certain nostalgia baked into the idea of the “great American car.” We remember the chrome, the tailfins, the V8s rumbling down Main Street. But the reality is, the auto industry has changed. Today’s cars are safer, more efficient, and packed with technology. Yet, the longing for a return to “the good old days” persists.

The Lada photo blunder might actually be a wake-up call. Maybe it’s time to stop chasing an idealized past and start appreciating the innovation happening right now. Electric trucks, hybrid SUVs, and advanced driver-assist systems are redefining what it means to drive American. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, electric vehicle sales in the U.S. grew by over 85% in 2023 alone—a clear sign that the future is already here, even if it doesn’t look like the past.

What Can We Learn from This Mix-Up?

Here’s the thing: mistakes like this are easy to laugh at, but they also open the door to bigger questions. What do we really want from our cars? Is it nostalgia, or is it progress? And how do we balance pride in American manufacturing with the realities of a global economy?

One lesson is clear: authenticity matters. Whether you’re building cars or telling stories about them, people crave the real deal. That means celebrating the true achievements of American automakers—like the resurgence of electric vehicles made in Detroit or the rise of innovative startups challenging the status quo.

The Big Takeaway

The great American car isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments.

Ford’s EV transformation isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments.","What Will Ford’s New EV Strategy Actually Change for Drivers and Investors?

Ford’s upcoming August 11 announcement isn’t just another corporate update—it’s being billed as the company’s “Model T moment” for electric vehicles. That’s a bold claim, especially from CEO Jim Farley, who’s known for his candor and willingness to shake things up. But what does this mean for the average driver or the savvy investor watching the EV space?

Farley has made it clear: profitability is the new North Star. Instead of chasing every EV niche, Ford’s going to zero in on segments where it can actually make money. This is a big shift from the “growth at all costs” mindset that’s dominated the electric car conversation for years. Investors should take note—Ford’s not just chasing volume, but sustainable returns.

Why Is Ford Looking to China for Inspiration Instead of Detroit?

Here’s where things get really interesting. Farley isn’t shy about his admiration for Chinese EV makers. He’s even been daily-driving a Xiaomi SU7, calling it “fantastic” and admitting he’s reluctant to give it up. That’s not just lip service. On a recent earnings call, Farley flat-out said that Ford’s real competition isn’t GM, Stellantis, or Volkswagen anymore—it’s Chinese companies like BYD and Geely.

Why? Because China’s EV makers are outpacing the rest of the world in both cost and innovation. According to the International Energy Agency, China accounted for nearly 60% of global EV sales in 2023, and their cars are often thousands of dollars cheaper than Western rivals. Farley’s takeaway: if Ford wants to survive, it needs to radically re-engineer how it designs, builds, and sources its EVs. No more business as usual.

How Is Ford Planning to Catch Up With Chinese EV Leaders?

Ford’s answer isn’t just to build cheaper cars—it’s to rethink the entire process. Farley talks about “radical re-engineering” of the engineering, supply chain, and manufacturing. That means looking for efficiencies everywhere, from battery sourcing to final assembly. It also means leaning into partnerships. As EV technology becomes more commoditized, it’s getting harder for any one brand to stand out on tech alone. Ford’s strategy is to team up where it makes sense, especially on complex systems like electrical architecture, and focus its resources where it can actually make a difference.

There’s a bit of humility here, too. Ford knows it’s behind, but it’s willing to learn from the best—even if the best are halfway around the world.

What’s the Real Impact of Tariffs on Ford’s EV Ambitions?

Tariffs are a thorny issue for Ford. The company is shelling out about $2 billion a year just in tariff-related costs, mostly from imported components. That’s a huge drag on profitability. But Farley sees a silver lining. Recent negotiations have brought some tariffs down from 25% to 15%, and he believes Ford’s status as a major American employer could help it secure more favorable treatment in the future.

There’s also a bigger trend at play: regionalization. As countries tighten their own electrification and emissions rules, and as tariff regimes shift, automakers are being forced to localize production and supply chains. Ford’s betting that by being nimble and leveraging its U.S. manufacturing footprint, it can turn these challenges into a competitive edge.

Are Partnerships the Secret Sauce for Ford’s EV Future?

With EV technology rapidly commoditizing, Ford is doubling down on strategic alliances. It’s a pragmatic move—no single automaker can do it all, especially as the pace of innovation accelerates. By partnering on things like battery tech, software, and supply chain logistics, Ford can share costs, speed up development, and avoid reinventing the wheel.

This approach is already paying off in the industry. For example, Ford’s collaboration with SK Innovation on battery plants in the U.S. is expected to create thousands of jobs and secure a steady supply of batteries for future models. It’s not just about cost-cutting; it’s about building resilience in a volatile global market.

What Does This Mean for the Future of Affordable EVs?

Farley’s “Model T moment” comment is more than just marketing. The original Model T revolutionized transportation by making cars affordable and accessible to the masses. Ford’s new EV strategy hints at a similar ambition: to bring down costs and make electric vehicles a realistic option for everyday drivers, not just early adopters or luxury buyers.

If Ford can pull this off—by streamlining manufacturing, leveraging partnerships, and out-innovating on cost—it could spark a new wave of EV adoption in North America and beyond. That’s not just good for Ford; it’s good for anyone hoping to see more affordable, practical electric cars on the road.

This action marks the most sweeping reexamination of federal climate policy since the 2009 endangerment determination was first issued. The 2009 determination concluded, under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (""CAA""), that six GHGs from new motor vehicles contribute to air pollution that could endanger public health or welfare, thereby allowing EPA regulation.

EPA justifies the proposed rule by arguing the statute authorizes vehicle standards only for pollutants that endanger health or welfare through local or regional exposure, not for substances—such as GHGs—which were based on global climate change concerns. EPA further reasons that it lacked statutory authority in 2009 to issue a freestanding endangerment finding and now proposes to revoke it outright.

If finalized, the rule requires no response from motor vehicle and engine manufacturers; instead, the proposed rule promises flexibility. EPA is specifically proposing to remove certain regulations concerning emission standards, reporting requirements, and testing procedures.

The legal ramifications of the rule could be widespread. While the 2009 Endangerment Finding was made in the context of motor vehicle emissions, it led to a series of cascading consequences that led to other rules regulating GHGs under the CAA. EPA recognizes this reliance in the rule and states it has ""initiated or intend[s] to initiate separate rulemakings that will address any overlapping issues."" EPA already proposed a rule to repeal GHG emission standards for power plants by finding that the emissions are not reasonably anticipated to endanger the public health or welfare. Regulations that stem from statutory authority other than the CAA will likely not be affected by this proposal.

Written comments on the proposed rule must be received on or before September 21, 2025. Litigation surrounding the final rule is expected. Regulated parties should prepare for a period of substantial uncertainty in which federal GHG standards may be stayed, withdrawn, or revised, while state initiatives and market forces continue to advance GHG reduction efforts.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15759_5453.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 14:03:40.984932

Below is a summary of the major updates, with each section highlighting the core changes.

The Return of Bonus Depreciation and Other Big Deductions

The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property placed in service after January 19, 2025, and increases the Section 179 expensing limit to $2.5 million. New options allow for 40% or 60% bonus depreciation in certain cases, and special rules apply for qualified production property. These incentives are designed to encourage business investment in equipment, machinery, and other properties.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act Increases Deduction for State and Local Tax but Fails to Address Nexus Concerns

Individual taxpayers benefit from a temporary increase in the SALT deduction cap, rising from $10,000 to $40,000, with a gradual phase-out for high-income earners. The cap increases by 1% annually until 2030, after which it reverts to $10,000. However, the Act does not address business state tax nexus concerns, leaving Public Law 86-272 unchanged.

Employee Retention Credit (ERC) Changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Some Disallowances, Six-Year Statute of Limitations and Expanded Penalties

The OBBBA disallows pending ERC claims submitted after January 31, 2024, for the third and fourth quarters of 2021, but leaves earlier claims intact. The statute of limitations for IRS audits on ERC claims is extended to six years, and new penalties apply for improper claims and due diligence failures by ERC promoters.

Qualified Small Business (1202) Stock: Easier to Qualify and Exit; Bigger Tax Savings

For new stock issuances, the QSBS exclusion under Section 1202 is expanded: the asset limit rises to $75 million, the exclusion phases in over three years (50% at year 3, 75% at year 4, 100% at year 5), and the gain exclusion cap increases to $15 million or 10x basis. These changes make QSBS more attractive for investors and business owners.

One Big Beautiful Bill Act Preserves Federal Tax Exemption for Municipal Bonds

The OBBBA preserves the federal tax exemption for municipal bonds and introduces several modifications, including a reduced threshold for 4% low-income housing tax credits, a new exempt facility bond category for spaceports, and changes to qualified small issue bonds.

The One Big Beautiful Bill’s New Qualified Opportunity Zones

The QOZ program is made permanent, with rolling 10-year designations and stricter requirements for low-income community qualifications. New rules introduce a rolling five-year deferral for capital gains, enhanced benefits for rural opportunity zones, and a 30-year cap on tax-free exit benefits. Reporting requirements are also heightened.

Clean Energy Tax Credit Changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act

The Act limits future eligibility for wind and solar tax credits, requiring projects to be placed in service by December 31, 2027, and introduces stricter domestic content and anti-foreign influence requirements. Carbon sequestration credits are expanded, and credits for clean transportation fuels and other technologies are modified or phased out.",https://www.jw.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/AdobeStock_306848457-Tax-deduction-planning-concept.-Businessman-calculating-business-balance-prepare-tax-reduction.-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 13:08:40.246551

Piedmont Lithium Inc. (Nasdaq: PLL; ASX: PLL) is a U.S.-based lithium company aiming to become a key player in the North American electric vehicle (EV) battery supply chain. The company’s main asset is North American Lithium (NAL), a joint venture in Quebec churning out spodumene concentrate—essentially the starting material for lithium batteries. Piedmont also has a stake in Ghana’s Ewoyaa lithium project and is working on two fully integrated lithium hydroxide plants: Carolina Lithium in North Carolina and Tennessee Lithium in Tennessee. Piedmont makes money by selling spodumene concentrate both on spot markets and via contracts, with ambitions to move further down the supply chain and process its own battery-grade lithium hydroxide. The lithium industry is running fast, powered by booming EV demand—but it’s a wild ride, with price swings, supply hiccups, and a raft of new regulations (especially U.S. tax breaks favoring local battery materials). The big dogs Piedmont is up against include Albemarle and Livent on one side, plus up-and-comers like Sigma Lithium and Lithium Americas. Piedmont’s edge? They’re one of the few U.S.-based, vertically integrated lithium producers, bolstered by offtake deals (including Tesla) and U.S. government incentives, which help them secure long-term EV supply deals.

Recent Performance

From August 2, 2024 to August 2, 2025, Piedmont’s stock slid from $9.13 to $7.32—a loss of 19.8%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 climbed more than 16%, going from 5,346.56 to 6,238.01. Piedmont’s poor showing traces back to a dramatic slump in lithium prices driven by global oversupply and slower-than-hoped EV adoption. Worries have also piled up about how quickly they’re burning through cash and falling revenue (Q1 2025 pulled in $20 million, down from $45.6 million the previous quarter).

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Piedmont racked up record growth in 2024, with revenue jumping 150.8% to $99.9 million and spodumene shipments up 169.5% to 116,700 dmt. Q1 2025 stayed on track, shipping 27,000 dmt and targeting full-year shipments of 113,000–130,000 dmt. The growth engine here is clear: Carolina and Tennessee lithium hydroxide plants (each planning to produce 30,000 tons per year), the Ewoyaa project in Ghana, and the pending Sayona merger (expected to create Elevra Lithium). Strong and steady EV demand, reshoring of supply chains in North America, and U.S. tax credits should keep medium-term demand healthy.

Quality & Moat

Piedmont’s strengths are offset by some hefty weaknesses. The positives: they’ve struck strategic offtake agreements (think Tesla), have a proven asset in NAL, and secured key permits for their Carolina project—helped by growing U.S. interest in supply security. But on the downside, they posted a net loss of $56.8 million over the last twelve months and keep burning cash, with operating margins at –54.8% and returns on invested capital at –21.9%. The management has trimmed capital spending and raised cash by selling assets and equity, but delivering on new projects and smoothly merging with Sayona are still big hurdles.

Valuation

Piedmont’s stock is trading at a rock-bottom 0.33× EV/sales multiple, far below the market average of 4.43×. That steep discount reflects their current losses and the risks around their various new projects. Forward P/E isn’t even meaningful as they’re posting losses, compared to the market average of 24.96×. The deep discount might protect against further downside, but it only changes if Piedmont can rein in cash burn, get new plants up and running, and start delivering profits. Upcoming milestones—like plant progress and merger benefits—could be the triggers for a re-rating.

Market Sentiment

In the short run, Piedmont’s stock is up 9.6% on its 50-day trend, but it’s anything but calm—volatility is at 102%, compared to 23% for the average stock (the beta is 1.80). Short sellers are circling, with 9.7% of the float sold short. Analysts, for now, are sitting on the fence with a Hold consensus, though the average price target is $13.50 (that’s 117% potential upside) based on six analyst calls. Institutions are taking a wait-and-see approach, and insiders haven’t been active given the pending merger vote.

Key Risks

Commodity Price Volatility: Lithium prices have dropped more than 80% since late 2023 due to oversupply out of China and cooling EV demand. That’s squeezing Piedmont’s margins and cash flow.

High Cash Burn and Financing Risk: Piedmont is losing cash fast (FCF yield of –44.2%) and running operating losses, so they’ll need to keep raising funds, which could mean shareholder dilution or tougher debt terms.

Execution and Project Delays: Getting the Carolina and Tennessee lithium plants built and running on time is critical—any delays push back Piedmont’s path to profitability.

Merger Approval Uncertainty: The merger with Sayona is key for scaling up and getting synergies, but it needs shareholder and regulatory sign-off. Any hiccups could derail Piedmont’s plans.

Regulatory and Community Opposition: Local permit and environmental concerns (especially around water in Gaston County) could ramp up costs or delay operations.

Bull Case

Long-Term EV Demand: Forecasts suggest global EV adoption will keep growing at over 20% a year through 2030, which keeps lithium demand strong.

IRA-Driven Domestic Incentives: U.S. tax credits for domestic battery materials are a tailwind for American producers like Piedmont, improving the economics for new projects.

Undervalued on EV/Sales: With an EV/sales multiple at 0.33×—far lower than peers—Piedmont could see a lot of upside if it can stabilize and boost margins.

Merger Synergies: The Elevra Lithium merger could deliver $15–20 million in annual cost savings and provide more funding options for projects.

Robust Asset Pipeline: The Carolina and Tennessee projects aim to deliver 60,000 tons per year of lithium hydroxide, setting Piedmont up as a fully integrated supplier across the lithium chain.

Bear Case

Continued Price Downturn: If lithium remains oversupplied or EV sales keep missing expectations, Piedmont could be forced to sell below cost.

Cash Refinancing Needs: Heavy cash burn may mean regular dilutive share sales or expensive borrowing, which could hit shareholder value hard.

Negative Profitability: With operating margins still deep in the red at –54.8%, breakeven isn’t on the immediate horizon.

Merger Execution Risk: A cross-border merger and reverse stock split are complex and risky, and could distract management while they’re needed elsewhere.

Regulatory Delays: Permitting and local pushback could slow progress on the Carolina and Tennessee plants, which means waiting longer for new revenue streams.

On Our Radar

Special Stockholder Meeting: Meeting adjourned to August 11, 2025 for the Sayona merger vote—a quorum is still needed to close the deal.

Q2 2025 Earnings Release: Expected mid-August 2025 and should update the market on shipments, cash flow, and overall project momentum.

Merger Closing: Piedmont is targeting a mid-2025 close of the Elevra Lithium merger, if the votes and approvals come through.

Carolina Lithium FEED Study: Piedmont expects a final investment decision by late 2025, pending results of front-end engineering for the Carolina Lithium project.

Ewoyaa Permitting: Parliamentary ratification for the Ewoyaa mining lease in Ghana is expected in the second half of 2025.

Investment Conclusion

Piedmont Lithium is a classic high-risk, high-reward story. It looks undervalued on EV/sales and plays a strategic role in building out North America’s battery supply chain, which could pay off big if lithium markets bounce back and new plants start delivering. But right now, negative margins, rapid cash burn, tough project execution, and big open questions about the Sayona merger all pose real risks. Long-term investors with a healthy appetite for risk might see the current share price and discounted valuation as a rare opportunity—but only if they’re prepared to keep a close eye on project milestones, merger approvals, and where lithium prices go from here.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-08-02 06:00:10.968103

*** Giulia Mannarino of Belleville, is a grandmother concerned about her two granddaughters’ futures and a member of Mid-Ohio Valley Climate Action.","It’s exciting that one of the world’s largest solar microgrid and storage projects is currently under construction and located in West (by God) Virginia! The “Canary Solar Grid” project in Jackson County, just outside of Ravenswood, will help power a titanium manufacturing facility. A solar microgrid is an innovative, popular energy technology that’s giving businesses and communities access to cleaner and more reliable power. Energy generated by the solar array can be stored in a battery storage system for use during times when the sun doesn’t shine. This project is notable as one of the first where a large industrial plant is directly powered by a solar-plus-storage microgrid. It’s also supporting and strengthening domestic renewable energy initiatives and supply chains; 100% of the solar panels are sourced and manufactured in Ohio, and 100% of the steel used is made in the U.S. The project is a collaborative effort between BHE Renewables and Precision Castparts Corp.(PCC), specifically their Titanium Metals Corporation facility (TIMET). The companies are part of the Berkshire Hathaway diverse portfolio of businesses.

For 50 years, the 2,000 acre site was home to Century Aluminum. Their giant smelter was idled in 2009 and permanently closed in 2015. Since then the site has been an empty expanse along the Ohio River. Now PCC has started construction on the facility that will melt titanium while BHE Renewables is installing arrays of solar panels and large battery systems, which will form the microgrid that connects to the titanium facility. Demand for titanium products is rising in the U.S., driven largely by the aerospace and defense industries. As a metal, titanium is twice as strong as aluminum and weighs nearly half as much as steel, while still having a similar strength. It is durable, highly corrosion-resistant and used in industrial applications such as airplane wings and military armor as well as high-end consumer products like golf clubs and iPhones. Many people have titanium fused into their bodies, in the form of joint replacements, dental implants, and pacemakers. Transforming titanium minerals into a sturdy metal requires enormous amounts of electricity. The solar-plus-battery system will provide the reliable power supply the melting furnaces require at a cost that compares to traditional power sources.

The cost of building the solar microgrid system is eligible for investment tax credits included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August of 2022. The IRA provisions included clean energy production initiatives that addressed the crisis of global warming by helping the U.S. reach critical climate emissions goals of the Paris Agreement. BHE Renewables is constructing the microgrid in phases that match TIMET’s energy needs as it develops and operates its facility. Initially, the melting plant is expected to need around 18 megawatts of power to operate before ramping up to its full capacity by the end of 2027. The first phase began operations in May 2025 when the first solar microgrid panels were installed at the Ravenswood Business Park. Each phase contains part of the solar array and part of the battery system. PCC will have their TIMET facility use the solar energy to produce titanium products, creating the start of an industrial hub. It’s designed to serve 70% of TIMET’s expected energy demand. When fully built, the BHE Renewables project will include a 106 MW solar array and a battery energy storage system with a capacity of 50 MW, or 260.5 megawatt-hours. The project is expected to be a model for future industrial facilities seeking to utilize renewable energy.

Another company based in Michigan, ONE (Our Next Energy), will also be building a new factory on the site. ONE debuted a new utility scale battery storage system in February 2023 and will make the batteries the BHE Renewables facility will need right on site. And the company will continue to manufacture their utility scale battery storage system to market to other interested businesses. The batteries deploy lithium iron phosphate technology, a lower-cost chemistry that’s catching on for stationary storage. This project may be the first to show that a microgrid can meet an industrial customer’s demands as well as create economic revitalization through manufacturing without polluting the environment. With all of West Virginia’s members of Congress racing backwards towards the fossil Fool industry, my hope is more solar projects will materialize in our state’s future.

When Will Haseltine saw images online of a small, boxy electric pickup from startup Slate Auto this past spring, he got on the waitlist right away. The sparse interior and crank windows reminded him of the no-frills pickups he grew up around in Memphis, Tennessee – but he was most enamored with the sub-$20,000 price tag.

That price, though, factored in a $7,500 federal tax break, which is set to expire Sept. 30, a casualty of the budget package U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month. Now Haseltine isn’t sure the truck will fit his budget when it comes out, expected late next year.

“The Slate was the first time that I looked at a car, wanted it, and could also really make it happen,” said Haseltine, a 39-year-old musical instrument technician. Without the tax credit, he said: “That’s just plain too much.”

Michigan-based Slate has raised $700 million from investors, including founder Jeff Bezos, and has racked up more than 100,000 reservations for its cars. But the company is launching into a tough U.S. market.

A few years ago, the electric-vehicle space was awash in hopeful entrepreneurs looking to cash in on the global transition to electric cars. But U.S. EV sales growth has cooled as consumer interest has faded. The loss of federal tax breaks will further hurt demand, auto executives and analysts predict.

Like other EV startups, Slate likely faces a long road to profitability. The EV business has proven to be a money loser for most industry players, partly because batteries remain relatively expensive. Even in China, where smaller, inexpensive EVs have proliferated and companies enjoy a cost advantage over Western automakers, most are unprofitable.

Slate founders believe the company can overcome those obstacles by offering something that is in short supply in today’s U.S. car market: affordability. The average new-vehicle selling price is above $45,000.

“We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never delivered,” Slate CEO Chris Barman said at a Detroit conference in July.

The company has a chance to fill a void left by Tesla, which has backtracked on plans to introduce a mid-$20,000s electric vehicle.

The startup has taken a bare-bones approach to its two-seat pickup, which is slightly smaller than a Honda Civic hatchback. How bare-bones? A stereo and power windows will cost extra. Slate hasn’t disclosed the cost of such add-ons.

‘IT’S A COOL IDEA’

Slate’s creation started with an idea from Miles Arnone, the CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing, a Massachusetts-based startup that includes several former Amazon employees. Arnone believed workers needed better access to affordable vehicles.

Arnone shared his idea with Jeff Wilke, the company’s chairman and a former Amazon executive, and eventually, a small team was formed. The group hired Barman, who spent most of her career as an engineering executive at Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis.

Barman told Reuters recently that Slate will be able to absorb the loss of the $7,500 tax credit because the truck’s price still will undercut competitors.

The company plans to build the pickup at an old catalog factory in Warsaw, Indiana. Executives are taking steps to hold down costs, starting with a simplified design that uses about 500 parts in the truck’s assembly, compared with a few thousand for a traditional truck.

The plan to build all of its trucks in a basic package – what the company calls a “SKU of one” – allows customers to choose to add a stereo, center console, special lighting, and other features later.

The pickup will be built with composite body panels in gray, with an option for a vinyl wrap. That will sidestep the need for a paint shop, which is one of the most expensive investments in a typical car factory.

Slate’s minimalist approach is a leap of faith that Americans will forgo creature comforts they have been increasingly willing to splurge on. Last year, U.S. buyers spent 33% above the base price on average, springing for higher-end trim packages and extra features, according to . That was up from 28% in 2014.

But there is mounting evidence that new cars are becoming out of reach for many Americans. That could worsen under the effects of the Trump administration’s tariffs, which threaten to increase prices on popular budget cars imported from Mexico, Korea and elsewhere.

From that standpoint, Slate’s price-conscious pickup might be hitting at the right time, said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific.

“There’s a growing appetite, especially among younger drivers, for vehicles that are more honest, more modular and less over-engineered,” he said. “Slate taps right into that.”

Traditional automakers and startups have found mixed success rolling out larger electric pickup trucks in recent years. Now, startups like Slate and California-based Telo are focusing on smaller electric pickups.

In a town hall meeting in early May, Ford CEO Jim Farley and Executive Chair Bill Ford told employees they admired the company’s customer-centered ethos and focus on affordability.

Tim Kuniskis, Stellantis’ head of American brands, called Slate “super interesting” at a June event, while also questioning how affordable it would be for some shoppers once they added all the options they wanted.

“The idea behind it, we’ve talked about that idea a million times,” he said. “It’s a cool idea.”",https://arizonadigitalfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2025-07-28T102100Z_1_LYNXMPEL6R0FH_RTROPTP_4_AUTOS-SLATE.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 01:01:04.681523

The Clean Energy and Smart Grids program, supported by a grant from the NiSource Charitable Foundation and NIPSCO, will educate students and teachers at East Chicago Central High School and Hammond Central High School through on-campus learning sessions and site visits to energy facilities. The field observations and discussions will promote opportunities for learners to think critically about the impact of clean energy in their communities and how to pursue sustainable solutions.

“This program empowers high school students and teachers to engage directly with the clean energy transition through site visits and lab-based learning,” said Arash Asrari, PNW associate professor of electrical engineering, in a press release. “By working side by side with Purdue Northwest undergraduate and graduate students on practical clean energy projects, high school participants gain valuable hands-on experience while we collectively build a strong pipeline of skilled talent to support our region’s clean energy future.”

The program is made possible through a $100,000 grant from the NiSource Charitable Foundation and NIPSCO.

“We hope that through our support of this program a generation of students today will emerge as our leaders of tomorrow, focused on utilizing innovation and new technology to advance our energy needs in responsible ways,” Reginald Fields, NiSource Charitable Foundation executive director, said.

The Foundation and NIPSCO launched the Bridging Our Energy grant in 2024. Two grant recipients were selected based on proposed initiatives that advance local communities across NIPSCO’s service area that promote greater economic inclusion.

The Clean Energy and Smart Grids program will provide participants an opportunity to learn at several Indiana energy generation facilities. These include the St. Joseph Solar Farm based at the University of Notre Dame, the Meadow Lake Wind Farm spanning Benton and White counties and the NIPSCO Michigan City Generation Station. The site visits provide students real-world insights into the challenges of maintaining reliable power generation.

Following the site visits, high school students and teachers will join Asrari and student researchers at PNW in the Smart Grid Design Lab. While there, Asrari and students will complete hands-on activities with small-scale electric modules that simulate renewable energy systems in real-world scenarios and challenges. The modules will imitate a smart grid, which is a digital communications network that monitors and distributes electricity flows to sources in a local network.

Clean hydrogen, ammonia and lithium are at the core of up to $30 billion in “low-emission opportunities” through 2030 that the company has identified.
Exxon is now evaluating if the combination of “45Q” tax credits for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the shortened 45V qualification window will provide the support needed for a low-carbon hydrogen market to grow.
Exxon said in the past that it sees the opportunity to produce enough lithium to supply 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2030.
CCS Woods said Exxon has made “great progress” on CCS, one of its key low-carbon initiatives, and highlighted the company's current developments as “some of the lowest-cost in the country.""","Exxon Mobil says its low-carbon hydrogen, ammonia and lithium developments in the US are at risk of being delayed due to slower-than-expected demand growth, unfavorable policy changes and rising costs.

CEO Darren Woods said a final investment decision (FID) for the US major's giant blue hydrogen and blue ammonia project in Baytown, Texas, which is expected by the end of the year, could be postponed.

“It’s a little early to tell, but that’s, I think, certainly a strong possibility,” he said during the company’s second-quarter earnings call on Friday.

Woods added that Exxon has seen ""mixed progress"" at the ambitious Baytown development while stressing the overall complexity of the project, which will require the simultaneous development of supply, demand and supportive policy to be viable.

Progress on those fronts has not been smooth lately, particularly when it comes to fundamentals, according to Woods.

“If we can't see an eventual path to a market-driven business, we won't move forward with the project,"" he said.

Exxon expects its Baytown project to produce around 1 billion cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen — made with natural gas and carbon capture — which would make it the largest low-carbon hydrogen project in the world, as well as 1 million tons per year of blue ammonia.

Clean hydrogen, ammonia and lithium are at the core of up to $30 billion in “low-emission opportunities” through 2030 that the company has identified.

Policy Changes

On the supply side, Exxon cited complications stemming from the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which revises clean energy tax credits that were originally established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

“We were disappointed that under the recently approved '45V' tax credit [for clean hydrogen production], timing for start-up of construction was shortened from 2033 to the beginning of 2028,” Woods said. “While our project can meet this timeline, we're concerned about the development of a broader market, which is critical to transition [away] from government incentives.""

Exxon is now evaluating if the combination of “45Q” tax credits for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the shortened 45V qualification window will provide the support needed for a low-carbon hydrogen market to grow.

Looking for Buyers

On the demand side, Exxon is working on translating the heads of agreement it signed with French commodities trader Trammo, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., Japanese trading house Mitsubishi, as well as Jera, Japan’s largest utility, into firm sales contracts. The major signed its first firm offtake deal with Japanese firm Marubeni in May.

However, the cost of clean hydrogen and ammonia remains a challenge for offtakers that have access to cheaper alternatives like natural gas.

“We haven't landed that,” Woods said, adding that Exxon won’t take FID on Baytown until it has signed enough offtake agreements that make it confident in the project's returns.

“We knew that helping to establish a brand-new product in a brand-new market, initially driven by government policy, would not be easy or advanced in a straight line,” he said. “It's why we focused on low-carbon opportunities aligned with our existing capabilities and advantages.""

Lithium

Woods suggested that the company's production of lithium from brine in southwestern Arkansas could also be pushed, as lowering the cost of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology could take longer than initially anticipated.

Exxon is looking to lower its DLE costs so that it can be “very competitive” in the global marketplace, particularly compared to Chinese lithium producers.

The first phase of Exxon's Pine Unit lithium extraction project is slated to come on stream in 2027 with a production capacity of 165,000 barrels per day of brine and 18,100 tons/yr of lithium.

Exxon said in the past that it sees the opportunity to produce enough lithium to supply 1 million electric vehicles annually by 2030.

CCS

Woods said Exxon has made “great progress” on CCS, one of its key low-carbon initiatives, and highlighted the company's current developments as “some of the lowest-cost in the country.""

The US sold 1.03 mt, or 11 per cent of its total LNG exports, to Latin America, with cargoes going to Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile.
LNG Canada exported four cargoes, or 0.29 mt of LNG, during July, according to LSEG ship tracking data.","Exports of US LNG jumped to 9.1 million tonnes (mt) in July, marking a sharp increase from June as some plants exited maintenance activities and Venture Global's Plaquemines facility ramped up production, preliminary data from financial firm LSEG showed.

The US is the world's largest exporter of LNG and July's output was its third highest on record. This year the US has seen three of its highest ever monthly LNG production figures, according to LSEG data.

US LNG shipments could have been higher had its third- largest export facility, Freeport LNG, not experienced several unplanned outages, reporting seven power outages at its plants to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality during the month of July. Its output fell in July to 1.3 mt from 1.4 mt in June, LSEG data showed.

The US could double its LNG export capacity by 2030, based on projects already under construction and expected to get the financial greenlight as the industry builds momentum following US President Donald's Trump's vow to bolster the country's energy industry. This week Venture Global gave a positive final investment decision for its massive 28 million mtpa CP2 facility in Louisiana.

In July, Plaquemines, also in Louisiana, exported 1.4 mt of LNG, compared to 1.2 mt in June, helping the US get to 9.1 mt in July, compared to 8.4 mt in June, LSEG data showed.

Gas prices fall in Europe and Asia

European gas prices fell in July to $11.56 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) from $12.38 per mmBtu in June at the European benchmark Title Transfer Facility in the Netherlands, according to LSEG data.

Even so, the softer prices were not enough to deter US LNG exports to Europe, which remained the favored destination. Some 5.25 mt of LNG, or just under 58 per cent of July's total, headed to Europe during July, slightly lower than the 5.53 mt, or 66 per cent, sold in June, LSEG data showed.

US exports to Europe could increase in the coming years following a trade deal earlier this week in which the European Union promised to buy $750 billion of US energy over a five-year period.

In July, gas prices were also lower in Asia, as the benchmark Japan Korea Marker fell to $12.18 per mmBtu from $12.90 per mmBtu in June.

Exports to Asia rose slightly during the month to 1.8 mt, or 20 per cent, of US LNG exports in July, compared to 1.56 mt, or 19 per cent, in June as demand for energy for cooling grew, according to LSEG data.

""After lackluster Asian LNG demand for much of 2025 so far, hotter July weather drove some improvement,"" bankers from Morgan Stanley told its clients in a report on Wednesday.

US sells more LNG closer to home

US LNG exports to South America grew in July as the continent faced colder-than-normal seasonal weather. The US sold 1.03 mt, or 11 per cent of its total LNG exports, to Latin America, with cargoes going to Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Chile. Cargoes were also sold to several Caribbean countries, including Jamaica, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic.

Egypt continued to import US LNG cargoes, buying eight in July, totaling 0.59 mt. There were also six cargoes with 0.43 mt of LNG that left US ports in July with no clear destination, signaling they were available for orders.

In July, Canada saw its first LNG shipment from a major plant, with the start-up of LNG Canada in Kitimat, British Columbia. That facility is the first North American plant with direct access to the Pacific Ocean and a shorter sail time to Asia.

LNG Canada exported four cargoes, or 0.29 mt of LNG, during July, according to LSEG ship tracking data.

It’s part of a broader national trend in which AI infrastructure is accelerating faster than energy systems can adapt, posing new challenges for utilities, governments, and consumers.

As AI model training and inferencing become increasingly resource-intensive, large-scale data centers are reshaping America’s energy and water usage. Industry estimates suggest data centers already account for 4.4% of US electricity consumption and could reach 12% by 2028. Some utilities warn that national electricity demand may rise as much as 50% within five years, with no state currently positioned to manage that level of growth.

AI infrastructure is outpacing utility capacity

Some of the new AI data centers being planned include one-gigawatt facilities, which is enough to power every home in a major US city like Philadelphia. Power consumption per AI query is also substantially higher than traditional internet use. A typical ChatGPT request uses approximately 2.9 watt-hours of electricity, compared to 0.3 watt-hours for a standard web search.

The growing energy burden is already prompting shifts in utility strategy. Pacific Gas & Electric, for instance, reversed plans to retire three coal plants. Grid operators in Texas have issued emergency alerts in anticipation of rising demand.

Meanwhile, Wyoming has emerged as a key location for new infrastructure due to its geographic stability and connectivity to the national internet backbone via Interstate 80. Companies including Microsoft and Meta are expanding in the state. Meta’s planned 900-acre hyperscale data center near Cheyenne is expected to come online within three years.

Water use raises new resource concerns

AI-related energy consumption is only part of the infrastructure equation; water usage is also a growing concern, especially in drought-prone regions. Many AI data centers use evaporative cooling systems, which require significant water resources. Estimates suggest each facility may use 2 million liters of water per day — roughly the equivalent of daily consumption for 6,500 US households.

This is particularly challenging for Western states like Nevada, Utah, and Colorado, where water is already scarce. In Nevada’s Reno area, for example, projected energy demand could require a 40% expansion of the state’s electricity sector within a decade. Colorado’s Front Range is planning to triple data center capacity, with a single new facility expected to draw 160 megawatts — surpassing even steel plants and mining operations in total electricity use.

Costs and emissions may fall to consumers

The economic and environmental impacts of this growth are significant. Data centers in the US may soon use more power than entire countries; one estimate compares their future energy footprint to Poland’s total consumption in 2023. Amazon alone could consume up to 48 terawatt-hours per year if it follows through on all planned facilities, and that roughly matches Nevada’s total electricity use last year.

States are beginning to respond. Utah recently passed Senate Bill 132 to develop alternative energy provisions for high-demand customers. Still, meeting the infrastructure requirements could cost up to $2 trillion by 2030. The resulting power generation is projected to cause $5.7 to $9.2 billion per year in public health-related costs due to increased emissions.

These costs are expected to be passed on to consumers through higher utility bills and environmental tradeoffs. As AI continues to expand across sectors, its energy footprint may soon impact every household — not just through digital services, but on monthly energy statements.",https://assets.techrepublic.com/uploads/2025/07/power-plant-photo-unsplash-1494818889428-42c443ab9f69-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 06:58:55.694212

Contrary to a communication by the Social Security Administration, this exemption is not tied to being a Social Security recipient.
But keep in mind, this has nothing directly to do with Social Security benefits.","At 887 pages, it certainly is one big bill, but as Margaret Wolfe Hungerford wrote, “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.”

U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, is quoted as saying, “If everybody draws a red line, you end up with a maze.”

Everybody got a little piece under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and nobody got all they wanted. The compromises needed to get consensus from deficit hard-liners, Medicaid defenders, the SALT caucus and Inflation Reduction Act protectors created a confusing hodgepodge of provisions. I confess that I have not read the entire 887 pages, but I have read countless summaries and sat in on webinars reviewing the provisions. Each webinar has had a different emphasis on various provisions, and here are a few that I found most interesting or confusing.

Tax Cut and Jobs Act

Passed in 2017 during the first Trump administration, it had provisions that were set to expire at the end of this year. The OBBBA made a lot of those provisions permanent.

◗ Tax rates: The lower individual income tax rates and tax brackets that were implemented temporarily have been made permanent.

◗ Standard deduction: 70% of filers used the standard deduction. After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was implemented and the standard deduction was significantly increased, that percentage rose to around 90%. The OBBBA makes the increase permanent.

◗ Estate and gift tax exemption:

OBBBA permanently extends the estate and lifetime gift tax exemption, and effective in 2026, increases the exemption amount to $15 million for single filers and $30 million for those married filing jointly.

◗ Child tax credit:

Increased from $2,000 to $2,200 and will be inflation adjusted. There are also strict Social Security number requirements to qualify.

◗ Alternative minimum tax:

A parallel tax system designed to ensure that certain high-income taxpayers pay at least a minimum amount of tax. Before TCJA, there were over 5 million filers. The TCJA decreased that to about 200,000; the figure is expected to remain there under the new OBBBA provisions.

New deductions

◗ Tips and overtime: No tax, but there are restrictions on who qualifies and caps on deductions.

◗ Charitable contribution deduction for those who don’t itemize:

You are allowed to deduct up to $1,000 for a single taxpayer or $2,000 for joint returns

◗ Enhanced senior deduction:

Temporary $6,000 deduction per qualified senior age 65 and older. This is in place for tax years 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028. This amount is phased out for higher-income individuals. President Trump proposed eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits as part of his 2024 campaign. This provision is a way to meet Trump’s pledge.

Currently, 64% of seniors do not pay taxes on Social Security. This provision would increase that to 88%. Contrary to a communication by the Social Security Administration, this exemption is not tied to being a Social Security recipient. Those claiming Social Security before age 65 do not receive the credit, and those who are over 65 but not claiming benefits are still eligible for the deduction. For example, a married couple filing jointly for tax year 2025 will have a standard deduction of $31,500. In addition, there is no change to the extra standard deduction of $1,600 if they are age 65 or older, or $3,200 for the couple.

Then, the budget bill gives each spouse an additional deduction of $6,000, or $12,000 for both, which would be available even for those who itemize their other deductions. Thus, for tax year 2025, a senior couple would owe no tax on their first $46,700 of income. But keep in mind, this has nothing directly to do with Social Security benefits. It lowers taxable income for all income tax purposes.

The latest SSA communication and additional rhetoric regarding this $6,000 senior deduction might raise false hope for many seniors.

ERI recently published its latest sustainability report, which says the company is the first in its industry to become carbon neutral.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

John Shegerian, ERI’s CEO and co-founder, is on the road again. His company has made a name for itself as one of the largest electronics recyclers in the country, expanding over the years to do business in about 140 countries.

Advancements in the electronics at the heart of ERI’s business model are also the reason Shegerian travels about 175 days a year, he said.

“With technology, with AI, nobody knows what’s real or fake anymore. But having real, personal relationships with clients and strategic partners – that’s what sets us apart,” he said. “The interpersonal relationships you build with people face to face are now more important than ever before.”

In the last few years, ERI has expanded its footprint across the U.S. It opened a new battery recycling plant in Indiana in 2024 and is getting ready to open an electronics recycling and IT asset disposition facility in Georgia. The company also plans to announce several international partnerships this year. This comes at a time when the U.S. government aims to prioritize domestic recycling initiatives in an effort to get back critical materials from electronics.

ERI is also balancing domestic and international business expansion with sustainability initiatives Shegerian said further set his company apart in a competitive field. “It doesn’t matter if you’re Republican, Independent or Democrat, everyone agrees that we want to leave the environment better than how we found it,” he said.

Shegerian talked with Waste Dive about ERI’s latest carbon neutral and zero waste initiatives, its focus on its battery and e-scrap services, and its relationship with the current Trump administration.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Domestic recycling infrastructure for electronics and batteries has seemed to really pick up in recent years, and you yourself have said competition can be fierce. What are ERI’s priorities in this space, and how is it mapping its own growth?

Only 22% of all electronics being used today and sold and used on this planet today are being responsibly recycled. That still leaves a massive 78% delta for myself and all of my competitors to chase. People ask why I’m friends with my competitors, and it’s because we can learn a lot from them, and it’s not a zero-sum game. There’s so much stuff to recycle that we can all do very well together. It’s really an industry of collaboration, and collaboration is what’s going to make the biggest impact.

One example of collaboration that we’ve had going since about 2005 is the electronic take-back programs with Best Buy and Staples, which is now the second most successful take-back program in the world for batteries and electronic waste. We also manage the Salvation Army take-back program now. We’re always trying to get the word out, get more education and activation, because people want to do the right thing with electronics, they just don’t know where it exists.

When we take back all the batteries at Staples, you know about 85% of these postconsumer batteries are alkaline batteries. Our technology so far is doing very well at our recycling plant in Indiana, [which focuses on alkaline battery recycling]. It’s closed loop, no emissions, and we create and sell a wonderful black mass there.

At the same time, we’re opening other infrastructure. In the fourth quarter we plan to open our northwest Georgia location, which will do ITAD and electronics recycling, and we plan to continue to grow in other parts of the United States as well.

We are also going to grow outside of the country. We’re getting more and more business in Asia, Canada, Southeast Asia and the Middle East. We’re going to be opening locations in those regions in the next 12 months in the form of ERI owned and operated [facilities], with partners in those regions.

ERI recently published its latest sustainability report, which says the company is the first in its industry to become carbon neutral. What steps did you take to do that, and why are these specific sustainability metrics important?

We started our company around 23 years ago, which is a lifetime ago when it comes to technology. That was before any company had a chief sustainability officer and “circular economy” wasn’t a word yet.

It does cost ERI more and requires more intentional work to be carbon neutral and to achieve zero waste. You just don’t write a check and buy your way into it. Our carbon neutrality and zero waste efforts stand out really fast compared to our competitors.

All our big clients like the retailers, OEMs, cities and municipalities — they all have to answer to somebody and create sustainability or impact reports. We’re one less problem on their balance sheet. We’re not creating more scope 1, 2 or 3 issues for them.

The fact is, we have strategic partners that are investors and board members of ERI, so everyone knows where our materials go. Batteries go right to Redwood Materials. Alcoa gets all of our aluminum and LS MnM gets all of our copper and precious metals. People know there’s no brokers. They see the transparency to that.

We have eight big facilities across America, but we never had a head of procurement until about two years ago, which is kind of embarrassing. Having a head of procurement is Sustainability 101. The march towards carbon neutrality becomes a lot easier when you’re buying right and when you’re diverting right.

No one’s truly zero waste. We’re at about 2.3% to 2.7% that goes to a hazardous waste landfill, but the rest gets diverted. Those efforts all came from our procurement and also from our chief sustainability officer efforts to increase and improve our diversion.

Our sustainability officer and his team also look into how to power our facilities with green energy such as solar, and then whatever we can’t do ourselves at the end of the day to zero out and reconcile this, then we’ll buy credits.

The Trump administration has been pretty clear that it wants to see more investments in domestic manufacturing and the recovery of critical materials, which it says is important to stay internationally competitive and reduce reliance on other countries. What’s ERI’s role in these larger federal priorities?

In the last nine months, we’ve met with leadership from Canada, the United States and Japan. They all are interested in the same thing. They don’t want to decouple from China, but they want to de-risk their resources and supply chain. The question on their minds is, “How can we recycle more electronics domestically and keep those material resources domestically?” And that’s what we’ve been asked to advise on.

ERI had an office in Washington, D.C. for 10 years under both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we would walk the halls to meet with both sides of the aisle. Each side gave us wonderful lip service. The Republican people typically say, “We love the job growth that you’re doing in our communities.” The Democrats would say, “We love what you’re doing for the environment.”

What’s different with the Trump administration, love them or hate them, is that this is an administration of doers. They’ve come to us and said, “Give us specifics. How can we retain more electronics, domestically speaking, and keep our resources domestic?” They ask practical questions and they’ve followed up with us numerous times. That’s never happened in all the years I had an office in D.C.

By the way, the Canadian and Japanese governments are doing the same thing. I know each one of those administrations is going to do a lot more to make their countries safer and more independent and de-risk their supply chains. This is a high, high priority for all administrations of those three countries. This is just not idle chatter.

ERI is known for electronics and battery recycling, but you also do a fair amount of plastics recycling because of the plastics in electronics. How has that area of the business evolved over the years, especially in the context of your zero waste goals?

Plastics have always been important to us. We built proprietary shredders back in 2008, and they have been upgraded every year. Those shredders create cleaner commodities, and smelters want the most liberated resources and commodities to smelt, because certain plastics will ruin their smelters.

When OEMs started realizing that circularity and sustainability were trends, they all created design for sustainability divisions. One of the ways they want to make their products greener and more sustainable is by avoiding buying virgin plastic and instead buying back recycled plastic from me. We make sure it goes to a good vendor who can meet our specs. We’ve been working with OEMs for the last 15 years on this, but now more and more OEMs are doing that. What they’re realizing is that young people are voting with their pocketbooks and want to buy greener and greener products.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jXaCpV-N5EWew5EeQOU03SjsaYmr6SbUd4yLBrOj7JI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9lcmktdHJ1Y2tzLTEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-08-02 03:00:36.652151

Jared Polis announced plans to expedite clean energy projects across Colorado on Friday, calling on state agencies to help utilities and residents dodge tariff impacts and take advantage of rapidly disappearing federal tax incentives.

“States across the county are competing to accelerate the deployment of affordable energy resources,” Gov. Polis said at a press conference at the Governor’s Residence in Denver. “What today’s action does is elevate our nation-leading work to make sure a lot of those clean energy investments come right here to Colorado.”

The announcement comes weeks after President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The sprawling budget law sets a hard deadline for clean energy developers: to claim federal solar and wind tax credits, projects must begin construction within a year or begin operating by the end of 2027. The incentives were previously available through 2032.

Discounts for green home improvement projects will also end at the end of the year. That includes a 30 percent tax credit for rooftop solar panels, home batteries, geothermal heat pumps and other products, plus an additional incentive to offset the purchase of energy efficient appliances and insulation.

To raise awareness of the rebates, Gov. Polis announced a new online tool to help residents find existing energy bill assistance programs and discounts on green energy improvement projects.

The tool allows renters and homeowners to enter basic information about their property and income. It then lists applicable federal, state, local and utility-level programs that might help residents cut their energy bills and afford home energy upgrades

Polis also sent a letter to state agencies outlining strategies to accelerate clean energy development.

It mostly calls on his administration to double down on existing climate policies. Last year, for example, lawmakers approved a bill designed to encourage community solar development, which allows residents to subscribe to small- to medium-sized solar projects to offset their energy bill. The letter notes Colorado will “work to augment” utility efforts to build those projects.

Utilities also must go through an extensive regulatory process to purchase large-scale renewable energy projects. The letter notes the Colorado Public Utilities Commission will work to quickly greenlight applications quickly enough for energy providers to claim federal tax credits.

“That’s a really important component for us, making sure our PUC as well as our utilities, especially Xcel Energy, put their foot on the gas and keep moving fast,” said Ellen Kutzer, general counsel for the Colorado Solar and Storage Association.

Xcel Energy, Colorado’s biggest electricity and gas provider, is already pushing regulators to replace a closing coal plant with 14 gigawatts of new natural gas and renewable energy projects — enough to supply energy to more than a million homes. A consumer watchdog group has already warned that the proposal is too expensive and could saddle ratepayers an unnecessary costs

The letter also hints at “forthcoming resource acquisitions,” which could suggest the state may solicit additional power projects tailored to qualify for the federal tax credits.

“You’re really seeing today Colorado stepping up and saying: we’re open for business and we’re here to help consumers save money,” said Kelly Nordini, the executive director of Conservation Colorado, an environmental advocacy group.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/05/sinedie_jp-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 01:00:18.138124

Flashback: Many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates embraced the ""Green New Deal"" and put forward multitrillion-dollar proposals.","President Trump's first term provoked the movement for a Green New Deal. His second term may have killed it.

Why it matters: Democrats aren't explicitly disavowing the Green New Deal, but they've abruptly stopped talking about it as they scramble to find new ways to talk about climate change.

Over the past three months, Democrats in Congress collectively said ""Green New Deal"" only six times across social media and on the floor.

That's the fewest mentions since the proposal rose to prominence in the fall of 2018, according to data from the legislative tracking service Quorum.

Over the same 3-month period, Republicans mentioned ""Green New Deal"" 337 times as they continue to believe that what President Trump calls the ""Green New Scam"" is a losing issue for Democrats.

Zoom in: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts have not reintroduced their Green New Deal resolution that had become one of their signature initiatives (they introduced it in April 2023 of the last Congress).

Spokespeople for Markey and Ocasio-Cortez did not respond for comment.

In attacking the GOP's ""one big, beautiful bill,"" Democrats and many groups have focused on claims it will drive up energy costs and cost jobs from scuttled projects rather than focus on it exacerbating climate change.

Other Democrats eyeing presidential runs have signaled they aren't purists on climate change in the way some Democrats did during Trump's first term.

Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona told The New York Times earlier this year: ""Every Latino man wants a big-ass truck, which, nothing wrong with that.""

After Elon Musk called Sen. Mark Kelly a ""traitor,"" the Arizona senator traded in his Tesla for a Chevy Tahoe SUV (he noted he had two of them: one in D.C. and another in Arizona).

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro has continued to be supportive of natural gas projects in his state.

Flashback: Many 2020 Democratic presidential candidates embraced the ""Green New Deal"" and put forward multitrillion-dollar proposals.

When then-Sen. Kamala Harris ran for president in 2020, her Green New Deal agenda called for mandating automakers to only make electric or hydrogen cars by 2035.

Between the lines: The tide against far-reaching Green New Deal-esque proposals began before Trump won in 2024.

Then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) dismissed it in 2019 as the ""green dream, or whatever they call it.""

When Vice President Harris was running for president last fall, her campaign equivocated and dodged on the issue.

In October, Harris said in Michigan: ""Let us be clear, contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive.""

The intrigue: Some Democratic leaders are increasingly skeptical that liberal climate advocacy groups can deliver the voters they claim to represent.

Former President Biden passed one of the most ambitious and expensive climate-focused bills in history, and voters did not appear to reward him.

Josh Freed, who leads the Climate and Energy Program at the moderate think tank Third Way, said: ""The groups wouldn't or couldn't sell the IRA, and promised they'd deliver young voters on climate. They didn't deliver on selling the IRA, and Democrats did worse with young voters. A lot of elected officials' faith and trust in that apparatus has been shaken.""

Some of those groups are having trouble raising money in the Trump era. The Sunrise Movement, which has been one of the most aggressive advocates for a Green New Deal, raised less than $30,000 over the first six months of 2025.

By the numbers: Wind and solar remain the most popular forms of energy, but popular support has declined significantly over the past decade, especially among Republicans, according to a Pew Research poll published in June.

""Republicans' views on the nation's energy priorities are now the reverse of what they were in 2020,"" Pew wrote.

""Today, 67% of Republicans and Republican leaners say the country should give priority to developing fossil fuel sources like oil, coal and natural gas.""

The bottom line: Some Democrats think that the party is overreacting to Trump's victory in what was ultimately a close presidential race after the party swapped out Joe Biden last summer.

""Some Democrats are so stuck in the fetal position post-2024 that they might miss an opportunity to go on offense in 2025 on clean energy cost savings and job creation,"" said Jared Leopold, a strategist and co-founder of Evergreen Action.

Stevie O'Hanlon, the political director of Sunrise, told Axios: ""We're seeing a level of enthusiasm among young people that we haven't since before 2018… The climate crisis is one of Donald Trump's biggest political vulnerabilities.""",https://images.axios.com/B58RQEclwtHFpUyJOTRzNoIFvAM=/0x0:1280x720/1366x768/2025/07/31/1753993922133.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 03:58:49.861433

This stems from their robust financial performances and an increasing inclination toward strong backward integration, extending up to wafers and ingots by FY27.

However, on some key issues, the two solar module and cell makers are charting their own paths. While Premier Energies is still hesitant to venture into the United States (US) market for manufacturing solar modules and cells, Waaree Energies took the early bird route and commissioned its solar module manufacturing factory just days before US President Donald Trump took office.

Premier Energies On US Manufacturing

Hyderabad-based Premier Energies believes that the US manufacturing market is currently undergoing turmoil in terms of policies, and it is better to wait for further clarity.

“Regarding our proposed cell manufacturing plant in the US, we have decided to continue keeping those plans on hold for now, pending greater clarity on the US policy and tariffs. That said, it's important to note that our business model is deeply anchored in the Indian market. Less than 1% of our total order book currently comes from the United States,” the top management of Premier Energies said in a recent investor call.

The management believes that, given the current production levels, it is better to focus on the domestic Indian market. Thus, the company is not inclined to export its solar modules and cells to the US either.

“On a short-term or medium-term outlook, there is a big demand from the US. But then we don't have enough capacities. Our priority has always been to cater to the Indian market. And we work very closely with the programs monitored by the ministry. The demand in India is so strong that we have no capacity for the US,” the management added.

Waaree’s Love for the US Market

Contrary to Premier Energies, Waaree Energies has taken a different approach altogether. Unlike the majority of Indian firms that are waiting for more stable policies in the US, Waaree Energies, in a strategic move, opened its GW-scale solar module manufacturing plant in the US in January 2025, days before Donald Trump took over as the new President. The company now operates a 1.6 GW solar module manufacturing facility in the US.

Waaree now enjoys the benefits of tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Meanwhile, the US government’s imposition of high tariffs and restrictions on Chinese imports of solar equipment gives a clear advantage to US-based manufacturing operations.

On the export front, Waaree Energies is strongly export-oriented. A large chunk of its order book and revenues stem from overseas markets. As per the latest figures released by the company, its order book stands at 25 GW, worth around ₹49,000 crore. Of this, 41.3% is from overseas clients, including the US. Revenue-wise, 32% of its earnings come from international markets.

What If Favouring Waaree In the US?

Amit Paithankar, CEO of Waaree Energies, told investors in a recent investor call that the company secured 2.23 GW of new orders from the US market in the last quarter. According to him, three key drivers are shaping the US solar market: the rise of AI-driven data centers, increasing power demand, and rapid electrification of transportation. He also mentioned that the company continues to benefit from a 45% tax credit for its US manufacturing facility.

In its latest investor presentation, the company projected that US solar capacity is expected to rise from 236 GW in 2024 to 500 GW by 2030.

Besides Waaree Energies, many Indian solar module manufacturers have identified the US as a prime export destination, attracted by higher demand, better prices, and the US government’s reluctance to rely on cheap Chinese modules. Companies like Rayzon Solar, Vikram Solar, and others have already expressed interest in establishing manufacturing units in the US. However, most are awaiting further clarity on policies and taxation before moving ahead.

It's a critical strategy for addressing the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change while continuing to support a thriving bourbon industry.
With its deep roots in Kentucky’s land, culture and agricultural traditions, the bourbon industry is well-positioned to emerge as a natural leader of landscape-level decarbonization and habitat protection.
The shared sourcing regions used by both large distilleries and small craft producers create opportunities for collective action.
Working together for impact The Kentucky bourbon industry teamed up with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to explore how it could deepen its commitment to nature and sustainable agriculture.","A new legacy for bourbon

Bourbon has long been a symbol of American heritage—so much so that in 1998, Congress declared it a “cultural contribution to the world...as uniquely and utterly American as jazz or baseball.”[1] Today, nearly three decades later, bourbon is poised to add another distinction to its legacy: becoming a leader in sustainability.

Kentucky’s bourbon industry offers a compelling test case of what it could look like when businesses operate in harmony with nature. Protecting natural habitats, such as forests, wetlands and grasslands, that border bourbon cornfields while also addressing the in-field productivity and sustainability challenges is essential. It's a critical strategy for addressing the dual crises of biodiversity loss and climate change while continuing to support a thriving bourbon industry.

Collective action at the landscape level

The Kentucky bourbon industry has a key opportunity to bring this vision to life by exploring and implementing innovative approaches focused on collective, landscape-level action. This is a departure from the more traditional approach, where companies focus only on the acres directly tied to their supply chains. That narrow focus often overlooks the opportunity for companies to work together and engage with other stakeholders to keep the entire landscape healthy and resilient.

When farms in a sourcing region, for example, experience extreme weather events, such as floods or droughts, everyone relying on the land’s production is impacted. The availability of commodities for companies is threatened, their prices rise and farmers face increased pressure to convert native habitats into cropland, even when it's not economically viable. By engaging collectively across a landscape, companies can help stabilize supply chains, support farmers and protect nature while advancing their shared goals for climate and sustainability.

With its deep roots in Kentucky’s land, culture and agricultural traditions, the bourbon industry is well-positioned to emerge as a natural leader of landscape-level decarbonization and habitat protection. The shared sourcing regions used by both large distilleries and small craft producers create opportunities for collective action. Longstanding relationships with farmers who grow corn for bourbon provide a strong foundation for reaching the critical mass of farms and acres needed to achieve meaningful results at scale.

Working together for impact

The Kentucky bourbon industry teamed up with The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to explore how it could deepen its commitment to nature and sustainable agriculture. With an initial focus on climate action, specifically the decarbonization of corn production, the initiative aimed to align the industry around shared goals, innovative solutions and collaboration with farmers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",https://natureconservancy-h.assetsadobe.com/is/image/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/photos/k/e/Kentucky_Cornfield.jpg?crop=0%2C448%2C3992%2C2095&wid=1200&hei=630&scl=3.3266666666666667,N,,2025-08-02 03:58:54.839051

The DOI unveiled four key policy changes aimed at promoting “affordable, reliable energy development in America,” while scaling back support for renewable energy. DOI Secretary Doug Burgum directed his agency to repeal policies that favor wind and solar energy, and to reconsider the vast areas of land and water allocated for wind development under the previous administration.

“These policy changes represent a commonsense approach to energy that puts Americans’ interests first,” said Burgum. “Leveling the playing field in permitting supports energy development that’s reliable, affordable, and built to last. We’re also making sure tribes and local communities have a real seat at the table. This move is about responsible energy growth that works for every American.”

At the heart of the reforms is the secretary’s order titled “Ending Preferential Treatment for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources in Department Decision-Making.” The order directs the department to identify and eliminate policies that favor wind and solar energy, whose supply chains are “controlled by foreign rivals.”

China holds at least 60% of the world’s manufacturing capacity for green energy technologies such as wind systems, solar panels and batteries, according to a 2023 report from the International Energy Agency.

DOI’s Tuesday announcement builds on President Donald Trump’s July 7 executive order titled, “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies for Unreliable, Foreign-Controlled Energy Sources.”

“Reliance on so-called ‘green’ subsidies threatens national security by making the United States dependent on supply chains controlled by foreign adversaries,” reads the executive order. “Ending the massive cost of taxpayer handouts to unreliable energy sources is vital to energy dominance, national security, economic growth, and the fiscal health of the Nation.”

Other changes include the potential withdrawal of certain federal designations for onshore and offshore wind development. The DOI says this move will help ensure energy development on public lands is balanced with other potential priorities and protect “coastal environments and local economies from unchecked development.”

At the end of the Biden administration, over 3.5 million acres of offshore areas were designated as Wind Energy Areas, allowing the federal government to auction them for wind development, the DOI said. The previous administration also provided generous tax credits and subsidies to offshore wind projects under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, with the goal of powering 10 million homes with wind energy by 2030.

The Biden administration’s Department of Transportation, led by Pete Buttigieg, approved dozens of wind projects near critical infrastructure — such as highways and railroads — despite documented safety concerns, the New York Post reported. Under Buttigieg, the department reportedly failed to issue safety recommendations for over 100 wind projects.

Going forward, the department said it would ensure stakeholders — including native tribes, fishing industries and coastal towns — are more actively engaged in offshore wind development to improve transparency and collaboration. Concerns about the ecological impacts of wind turbines have been raised by a range of groups, including fishermen and some environmental organizations, especially after incidents where damaged blades scattered toxic debris into the ocean.

The department also announced it will investigate the “avian mortality rate” tied to wind turbines located in migratory flight paths. The review will examine whether these deaths violate the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and other wildlife protection laws.",https://readlion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/wind-turbine-energy-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-02 10:58:51.040909

CEC provides free one-on-one support to community members to take advantage of EV funding programs.","It’s official: when it comes to protecting us from the growing threat of a climate crisis, the federal government is not just asleep at the wheel – it’s driving us in reverse. Regressive climate policies, funding rollbacks, and the purge of environmental agencies threaten to permanently set the climate movement back by a decade or more.

As we watch years of climate progress unravel, state and local action is the only path toward a livable future. Thankfully, there are many impactful ways we can resist these attempts to thwart climate progress. While this may seem small in the scheme of things, one such way is to switch to an electric vehicle.

Driving electric is an act of resistance

Transportation is the highest-emitting sector in the United States, and D.C. seems bent on keeping it that way by threatening California’s clean car goals and taking aim at the Clean Air Act. If you want to resist these attacks on the climate movement, switch to an EV. EVs emit much less carbon and air pollution than gas-powered vehicles (no matter how you charge them), and adopting an EV in these times signals your resistance to oil companies and support for climate action.

This is especially true for California residents. As the fourth-largest economy in the world with far more cars on the road than any other state, California has the power to shape global vehicle markets and influence climate action well beyond our borders. When we back California’s 2035 zero-emissions vehicle target and collectively push for EV adoption, it sends a clear message to automakers, other states, and the federal government: the clean energy revolution is still underway — regardless of what happens on the Hill or in the White House.

Cue the countdown: 60 days until the federal EV tax credits expire.

Buying a new car can be costly and complicated, so let’s break down how to get a new or used electric vehicle at an affordable price. Through IRS Clean Vehicle Tax Credits, you can get up to $7,500 to buy or lease a new plug-in hybrid, EV, or fuel cell vehicle or up to $4,000 for a used one … but not for long. When Congress signed the so-called Big Beautiful Bill, they cut this EV affordability program and set it to expire September 30, 2025 (instead of 2032). If you want to claim these EV savings, head to the dealership as soon as possible.

If you are unable to take advantage of the federal tax credits before they go away, you still have other ways to fund an EV purchase or lease. Many local drivers have access to at least one or two additional incentives –– and there are even more for low- to moderate-income drivers (income thresholds are as high as $141,200 for a family of four in Santa Barbara). California’s Driving Clean Assistance program offers up to $12,000 for EVs, EV charging, and other green transit options (think E-Bikes and bus passes). Utility companies offer their own EV incentives. Plus, the City of Santa Barbara gives rebates for EVs and EV charging. The best part of having an array of funding programs available is — eligibility pending — you can stack these funds to significantly bring down the cost of an EV purchase or lease.

If you need help making the switch, look to the Community Environmental Council (CEC). Our mission is to ensure that proven environmental solutions like this are given the opportunity to succeed. CEC provides free one-on-one support to community members to take advantage of EV funding programs. Our team can answer your EV and EV charging questions, find out what funding you qualify for, and help you apply for incentives.

EVs alone aren’t going to change the tide on climate – we still need to equitably and holistically shift the entire transportation system. However, EV adoption is a necessary piece of the puzzle for ramping down carbon pollution, and it’s a potent way to push the climate movement forward amid the federal administration’s regressive actions. Now more than ever, every voice, every action, and every tonne of carbon emissions matter, so swapping your car is a step toward the livable climate future we need.

In short:

The Geothermal Greenhouse Partnership in Colorado uses naturally hot water from a town-owned well to heat greenhouses, supporting local food production despite harsh winters.

Geothermal greenhouses, unlike conventional models powered by fossil fuels, significantly reduce carbon emissions and energy costs by recycling Earth’s natural heat.

Although geothermal systems can cut heating costs by up to 80%, high installation expenses remain a major barrier to widespread adoption in U.S. agriculture.

Key quote:

“Geothermal greenhouses offer a more sustainable solution by using the Earth’s natural heat directly for warming, greatly reducing overall energy use and carbon footprint.”

— Gina Marie Butrico, co-author of “Greenhouse Agriculture in the Icelandic Food System”

Why this matters:

As climate change intensifies and rural food insecurity grows, the need for resilient, low-carbon agriculture becomes more urgent. Geothermal energy, a stable and renewable source, offers a promising path to heating greenhouses without fossil fuels, cutting emissions while extending growing seasons in cold regions. Yet in the U.S., adoption has lagged due to steep upfront costs and limited policy support. Less than 0.5% of U.S. energy comes from geothermal sources, despite the country’s significant potential, especially in the West.

Only California and Hawaii have higher gas prices than Washington.
Several factors impact the price of gas in the Evergreen State, including increases in state gas and diesel taxes effective July 1.
Larry Behrens, communications director with the energy advocacy organization Power The Future, didn’t hesitate to express his opinion on Washington’s energy policies related to gas prices.
""While gas prices have dropped across the country over the past year, they’ve actually gone up in Washington state,” he emailed The Center Square on Thursday.","(The Center Square) – While gas prices in Washington state fluctuate, they have increased overall compared to last year, with drivers enduring some of the highest fuel costs in the nation.

According to AAA, the average price of standard, or regular grade, gas in Washington is $4.39 per gallon as of Friday morning, up slightly from last week’s $4.388. However, prices have increased substantially compared to last year, when gas was $4.243.

Only California and Hawaii have higher gas prices than Washington.

The national average for a gallon of regular gas is $3.151.

Several factors impact the price of gas in the Evergreen State, including increases in state gas and diesel taxes effective July 1.

The new gas tax increased the price by 6 cents per gallon, bringing the state's per-gallon tax rate from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. To adjust for inflation, per-gallon gas prices will rise 2% every year.

The diesel tax went up 3 cents per gallon at the beginning of July. Diesel will increase by 3 cents more in two years; then in 2028, it will increase by 2% a gallon each year. Factoring in future increases and inflationary adjustments translates into a 9-cent climb from 49.4 cents per gallon to 58.4 cents per gallon.

State lawmakers faced a projected $1 billion shortfall in the two-year transportation budget and an $8 billion gap over the next six years. The deficit was largely attributed to rising construction costs and a decline in gas tax revenue due to increased fuel efficiency and the rise of electric vehicles.

The gas tax increase, along with other revenue measures, is expected to generate approximately $3.2 billion over the next six years, with the gas tax specifically bringing in $1.4 billion over that period.

Also impacting the price at the pump in Washington is the state’s cap-and-trade program, established by the Climate Commitment Act in January 2023 and run by the Washington State Department of Ecology. The program has generated approximately $3.2 billion so far. The money goes to projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote clean energy initiatives.

Larry Behrens, communications director with the energy advocacy organization Power The Future, didn’t hesitate to express his opinion on Washington’s energy policies related to gas prices.

""While gas prices have dropped across the country over the past year, they’ve actually gone up in Washington state,” he emailed The Center Square on Thursday. “It’s a clear sign of energy mismanagement, especially when Washington drivers are now paying over $4.38 a gallon – more than $1 above the national average. At this point, Washington seems determined to compete with California for the title of most incompetent energy policy in America.”

Andrew Wineke, Washington State Department of Ecology deputy communications director, has a different perspective.

“According to U.S. Energy Information Administration data, gas prices in Washington are about 6 cents a gallon cheaper today than they were a month ago, 60 cents lower than they were in 2023, and 73 cents lower than they were in 2022,” he said in a Thursday email to The Center Square. “That’s despite the 6-cent increase in the gas tax that took effect July 1.”

He added, “Adjusted for inflation, today’s prices are also lower than the equivalent price in 2021.”

Wineke pointed out that Washington often experiences higher gas prices than the national average due to a combination of factors unique to the state and region.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e47550d8-b866-11ed-a481-ffd95f72d957.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-08-02 00:00:00.057063

EPA.
What's at stake if the endangerment finding is reversed?
But once the EPA issues its final decision, the endangerment finding will be revoked, Gerrard told DW.
Still, with a six-to-three conservative majority, the Supreme Court has repeatedly chipped away at federal climate regulations in recent years.
""So, a court that is hostile to climate regulation might follow that approach and agree with the Trump EPA and say that the endangerment finding is not valid.""","The administration of US president Donald Trump is forging ahead with a plan to revoke a scientific finding that's long been the cornerstone of US climate action. Lee Zeldin, the head of the Environmental protection agency (EPA) who along with Trump has called for the ""death of the Green New Scam,"" unveiled the move at a car dealership in the US state of Indiana on Tuesday, hailing it as ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States. "" At the heart of the rollback is the Obama-era 2009 endangerment finding, grounded in the landmark Supreme Court case Massachusetts v. EPA. That ruling established the EPA has authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases as air pollutants, a legal foundation for US efforts to curb emissions.

What's at stake if the endangerment finding is reversed?

If the endangerment finding is thrown out, the EPA would lose its ability to use the Clean air Act to regulate greenhouse gases, a move experts warn would represent a ""radical pivot in American climate and energy policy."" ""It represents a complete US step away from renewable energy and energy efficiency in favor of full embrace of expanded production and use of fossil fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas,"" Barry Rabe, environmental and public policy professor at the University of Michigan, told DW. The second Trump administration is acting more aggressively in just about everything than the first, said Michael Gerrard, professor at Columbia Law School. It's closely following the blueprint of Project 2025, a road map developed by conservative think tank, The Heritage Foundation. The 900-page document suggested an ""update"" of the endangerment finding. The finding is the basis for rules regulating climate pollution established under the Obama and Biden administrations. Rules on power plants, vehicles, airplanes and landfills could now be repealed, said Jason Rylander, legal director of the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute. At the same time, climate change continues to intensify across the US, fueling extreme heat, wildfires, floods and billion-dollar weather disasters. ""Climate change isn't going away. We are rapidly accelerating past 1.5 degrees. There will be additional public health and environmental harms that will result from that,"" said Rylander.

What will happen next?

The EPA has formally drawn up a proposal, which is now open for public comment until September. The agency will then review and respond to the feedback before issuing a final ruling, expected by the end of the year. There will then likely be lawsuits. ""Groups like mine will certainly sue,"" said Rylander. The cases will first go to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and could then be appealed to the US Supreme Court. It could take years for the case to reach the Supreme Court. But once the EPA issues its final decision, the endangerment finding will be revoked, Gerrard told DW. ""It stays revoked unless a court overturns it.""

Would the agency's arguments hold up in court?

The endangerment finding is based on decades of scientific conclusions from credible global sources about the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change and public health. Rylander said the EPA was ""slicing and dicing the statute to try to come up with some sort of loopholes,"" and that none of the arguments brought forward ""really passed the laugh test."" Still, with a six-to-three conservative majority, the Supreme Court has repeatedly chipped away at federal climate regulations in recent years. ""So, it is possible that the Supreme Court will uphold this,"" said Gerrard, who is also faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change law. One argument the agency is using to reverse the finding is that its economic and political significance is so great that it requires explicit authorization from Congress. And while the EPA under Obama and Biden assumed it was enough to show that greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans endanger the climate, the Trump administration wants to evaluate each gas individually and by sector. ""And they are saying each chunk, like carbon dioxide from US power plants alone, has to endanger the climate,"" Gerrard said, adding that this is much harder to establish. ""So, a court that is hostile to climate regulation might follow that approach and agree with the Trump EPA and say that the endangerment finding is not valid."" The EPA proposal also argues the 2009 finding failed to consider the benefits of CO2 emissions alongside their costs. Rylander called this ""a fallacious argument,"" comparing it to deciding whether a species is endangered under the Endangered Species Act. ""That's not an economic decision. It's a question of science,"" he said, adding that it's the same with pollutants, like CO2. ""Do they cause public health harm or do they not?""

Will climate action continue in the US even if the finding is reversed?

Rabe said a reversal would cause ""a chilling effect on many existing federal policies for greenhouse gas emissions."" Still, the EPA would retain authority to regulate other pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, mercury and coal ash from coal-fired power plants. ""And many states are working to address pollution from cars and power plants, and they would do that under state law,"" said Rylander, adding that ""US efforts to decarbonize will still continue."" However, Gerrard said, ""the best tool they have would be gone.""

The portal allows consumers to enter their home zip code and get a full readout on which clean energy and energy efficiency tax credits and rebates they qualify for. It shows available resources both for homeowners and for renters.

The governor also announced a process to save Colorado ratepayers money by cutting red tape for clean energy projects in order to benefit from millions in expiring federal tax credits that the state was in danger of missing out on.

In response to the governor’s announcement, CoPIRG Foundation Advocate Kirsten Schatz issued the following statement:

“The Energy Savings Navigator is a win for anyone looking to cut down on energy waste, save money or reduce pollution. Coloradans need accurate information about the many rebates, tax credits and other incentives available for clean energy and energy efficiency home improvements. We’re excited that Governor Polis has created a one-stop shop for Coloradans to benefit from available resources.

We need to reduce our reliance on power that pollutes, and renewable energy has the benefit of free fuel from the sun and the wind. It makes sense that Colorado should maximize federal tax credits now in order to minimize the cost of wind and solar projects that we were already going to build. Cutting these upfront costs compared to waiting will save ratepayers money down the road and provide clean energy at a time when our air is too often unhealthy to breathe.

Taken together, these actions will help cut costs on utility bills and save Coloradans money when they choose energy-saving technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps or better insulation for their homes.”",https://pirg.org/wp-content/themes/tpin2022/assets/favicons/pirg/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-02 01:00:30.090295

DC in power grids today is mainly perceived as energy highway at the top layer of power grids: HVDC links transmit power over large distances and increasingly interconnect offshore wind farms.

Most HVDC links represent point-to-point connections and will move to multiport configurations in the next years. At low-voltage level, DC technology is progressing at high speed to directly interconnect renewables, energy storages, charging infrastructure, heat pumps, air conditioning and machines in factories.

By providing one single point of interconnection, DC grids off load the power grid and simplify grid codes. Industry consortiums like the Current/OS Foundation are setting the standards for compatible DC products operating on DC grids.

This paper outlines the drivers for DC in power grids and the state of developments.

Global Energy Transition

Global energy still is dominated by fossil fuels (80% in the year 2020) but is progressing fast to renewables. Wind power and solar power will cover most of the future energy production, supplemented by biomass, hydropower and hydrogen. By 2030, the share of renewables on total power is expected at 40%. The target is to turn the energy mix upside down by 2025 by renewables providing 80% of total power.

Within this transition, the total demand of power remains at a constant level (it even slightly decreases over the years), despite the energy consumption per head is increasing by about 50% over the same period. This apparent paradox is caused by the energy transition: Conventional power plants only convert about 1/3 of the fuel’s energy into electric power, about 2/3 are dissipated as heat. In contrast, when fossil fuels are used for heating, 100% of the energy is used. Using a heat pump will utilise the ambient energy for heating while consuming only a fraction of electric power (usually less than 1/3).

Combustion engines in vehicles only transform a fraction of less than 1/3 of their power consumption from fossil fuels into motion. An electric engine will only need this fraction of energy for the same effect (and can recuperate energy downhill and while slowing down). This way the energy transition makes much better use of power. The gain of efficiency keeps the total demand stable, while providing more useful power.

Electricity is becoming the predominant power source

The examples indicate that the predominant power sources and consumers will be electrical. Figure 2 illustrates the share of electricity in the energy transition in the above-mentioned stages. At the starting point in 2020, electricity represents about 20% of the total energy production. This represents the amount of energy, that power grids used to handle every year. Until 2030, the share of electricity will rise to 30% of total energy production. This development is visible in the current expansion of per grids worldwide: It represents a growth of 50% in total energy to be carried over electric power grids.

In 2050, electricity is expected to represent 50% of total energy production. In comparison to the 20% share in 2020, this represents growth of a factor of 2,5. While this growth over a period of 30 years does not seem unreasonable, in certainly represents a major development in electric power grids: They will need to double.

Another significant change is hidden in energy production: The share of renewables on the grid will rise between 2020 and 2050 by a factor of 10. In 2020, there have been about 3.000GW of renewable power worldwide, by 2030 it will grow to about 9.000GW, and achieve 30.000GW by 2050.

The reason for the higher growth of connectivity for power (factor 10 in GW) against energy production (a factor of 2,5) is the nature of renewables: solar power in Europe can deliver between 1000 to 2000 hours of peak power, peak wind power is available for 2000 to 3000 hours a year. To cover the gaps between supply and demand, energy storages are used: Battery energy storages to buffer solar energy from one day to the other, hydrogen storage for wind farms to cover periods of about two weeks.

DC in Power Grids

Renewables such as solar power and wind turbines represent DC systems. The wind turbine operates at variable speed, so in connects over a power converter, like most electric engines today. Battery storages, electrolysis of hydrogen and fuel cells represent DC systems. The bulk of renewables and their storage systems hence represent DC-systems. Storage and production should be placed close together to avoid unnecessary grid extensions. Charging stations and wall boxes for electric vehicles also represent DC-Systems, along with every variable speed drive and most appliances.

Figure 3 illustrates the growth in power grids: Power lines and transformer stations will need to expand by a factor of about 2,5. The core of power grids will need to double. At the same time power grids will need to offer 10 times to connectivity for renewables. At this point, DC grids may relieve stress from the power grid by connecting native DC systems directly over DC grids. One central power converter (the so called Interlink Converter) will interconnect the DC systems to the power grid.

The Interlink Converters will implement the AC grid code and keep its DC systems organised. Over time, this development will cover the lower voltage level, medium voltage level and high voltage. Most current developments focus on low voltage DC-grids. At LVDC, DC grids including the interlink converters are located behind the meter. This way, the interface between DC-systems (i.e. the DC grid code) is not visible to the grid operator: The DC grid remains a private installation. With DC grid codes getting mature, grid operators may choose to provide DC connections of their own.

Current/OS Reference Installations

The Current/OS Foundation is setting the standards for a DC grid code, which allows the stable operation of systems on a DC grid. It defines the technical requirements for DC grids and devices on DC grids.

Currently, the following DC grids operate according to Current/OS specifications.

Consider the N470 highway in the Netherlands, with solar panels embedded in its noise barriers. Coupled with a 1MWh battery storage system, this forms a DC microgrid which powers the road’s lighting and traffic signals sustainably. Compared to similar AC systems, the highway achieved energy savings of 10%, requiring 40-60% fewer convertors and 35% less copper for electric cables.

The WAVE office building in Lille, France, by VINCI Energies, a Current/OS partner, provides another example. With part of the offices powered in DC drawn from solar panels, the WAVE building uses DC at the local level in conjunction with the public grid. This has reduced energy consumption by 20%, with no need for convertors for IT equipment.

A similar setup at the Rosie Hospital in Cambridge, led by Current/OS’ partner Arriba Technologies, connects a 750kW facility in DC to an 80 kW solar array, forming a DC microgrid that already meets up to 90% of the hospital’s HVAC needs. Having replicated similar setups across five separate hospital buildings in southeast Britain, Arriba has observed electrical efficiency savings of around 7% by pushing solar power directly into high amperage DC-HVAC systems without unnecessary excursions through the 50Hz AC network. This can be boosted to 15% by synchronising HVAC production to fall into a sort of lockstep with solar intensity. Locations situated at lower latitudes, may see even higher returns, owing to both the higher number of sunny hours per year, and the higher usage of air conditioning and refrigeration.",https://www.smart-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/HVDC-transmission-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 06:59:34.441485

The Trump EPA first says that after revoking the endangerment finding, it no longer has any authority to issue GHG standards for vehicles.","The Trump Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued a proposal to revoke the endangerment finding. The proposal relies on misinterpretations of the law and recent cases, fringe science, and tortured cost analysis to justify a conclusion that the EPA cannot and should not regulate greenhouse gases (GHG). Below, we explain the flaws in the agency’s reasoning.

What is the endangerment finding?

The “endangerment finding” is the EPA’s scientific and legal conclusion that the Clean Air Act requires regulation of greenhouse gas emissions to protect public health and welfare. The EPA issued the endangerment finding in 2009 pursuant to the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA.

What is the EPA’s reasoning for revoking the endangerment finding?

The proposal includes a grab bag of alternative reasons for revoking the endangerment finding. For example, it argues that the endangerment finding exceeded the agency’s statutory authority under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act for many reasons. Its claims include:

Arguing that the term “air pollution” in the Clean Air Act should be narrowly interpreted to only include air pollutants that cause harms through “local or regional exposure.” Under this novel reading of the Clean Air Act, the EPA cannot regulate any air pollutant on the basis that the pollutant causes global harm. This interpretation is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, which found that air pollutants that warm the global atmosphere are clearly “air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.

Arguing that the Court’s 2022 decision in West Virginia v. EPA imposes a new and higher “major question” bar to the Supreme Court’s prior conclusion that Congress gave the EPA the authority to regulate GHGs. But West Virginia v. EPA did not overrule Massachusetts v. EPA and it inherently acknowledged the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

Arguing that the EPA does not have the discretion to issue a standalone endangerment finding separate from emissions standards to regulate that pollutant. This interpretation would require the EPA to make concurrent endangerment findings every time it issues emission standards for any pollutant based on its danger to public health and welfare. That would mean the EPA could never rely on its past findings about the danger of a given pollutant in order to issue new regulations concerning that pollutant.

Alternatively, the proposal argues that even if the EPA has the authority to address GHGs, the agency “exercised that authority unreasonably” in 2009. It does this largely by casting doubt on the scientific record. Among other things, the proposal:

Argues that previous administrations did not consider the “potential benefits” of increased GHG concentrations, especially on plant growth and increased agricultural capacity.

Argues that the reports from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) “are unduly pessimistic” about the effects of climate change and do not meet standards of President Trump’s “Restoring Gold Science” Executive Order.

Rejecting mainstream science in favor of fringe theories, the proposal argues that “there is insufficient reliable information to retain the conclusion that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines in the United States cause or contribute to endangerment to public health and welfare in the form of global climate change.”

What is the new scientific data that the EPA is referencing? Is it reliable?

The proposal relies on a new Department of Energy (DOE) report on the impacts of carbon dioxide emissions on the U.S. climate. This “red team, red team” analysis challenges the scientific consensus that increased carbon dioxide emissions will harm the environment by arguing that rising CO2 emissions will actually result in “global greening” through increase in plant growth. The report was drafted by five contrarian scientists that include noted climate-science skeptics such as John Christy, Judith Curry, and Steven Koonin. Other scientists cited in the DOE report have claimed that DOE misused their findings.

The EPA has also halted work on the congressionally-mandated National Climate Assessment (NCA) that incorporates the expertise of over 400 scientists and has discounted the consensus of scientists around the world reflected in the NCA, the IPCC, and USGCRP.

DOE is accepting comments on the report through September 2, 2025.

What rules does the proposal impact?

In addition to rescinding the EPA’s 2009 endangerment finding, the proposal also seeks to rescind all GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines. This recission includes GHG emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines for model years 2012 to 2027, and beyond.

What are the EPA’s reasons for repealing GHG emission standards for motor vehicles?

The Trump EPA first says that after revoking the endangerment finding, it no longer has any authority to issue GHG standards for vehicles. But the EPA also argues that even if courts rule that the endangerment finding must stand, the EPA can still repeal vehicles standards for GHG emissions because:

Reducing GHG emissions from vehicles “would not measurably impact GHG concentrations in the atmosphere or the rate of global climate change.” According to the proposal, the EPA can only mandate vehicle engine designs that “remove GHGs already present in the atmosphere.” And there are no commercially available designs for such engines.

Reducing and even eliminating GHG emissions from motor vehicles in the United States would be “futile” when it comes to stopping climate change.

Regulations that shift the new vehicle market toward electric vehicles (EVs) would be analogous to the power plant regulations that the Supreme Court rejected in West Virginia v. EPA.

Vehicle GHG pollution standards hurt the public more than climate change.

The proposal focuses on motor vehicles. How does it undercut the EPA’s ability to regulate emissions from power plants and other sources?

The 2009 endangerment finding was based on the EPA’s interpretation of section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, which regulates the emissions of air pollutants from “new motor vehicles.” But after issuing that 2009 finding, the agency referred back to it when issuing regulations on GHG emissions from power plants and oil and gas facilities. Finalizing the current proposal would not repeal the power plant and oil and gas facility regulations but it would eliminate the basis for them. The EPA has already proposed a separate repeal of its GHG power plant regulations.

What isn’t changing under this proposal?

The EPA’s proposal does not change the reality of climate change and how it will affect our lives. The science of climate change has not changed, and the need for emission reductions remains just as important as it was before the EPA’s proposed repeal of the endangerment finding.

The EPA says it is not “at this time” revising vehicle emissions standards for pollutants other than GHGs, such as those for carbon monoxide, lead, and particulate matter. The agency is saying that it may revise those standards in a separate rulemaking.

As discussed above, this proposal would not repeal GHG standards for other sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities. The EPA will need to conduct separate rulemakings to repeal those standard and it has already begun that process.

Who wins and who loses under this proposal?

The losers are the American people who will suffer from more heat and extreme weather events, more air pollution from fossil vehicles, and more delays in responding to the climate crisis.

The auto industry loses too: The rest of the world is rapidly shifting to EVs made by nations like China; slowing down that transition domestically hurts American automakers’ ability to compete in global markets. If U.S. automakers are going to remain competitive, they need the U.S. government to help spur innovation. With this announcement, the Trump administration has signaled that it won’t do that. This may be why major auto manufacturers did not cheer the proposal.

There’s only one winner: the fossil fuel industry. The companies that bankrolled President Trump’s campaign are getting what they paid for: regulations that delay a cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable future.

What does this mean for climate progress?

This proposal is just the Trump administration’s latest attempt to bail out the fossil fuel industry by gaslighting Americans about climate change. But renewable energy and clean vehicles are cheaper, healthier, and more reliable. Trump can slow them down, but he can’t stop them.

Toyota’s announcement mentions that the Grand Highlander is “exclusively assembled” at the Indiana facility, along with several other models, including the Highlander.

Autoblog reports that the Kentucky plant will be manufacturing two different electric SUVs: one larger one, set for release in 2028, and a smaller version — albeit one with three rows of seats, like its larger counterpart — rumored to make its debut next year. They also note that the Highlander name is “reportedly reserved for the smaller, lighter electric three-row.” This also suggests Toyota has updated some of its logistical plans since last year.

Zeldin reiterated the Trump administration's stance that the EPA does not have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act unless an act of Congress changes that.
Impacts on fuel efficiency Along with rolling back greenhouse gas emissions standards to limit tailpipe emissions, the EPA would also rescind fuel efficiency measures.","When the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would roll back regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions — especially from motor vehicles — it touted annual savings for Americans of $54 billion. The EPA said eliminating Biden-era policies, which encouraged higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and electric vehicle adoption to limit tailpipe emissions, would enable consumers to ""have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car.""

But a CBS News review of the agency's own regulatory impact analysis of the proposal found that gasoline prices would increase, and nearly a half million jobs would be lost by 2035, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency, which was cited in the EPA's report.

Cost of gasoline

In the EPA's July analysis, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which collects and analyzes energy data, showed Biden-era policies that were adopted by the end of 2024 would dramatically bring down the future cost of gasoline because more consumers would be driving electric vehicles, hybrids and fuel-efficient cars that require less gas.

It is challenging to predict the future gas prices because they're subject to high uncertainty and market volatility, but under a future scenario where Biden-era policies have been revoked under the Trump administration, the EIA projects gasoline prices will continue to increase because of a higher demand for gas-powered cars and fuel.

The former administrator of the EIA, Joseph DeCarolis, explained in an email that if the government ""disincentivizes electric vehicle purchases, more consumers will purchase gasoline vehicles resulting in higher gasoline consumption and high gasoline prices for everyone.""

""There's a clear causal connection between rescinding measures promoting electric vehicles, such as EPA tailpipe standards, and the projection of higher gasoline prices,"" he said.

When asked in an interview with CBS News' ""The Takeout with Major Garrett"" about how this plan could raise gas prices, Zeldin did not directly address the question.

Instead, he argued that previous policies like an electric vehicle mandate were costing trillions of dollars to regulate climate pollution, saying the policies were ""seeking to strangulate out of existence, entire sectors of our economy, and specifically our energy economy.

'It's important that we are applying common sense,"" Zeldin said, ""that we are cognizant of these economic demands and that, wherever possible, when we can protect the environment and grow the economy that we will choose both.""

Neither the Biden nor Obama administrations implemented EV mandates, though both encouraged EV adoptions by Americans and businesses.

Zeldin reiterated the Trump administration's stance that the EPA does not have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act unless an act of Congress changes that.

""Here's my message: If Congress wants the EPA to be regulating the heck out of carbon dioxide, well, they could put it inside of law,"" Zeldin said.

Impacts on fuel efficiency

Along with rolling back greenhouse gas emissions standards to limit tailpipe emissions, the EPA would also rescind fuel efficiency measures.

Under Biden-era fuel efficiency policies, a new standard gas-powered car was expected to get 47.1 miles per gallon by 2027, and by 2035, cars were expected to achieve 61.2 mpg, according to EIA data.

Without the Biden policies, model 2027 cars are supposed to meet a 43.6 mpg standard and gradually increase to 50.5 mpg by 2035.

Light trucks and SUVs, beginning in model year 2027, under a scenario where Biden policies are revoked by the Trump administration, are set to reach fuel efficiency of 27.2 mpg and increase to 28.6 mpg by 2035. Had the Biden policies remained in place, SUVs and light trucks were expected to meet a 28.4 mpg standard in 2027 and increase to 46.2 mpg by 2035, according to EIA data.

The EIA's own data estimates that a future scenario — where Biden-Obama emissions standards are revoked — would lead to a loss of 450,000 jobs by 2035. Jobs would begin to rebound by 2045, but not enough to overcome the significant losses suffered in previous decades.

Peter Huether, senior transportation research associate at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, said in a statement, ""Drivers would pay thousands of dollars more in fuel and maintenance costs over the life of a vehicle, and businesses could lose billions annually from higher trucking costs"" as a result of the Trump administration's deregulation.

""These costs would ripple through the economy, raising prices for everyday goods and undercutting job growth,"" Huether said.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/01/d270a652-d628-4edd-a825-a5f88a134fa2/thumbnail/1200x630g2/720fa28b1f388311959765761c77736d/sot-lee-zeldin-e3-for-5pm-transfer-frame-4521.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 23:59:40.957108

Zeldin reiterated the Trump administration's stance that the EPA does not have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act unless an act of Congress changes that.
Impacts on fuel efficiency Along with rolling back greenhouse gas emissions standards to limit tailpipe emissions, the EPA would also rescind fuel efficiency measures.","When the Environmental Protection Agency announced it would roll back regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions — especially from motor vehicles — it touted annual savings for Americans of $54 billion. The EPA said eliminating Biden-era policies, which encouraged higher fuel efficiency standards for cars and electric vehicle adoption to limit tailpipe emissions, would enable consumers to ""have affordable choices when deciding to buy a car.""

But a CBS News review of the agency's own regulatory impact analysis of the proposal found that gasoline prices would increase, and nearly a half million jobs would be lost by 2035, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency, which was cited in the EPA's report.

Cost of gasoline

In the EPA's July analysis, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which collects and analyzes energy data, showed Biden-era policies that were adopted by the end of 2024 would dramatically bring down the future cost of gasoline because more consumers would be driving electric vehicles, hybrids and fuel-efficient cars that require less gas.

It is challenging to predict the future gas prices because they're subject to high uncertainty and market volatility, but under a future scenario where Biden-era policies have been revoked under the Trump administration, the EIA projects gasoline prices will continue to increase because of a higher demand for gas-powered cars and fuel.

The former administrator of the EIA, Joseph DeCarolis, explained in an email that if the government ""disincentivizes electric vehicle purchases, more consumers will purchase gasoline vehicles resulting in higher gasoline consumption and high gasoline prices for everyone.""

""There's a clear causal connection between rescinding measures promoting electric vehicles, such as EPA tailpipe standards, and the projection of higher gasoline prices,"" he said.

When asked in an interview with CBS News' ""The Takeout with Major Garrett"" about how this plan could raise gas prices, Zeldin did not directly address the question.

Instead, he argued that previous policies like an electric vehicle mandate were costing trillions of dollars to regulate climate pollution, saying the policies were ""seeking to strangulate out of existence, entire sectors of our economy, and specifically our energy economy.

'It's important that we are applying common sense,"" Zeldin said, ""that we are cognizant of these economic demands and that, wherever possible, when we can protect the environment and grow the economy that we will choose both.""

Neither the Biden nor Obama administrations implemented EV mandates, though both encouraged EV adoptions by Americans and businesses.

Zeldin reiterated the Trump administration's stance that the EPA does not have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act unless an act of Congress changes that.

""Here's my message: If Congress wants the EPA to be regulating the heck out of carbon dioxide, well, they could put it inside of law,"" Zeldin said.

Impacts on fuel efficiency

Along with rolling back greenhouse gas emissions standards to limit tailpipe emissions, the EPA would also rescind fuel efficiency measures.

Under Biden-era fuel efficiency policies, a new standard gas-powered car was expected to get 47.1 miles per gallon by 2027, and by 2035, cars were expected to achieve 61.2 mpg, according to EIA data.

Without the Biden policies, model 2027 cars are supposed to meet a 43.6 mpg standard and gradually increase to 50.5 mpg by 2035.

Light trucks and SUVs, beginning in model year 2027, under a scenario where Biden policies are revoked by the Trump administration, are set to reach fuel efficiency of 27.2 mpg and increase to 28.6 mpg by 2035. Had the Biden policies remained in place, SUVs and light trucks were expected to meet a 28.4 mpg standard in 2027 and increase to 46.2 mpg by 2035, according to EIA data.

On days where air quality is poor, spending extended periods outdoors may hurt your health in the long run.

A study released by Opera Beds shows Indiana sits at 4.04 out of 10 on the worst lung health score.

There are a few reasons why Indiana is the worst state for lung health. One being that taxes on tobacco products are on the lower end, and because of that tobacco products are more easily affordable in this state. But another big reason for poor lung health is that there are many coal fire power plants across the state. These plants release pollutants into the air that can cause poor air quality across the state.

Despite the poor air quality, many people at central park still enjoyed the weather, playing pickleball on the courts.

One player, Monica Gullon says, ""I play about three days a week. I like to get in three to four games at least.”

Monica is originally from California and is used to checking the air quality before she goes out.

She says, “I did realize the air quality was bad today, but you know the temperature is so nice, so I just thought well I'm not going to work out that long. So, I'm not that concerned.”

On days where air quality is poor, spending extended time outside can come with risks.

Nikos ZiroGiannis, an assistant professor of environmental economics and environmental policy at Indiana University tells ABC 57, “when those pollutants are emitted, they can harm public health.”

People with respiratory issues are vulnerable to air pollution but everyone can feel the effects of poor air quality over time.

ZiroGiannis says, “those impacts of exposure to air pollution can be cumulative. They can take many years to manifest.”

You can prevent the long-lasting effects of poor air quality by wearing a tight-fitting mask outdoors when air quality is poor or use an air purifier in your home. The biggest precaution to take during poor air quality days is to stay inside.

ZiroGiannis says the “Advice that public health officials provide is that people should stay indoors on days when air pollution readings are very high.”

According to the American Lung Association nearly half of the US population lives within unhealthy levels of air pollution.

This client alert will examine the Act’s implications on the following policy areas:

Artificial Intelligence

Notably, two significant provisions from earlier versions of the bill were not included in the final Act: a proposed tax on litigation funding and a 10-year federal moratorium on state and local AI regulations. The exclusion of the litigation funding tax provision, while not targeted specifically at intellectual property (IP) litigation, avoided potentially sweeping changes to the economics of litigation, including many patent enforcement actions brought by non-practicing entities such as individual inventors and universities. These types of cases often rely on third-party funding to offset the substantial upfront and ongoing costs associated with IP litigation, which can be prohibitive for smaller entities.

Conversely, the removal of the proposed federal moratorium on state and local AI regulation introduces significant uncertainty for the development and deployment of AI technologies. Without federal preemption, states and local governments retain broad authority to regulate AI, potentially resulting in a fragmented and inconsistent regulatory landscape at a critical juncture for the industry.

Although the Act as enacted does not directly regulate intellectual property law or the development of AI, several provisions may nonetheless have important implications for both fields. This alert summarizes those provisions and their potential impact, particularly for developers, litigants, and rights holders in the intellectual property and technology sectors.

What Was Removed—and Why It Still Matters

1. Rejection of the Federal Moratorium on State AI Regulation

Earlier drafts of the Act included a provision that would have imposed a 10-year federal moratorium on state and local regulation of artificial intelligence. Specifically, the House-passed version would have preempted states and localities from enacting or enforcing any law or regulation ""limiting, restricting, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence models, artificial intelligence systems, or automated decision systems entered into interstate commerce.""

The Senate, however, rejected this proposal, thereby preserving the authority of states to legislate in this area. As a result, AI developers and IP owners now face a growing patchwork of state-level AI laws and regulations. States such as Colorado, California, Illinois, and New York have already enacted or are considering legislation addressing various aspects of artificial intelligence, including deep-fakes, biometric privacy, and the use of copyrighted works in AI training data. For example, California is advancing an ""AI Bill of Rights"" (Senate Bill 420) that would regulate the development and deployment of ""high-risk"" automated decision systems by requiring impact assessments to evaluate their purpose, data use, potential for bias, and mitigation measures.

The absence of federal preemption in this area increases compliance complexity and legal uncertainty, particularly for companies operating across multiple states. Businesses that deploy AI tools or products nationwide must now ensure compliance with each state’s unique legislative framework, navigating a patchwork of evolving requirements. This challenge is compounded by the emergence of international regulations, such as the EU AI Act. Given the significant attention this issue has received, and the likelihood of further state-level activity, federal preemption or harmonization may be revisited in future legislative sessions.

2. Elimination of the Tax on Litigation Funding Proceeds

The House version of the Act included a proposal to impose a new tax on proceeds from third-party litigation funding arrangements (initially set at 40.8%, later revised to 31.8% of ""qualified litigation proceeds""), which would have affected IP litigation among other areas. The final Act omits this provision, primarily due to a ruling by the Senate parliamentarian, rather than a lack of legislative support. In fact, there appears to be bipartisan interest in regulating or taxing litigation finance, and the proposal’s inclusion in a major legislative package signals increased scrutiny of litigation funding structures.

It is estimated that up to 30% of patent litigations are supported by some form of third-party funding. The mere appearance of this proposal in the legislative process may already be influencing the litigation funding market, potentially driving capital to other jurisdictions or investment vehicles and leading to a reduction in the number of patent cases filed in the United States. The issue remains live, and future legislative or regulatory action in this area is possible.

3. Remaining AI and IP-Related Provisions in the Enacted Act – More Investments, Less Foreign Influence

While the Act does not include certain provisions that would have directly impacted intellectual property litigation and AI regulation, it does provide for significant federal investments in AI, semiconductor manufacturing, data centers, and related fields through grants, appropriations, and enhanced tax incentives. However, eligibility for these incentives is subject to rigorous restrictions designed to prevent federal support from benefiting “prohibited foreign entities,” a term defined within the Act to include entities owned, controlled, or significantly influenced by governments such as China, Russia, Iran, or North Korea, as well as entities with substantial contractual, equity, or governance ties to such actors.

These restrictions are broad and apply to both direct and indirect relationships, including beneficial ownership, supply chain arrangements, and contractual rights that confer “effective control” or “material assistance.” Companies seeking to benefit from federal funding or tax credits must conduct thorough due diligence to identify any exposure to prohibited foreign entities, particularly in their ownership structures and supply chains. The Act imposes strict certification requirements, and noncompliance can result in loss of eligibility, recapture of credits, penalties, and enforcement actions.

Accordingly, while the Act expands funding and incentive opportunities for AI and related technologies, these benefits are available only to those companies that can demonstrate compliance with the Act’s comprehensive sourcing and foreign influence restrictions. Companies with foreign capital or complex ownership structures should carefully assess their compliance risk and implement robust due diligence and documentation practices.

Health Care —Medicaid

The Act includes significant reforms to Medicaid, Medicare, and Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits that are intended to reduce federal healthcare expenditures by more than $1 trillion over a decade. The OBBBA accomplishes this through new work requirements for Medicaid, reforms to healthcare program subsidies, and enhanced eligibility checks that are intended to result in fewer people being covered by government health programs. To offset the impact of the reduced financial healthcare expenditures, the OBBBA includes a $50 billion rural health relief fund that will be available to rural hospitals.

Reducing fraud and improving enrollment processes

1. Sec. 71101. Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to eligibility and enrollment in Medicare Savings Programs.

Section 71101 prohibits the Secretary from implementing, administering, or enforcing certain provisions stemming from part one of a two-part final rule aimed at simplifying processes for eligible individuals to enroll and retain eligibility in the Medicare Savings Programs (“MSPs”) until October 1, 2034. See 88 Fed. Reg. 65,230 (Sep. 21, 2023) (part one of two-part final rule) (referred to as the “2023 Eligibility Final Rule”).

The 2023 Eligibility Final Rule made several regulatory updates of which certain provisions have been halted by Section 71101 until October 1, 2034. The affected provisions include:

Individual enrollment: 42 C.F.R. § 406.21(c)

Procedures for determining eligibility for the MSP groups: 42 C.F.R. § 435.601(e)

Medicare Part D LIS program leads data: 42 C.F.R. §§ 435.4, 435.911(e)

Determining eligibility for MSPs: 42 C.F.R. § 435.952(e)

2. Sec. 71102. Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to eligibility and enrollment for Medicaid, CHIP, and the Basic Health Program.

Section 71102 prohibits the Secretary from implementing, administering, or enforcing certain provisions stemming from part two of a two-part final rule aimed at simplifying the eligibility and enrollment processes for Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and the Basic Health Program until October 1, 2034. See 89 Fed. Reg. 22,780 (April 2, 2024) (part two of two-part final rule) (referred to as the “2024 Eligibility Final Rule”).

The 2024 Eligibility Final Rule made several regulatory updates of which certain provisions have been halted by Section 71102 until October 1, 2034. The affected provisions include:

Determination of Eligibility: 42 C.F.R. § 435.911(c)

Establish maximum timeframes for redetermination of eligibility: 42 C.F.R. § 435.912

Aligning MAGI and Non-MAGI Renewal Requirements: 42 C.F.R. § 435.907, 435.916

Acting on changes in circumstances: 42 C.F.R. §§ 435.919, 457.344

Facilitate transitions between Medicaid and CHIP: 42 C.F.R. §§ 435.1200(b)(3)(i)-(v), 435.1200(e)(1)(ii), 435.1200(h)(1)

Exceptions from advance notice: 42 C.F.R. § 431.213(d)

Types of acceptable documentary evidence for citizenship: 42 C.F.R. § 435.407

CHIP-specific review process 42 C.F.R. §§ 457.1140(d)(4), 457.1170, 457.1180

3. Sec. 71103. Reducing duplicate enrollment under the Medicaid and CHIP programs.

Section 71103 requires the Secretary to establish a system for states to submit enrollees’ social security numbers on a monthly basis. The Secretary’s system must utilize the social security numbers to ensure that individuals are not enrolled in multiple States’ plans.

Section 71103 requires states to regularly consult enrollee’s address information to confirm they are eligible for the state plan. Managed care entities with state contracts must provide states with enrollee addresses beginning January 1, 2027.

4. Sec. 71104. Ensuring deceased individuals do not remain enrolled.

Beginning January 1, 2027, states must verify on a quarterly basis that no enrolled individuals are deceased. If an individual is determined to be deceased, they must be disenrolled and no additional payments shall be made on that enrollee’s behalf.

5. Sec. 71105. Ensuring deceased providers do not remain enrolled.

Beginning on January 1, 2028, states must check the Death Master File at least quarterly to ensure that deceased providers do not remain enrolled in Medicaid.

6. Sec. 71106. Payment reduction related to certain erroneous excess payments under Medicaid.

Federal law previously directed CMS to recoup federal funds for erroneous payments made for ineligible individuals and overpayments for eligible individuals if the state’s eligibility “error rate” exceeds 3 percent. CMS was permitted to waive the recoupment if the Medicaid agency had taken steps to demonstrate a “good faith” effort to get below the 3 percent allowable threshold.

Section 71106 expands the scope of overpayments potentially subject to recoupment by CMS. This provision takes effect in FY 2030.

7. Sec. 71107. Eligibility redeterminations.

Section 71107 requires redeterminations of eligibility to occur every six months for the ACA Medicaid expansion population. The remainder of the Medicaid population must be subject to annual redeterminations.

8. Sec. 71108. Revising home equity limit for determining eligibility for long-term care services under the Medicaid program.

States impose home equity limits on how much equity a Medicaid applicant can have in a home without the equity counting towards the Medicaid asset limit.

Beginning on January 1, 2028, the home equity limit is capped at $1 million regardless of inflation.

9. Sec. 71109. Alien Medicaid eligibility.

Section 71109 shortens the list of eligible immigrant populations whose care can be covered by Medicaid.

Prior to the enactment of the OBBBA, hospitals could receive Medicaid payments from the federal government for emergency care provided to several qualified immigrant groups, including refugees, asylees, victims of human trafficking, and those granted deferred action status, among others.

Section 71109 prohibits Medicaid payments to States for medical assistance to individuals unless they fall into one of four categories: (i) U.S. citizens and U.S nationals; (ii) certain U.S. lawful permanent residents; (iii) Cuban and Haitian entrants; and (iv) individuals in the U.S. under a Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau.

The same restrictions apply to Children’s Health Insurance Program eligibility.

10. Sec. 71110. Expansion FMAP for emergency Medicaid.

Section 71110 limits Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) payments for emergency care furnished to immigrants who qualify for Medicaid coverage.

Before the OBBBA, states that enrolled in Medicaid expansion under the ACA would be eligible to receive a higher percentage of Medicaid reimbursement for the costs of emergency care provided to immigrants who would qualify for Medicaid except for their immigration status.

The OBBBA caps FMAP payments to the state’s regular FMAP percentage for emergency care provided to immigrants not eligible for Medicaid coverage.

These modifications to FMAP payments will likely lead to lower Medicaid payments to states and could also result in lower reimbursement to providers.

Preventing wasteful spending

1. Sec. 71111. Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to staffing standards for long-term care facilities under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

Section 71111 imposes a moratorium through September 30, 2034, on CMS’s enforcement of its May 2024 final rule (89 Fed. Reg. 40876) establishing minimum staffing standards for long-term care facilities.

2. Sec. 71112. Reducing State Medicaid costs.

Section 71112 reduces retroactive Medicaid and CHIP eligibility beginning January 1, 2027; limits retroactive coverage to one month prior to application for ACA expansion adults; limits coverage to two months prior for all other applicants; and applies similar limits to CHIP pregnancy-related and child health assistance.

3. Sec. 71113. Federal payments to prohibited entities.

Section 71113 prohibits federal Medicaid funds from going to certain nonprofit providers that offer abortion services, for a one-year period following enactment.

This prohibition applies to organizations meeting specific criteria (e.g., 501(c)(3), essential community provider, >$800K in FY2023 Medicaid reimbursements).

Exemptions are included for cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment.

Stopping abusive financing practices

1. Sec. 71114. Sunsetting increased FMAP incentive.

The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 created a new incentive for non-expansion states to expand their Medicaid programs under the ACA – getting a 5% bump to their FMAPs for eight calendar quarters. Section 1114 would terminate this incentive, requiring non-expansion states to expand their Medicaid programs by January 1, 2026, in order to be eligible, making Medicaid expansion a less enticing option for states that have yet to implement it.

2. Sec. 71115. Provider taxes.

Provider taxes are an extremely common means that states use to finance their Medicaid state share. Under Section 71115, starting in 2028, states that expanded their Medicaid programs will have a 0.5% reduction to their “hold harmless” threshold until bottoming out at 3.5% in 2032, forcing expansion states to either scale back programs or use general revenue funds or intergovernmental transfers (IGTs) to finance a greater portion of their state share.

Additionally, both expansion and non-expansion states alike will have their hold harmless thresholds for classes of providers that are not already subject to provider taxes set to 0%, effectively barring states from implementing any new provider tax to support state Medicaid programs.

3. Sec. 71116. State directed payments.

Using state directed payment programs, some states were able to reimburse providers for Medicaid services at upwards of 90% of the average commercial rates.

Section 71116 significantly scales back the upper limit that Medicaid providers can receive for services, instead limiting the maximum amount for state directed payments in Medicaid expansion states to 100% of the Medicare payment rates and in non-Medicaid expansion states at 110% of the Medicare payment rates, as opposed to Average Commercial Rate.

For programs that already exist, Section 71116 directed the Secretary to wind down the reimbursement rates by ten percentage points each year until reaching the new statutorily designated ceiling.

4. Sec. 71117. Requirements regarding waiver of uniform tax requirement for Medicaid provider tax.

Federal law authorizes states to tax providers to finance the state share of Medicaid spending. All but one state has adopted some form of provider taxes.

In 1991, Congress enacted restrictions that require provider taxes to be broad based and uniform. CMS can waive the broad based and uniform requirements if the tax is “generally redistributive,” i.e., it tends to draw funds from non-Medicaid sources. CMS has adopted a test for determining whether a tax is “generally redistributive.” But the agency reports that some states have found ways to circumvent the test.

To close this perceived loophole, Section 71117 provides that a tax will not be considered “generally redistributive” if it imposes a higher tax rate on Medicaid units (e.g., bed days, discharges, costs) than non-Medicaid units. States with non-compliant taxes are required to fix them immediately, unless CMS implements a transition period (not to exceed 3 years).

5. Sec. 71118. Requiring budget neutrality for Medicaid demonstration projects under section 1115.

Section 71118 authorizes CMS to waive compliance with the Medicaid statute to authorize funding for demonstration projects that promote the objectives of the Medicaid program. According to MedPAC, Section 1115 demonstration accounts for over 50% of Medicaid spending.

It has been CMS’s longstanding policy that demonstrations must be budget neutral. But the Government Accountability Office has repeatedly faulted CMS for approving demonstrations that are not budget neutral.

Section 71118 prohibits CMS from approving new or renewing existing Section 1115 demonstration projects unless the Chief Actuary for CMS certifies that the project is budget neutral.

Section 71118 also gives CMS discretion to decide whether savings achieved by a demonstration can be applied towards calculating budget neutrality in future approval periods.

Increasing personal accountability

1. Sec. 71119. Requirement for States to establish Medicaid community engagement requirements for certain individuals.

States must incorporate a “Community Engagement” requirement into their processes for determining eligibility for Medicaid.

Those applying for Medicaid enrollment will need to show they have completed at least 80 hours of “Community Engagement” during the prior month.

Those who are already enrolled in Medicaid, must, at their next regularly scheduled redetermination of eligibility, show that they have completed at least 80 hours of “Community Engagement” for one or more prior months.

“Community Engagement” is defined as:

working at least 80 hours;

performing at least 80 hours of community services;

participating in a work program for at least 80 hours;

being enrolled in an educational program for at least half of the time;

some combination of the prior four activities amounting to at least 80 hours; or

showing a monthly income of the national minimum wage (currently $7.50/hour) multiplied by 80 hours.

If a state is unable to verify that a person has met “Community Engagement” requirements, the state should:

provide that person with a notice of noncompliance;

provide that person 30 days from the date of receipt of the notice of noncompliance to show that they either had met the requirements or were subject to an exception;

if the person is unable to make such a showing, deny the person’s application for Medicaid or disenroll the person from Medicaid no later than the end of the month following the month in which the 30-day period ends.

The Community Engagement requirement is subject to both Mandatory Exceptions (where a person will be deemed to have demonstrated that they met the “Community Engagement” requirements for the prior month) and Optional Exceptions (where a person will be deemed to have met their requirement for the prior month if they endured certain “short-term hardship events”).

2. Sec. 71120. Modifying cost sharing requirements for certain expansion individuals under the Medicaid program.

State Medicaid plans may, effective October 1, 2028, begin imposing deductions, cost sharing, or similar charges determined appropriate by the state for certain care, items and services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries who have a family income that exceeds the poverty line. This does not allow the imposition of premiums.

Cost sharing cannot be applied to certain services, including but not limited to: (i) services rendered to those under 18-years old; (ii) people receiving inpatient services in a hospital, nursing facility, or intermediate care facility who are required to spend all but a minimal amount of income on medical care; (iii) emergency services; (iv) hospice services; (v) COVID-19 testing; and (vi) vaccines recommended by the CDC.

Cost share portion must not exceed $35 for any individual item or service except for prescription drugs, which are subject to the cost share amounts permitted under Section 1916(A).

The maximum aggregate amount of deductions, cost sharing, or similar charges imposed for all members of a family cannot exceed five percent of the family income.

Providers are entitled to make the provision of services contingent on payment of deductions, cost-sharing, or similar charges. Providers are also permitted to reduce or waive such deductions and cost-sharing on a case-by-case basis.

Expanding access to care

1. Sec. 71121. Making certain adjustments to coverage of home or community-based services under Medicaid.

Expands the ability of state Medicaid plans to provide home and community-based services as an alternative to institutional services for individuals who otherwise would require admission to a nursing facility of intermediate care facility.

Establishes additional “waivers” of requirements under § 1396(a) that normally would require state Medicaid plans to ensure consistency and comparability of services statewide.

Starting July 1, 2028, the HHS Secretary may approve waivers pursuant to which state plans can cover part or all of the cost of home or community-based services (other than room and board).

The state’s ability to obtain such a waiver will be contingent on the state establishing needs-based criteria for determining who will be eligible for care under the state plan provided under such waiver, as well as on the state establishing that the average per capita expenditure for medical assistance provided pursuant to these waivers will not exceed the comparable amounts expended for individuals receiving institutional care.

Health Care —Medicare

Strengthening eligibility requirements

1. Sec. 71201. Limiting Medicare coverage of certain individuals.

Section 71201 limits Medicare coverage to United States citizens and other individuals lawfully residing in the United States.

For current Medicare enrollees, this limitation begins to apply 18 months after the date of the OBBBA’s enactment.

Improving services for seniors

1. Sec. 71202. Temporary payment increase under the Medicare physician fee schedule to account for exceptional circumstances.

Section 71202 provides a temporary one-year increase of 2.5% to the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) conversion factor for all services furnished between January 1, 2026, and January 1, 2027. The PFS conversion factor is one factor used to determine PFS rates and is updated annually.

2. Sec. 71203. Expanding and clarifying the exclusion for orphan drugs under the Drug Price Negotiation Program.

Section 71203 expands the Orphan Drug Exclusion under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. Under IRA, excluded from the negotiations are so-called “orphan drugs,” drugs that are designated for only one rare disease or condition and approved for an indication (or indications) only for that disease or condition.

The orphan drug exclusion is modified to include drugs designated for one or more rare diseases or conditions and where the only approved indication or indications are for one or more rare diseases or conditions.

Health Care —Affordable Care Act

Improving eligibility criteria

1. Sec. 71301. Permitting premium tax credit only for certain individuals.

Section 71301 limits the availability of premium tax credits under the ACA only to certain “eligible aliens.”

An “eligible alien” is defined as an individual who is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence, an alien who has been granted the status of Cuban and Haitian entrant, or an individual who lawfully resides in the United States in accordance with a Compact of Free Association.

These changes will go into effect on January 1, 2027.

2. Sec. 71302. Disallowing premium tax credit during periods of Medicaid ineligibility due to alien status.

Section 71302 eliminates premium tax credit eligibility under the ACA for lawfully present immigrants with income below 100% of the poverty line who are ineligible for Medicaid due to their immigration status.

This change will become effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Preventing waste, fraud, and abuse

1. Sec. 71303. Requiring verification of eligibility for premium tax credit.

Section 71303 requires health insurance exchanges to annually verify, using applicable enrollment information, an applicant’s eligibility before enrollment in a plan or receipt of premium tax credits.

Applicable enrollment information includes affirmation of the following: (i) household income and family size, (ii) whether the individual is an eligible alien, (iii) any health coverage status or eligibility for coverage, (iv) place of residence, or (v) such other information as may be determined by the Secretary as necessary to the verification.

These requirements become effective with taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027.

2. Sec. 71304. Disallowing premium tax credit in case of certain coverage enrolled in during special enrollment period.

Section 71304 disallows premium tax credits in the case of certain coverage that is enrolled during a special enrollment period (SEP).

An SEP provides an opportunity for enrollment in a health plan outside a standard open enrollment period. SEPs are usually temporary and come with restrictions on those that may be eligible to enroll, such as requiring a qualifying life event (e.g., marriage, birth of a child, etc.). The Biden administration significantly expanded the opportunity for individuals to enroll in coverage at any point through new SEPs.

Section 71304 eliminates the SEP for individuals claiming income between 100-150% of the federal poverty line.

This change will go into effect during plan years beginning December 31, 2025.

3. Sec. 71305. Eliminating limitation on recapture of advance payment of premium tax credit.

Section 71305 eliminates caps on the IRS’s recapture of excess Advanced Premium Tax Credits (APTCs) and requires individuals who misreport income to fully account for overpayments.

There are limits to the amount of APTCs the government may recover if an enrollee receives excess APTCs. Since the ACA Premium Tax Credit is based on income, brokers have incentive to advise enrollees to underestimate income and increase overpayments.

Section 71305 allows the government to recover the entirety of the overpayments.

This change will go into effect during taxable years beginning December 31, 2025.

Protecting Rural Hospitals and Providers

1. Sec. 71401. Rural Health Transformation Program.

Section 71401 establishes a $50 billion rural health relief fund called the Rural Health Transformation Program.

The Rural Health Transformation Program aims to support rural health by dispersing funds to eligible states, which then have the discretion, subject to certain limitations, to determine how to allocate such funds.

$10 billion will be administered annually by CMS to eligible states for years 2026-2030. To be eligible to access this funding, states must submit an application, including a rural health transformation plan, to CMS by December 31, 2025.

Health Care —Health Saving Accounts (HSA)

Permanent extension of safe harbor for absence of deductible for telehealth services

Section 71306 makes permanent the CARES Act telehealth safe harbor for HSA eligible health plans that allow provision of telehealth and remote care services without a deductible.).

Health Care —Research

Section 70302 allows research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer in connection with the taxpayer’s trade or business to be immediately deductible and repeals the previous Section 174 that had required amortization of research expenses over a five-year period. Foreign research expenditures still retain a 15-year amortization period.

Tax, Including Energy Credit Provisions

The Act extends and modifies several taxpayer-favorable provisions of the 2017 tax reform legislation known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“TCJA”) and introduces a host of new measures impacting individuals and businesses. A portion of the OBBBA’s cost is offset by a cutback to the energy tax credit legislation enacted under the Biden administration as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”).

Some of the more notable changes wrought by the OBBBA will impact significant domestic and international tax rules, including those relating to:

qualified small business stock (QSBS) benefits;

qualified opportunity zone (QOZ) investments;

taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS) limitations;

state and local tax (SALT) deductions;

the “qualified business income” deduction under section 199A;

research and development expenses;

bonus depreciation;

the limitation on interest deductibility under section 163(j);

global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI), foreign-derived intangible income (FDII), base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT) and controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules;

accelerated expiration of, and new restrictions on, certain energy credits;

charitable deductions; and

investment income of certain tax-exempt organizations.

Also notable are several items not included in the OBBBA, most importantly the proposed section 899 “retaliatory tax” provision that had been included in the House and Senate version of the bill. In addition, the OBBBA does not include a previously proposed new tax on proceeds received under litigation funding arrangements. The OBBBA also declines to eliminate tax credit transferability, which had been proposed in prior versions of the legislation. Finally, the OBBBA does not impact the taxation of carried interest, which remains eligible for preferential tax rates, subject to the existing 3-year holding period requirement.

Below we provide a high-level summary of some of the key OBBBA changes that will primarily impact business clients.

Qualified Small Business Stock

Under prior law, taxpayers were required to hold qualified small business stock (“QSBS”) for at least five years prior to disposition in order to exclude gain on the sale of QSBS under section 1202. The OBBBA shortens the holding period by allowing a 50% exclusion of eligible gain on sales of QSBS held for three years and a 75% exclusion of eligible gain on QSBS held for four years. QSBS held for five or more years at the time of sale will continue to qualify for 100% exclusion of eligible gain.

Under prior law, stock would not be QSBS if the issuing corporation’s aggregate gross assets exceeded $50 million at any point before and immediately after the stock issuance. The OBBBA increases the aggregate gross asset limit to $75 million.

Prior to the OBBBA, excludible gain was generally limited to the greater of (i) $10 million ($5 million for married taxpayers filing separate returns) and (ii) ten times the taxpayer’s aggregate adjusted basis in QSBS. The OBBBA increases the $10 million cap to $15 million.

These changes generally apply to QSBS acquired after July 4, 2025.

Qualified Opportunity Zones

The OBBBA eliminates the previously applicable investment sunset of December 31, 2026, and makes the QOZ program permanent, with certain changes.

There will be a new census tract designation process commencing in 2026, which will go into effect on January 1, 2027. The new QOZs will be effective for ten years, and new designations will be made on each ten-year anniversary.

The OBBBA adds a new “rolling” five-year gain deferral period (as opposed to a fixed trigger date of December 31, 2026, under the prior QOZ rules) as well as an automatic 10% basis step-up that crystallizes at the end of the five-year period (30% for an investment in a rural area).

The OBBBA eliminates the 2047 program sunset provision, such that a 30-year rolling sunset will apply with respect to post-10-year dispositions of qualifying investments.

The OBBBA enacts new, enhanced reporting requirements applicable to QOZs.

Most of the QOZ changes are set to take effect after December 31, 2026. Various uncertainties remain regarding the interplay of the “old” and “new” QOZ designations and timelines.

Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

Section 856 establishes a limit on the percentage of a REIT’s assets that can be held in securities of TRSs. The OBBBA increases the limit from 20% to 25%.

State and Local Tax Deductions

The TCJA capped the itemized deduction for payments of state and local taxes (“SALT”) by individual taxpayers to $10,000 ($5,000 for married taxpayers filing separate returns). The TCJA’s $10,000 SALT cap was set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA increases the SALT cap to $40,000 for taxable years beginning in calendar year 2025. The OBBBA further increases the SALT cap to $40,400 for taxable years beginning in calendar year 2026, and then by an additional 1% for 2027, 2028, and 2029.

The OBBBA also phases out the SALT deduction for taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income (“MAGI”) greater than $500,000 in 2026. In 2026, the phaseout threshold increases to $505,000, and then by an additional 1% annually. For taxpayers with MAGI above the threshold amount, the SALT cap is reduced (but not below $10,000) by 30% of the excess of the taxpayer’s MAGI over the threshold amount.

The SALT cap will revert to $10,000 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2029.

The pass-through entity tax workaround enacted in many states was not affected directly by Othe BBBA.

Qualified Business Income Deduction

The TCJA added a deduction for certain non-corporate taxpayers equal to 20% of qualified business income (“QBI”) derived from partnerships, S corporations, and sole proprietorships. For this purpose, QBI is generally active trade or business income (other than income as an employee or from certain specified service businesses). Ordinary REIT dividends and certain publicly traded partnership income also qualify for the 20% deduction. The deduction is subject to a limitation based in part on W-2 wages paid by the qualifying trade or business, which limitation is phased in for single filers with taxable income of at least $50,000 and married taxpayers filing joint returns with taxable incomes of at least $100,000. The deduction was set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA makes the 20% deduction for QBI permanent. OBBBA also sets a $400 minimum deduction for active QBI and requires a taxpayer to have at least $1,000 of QBI in order to claim the deduction.

Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the OBBBA increases the phase-in threshold to $75,000 for single filers and $150,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns, with both thresholds indexed for inflation starting in 2027.

Research and Development Expenses

Under prior law, research and development (“R&D”) expenditures (called “research and experimental” expenditures under section 174) incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, were required to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a 5-year period (15 years in the case of expenditures related to foreign research).

The OBBBA permanently allows for immediate expensing of domestic R&D expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024. Foreign R&D expenses remain subject to capitalization and amortization over a 15-year period.

In addition, the OBBBA allows taxpayers to elect to deduct unamortized domestic R&D expenditures capitalized in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2025, in either the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2024, or ratably over the first two taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.

Bonus Depreciation

The TCJA amended section 168(k) to permit taxpayers to elect to immediately expense 100% of the cost of qualified property (including machinery, equipment and other tangible personal property with a recovery period of 20 years or less). The 100% bonus depreciation added by the TCJA was subject to a phase-out of 20 percentage points per year beginning in 2023 and was scheduled to expire after 2026.

The OBBBA permanently reinstates 100% bonus depreciation for qualified property acquired after January 19, 2025.

The OBBBA also allows taxpayers to elect 100% bonus depreciation for “qualified production property,” defined to include nonresidential real property used in the manufacturing, production or refining of certain products in the United States (excluding certain food and beverage products), if the following requirements are met: (i) the original use of the property commences with the taxpayer; (ii) construction of the property begins after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029; and (iii) the property is placed in service in the United States by December 31, 2030.

Business Interest Expense Limitation

Under section 163(j), which was added by the TCJA, the amount of business interest expense that a taxpayer can deduct generally is limited to 30 percent of the taxpayer’s adjusted taxable income (“ATI”) (equal to taxable income with certain modifications). Following enactment of the TCJA, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, ATI was determined based on an EBITDA standard. For subsequent taxable years, a less-favorable EBIT standard was used in computing ATI, resulting in lower ATI (and a correspondingly lower cap on interest deductions).

The OBBBA restores the more favorable pre-2022 EBITDA rule, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.

Under the OBBBA, the section 163(j) limitation will also apply to certain capitalized interest, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (now “Net CFC Tested Income”)

The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) regime was introduced by the TCJA, in effect, to impose a minimum tax on U.S. shareholders of controlled foreign corporations (“CFCs”). Under that regime, U.S. shareholders were taxed on their share of a CFC’s foreign earnings exceeding a 10% return on the CFC’s tangible property. Domestic corporations are allowed to deduct 50% of their GILTI income and claim a foreign tax credit (“FTC”) for 80% of foreign taxes paid on the GILTI income. This results in an effective tax rate of 10.5% (or 13.125% when factoring in the FTC limitation) on earnings exceeding the 10% threshold. Starting in 2026, the deduction was scheduled to decrease to 37.5%, raising the effective tax rate to 13.125% (or 16.4% when accounting for the FTC limitation).

The OBBBA eliminates the rule excluding CFC earnings up to a 10% return on its tangible property from the GILTI calculation, resets the deduction for domestic corporations permanently at 40%, and increases the FTC limitation to 90%. These changes will result in an effective tax rate of 12.6% (or 14% when accounting for the FTC limitation) on CFC earnings without any threshold. Furthermore, the OBBBA disallows 10% of the deemed paid FTC for distributions of previously taxed Net CFC Tested Income, which applies to foreign income taxes paid or accrued after June 28, 2025. The OBBBA also renames GILTI as “Net CFC Tested Income.”

The OBBBA also introduces a new limitation on expenses allocable to foreign source income in the “Net CFC Tested Income” FTC basket to the 40% deduction for Net CFC Tested Income and any other deduction that is directly allocable to Net CFC Tested Income. Additionally, no amount of interest expense or research and experimental expenditures will be allocable to the Net CFC Tested Income basket. Instead, such expenses will be allocated to U.S. source income.

The OBBBA’s changes to the GILTI regime apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII)

The TCJA also established the Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (“FDII”) regime, which allows domestic corporations to deduct 37.5% of certain income derived from foreign sources exceeding a 10% return on the corporation’s tangible property. This deduction results in an effective tax rate of 13.125% on earnings exceeding the 10% threshold. Beginning in 2026, the deduction was scheduled to be reduced to 21.875%, increasing the effective tax rate to 16.4% on earnings exceeding the 10% threshold.

For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the OBBBA eliminates the rule excluding earnings up to a 10% return on tangible property from the FDII calculation and renames the regime “Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income” (“FDDEI”). The deduction for domestic corporations is permanently set at 33.34%, resulting in an effective tax rate of 14% on earnings without any threshold. This aligns with the effective tax rate for Net CFC Tested Income when factoring in the FTC limitation.

Additionally, the OBBBA modifies the calculation of FDDEI compared to FDII by implementing restrictions on expense apportionment and excluding certain types of income from deduction eligibility. Specifically, gains from the sale of certain intangible property, as well as property that is depreciable or amortizable, are excluded from deduction eligible income. This exclusion applies to amounts received or accrued on or after June 16, 2025.

Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT)

The Base Erosion & Anti-Abuse Tax (“BEAT”), which was added by the TCJA, is a minimum tax regime designed to prevent large U.S. corporations from eroding their U.S. tax base by making related party payments to foreign affiliates. The BEAT applies to multinational corporations with average gross receipts of $500 million or more over the three preceding taxable years and deductions for payments to related foreign corporations in excess of 3% of total deductions (the “BEAT Threshold”).

Under the TCJA, the BEAT tax rate was set to 10% for 2025 and was set to increase to 12.5% beginning in 2026. The base erosion minimum tax amount is due in addition to regularly owed U.S. corporate tax and is calculated as the applicable BEAT rate multiplied by a modified income baseless the adjusted regular tax liability.

The OBBBA permanently sets the BEAT rate at 10.5% for taxable years beginning in 2026 (11.5% for banks and certain securities dealers), but maintains the BEAT Threshold at 3% of total deductions. The OBBBA also retains the current treatment of certain tax credits (e.g., R&D credits), whereby “regular tax liability” calculated for BEAT purposes would not be reduced by such credits for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2025.

Subpart F Income Inclusions

Under current law, a U.S. shareholder of a CFC is required to recognize their share of the CFC’s subpart F income only if it owns stock in the CFC on the last day of the taxable year.

Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the OBBBA requires any U.S. shareholder who owns stock in a CFC at any point during the taxable year to include its pro rata share of the CFC’s subpart F income in its taxable income for that year, regardless of whether it owns stock in the CFC on the last day of the year.

Stock Ownership for CFC Purposes

Prior to the TCJA, section 958(b)(4) prevented the downward attribution from foreign persons to U.S. persons for purposes of determining whether the U.S. person is the owner of CFC stock by providing that sections 318(a)(3)(A) through 318(a)(3)(C) are not to be applied to consider a U.S. person as owning stock owned by a foreign person. The TCJA repealed section 958(b)(4).

The OBBBA restores section 958(b)(4), reinstituting restrictions on the downward attribution of stock ownership. Thus, a U.S. corporation wholly owned by a foreign corporation will not necessarily be treated as owning the stock of the foreign parent’s wholly owned foreign subsidiary. The OBBBA also introduces a new Section 951B which allows downward attribution in limited circumstances. Sections 958(b)(4) and 951B are effective beginning in taxable years after December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA also grants the Treasury Secretary the authority to issue regulations to treat foreign controlled U.S. shareholders and foreign controlled foreign corporations as U.S. shareholders and CFCs, respectively, for other tax purposes, including reporting requirements and determining the treatment of foreign controlled foreign corporations that are passive foreign investment companies.

Enforcement of Remedies Against Unfair Foreign Taxes (Proposed Section 899)

Prior versions of the OBBBA passed by the House and introduced in the Senate proposed a new section 899 which caused much consternation among legal professionals, industry stakeholders, and taxpayers. Proposed section 899 would have raised tax rates on certain categories of U.S. source income paid to foreign individuals, entities, and governments with connections to countries imposing taxes (such as a global minimum tax and a digital services tax previously negotiated by the OECD) deemed to be “unfair foreign taxes.”.

The proposed section 899 was removed from the OBBBA after the Treasury Department and the G7 countries reached an agreement not to apply the global minimum tax of the OECD’s Pillar II to U.S.-parented corporate groups.

Tax-Energy Credit Provisions

Clean Electricity Investment/Production Tax Credits (Section 48E/45Y)

These credits are phased out for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2032, except for solar and wind. No credits under section 48E/45Y are available for solar and wind projects that are placed in service after December 31, 2027, unless they begin construction within 12 months of the enactment of the OBBBA. Previously, under the IRA, the phase-out would have been automatically extended beyond 2032 if U.S. greenhouse gas emissions were not reduced to 25% of 2022 levels.

For facilities that begin construction starting June 16, 2025, higher thresholds for domestic content requirements apply for purposes of section 48E.

Section 48E was revised to provide a flat 30% credit to qualified fuel cell property that begin construction after December 31, 2025, which will not be eligible for bonus credits (i.e., the domestic content and energy community bonuses).

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q)

Under prior law, the credit rate varied based on how the sequestered carbon oxide was stored or used.

Under the OBBBA, the credit rate is same across the different uses of sequestered carbon oxide. As revised, both enhanced oil recovery and commercial utilization can qualify for an inflation-indexed credit of initially up to $85 per metric ton.

Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (Section 45V)

This credit, created by the IRA, is eliminated for facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2027.

Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit (Section 45Z)

Under prior law, the credit was set to expire at the end of 2027.

The OBBBA extends the credit through December 31, 2029, but eliminated the special credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel.

Additionally, fuel produced after December 31, 2025, must be from feedstock produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Transferability (Section 6418) and Direct Pay (Section 6417)

The OBBBA generally preserves transferability and direct pay of certain tax credits, features added by the IRA.

The OBBBA does, however, prohibit transfer of credits to specified foreign entities. For this purpose, “specified foreign entities” generally include entities with certain ties to China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.

Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) Restrictions

FEOC restrictions disallow many tax credits for

taxpayers that are “prohibited foreign entities” for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025, and

facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2025, receive “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.”

The FEOC restrictions are intended to limit the ownership of and control over U.S. energy projects by individuals and entities from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. The material assistance restrictions, which apply to credits under sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X, prohibit a project from qualifying for a tax credit if the total direct costs exceed specified thresholds related to products or components from those jurisdictions. The FEOC restrictions are likely to significantly impact credit eligibility for projects with Chinese-owned suppliers in particular.

The OBBBA introduces accuracy-related penalties due to overstating the “material assistance cost ratio” where applicable. Additionally, the OBBBA extends the period for assessment to 6 years material assistance issues.

Beginning of Construction

For purposes of the FEOC restrictions, the OBBBA codifies the beginning of construction rules under IRS Notices 2013-29 and 2018-59 (as well as any subsequently issued guidance clarifying, modifying, or updating either such Notice), as in effect on January 1, 2025.

A recent executive order directs the Treasury Department to more strictly define when a project begins construction for other purposes, including by restricting the use of existing broad safe harbors “unless a substantial portion of the project has been built.”

Charitable Contribution Deductions

The TCJA increased the limit on deductibility of cash contributions by individuals to certain tax-exempt organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A) from 50% of the taxpayer’s contribution base (which is, generally, adjusted gross income (“AGI”)) to 60% of the taxpayer’s contribution base. The TCJA’s increased 60% contribution ceiling for those cash gifts was set to expire on December 31, 2025.

The OBBBA permanently extends the TCJA’s 60% ceiling for cash gifts made by individuals to tax-exempt organizations described in section 170(b)(1)(A).

Additionally, the OBBBA imposes a floor on the charitable contribution deduction equal to 0.5% of the taxpayer’s contribution base (in the case of individuals) or 1% of the taxpayer’s taxable income (in the case of corporations). Thus, qualifying charitable contributions by individuals will now be deductible only to the extent their aggregate contributions exceed 0.5% of the taxpayer’s contribution base, and qualifying charitable contributions by corporations will now be deductible only to the extent the aggregate contributions exceed 1% of the corporation’s taxable income. These new floors apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

Excise Tax on Investment Income of Private Colleges and Universities

The TCJA imposed a flat 1.4% excise tax on the income earned on endowments of private educational institutions with at least 500 students (more than half of whom are located in the United States) with an endowment of at least $500,000 per student at the end of the preceding tax year.

The OBBBA replaces the pre-existing flat 1.4% endowment excise tax on “applicable educational institutions” (as defined below) with a new tiered rate structure, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. For this purpose, an “applicable educational institution” is defined to mean an eligible educational institution with at least 3,000 tuition paying students more than 50% of which are located in the U.S., a student adjusted endowment of at least $500,000, and which is a not a state college or university.

The new excise tax rate ranges from 1.4% to 8% based on the size of the “student adjusted endowment.” The maximum rate of 8% is applied to institutions with a student adjusted endowment exceeding $2,000,000. The “student adjusted endowment” is defined as the aggregate fair market value of the assets of such institution (determined as of the end of the preceding taxable year), other than those assets which are used directly in carrying out the institution’s exempt purpose, divided by the number of students of such institution.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.12073_3056.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 22:59:04.919357

Although Kernodle said it was a ""close call,"" he found that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence that the asset managers engaged in a coordinated conspiracy with each other.
Kernodle noted the attorneys general also say the asset managers had an economic motive to conspire to lower coal output in order to raise coal prices, thereby increasing profits for coal companies they own stock in.
Kernodle acknowledged that the plaintiffs' Sherman Antitrust Act claim is unusual, but he ultimately said there was evidence that the asset managers had acted to restrain trade.","(CN) — A Texas federal judge ruled Friday that a group of Republican state attorneys general can proceed with most of a lawsuit accusing three of the world's largest investment companies of violating antitrust laws by participating in climate initiatives.

A coalition of 11 Republican attorneys general, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas last year accusing BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard — known as the ""Big Three"" asset managers — of conspiring to pressure coal companies they own stock in to lower output.

The plaintiffs take issue with the investment companies' participation in groups like Climate Action 100+ and the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative, which call on investors to use their investment power to help lower greenhouse gas emissions.

U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle rejected the asset managers' arguments that they were merely engaged in lawful passive investment.

The Donald Trump appointee found the plaintiffs had sufficiently claimed that the companies engaged in anticompetitive conduct to decrease coal output, such as by voting against board directors at coal companies they deemed not sufficiently committed to climate goals.

Although Kernodle said it was a ""close call,"" he found that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence that the asset managers engaged in a coordinated conspiracy with each other.

""It’s not a stretch to infer that defendants believed they were morally compelled to fight 'climate change' and 'global temperature increases' because they joined climate initiatives that committed to taking necessary action on climate change, reducing coal emissions, and limiting global warming,"" Kernodle wrote. ""But even well-intentioned moral motives are no excuse for antitrust violations.""

Kernodle noted the attorneys general also say the asset managers had an economic motive to conspire to lower coal output in order to raise coal prices, thereby increasing profits for coal companies they own stock in.

The lawsuit is part of a larger conservative battle against ESG investing. Short for environmental, social and governance, ESG investing involves considering in investment decisions factors like a company's impact on the environment, its relationships with employees and communities and the quality of its leadership and internal controls.

The practice is aimed at promoting sustainable and ethical business practices, but many Republicans argue it prioritizes political and social agendas over financial returns, potentially harming investors and the economy.

Kernodle acknowledged that the plaintiffs' Sherman Antitrust Act claim is unusual, but he ultimately said there was evidence that the asset managers had acted to restrain trade.

""While the alleged restraint’s structure is unique, plaintiffs plausibly allege that its purpose and effect is not: it is a 'concerted attempt to reduce output,'"" Kernodle wrote.

Instead of accusing the asset manager of a horizontal agreement among competitors to reduce output, which is automatically unlawful, Kernodle said the attorneys general are instead claiming ""a horizontal agreement among investors to pressure competitors in another industry to reduce output.""

Five of the attorneys general also bring claims against BlackRock under their states' consumer protection laws, accusing the investment firm of falsely marketing certain funds as not pursuing an ""ESG investment strategy"" when in fact, they claim, these funds owned shares in coal companies and BlackRock was using its power from those shares to advance a climate agenda.

Kernodle dismissed the claims against BlackRock under the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Nebraska Consumer Protection Act, as those laws do not cover securities transactions.

But he ruled the other consumer protection claims can continue, finding the plaintiffs had properly argued both that BlackRock had made deceptive statements about the ESG status of the funds and that reasonable investors would consider that information important.

""As plaintiffs say, an investor may avoid ESG-based funds either 'because of a political disagreement' or 'because of a belief that ESG priorities will diminish the fund’s performance, or both,'"" Kernodle wrote. ""And it is plausible that an alleged misrepresentation pertaining to a fund’s ESG involvement is important to a reasonable shareholder and may alter their decision to invest in the fund.""

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton celebrated Kernodle's ruling in a statement.

“BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard — three of the most powerful financial corporations in the world — created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans,” Paxton said. “Today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable. I will continue fighting to protect Texas and defend America’s energy independence from this unlawful conspiracy.”

In an email to Courthouse News Service, a spokesperson for Vanguard said the firm ""looks forward to the opportunity to vigorously defend against plaintiffs' claims and will continue to give investors the best chance for investment success.""

A spokesperson for State Street said, ""Despite the plaintiffs’ efforts to advance a new and dangerous antitrust theory, this lawsuit remains baseless and without merit. It poses unnecessary risk to investors and energy markets.There is no collusion here, and we remain confident that the facts and legal substance are on our side.”

BlackRock did not respond to a request for comment on Kernodle's ruling.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2021/04/EmissionsCoal-FiredPowerPlant2-1-21AP.jpg/w=2500,h=1666",N,,2025-08-01 22:01:17.909848

More than 420 homes and businesses will be powered through the new solar energy center, while also serving as a testing ground for new battery storage software that could be scaled up in the future.
This is our mission and this is what the Peoria solar energy field is all about.""","Ameren Illinois officially broke ground Thursday on a new solar energy facility, the company's third attempt in Illinois to provide such forms of energy in equity-eligible areas.

The Peoria Solar Energy Center will join a pair of similar facilities in East St. Louis in providing solar power to provide equity in transitioning to clean energy, according to Ameren. The site, located on a 37-acre plot of farmland off Prichard Road, was purchased by the company in 2023. It will contain 4,850 solar panels capable of producing 2.5 megawatts of energy as part of a $20 million project. The company hopes to have it up and running in the third quarter of 2026.

While not the biggest or most powerful solar facility in Illinois, the company is hopeful that the new site will help in addressing the increased demand for electricity in areas like Peoria. Lenny Singh, president of Ameren Illinois, said that due to that increase in electricity demand, the company needed to build up new ways of producing energy as fast as possible.

""In the last decade, electricity demand was flat,"" Singh said. ""Today, tremendous economic development and expanding energy use is driven by the growth in manufacturing, industrial business needs and rapidly emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence that drive the need for data center expansion, leading to significant growth in electricity demand.

""Now more than ever, more energy needs to be generated and connected to the grid as fast as possible so that it can be delivered to residents and businesses and support economic development in communities such as Peoria.""

The new facility was aided in its conception by the Illinois General Assembly passing the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in 2021, allowing Ameren to build the new solar energy plots and helping it provide the infrastructure to facilitate clean energy in central and southern Illinois.

Singh said the CEJA allows the company to pursue projects such as this in order to better serve its customers.

""CEJA enabled us to invest in our electric system to serve the 1.2 million customers across 45,000 square miles and roughly 1,200 communities in central and southern Illinois,"" Singh said. ""Transitioning our energy systems to accommodate clean energy requires intricate planning, engineering and coordination across our entire service territory. Not a small task, but our team is up for it.""

The facility will utilize its solar panels to automatically rotate with the sun in order to maximize the energy produced at the site. That energy will be stored in six battery modules and cabinets, with the aim of keeping the electric and natural gas delivery systems reliable for Peoria-area customers.

Patrick Smith, senior vice president of operations and technical services for Ameren, said that the facility will help keep the energy grid reliable through changing and evolving weather conditions, such as extreme heat, cold and high winds.

""The extreme weather events, like the polar vortex, the stuff that's happened in Texas, the extreme heat that we're getting a sense of now, the increased demand for energy with the data centers and the like and the supply constraints that we're facing now in our state make this so vital to find new ways to deliver new energy to our customers,"" Smith said.

Smith noted that the solar panels would fill just over six football fields, tracking the sun from when it rises to when it sets in order to maximize the company's investment in the technology. More than 420 homes and businesses will be powered through the new solar energy center, while also serving as a testing ground for new battery storage software that could be scaled up in the future.

""This site will have a 1.5 MW AC lithium-ion system to test how battery energy storage can be deployed to manage electricity across our distribution system and the capacity that we need to service our customers,"" Smith said. ""In recent days, it's been extremely hot. Everyone's turning their air conditioners on, everyone's using more energy.

""At those times, when capacity goes off the grid, we're trying to figure out when the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow, how to capture that energy and use it when you have peak demand times when everyone's coming home, especially in the winter time towards the evening when the usage is up.""

The system is designed to do something that Smith referred to as ""peak shaving,"" which allows it to address reliability issues that can be associated with generating renewable energy. He said that the technology is a way to keep energy reliable even when weather makes it difficult to produce solar or wind power.

""We're committed to keeping your energy reliable through these types of investments,"" Smith said. ""With every kilowatt we're adding in capacity to the grid, we're helping keep costs affordable. This is our mission and this is what the Peoria solar energy field is all about.""

Singh said that the site will play a role in economic development in Peoria County, with 50 new jobs being added to the mix along with adding more resources for affordable energy.

""More resources onto the grid allows more energy to be available to supply growing demand as economic development takes place across the state,"" Singh said.

He noted that while it was only an incremental step toward the state's goal of 100% clean energy by 2050, it may help serve as a model for other sites in the near future.

""It's a small part of what Peoria residents use, enough to power about 420 homes,"" Singh said. ""It's incremental to what's needed, but lots more of these types of projects are needed on the grid to be able to add more capacity, more energy to the grid. Ultimately, when supply and demand crosses, the more supply than you have demand, that's when prices will go down.""

Singh is sensitive to the impact that high energy costs have on Ameren's customers, saying that his company shares the frustration that they have toward the increased costs of keeping the lights on.

""We understand what customers are facing,"" Singh said. ""We're just as frustrated as customers about the energy crisis and the volatility we see. Ameren doesn't generate power – the state procures it through the Illinois Power Agency and we pass it on to customers with no markup. We do offer assistance in the way customers manage their bill, whether it's payment assistance, grants, level payments, etc.

""We empathize and really understand what customers are facing and we want to offer help where we can help.""

Even so, he feels that more projects such as this new solar plot will help in providing relief to frustrated customers across Illinois.

""More projects like these, more development of renewables, nuclear, energy in general across the state will be a way to solve for those issues in the long run,"" Singh said.","https://www.pjstar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/31/NJOS/85459914007-073125-amerensolar-01.jpg?crop=5736,3227,x0,y0&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-01 20:58:20.805981

For instance, BYD's Seagull model sold 440,000 units in 2024—a stark contrast to Ford's BEV sales in China, which remain modest.
Investment Considerations: Risks and Rewards For investors, Ford's BEV division presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition.
Conclusion: A Calculated Bet Ford's BEV division is in a restructuring sweet spot: it has the capital, partnerships, and strategic clarity to pivot, but execution remains uncertain.
For growth-focused investors, positions in Ford's BEV milestones (e.g., LFP battery production, platform launch) could pay off if the company meets its margin targets.","Ford's battery electric vehicle (BEV) division, often referred to as the “Model e” segment, is at a crossroads in 2025. Amid a $2.2 billion loss in the first half of the year, the automaker is recalibrating its approach to electrification—a shift that could either catalyze a breakthrough or deepen its struggles. For investors, the question is whether Ford's strategic reallocation of capital, focus on domestic production, and partnerships with Chinese automakers can translate into long-term profitability.

A High-Stakes Restructuring

Ford's BEV division has faced headwinds, including a Q2 2025 EBIT loss of $1.3 billion and a 128% surge in wholesale volumes to 60,000 units. While revenue doubled to $2.4 billion year-on-year, the EBIT margin of -56.4% underscores the financial strain. The Trump administration's tariffs have exacerbated costs, with Ford estimating a $2 billion net impact in 2025—up from $1.5 billion previously. To counter this, Ford is shifting capital expenditures from its BEV segment to its profitable Ford Pro commercial-vehicle division, a move aimed at balancing short-term cash flow with long-term electrification goals.

The company's $9 billion 2025 capital expenditure plan highlights its commitment to next-generation EVs. A lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery plant in Marshall, Michigan, is set to begin production next year, leveraging U.S. production tax credits and lower manufacturing costs. LFP batteries, cheaper and longer-lasting than traditional lithium-ion, could reduce costs by 20% per unit—a critical edge in a market dominated by Chinese automakers.

The Platform Play: A “Model-T Moment”

Ford's most ambitious move is the development of a new EV platform, dubbed a “Model-T moment” by CEO Jim Farley. Unveiled on August 11, 2025, at the Louisville Assembly Plant, the platform is designed to produce fewer but higher-margin models. This shift mirrors strategies employed by Chinese automakers like BYD and Geely, which prioritize cost efficiency and rapid innovation. Ford's “Skunk Works” team is spearheading the effort, aiming to create a low-cost EV platform that rivals Chinese competitors on price while maintaining U.S. design standards.

The platform's first product—a mid-sized EV pickup slated for 2027—will use prismatic LFP batteries from CATL, a partnership Ford hopes will bridge the gap in cost parity. Analysts argue this could be pivotal: if Ford achieves a -5% margin by 2025 and breakeven by 2026, as projected, the BEV division could become a profit engine rather than a drag.

Investor Sentiment: A Mixed Bag

Investor reactions to Ford's BEV strategy remain divided. As of May 2025, 13 analysts assigned ratings ranging from “Overweight” to “Underperform,” with an average price target of $10.37—down from $11.70 previously. Key metrics to watch include the F-150 Lightning's margin improvement (currently -5%) and the Mustang Mach-E's scalability (projected to reach 100,000 units by 2025).

While Tesla's dominance in the U.S. market (38% share in 2024) looms large, Ford's domestic production strategy and LFP battery roadmap offer a counter-narrative. The company's P/E ratio of 12.4, below its historical average, suggests undervaluation if growth projections materialize. Technical indicators, such as support levels at $10.50 and $12.75, also hint at potential for a golden cross formation if fundamentals align. However, historical data from a backtest of a similar MACD Golden Cross strategy held for 30 days from 2022 to 2025 shows underperformance, with a CAGR of -19.97% and a total loss of -53.49% compared to the market's 37.31%.

Market Positioning: Lessons from China

Ford's partnerships with Jiangling Motors and Changan Automobile in China have provided critical insights into global EV architectures. By studying Chinese automakers' agility in AI integration and supply chain efficiency, Ford aims to replicate their cost structures. For instance, BYD's Seagull model sold 440,000 units in 2024—a stark contrast to Ford's BEV sales in China, which remain modest. However, Ford's joint ventures have enabled exports of vehicles like the Territory compact SUV, which outperformed the F-150 in Mexico.

The competitive landscape is shifting: BYD's 2025 export target of 800,000 units and Geely's European expansion (via Volvo) pose challenges. Yet Ford's focus on commercial vehicles and subscription services—exemplified by its Ford Pro Intelligence platform (674,000 active subscriptions in Q1 2025)—offers a differentiation strategy.

Investment Considerations: Risks and Rewards

For investors, Ford's BEV division presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition. Key risks include:

- Tariff impacts: The $2 billion cost drag in 2025 could persist if trade policies remain hostile.

- Margin pressures: BEV margins remain negative, and scaling production to profitability is unproven.

- Competition: Tesla's innovation cycle and Chinese automakers' cost advantages are formidable.

However, opportunities abound:

- Platform innovation: The new EV platform could reduce costs and attract premium buyers.

- LFP battery adoption: Lower production costs may narrow the gap with Chinese competitors.

- Government incentives: U.S. production tax credits and the Inflation Reduction Act's EV tax credits provide tailwinds.

Conclusion: A Calculated Bet

Ford's BEV division is in a restructuring sweet spot: it has the capital, partnerships, and strategic clarity to pivot, but execution remains uncertain. For growth-focused investors, positions in Ford's BEV milestones (e.g., LFP battery production, platform launch) could pay off if the company meets its margin targets.

Since the start of the year, electricity prices have increased almost 5 percent — and in June alone, prices increased by almost a full percentage point.
Summer electricity bills are expected to be an average of $784, the highest price in at least 12 years, according to the legislators’ letter.
Experts say Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” is likely to drive up energy prices even higher.
“At the same time, the Trump Administration is cutting programs that help families afford higher electricity costs and lower their energy usage, all while utility CEOs receive massive payouts.”","Congressional lawmakers are demanding to know how the Trump administration plans to bring down energy prices as electricity bills hit record highs.

“A combination of the Administration’s regulatory decisions, the impacts of tariffs, and the Administration’s reversal of key energy investments is driving up energy bills for Americans around the country,” Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), Ed Markey (D-Massachusetts), Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) wrote in a letter to heads of several federal agencies on July 29.

Since the start of the year, electricity prices have increased almost 5 percent — and in June alone, prices increased by almost a full percentage point. Summer electricity bills are expected to be an average of $784, the highest price in at least 12 years, according to the legislators’ letter.

The lawmakers detailed several ways President Donald Trump “continues to make an already dire situation even worse.” His administration has ordered states to “keep defunct, unwanted, and unneeded coal plants open … foisting tens of millions of dollars of new maintenance and retention costs onto consumers in 15 states.”

In May, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former fracking executive, ordered Michigan to keep a coal powered plant open, just eight days before its scheduled closure. Between the end of May and June 30, it cost $29 million to comply with the secretary’s order.

An analysis by Global Witness found that companies and people with ties to the fossil fuel industry donated more than $19 million to Trump’s presidential inaugural fund. Experts say Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” is likely to drive up energy prices even higher.

“Based on Trump’s tax law and the ongoing rollbacks of environmental standards at the EPA and other agencies, by 2035, families nationwide can expect to pay up to $430 a year more on energy costs,” Natural Resources Defense Council’s editorial director, Jenny Shalant, wrote in a blog post entitled “Why Your Electricity Bill is So High.”

More than 70 million U.S. households struggle to afford their utilities and have to choose between paying their utility bill or buying necessities like food and medicine. Despite rising costs and a widespread need for assistance, the Trump administration fired all of the federal workers who administer the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) and has proposed eliminating its federal funding. The program helps approximately 6 million low-income households pay their utility bills.

“Rather than keeping his campaign promise to ‘cut the price of energy and electricity in half,’ President Trump’s shortsighted approach to energy policy is driving prices higher and doing so quickly,” the lawmakers wrote. “At the same time, the Trump Administration is cutting programs that help families afford higher electricity costs and lower their energy usage, all while utility CEOs receive massive payouts.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/2025-8-1-Trump-at-White-House.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 22:01:22.489313

The annual agricultural funding plan calls for $27 billion in discretionary funding for fiscal 2026.
Kennedy has criticized the legislative branch funding bill for its proposed spending levels.","The Senate on Friday passed its first tranche of government funding bills for fiscal year 2026 ahead of its upcoming August recess, but Congress is bracing for a potentially messy fight to prevent a shutdown when they return in September.

The chamber approved three bills that provide more than $180 billion in discretionary funding for the departments of Veterans Affairs (VA) and Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), military construction, legislative branch operations and rural development.

The bills passed in two parts: on an 87-9 vote for military construction, VA, agriculture and FDA funding; and an 81-15 vote for legislative branch funding.

The votes cap off days of uncertainty over whether the Senate would be joining the House on a monthlong recess with any of its 12 annual funding bills passed out of the chamber.

Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), who heads the subcommittee that crafted the full-year VA funding bill, said Friday that he sees the first batch of bills as more of a “test run.”

“It’s just been so long since we’ve done our appropriations bills. A lot of people just [forgot] the procedures,” he told The Hill, noting that in the previous congressional session senators “really didn’t do bills.”

Appropriators say the vote marks the first time since 2018 that the Senate has passed funding legislation before the August recess.

“It’s really a matter of just kind of legislating again, and the more we do it, the easier, the easier it’ll be as we go back,” Boozman said.

In the past week, senators had gone through several iterations of their first funding package of the year, as leaders on both sides worked through frustrations in their ranks over proposed spending levels and actions by the Trump administration that incensed Democrats.

Well over half of the funding approved Friday is included in the annual VA and military construction bill, which calls for upwards of $153 billion in discretionary funding for fiscal 2026. That includes about $133 billion for the VA and roughly $20 billion for the Department of Defense military construction program. More than $113 billion in discretionary funding would go toward VA medical care.

The annual agricultural funding plan calls for $27 billion in discretionary funding for fiscal 2026. It includes $8.2 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), about $7 billion in funding for the Food and Drug Administration, roughly $1.7 billion for rental assistance, and nearly $1.23 billion for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

Democrats have also highlighted $240 million in funding in the bill for the McGovern-Dole Food for Education program, which was targeted in President Trump’s latest budget request.

The annual legislative branch funding plan calls for about $7 billion for House and Senate operations, the U.S. Capitol Police and agencies like the Library of Congress (LOC), the Government Accountability Office, the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), and the Architect of the Capitol.

Capitol Police would see a boost under the plan, along with the CBO, while funding for the LOC, the CRS and the GAO would be kept at fiscal 2025 levels. Lawmakers also agreed to $44.5 million in emergency funds aimed at beefing up security and member protection, citing safety concerns following the shootings of Minnesota lawmakers earlier this year.

Republicans had previously been uncertain about whether the third bill would be passed as part of the package this week until Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a senior appropriator, said a deal was worked out to allow him to vote on the measure separately from the other bills. Kennedy has criticized the legislative branch funding bill for its proposed spending levels.

“It just doesn’t seem appropriate for us to be spending that much extra while everybody else has to take a cut,” he told reporters in late July. “Now, some of my colleagues point out, yes, but the extra spending is for member security.”

“If you’re going to spend extra money on member security, find a pay-for within the bill. I just think the optics are terrible and the policy is terrible,” he said. “We ought to hold ourselves to the same standard we’re holding everybody else, and that’s why I’m going to vote no.”

Republicans also blame Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s (D-Md.) resistance to the Trump administration’s relocation plans for the FBI’s headquarters for weighing down efforts to pass the annual Justice Department funding bill.

Senators had initially expected that bill, which also funds the Commerce Department and science-related agencies, to be part of the package until those plans fell apart earlier this week amid a clash over Trump administration plans to relocate the FBI headquarters.

Speaking from the Senate floor on Thursday, Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that crafted the annual funding deal, said he had been pushing for an amendment aimed at ensuring the FBI would “have a level 5 security headquarters.”

He noted his previous attempt during committee consideration that temporarily led to the adoption of an amendment to the DOJ funding bill that sought to block President Trump’s plans to keep the FBI’s headquarters in Washington, D.C. However, the change was later scrapped after staunch GOP opposition threatened to tank the bill.

“It didn’t happen because members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Republicans and Democrats, didn’t think that was the right thing to do – to preserve what we had set out before and make sure that the men and women [of the FBI] have a level 5 security headquarters,” he said. “We did it because the President of the United States was going to throw a fit if that provision stayed on.”

Van Hollen said he hopes the bill will be able to “get back on track” in September. However, Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas), chair of the subcommittee alongside Van Hollen, offered a rather gloomy outlook for the bill’s next steps after recess. He argued much of the focus in September is likely to be on getting a deal on a funding stopgap, also known as a continuing resolution (CR), to keep the government funded beyond the Sept. 30 shutdown deadline.

“When we get back from recess, we’ll move to working on the CR to get us so I would guess if the CJS has a path, it’s probably just the CR and will continue,” Moran said. “All the work that we’ve done goes away, and we’ll go back to CR and fund those agencies at the same level and same way that we did last year.”

“Every time we say we want to do appropriation bills, then there’s someone who has a reason that, ‘Not this time,’ ‘Not this one,’ ‘Not – because I didn’t get what I want,’” he said. “And this time we’re arguing over an amendment that was allowed to the senator who’s objecting, but he wanted a commitment that he get the outcome he wants.”

“And he didn’t win in committee, and he wouldn’t win on the Senate floor, but he can, I wouldn’t think, but he can make his case. But he rejected that option,” he said.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/boozmanjohn_062825gn01_w.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-02 01:00:02.257568

These areas feed directly into the renewable energy sector, where cutting-edge data, security and communication tools are now standard.","In a trade pact centred on clean energy and industrial collaboration, the UK and India have agreed a new framework designed to reshape their economic relationship.

Prime Ministers Sir Keir Starmer and Shri Narendra Modi signed the UK-India Vision 2035 agreement in Westminster this week, laying out terms that target renewable energy growth and open critical supply chains between the two countries.

The deal aims to boost bilateral trade by US$31.7bn annually, with sustainable technology, referred to in the document as climate tech, at its core. This includes solar, wind and other low-carbon solutions.

Beyond green technology, the agreement also locks in defence and aerospace contracts, financial services access and joint innovation in frontier technologies.

Trade deal opens clean tech access and supply lines

The agreement provides British climate tech companies with direct access to India’s fast-expanding renewable energy market.

For the UK, this opens not just sales opportunities but positions its manufacturers and research institutions inside India’s supply chain as the country pushes towards its energy transition goals.

India has committed to ramping up its renewable capacity over the next decade, which will rely on solar panels, battery systems, grid infrastructure and advanced turbines. The trade agreement allows British firms to supply these technologies directly and collaborate with Indian counterparts on development.

""The deal will create thousands of British jobs across the UK, unlock new opportunities for businesses and drive growth in every corner of the country, delivering on our Plan for Change,"" the PM said at the signing ceremony.

The framework includes joint research programmes in green energy and support for co-development of new systems, ensuring that UK firms are part of the innovation as well as the supply chain. Shared goals on sustainable infrastructure mean both countries are expected to invest in projects that reinforce one another’s energy transitions.

As supply chains globalise, proximity to markets and reliability of materials are key. India’s growing role as both a producer and consumer of renewable technology offers UK manufacturers and developers new resilience and scale.

Conversely, India gains access to British design, manufacturing and financial services—further integrating both economies into a sustainable model.

Aerospace contracts signal industrial scale of deal

Alongside clean energy, the agreement features industrial-scale contracts across aviation and defence sectors.

Airbus and Rolls-Royce have secured US$6.2bn in deals to supply aircraft and engines to India. This represents not only a commercial win but also signals how deep supply chains between the two countries will now extend.

More than two dozen UK companies are starting operations or expanding in India as a result of the deal, while nearly US$7.5bn in new investment and export agreements have been disclosed by Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds.

""India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and an emerging economic superpower,"" Jonathan said, highlighting the strategic value for British businesses across multiple industries.

Tariff rates for UK exports into India are set to drop from 15% to just 3% on goods like medical devices and automotive components, giving UK manufacturers wider access to a consumer base of more than 1.4 billion.

Meanwhile, Indian exporters will benefit from improved entry into UK markets, and British consumers are expected to see lower costs on a range of imported products.

Financial services are also part of the deal, with India agreeing to remove key barriers to UK investment while maintaining caps that ensure long-term stability. These changes should allow British firms to enter more partnerships and take longer-term positions in the Indian market.

Joint development in tech strengthens the alliance

The agreement comes on the first anniversary of the UK-India Technology Security Initiative, signed in July 2024. This initiative has already laid the groundwork for joint activity in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cybersecurity and space technologies. These areas feed directly into the renewable energy sector, where cutting-edge data, security and communication tools are now standard.

With grid management, battery storage and distribution increasingly reliant on advanced digital tools, the integration of frontier technologies with climate tech offers another layer of cooperation between the countries.

The UK-India Vision 2035 agreement will be ratified by Parliament in the coming weeks, with supply chain improvements expected to start rolling out immediately afterwards.

Long-term, the deal supports the UK’s post-Brexit economic positioning and places it alongside India as it rises in global influence.

Both governments describe the agreement as a long-term partnership rather than a short-term boost, with supply chain resilience, technology transfer and industrial cooperation central to its future.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/10e1b525c5dea97b358ade7e53d4c113:9f9eaf96bd3b105b0edd8de7395813d4/prime-minister-shri-narendra-modi-met-rt-hon-keir-starmer-prime-minister-of-the-united-kingdom-credit-mea.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 05:00:26.153800

PJM Interconnection, which coordinates wholesale electricity across 13 states and Washington, D.C., requested that the department issue a waiver that allows Wagner Generating Station Unit 4 to keep energy flowing when necessary to meet demand for the next 90 days.

The power plant is typically permitted to operate up to 438 hours per year when burning fuel under a consent agreement with the Maryland Department of the Environment. The plant had 80 operating hours left this year when PJM reached out to Wright last week.

“This order reduces the threat of power outages during peak demand conditions for millions of Americans,” said Wright in a statement. “The Trump Administration remains committed to swiftly deploying all available tools and authorities to safeguard the reliability, affordability, and security of the nation’s energy system.”

Wright’s Monday order argued that not running the unit could “result in adverse reliability impacts to service in the Baltimore Gas and Electric (BG&E) territory, and within PJM’s service territory more broadly”.

The unit would need to be operational, the company argued in their application, when temperatures reach about 92 degrees.

The Maryland Freedom Caucus, a group of hard-right members of the state legislature, touted the order as a win. The caucus said they had called on President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Energy, Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, and the state legislature to intervene to keep plants open, as a part of the group’s demands to prevent blackouts across the state.

Trump has made promoting energy efficiency a focus in his second administration, including declaring a National Energy Emergency through an executive order on the first day of his second term. The president has argued that the United States should be less reliant on energy from other countries.

The group’s energy demands include intervening to keep the state’s existing power plants open, repealing “green energy extremist mandates,” and ending the Maryland EmPower program — which aims to help Marylanders conserve energy — and any fees associated with it.

“…We called on Governor Moore to get started and we promise, until our energy is reliable and affordable, we won’t stop until it is accomplished,” the group said on X.

These changes take effect August 1, 2025, and are now part of the legal landscape.","Baton Rouge, LA — Starting Thursday, August 1, 2025, Louisiana will begin enforcing a wide array of new laws that will impact everything from how residents drive and vote to how they raise their kids, do business, and interact with law enforcement. Many of these laws were passed during the 2024–2025 legislative session and are now officially going into effect.

The legislation covers crime and public safety, traffic enforcement, school policies, consumer protections, and environmental regulations. While some are aimed at improving safety or closing legal loopholes, others have raised questions about enforcement and fairness.

Here’s a breakdown of the most significant changes.

🔒 CRIME & PUBLIC SAFETY

Louisiana is expanding legal protections around critical infrastructure and minors:

• Act 26 makes the theft of vital infrastructure like power lines and pipelines a felony offense.

• Act 28 criminalizes the theft of gift cards and digital redemption codes, even if done online.

• Act 97 targets predatory behavior (both online and in person) directed toward minors.

• Act 106 prohibits the sale of nitrous oxide (“whippets”) for recreational misuse, particularly to minors.

• Act 420 revises weapons laws, so firearm carriers are encouraged to review what’s now legal.

• Act 426 requires law enforcement to file written reports after any use of force.

• Act 416 expands eligibility for electronic tracking devices, like ankle monitors, to more offenders.

• Act 399 makes it a state crime to obstruct federal immigration enforcement, a move aligned with Governor Jeff Landry’s law-and-order agenda.

🎣 HUNTING, FISHING & FARMING

Outdoor enthusiasts and agricultural producers see some notable changes:

• Act 109 legalizes night frogging with firearms, a long-debated local tradition.

• Act 91 mandates that seafood dealers provide receipts and report transactions to the Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

• Act 321 introduces $20 hunting and fishing licenses for veterans and retired National Guard members.

• Act 94 protects farmers using gypsum soil amendments from lawsuits when applied under approved conditions.

🏫 EDUCATION & SCHOOL SAFETY

Several acts seek to improve both opportunity and security in Louisiana schools:

• Act 449 requires every public high school to offer career or vocational programs or connect students to such opportunities.

• Act 469 mandates mental health screenings in public schools.

• Act 425 ensures emergency responders have access to accurate school building maps.

• Act 100 bans discrimination in education based on a student’s or parent’s military service status.

🗳️ ELECTIONS & POLITICAL ACTIVITY

Election laws also get a shake-up:

• Act 4 makes it illegal to place bets on political races in Louisiana.

• Act 37 restricts exit polling to only registered media outlets, who must file with the Secretary of State.

• Act 89 allows paid political signage at public school gyms and stadiums, previously off-limits.

🚗 TRAFFIC & ENVIRONMENT

Arguably the most widely discussed update is a stricter stance on distracted driving:

• Act 288 (HB 519) bans texting and handheld phone use while driving, reinforcing penalties for distracted driving.

• Act 24 targets left-lane dawdlers — drivers going too slow in the passing lane may now face tickets or even jail time for repeat offenses.

• Act 107 limits the use of traffic cameras to school zones and establishes penalties for misuse.

• Act 95 bans the release of chemicals into the atmosphere intended to alter the weather or temperature.

• Act 325 announces the creation of a new state park in Terrebonne Parish, called Ouiski Bayou State Park.

• Acts 407 & 414 impose stricter regulations on carbon capture and storage projects in the state.

💼 CONSUMER & CIVIL LAWS

Key updates affecting business owners, tenants, and consumers:

• Act 41 bans the sale and use of Kratom, a controversial herbal supplement, statewide.

• Act 406 makes it a crime to alter insurance estimates without appropriate disclosure.

• Act 465 limits how insurance companies can use your credit score when setting rates.

• Act 100 extends military status protections across housing, employment, and education.

• Act 110 makes contributions to ABLE accounts (for people with disabilities) state tax-exempt.

✅ BOTTOM LINE

Whether you’re a parent, driver, student, veteran, or small business owner, there’s a good chance one of these laws affects your daily life. Some represent long-awaited reforms. Others bring up new questions — especially around enforcement, privacy, and practical impact.

Louisianans are encouraged to stay informed, ask questions, and speak up. These changes take effect August 1, 2025, and are now part of the legal landscape.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/688be8976ac4d4001e5ab93b.jpg",N,,2025-08-02 05:00:41.509494

According to the latest data, in 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy.
The home generates as much energy as it consumes, and all the energy generated is clean and renewable, with no polluting fossil fuels.
""My whole goal of my career has been to understand and solve large-scale air pollution and climate problems through clean renewable energy systems,"" Jacobson said.

Last month, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that the Golden State had reached a historic milestone. According to the latest data, in 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy.

A leading climate scientist not only believes the state is heading in the right direction, but he also practices what he preaches. Mark Z. Jacobson, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, lives in a two-story, 3,200 square-foot home with large picture windows that to any passerby might appear prohibitively expensive to heat and cool. But, it's not.

""To run it, it costs nothing. I have not paid an electric bill in eight years,"" Jacobson said.

Jacobson built from scratch what's called a ""zero net energy house."" It's all-electric with no gas on the property. The home generates as much energy as it consumes, and all the energy generated is clean and renewable, with no polluting fossil fuels.

""My whole goal of my career has been to understand and solve large-scale air pollution and climate problems through clean renewable energy systems,"" Jacobson said.

The house is a light steel frame structure with airtight insulation. On the roof are solar panels. In the garage, he installed a home battery system.

""I'm generating my electricity with solar on the roof, and that solar generates during the day, peaks at about noon, and there's a lot of excess,"" Jacobson said. ""I mean, I use a lot less energy than I produce, and so that energy first gets stored in batteries. And then that excess beyond that gets sent to the grid.""

As for California's electric grid, it's undergoing a major transition to clean, renewable sources. According to California ISO, since 2021, about 25,000 megawatts of renewables have been added to the supply. That's enough to power nearly a quarter-million homes.

Jacobson's research shows that, so far this year, California has run on 100% wind, water, and solar for 164 of 209 days and for an average of 4.8 hours a day.

""So, wind, water and solar this year has supplied 57.4% of all of California's electricity,"" added Jacobson. ""And that's an increase from about 53% last year, and 48% the previous year.""

Those calculations, as well as Cal ISO's data, don't include private homes equipped with solar and battery systems.

""These are sufficient to provide electricity for my home from solar for 24 hours a day for most of the year,"" said Jacobson, as he gestured to his garage Powerwall.

Jacobson also drives electric vehicles. In addition, he uses energy-efficient electrical devices.

""Electricity is the future for everything. It's much more efficient. It's cleaner and it's cheaper, and it does far less damage to the environment than gas or other types of fossil fuels,"" he said.

Among his devices: an induction stove which uses 60% less energy than gas, and a heat pump that transfers heat between the indoors and outdoors. Jacobson's heat pump uses a ductless ""mini split"" model that uses 75% less energy than a gas heater because, as he explained, it doesn't create the heat. The pump simply moves it around.

As for hot water, the home uses a heat pump electric water heater. The temperature was set at 129 degrees Fahrenheit.

""It's got plenty of water for showers, and it reheats pretty rapidly,"" he said.

Jacobson received a 30% federal tax credit and a state subsidy when he installed his system. He has generated about 120% of what he has used on average and sold the extra 20% back to the grid under the net metering program.

He is also studying his home and collecting data to use in a class that he teaches. He has also published the data in a textbook with the goal of informing others about a combustion-free future.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/01/fcaee89f-883e-4afd-bf54-2bd06e145cd6/thumbnail/1200x630/ace86ea8b7856facfe092bfe2a82bce5/f8c538f268b05acedfae44c38a82cd6f.jpg,N,,2025-08-02 05:59:02.873720

As these elements align, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry will be poised for exponential growth, enabling aviation to meet its climate goals and reshaping the future of flight.","SAF Commitments and Trends in North America

North American airlines have emerged as pioneers in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry. Their leadership is visible in long-term SAF offtake agreements, early infrastructure deployment, and corporate partnerships that foster demand aggregation. As of 2025, five major carriers United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Air Canada, and JetBlue have committed to substantial SAF volumes, illustrating the increasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size in the region.

United Airlines leads the charge with a total of 2.9 billion gallons in SAF commitments. Notably, a landmark 1 billion gallon agreement with Cemvita marks a shift toward synthetic fuel pathways. United plans to use 10 million gallons of SAF in 2025, tripling its 2022 volume.

Delta Air Lines has secured offtake agreements totaling 910 million gallons 525 million from Gevo and 385 million from DG Fuels targeting a 5% SAF blend by 2030.

American Airlines has inked deals worth 620 million gallons through 2030. Its partnerships with Aemetis and Gevo include annual deliveries beginning in 2024, reinforcing its strategic SAF ambitions.

Air Canada will deploy 77.6 million liters (20.5 million US gallons) of Neste SAF in 2025, representing 1% of its fuel consumption, with further growth expected under Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations.

JetBlue, while smaller in scope, has launched a 1 million gallon per year SAF program at JFK, marking the first regular SAF supply at that major hub.

These examples reflect growing Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share among North American airlines.

Barriers to Scaling SAF

Despite remarkable progress, the SAF Industry faces systemic barriers that hinder broader adoption. Chief among them are cost premiums, feedstock limitations, infrastructure inadequacies, and inconsistent policy frameworks.

SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel often 2 to 5 times the cost. In Europe, SAF blending mandates are projected to add $1.7 billion in airline costs in 2025 alone. These price disparities reduce competitiveness, especially for carriers operating on tight margins.

Feedstock availability poses another critical challenge. Most SAF today is produced using the HEFA pathway, reliant on used cooking oil and animal fats. However, this feedstock stream is expected to plateau at 2 million tonnes by 2030. Advanced feedstocks like municipal solid waste and cellulosic biomass require intricate logistics and higher processing costs.

Infrastructure remains a bottleneck. Only 25% of North American airports are SAF-capable, and retrofitting facilities is capital intensive. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market cannot scale unless distribution and blending infrastructure is widely available.

Finally, regulatory fragmentation further complicates progress. The U.S. SAF Grand Challenge sets ambitious voluntary goals, but lacks federal blending mandates. Tax credits under Section 45Z expire between 2024–2027, creating long-term uncertainty. Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations are more prescriptive, requiring 1 billion liters of SAF by 2030, but regional differences remain.

Opportunities for Acceleration

Despite these challenges, significant opportunities exist to catalyze SAF Market growth across North America.

Emerging SAF pathways, such as Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), promise dramatic lifecycle emissions reductions. United Airlines is investing in Twelve’s CO2-to-fuel technology, which can reduce emissions by up to 90%. DG Fuels is developing timber waste-to-SAF conversion plants with 85% reduction potential.

Corporate demand aggregation is gaining traction. Programs like Eco-Skies Alliance enable cargo and logistics companies (e.g., SEKO Logistics) to co-invest in SAF, creating reliable demand pools and de-risking project financing.

Policy incentives are proving effective. California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits and Michigan’s $1.50/gallon SAF tax credit stimulate regional production and feedstock utilization, helping to expand Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share.

Technological integration also supports scaling. Companies like LanzaJet are deploying modular ATJ facilities to lower capital expenditure. Digital platforms, such as SAFc-Registry powered by Chooose, streamline SAF transaction certification and traceability.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

North American policy is evolving to support the SAF Industry, but further alignment is needed to create long-term stability.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge outlines a goal of 3 billion gallons of annual SAF production by 2030, scaling to 35 billion by 2050. The Inflation Reduction Act offers Section 45Z tax credits of $1.25–$1.75/gallon, contingent on emissions reductions of over 50%.

State-level programs complement federal efforts. California’s LCFS rewards carbon intensity reductions, while Michigan offers per-gallon credits to SAF producers. However, without a federal mandate, airlines and producers still face demand uncertainty.

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations offer more structured targets: 1 billion liters by 2030 (approximately 10% of aviation fuel) and up to 25% by 2035. Provincial mandates and incentives further support regional development, boosting Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Trends.

Airline Leading Company Profiles

United Airlines: With a 2.9 billion gallon SAF commitment, United has invested in innovative platforms including Cemvita and Twelve. The airline will use 10 million gallons of SAF in 2025 and is scaling PtL facilities like AirPlant One.

Delta Air Lines: Delta’s 910 million gallon SAF offtake from Gevo and DG Fuels supports its 5% blending target by 2030. Projects focus on cellulosic feedstocks and Alcohol-to-Jet conversion.

American Airlines: With 620 million gallons committed through Aemetis and Gevo, American is exploring E-SAF pathways from CO2 via Infinium, supported by Breakthrough Energy Ventures.

Air Canada: A 20.5 million gallon SAF purchase from Neste marks a major milestone. The airline integrates SAF pipeline delivery to YVR and adheres to ISCC sustainability certifications.

JetBlue Airways: Operating the first regular JFK SAF supply through a 1 million gallon/year partnership with Valero and World Fuel Services, JetBlue also promotes corporate sustainability programs.

Strategic Recommendations

To expand the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size and achieve net-zero aviation by 2050, coordinated efforts are required:

Establish a federal blending mandate in the U.S., starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling to 10% by 2030. This would create predictable demand and incentivize private investment.

Extend and expand tax incentives under Section 45Z and explore Contracts for Difference (CfDs) to reduce financial risk for producers.

Invest in advanced feedstocks such as cellulosic biomass, algae, and direct air capture through grants and tax credit mechanisms.

Fund infrastructure retrofits at major hubs to enhance SAF blending and storage capabilities.

Strengthen partnerships between airlines, SAF producers, and corporations to promote collaborative offtake agreements and boost Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share.

Fueling the Future of Flight

North American airlines are setting the global pace in the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. Through bold commitments, innovative partnerships, and policy advocacy, they are building the foundation for a low-carbon aviation sector. Yet realizing the full potential of the SAF Market depends on overcoming high costs, scaling feedstock supply, harmonizing policy, and upgrading infrastructure. As these elements align, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry will be poised for exponential growth, enabling aviation to meet its climate goals and reshaping the future of flight.

""Europe needs more compute to realize the full potential of AI for all Europeans — from developers and researchers to startups and scientists — and we want to help make that happen,"" said Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, in a statement. ""I've always said we'd love to bring Stargate to Europe if the conditions are right, and we think we've found that in Narvik with clean, affordable energy, ideal climate, and great partners in Nscale and Aker. Stargate Norway will help provide the compute power to drive the next wave of AI breakthroughs and economic progress for Europe, in Europe.""

Staggering numbers in computing and power generation

The partners say Stargate Norway will soon generate 230 MW of AI-enabled data capacity—eventually aiming for 520 MW—and be completely powered by renewable energy in the region. The computing power will be enabled by 100,000 NVIDIA graphic processing units by 2026, according to reports.

Global AI infrastructure firm Nscale will design and build Stargate Norway, while the center will be owned equally by Nscale and Norwegian investment firm Aker in a planned joint venture. Both NScale and Aker so far have contributed $1 billion each to the early 20-MW phase of the project.

“Delivering one of the first European AI Gigafactory to market is a strategic milestone for the region and boosts its role in the global AI landscape,"" said Josh Payne, CEO of Nscale. ""Sovereign, scalable and sustainable infrastructure is now essential to remain competitive. We're proud to partner with Aker, drawing on the team's extensive experience and impressive track record, to deliver a new generation of AI economic and productivity growth in Europe. Together, we are combining OpenAI's leading models with Nscale's vertically integrated AI cloud, to provide the sustainable infrastructure necessary to support public benefit, build industrial resilience and enable long-term regional innovation.""

The American Stargate AI Initiative

While creating a strong network of AI data centers in the western world is a priority in Europe, In the U.S., President Trump and business leaders also are pushing there to create infrastructure expanding AI capacity and leading the technology globally. Earlier this year, President Trump announced a U.S.-based “Stargate Project” with OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX as lead investors in the initial $100 billion initiative which is expected to reach $500 billion.

The energy demand is enormous to feed these processing units and training models in action, and the president has vowed to make emergency declarations to spur more baseload-level power whether it’s natural gas or nuclear.

“We have to get this stuff built. They have to produce a lot of electricity, and we’ll make it possible for them to get that production done very easily,” Trump said as quoted in Scientific American.

Last month, the Trump Administration’s Department of Energy announced it was inviting private sector partnerships to connect AI capacity and power generation on four federal land locations. Those sites include Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee, the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Kentucky and Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

""By leveraging DOE land assets for the deployment of AI and energy infrastructure, we are taking a bold step to accelerate the next Manhattan Project—ensuring U.S. AI and energy leadership,” Chris Wright, Secretary of Energy, referring to the scientific collaboration which developed the first atomic bomb during World War II, said when the DOE federal land project was announced last month. “These sites are uniquely positioned to host data centers as well as power generation to bolster grid reliability, strengthen our national security, and reduce energy costs.”

Back to Norway and the Global Rise of the Industrial Compute Age

Stargate Norway, led by OpenAI’s technology, is designed to spearhead AI-enabled technology advances in Europe, but also collaborate with local and regional academic institutions to advance AI research and development in northern Norway.

""Norway has a proud history of turning clean, renewable energy into industrial value, powering global industries like aluminium and fertiliser,"" said Øyvind Eriksen, President & CEO of Aker. ""Today, artificial intelligence and advanced data operations represent the next wave of value creation. Northern Norway, with its surplus of clean energy, available capacity, and industrial readiness, is the ideal launchpad for this transformation. As data centers shift from cost centers to value-generating assets, Norway's energy advantage becomes a catalyst for the next generation of digital industry.""

The race to lead in AI—a technology which promises untold computing power—is considered critical in many nations, including China. In an earlier EnergyTech story, Everett Thompson, a longtime data center and real estate development player and founder and CEO of WiredRE, said the world is entering a new “Industrial Compute Age,” as he called it, and the criticality of succeeding at AI was unprecedented.

“Enterprise data centers are going away, and everybody is using the cloud; it’s a very fascinating time,” Thompson said. “There will be some swings and misses, but no question the genie is out of the bottle and we’re in an Industrial Compute Age.

“It’s hard to imagine that’s going to stop,” he added. “Quantum computing is coming faster than people expected, and it could be a wonderful stairstep, changing the relationship between computing and power in a positive way.”

Big data, Big Money

Digital infrastructure’s leading firms are putting money where they believe the future is. Google is investing close to $75 billion on AI infrastructure alone, while Apple plans to spend $500 billion on manufacturing AI capacity and data centers in the U.S. before the end of this decade.

OpenAi creates AI technology such as the GPT family of large language training models. Microsoft, which is signing numerous power purchase agreements to expand nuclear power generation in the U.S. to help meet data center demand, is a key investor in OpenAI with about $13 billion.

OpenAI was founded 10 years ago by Altman, Elon Musk as co-chairs with others in the founding group. “Deep learning” AI, of which OpenAI is intensely involved, is a part of machine learning which operates within multilayered artificial neural networks to extract and process deeply embedded classification, regression and representation learning models.

The Saint Rest + Food to Share Hub has been recognized as a national model for revitalization of contaminated or underused properties. Once home to a bakery, gas station and meatpacking plant, the 6,800-square-foot warehouse stood vacant for years due to contamination and structural decline. With $1.5 million in funding from Transform Fresno, a Round 1 recipient of the TCC program, Saint Rest Baptist Church led efforts to turn the site into a vibrant community food hub.

The EPA’s Brownfields Program, which helps communities safely clean up and reuse properties that may be contaminated with hazardous substances, provided technical assistance and supported environmental assessments, cleanup and planning. The full project costs reached more than $6 million, with contributions from federal, state, local and philanthropic partners.

The hub officially opened in May 2024 and now serves as a food recovery and distribution center. It offers nutrition education, cooking classes and monthly markets. The project has created 51 local jobs and supports ongoing programs that improve access to healthy food for families in the region.

“This is about more than food. It’s about restoring dignity,” said Pastor D.J. Criner of Saint Rest Baptist Church in an interview with EPA’s Brownfields Program.

Repealing the finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said Tuesday.
“There are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,” Zeldin said on the conservative “Ruthless” podcast.
“The car companies were making large investments in producing and marketing electric vehicles,” explained Goffman.
And so that’s a really devastating problem for California.” The EPA proposal must go through a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it is finalized, likely next year.","President Donald Trump’s administration this week proposed revoking a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.

The proposed Environmental Protection Agency rule would rescind the 2009 declaration that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The “endangerment finding” is the legal underpinning of a host of climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.

Repealing the finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said Tuesday.

“There are people who, in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,” Zeldin said on the conservative “Ruthless” podcast. “They created this endangerment finding, and then they are able to put all these regulations on vehicles, on airplanes, on stationary sources, to basically regulate out of existence, in many cases, a lot of segments of our economy. And it cost Americans a lot of money.”

But Joe Goffman, the former Assistant Administrator of the Office of Air and Radiation at the EPA under President Joe Biden, said that while Zeldin claims rolling back the Endangerment Finding would drive down costs, it will likely do the opposite.

“The car companies were making large investments in producing and marketing electric vehicles,” explained Goffman. “What the agency is trying to do here by taking these standards away is sort of pull the rug out from under those investments. And as a result, there are going to be fewer electric vehicles being sold, and that means that — whereas a year ago, consumers thought they could look forward to more — they’re now going to have less choice.”

Goffman also charges that it will drive up costs for consumers. His source? The EPA’s own regulatory impact analysis.

“Costs go up because it is more expensive to maintain an internal combustion engine than an EV and also because consumers remain at the mercy of gasoline prices,” he explained. “Unless you’re seeing a miraculously low, long-lasting reduction in the price of gasoline, it’s going to be more expensive to operate a new car if you don’t have the option of that car being an electric vehicle.”

The latest proposal from the EPA comes after California was dealt a devastating blow earlier this summer when Republicans in Congress revoked the state’s ability to set tougher emissions standards than those set by the federal government. Without a federal backstop, Goffman says air quality, particularly in Southern California, could deteriorate.

“Going all the way back to not President Ronald Reagan, but Gov. Ronald Reagan, California has been dealing with unusually bad air quality, particularly in Southern California,” he said. “The most recent program, which Congress just blocked, was not just a climate program. It was an air quality program as well. Because when you replace an internal combustion engine with an electric vehicle, or you require the internal combustion engine to operate more efficiently, you reduce pollutants across the board, not just greenhouse gases. And so that’s a really devastating problem for California.”

The EPA proposal must go through a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it is finalized, likely next year. The public comment window is open now through Sept. 15, 2025, and those wishing to contribute can do so via email, written letter, as well as through public hearings scheduled for Aug. 19 and 20, 2025.

While lithium-ion batteries were invented in the United States, China has been outpacing the nation in terms of both battery manufacturing and technological innovations.
The domestic battery industry had been gaining considerable ground under the Biden administration thanks to major incentives including the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act.
But the overall impact of recent political shifts are still unclear, and overall the domestic clean energy sector is still growing.
More likely, it will cause an extreme contraction of the domestic battery sector at a time when Beijing was already pulling away.","Trump-era clean energy policies are slamming the breaks on the United States’ battery war with China. While lithium-ion batteries were invented in the United States, China has been outpacing the nation in terms of both battery manufacturing and technological innovations. But while U.S. companies have been scrambling to keep up, gutted clean energy incentives and tariffs on critical materials have made a U.S. victory all but impossible.

The domestic battery industry had been gaining considerable ground under the Biden administration thanks to major incentives including the sweeping Inflation Reduction Act. Tax credits, in particular, “helped close the price gap between U.S.-made batteries and those made in China, the world’s main supplier of lithium-ion battery modules, cells, and materials,” according to Canary Media.

Realizing that the Trump administration would bring a less encouraging policy environment for clean energy technologies, makers of lithium-ion batteries promised the federal government that they would collectively spend a cumulative $100 billion by 2030 to build up an independent and totally domestic grid battery industry. In exchange, they asked for continued political support.

So far, that plea seems to be falling flat. Just this month, the Trump administration accused Chinese suppliers of dumping graphite into U.S. markets – meaning that they are selling graphite more cheaply abroad than in their own markets. As a result, the United States has imposed a formidable 93.5 percent tariff on Chinese graphite. This could have immediate and serious consequences for United States batterymakers, as almost all refined graphite in the world comes from China. In fact, this tariff alone could “easily add $1,000 or more to the price of a battery” according to the New York Times.

As a result, the nation’s once-thriving “battery belt” is faltering. “Projects are being paused, cancelled, and closed at a rate 6 times more than during the same period in 2024,” reports “The Big Green Machine,” a site affiliated with Wellesley College that tracks domestic clean energy investments. And this biggest projects are the ones suffering most.

Politico reports that “prospects dimmed for 34 projects that are worth more than $31 billion and were expected to create almost 28,000 jobs.” This includes projects that are either paused, canceled, delayed by at least six faced by a slash in funding, or scaled down. But the overall impact of recent political shifts are still unclear, and overall the domestic clean energy sector is still growing.

“The policies Republicans have passed are so recent that they may not have worked their way through the economy,” reports Politico. “In the last three months, Congress has passed and President Donald Trump has signed bills that removed key tax credits, taken the teeth out of fuel-economy rules and neutered California’s ability to force automakers to sell EVs.”

Taken together, all of these compounding policy measures create an uncertain policy and investment environment at minimum. More likely, it will cause an extreme contraction of the domestic battery sector at a time when Beijing was already pulling away.

""Unquestionably, the Chinese are ahead in manufacturing technology,"" Bob Galyen, a retired executive who worked with both GM and the Chinese battery giant CATL, told NPR. He says that Chinese battery research and development is receiving major influxes of cash at a time when U.S. manufacturers are struggling for funding. ""Clearly, the U.S. is lagging behind,” he finished.

Ironically, these measures are hitting Republican districts the hardest. The so-called “battery belt” is mostly comprised of red states. As a result, according to Politico, “GOP districts saw 60 percent of the funding decline, while Democratic districts saw 39 percent.”

A confluence of bipartisan legislation, executive action, and market dynamics is reshaping the nuclear sector, positioning it as a cornerstone of decarbonization. At the heart of this transformation lies the INSPECT Act (H.R. 5115), reintroduced in 2025, which mandates enhanced oversight of decommissioned nuclear plants. This act, alongside broader policy shifts, is not only addressing safety concerns but also unlocking new investment opportunities for forward-looking clean energy investors.

A Policy Pivot: The INSPECT Act and Enhanced Oversight

The Increasing Nuclear Safety Protocols for Extended Canister Transfers Act (H.R. 5115) requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to station resident inspectors at decommissioned nuclear plants until spent fuel is fully transferred to dry cask storage. This measure, born from incidents like the near-canister drop at San Onofre in 2018, aims to eliminate gaps in oversight during the extended decommissioning process. By ensuring continuous monitoring, the act reduces the risk of accidents and environmental harm, fostering public trust—a critical factor for attracting private capital.

The bipartisan nature of the bill—sponsored by Democrats and Republicans alike—reflects a rare consensus on the need for modernized nuclear regulation. It aligns with broader efforts to streamline permitting and licensing for advanced reactors, as outlined in President Trump's May 2025 executive orders. These directives target a tripling of U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050, emphasizing small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors as key to decarbonization and national security.

Market Implications: From Decommissioning to Next-Gen Reactors

The INSPECT Act's focus on decommissioning creates immediate opportunities in infrastructure and compliance. Companies like Holtec International, which is managing the Indian Point decommissioning project, stand to benefit from increased demand for spent fuel management and site remediation. Similarly, firms specializing in robotics and automation—such as those developing AI-driven safety systems—could see a surge in contracts for fuel transfer operations.

Beyond decommissioning, the act complements the rise of SMRs and microreactors. For instance, NuScale Power, a leader in SMR design, has gained traction under federal incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The recent executive orders further accelerate this trend, with states like Indiana offering tax credits and cost-pass-through mechanisms to reduce financial risk for utilities.

Investors should also consider the ripple effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025, which preserved IRA-era tax credits for nuclear projects while introducing restrictions on foreign entities of concern (FEOCs). While these rules add complexity, they also create a more level playing field for domestic firms. For example, Westinghouse, whose AP1000 reactors are in demand in Asia, may see a boost from the U.S. government's renewed focus on nuclear exports.

Strategic Opportunities for Investors

Infrastructure and Compliance Tech: The decommissioning sector is a short-term growth driver. Look to firms providing robotics, blockchain-based tracking systems for spent fuel, or AI-driven safety simulations.

SMR Developers: Companies like NuScale and TerraPower (backed by Warren Buffett) are positioned to benefit from streamlined licensing and state-level incentives.

Regulatory Compliance Firms: As the INSPECT Act tightens oversight, consultancies offering risk assessment and environmental monitoring services—such as Burns & McDonnell—will see increased demand.

MLPs and Tax-Advantaged Structures: The 2025 act's allowance for nuclear facilities to be structured as master limited partnerships (MLPs) opens new avenues for public investment, though investors must act quickly before tax credits phase out in 2034.

Navigating Risks and Regulatory Shifts

While the policy landscape is favorable, investors must remain vigilant. The FEOC restrictions under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act require careful due diligence to ensure eligibility for tax credits. Additionally, the accelerated phase-out of the Clean Electricity PTC and ITC by 2034 creates urgency for project developers.

The July 2025 executive order tightening ""begun construction"" standards for tax credits further complicates timing. Investors should prioritize projects with clear permitting timelines and leverage state-level incentives, such as Indiana's HB 1007, to mitigate federal uncertainty.

Conclusion: A New Era for Nuclear Energy

The INSPECT Act is more than a safety measure—it is a catalyst for reshaping the nuclear industry. By addressing decommissioning risks, streamlining regulations, and aligning with federal and state-level goals, it paves the way for a sustainable energy future. For investors, the path forward lies in balancing short-term infrastructure plays with long-term bets on advanced reactor technologies. As the U.S. aims to double its nuclear capacity by 2050, the sector offers a compelling mix of policy-driven growth and technological innovation.

In this new era, the question is not whether nuclear energy will play a role in decarbonization—but how quickly investors can position themselves to capitalize on its resurgence.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-01 20:01:42.347557

Hello and welcome to Eco Report.

In today’s feature report, we will listen to Part 2 with WFHB Environmental Correspondent Max Jancich as he speaks with Greg Olsen, Field Projects Director at the Sand County Foundation. Olsen discussed prairie strips, a conservation practice that integrates prairie ecosystems into 10-20 percent of farmland to improve water quality and soil health.

And now for your environmental reports:

Indiana will no longer move forward with its plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which means Indiana is no longer moving forward with its climate action plan. Now that both the federal and state governments aren’t leading climate efforts, the challenge of addressing climate change in Indiana mostly falls to local governments.

After the Trump administration announced it would cancel a $4.9 billion federal loan guarantee for the massive Grain Belt Express transmission project, developer Invenergy indicates the plan would move forward with private financing. This project has been underway for two decades. It would bring power from wind turbines in western Kansas to Indiana and all the way to the East Coast. It would strengthen the grid enormously.

The United Nations’ highest court last week told wealthy countries they must comply with their international commitments to curb pollution or risk having to pay compensation to nations hard hit by climate change.

There’s a sharp decline in staffing levels across the National Park System since January 2025. Since the Trump administration took office, the National Park Service has lost 24% of its permanent staff, a staggering reduction that has left parks across the country scrambling to operate with bare-bones crews.

So far, 2025 has been a mixed bag for EV sales in the U.S. A record 607,089 EVs left the lot in the first six months of the year, Cox Automotive reports, but sales in the second quarter were still lower than in Quarter 2 2024.

Rising power demand and necessary upgrades to outdated grid infrastructure are increasing electric rates across the country, with little relief in sight. Power price increases are set to worsen for Ohio customers in the territory of grid operator PJM, where future prices jumped 22% in a recent capacity auction.

Norway just built a floating greenhouse that grows food, farms fish, and makes clean energy — all in the open ocean. Off the rugged fjords of Norway, a strange new structure drifts quietly on the waves. From afar, it resembles a massive water lily — its circular platforms blooming with green leaves, solar panels, and translucent domes. But this is no tourist attraction. It’s “Ocean Bloom,” Norway’s latest marine innovation: a self-sustaining floating farm that produces vegetables, fish, freshwater, and clean.

As you know, plastics are absolutely everywhere, and that’s bad news for human health. Plastics contain over 16,000 chemicals, many of which remain undisclosed, untested, and unproven to be safe for human health. As plastics shed microplastics, these chemicals leach into our food, air, and water, putting the health and safety of our families at risk.

Feature Report:

And now, in Part 2, we turn to Max Jancich as he talks with Greg Olsen, Field Projects Director at the Sand County Foundation about prairie strips.

And now for some upcoming events:

Enjoy a Fossil Discovery and Geology Hike at McCormick’s Creek State Park on Saturday, August 2nd, from 10 to 11:30 am. Hike the rugged Trail 3 to scramble through rocks to learn about fossils and how the canyon was formed. Meet at the Canyon Inn.

Learn about Hungry, Hungry Fish at the Paynetown State Recreation Area at Monroe Lake on Saturday, August 2nd, from 2 to 3:30 pm. Meet at the Deer Run Playground to discover what fish like to eat and make a fish clip.

Learn about Slimy Salamanders at McCormick’s Creek State Park on Sunday, August 3rd, from 3 to 4 pm in the Nature Center. Find out why salamanders are slimy and how it helps them survive.

Take a Creek Walk at Brown County State Park on Thursday, August 7th, from 3 to 4 pm. Meet at the Strahl Lake Parking lot to walk along the creek and learn how to identify clean and healthy water.

Virginia solar installers are bracing for the rollback of the federal rooftop solar tax credit and a potential decision from state regulators to allow Appalachian Power and Dominion Energy to reduce net metering rates.

Albemarle County now allows solar installations without permission as long as they are smaller than 500 square feet. In the rural area, solar installations could be on as much as 21 acres without approval, unless more than 10 acres of forest or prime farmland would be disturbed.

Dominion Energy’s latest long-range resource plan stops at 2039 without addressing how it will meet the state’s 2045 deadline for achieving 100% carbon-free electricity. The utility commission called the 15-year forecast flawed but ​“legally sufficient,” ordering major changes for the next one due in 2026.

A Virginia regional planning commission’s “Fight the Flood” program connects local property owners with practical solutions to flooding and other problems that stem from climate change and sinking land.

Our Climate Crisis

Intense downpours like those in Texas are more frequent, but where they occur and whether they cause catastrophic flooding is largely a matter of chance. Even so, a warming atmosphere and oceans due to the burning of fossil fuels make catastrophic storms more likely.

In less than a week in July, there were at least four 1-in-1,000-year rainfall events across the U.S.—intense deluges that are thought to have roughly a 0.1% chance of happening in any given year. First the river rose in Texas, then, the rains fell hard over North Carolina, New Mexico and Illinois. This is clear evidence that climate change is accelerating.

The extreme rainfall that occurred in the U.S. Northeast in July will likely occur more often in the future as a result of climate change, research shows. This region has experienced the largest regional increase of extreme precipitation with a 60% increase in recent decades.

The January wildfires in Los Angeles County caused $65 billion in damages, making them the costliest fires in U.S. history and reshaping expectations for wildfire season. Weather whiplash is shifting fire season patterns, as climate extremes accelerate vegetation growth and then fuel catastrophic fires.

Turkey has been hit by a record high temperature of 122.9 degrees Fahrenheit as southeastern Europe reels under a heat wave. This heat exacerbated by strong winds and dry conditions, has led to dozens of wildfires across the country.

Politics and Policy

The Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a proposal to rescind the 2009 landmark legal opinion that underpins virtually all of its regulations to curb climate change. Administrator Lee Zeldin argues that Congress, in the Clean Air Act, does not give the agency the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

In a self-inflicted tragedy, Congress passed Trump’s so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” that deeply cuts America’s social safety net and decimates our country’s only federal climate strategy.

Trump’s ​“Big Beautiful Bill” tethers the US to the past by taking a sledgehammer to key pieces of American industrial policy, threatening the development of clean energy, which has become a vital 21st century technology. Jobs will be lost, energy will get more expensive, and billions more tons of carbon dioxide will escape into the atmosphere.

China and the European Union, pledged to work together to slow down planetary heating as they together called the Paris Agreement “the cornerstone of international climate cooperation.”

The Trump administration has halted the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s effort to model future rainfall extremes linked to climate change, leaving cities and engineers without critical data as storms intensify nationwide.

Climate change data is being erased from U.S. government websites. The Trump administration has dismantled key climate science programs, removed publicly accessible reports, and cut research funding, as it moves to calculated data suppression.

Brazil’s increasingly powerful Congress passed a bill that weakens the country’s environmental licensing framework amid a political crisis with President Lula da Silva. Environmentalists have dubbed it the ‘devastation bill’ and see it as a major environmental setback.

Energy

The UN reports that renewable energy has passed a “positive tipping point” where solar and wind power will become even cheaper and more widespread. The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower. Solar power now is 41% cheaper and wind power is 53% cheaper globally than the lowest-cost fossil fuel.

Electric vehicles will decimate big oil even without U.S. tax credits. They are already displacing millions of barrels of oil per day globally and oil demand is expected to fall spectacularly over the next decade. Countries without their own oil reserves are especially eager to get out from under the thumb of big oil.

Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The swift turnover is the result of policies aimed at leveraging Nepal’s wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and clearing urban smog.

Google’s carbon emissions went up by 65% between 2019 and 2024. In 2021, the company set a lofty goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. In the years since then, it has moved in the opposite direction as it invests in energy-intensive artificial intelligence.

Dean Solon, the self-made solar billionaire, is forging ahead with a new U.S. solar and battery manufacturing business, despite tariff uncertainty and the loss of tax credits.

Solar and wind made up 95.7% of new US power generating capacity in first third of 2025. Natural gas provided just 4.2%; the remaining 0.1% came from oil.

Record volumes of solar helped to keep Europe’s electricity grids stable through a heatwave in late June and early July.

It’s been a bad several months for the U.S. energy transition but the global transition moves on. Wind and solar capacity overtook coal and gas in China in the first quarter of 2025. Solar was the largest source of electricity in the European Union in June. And, across the entire world, $2 is now invested in clean energy, efficiency, and the grid for every $1 invested in fossil fuels.

India has hit its target for 50% of its installed electricity generating capacity to come from non-fossil fuel sources five years early.

Over 37,000 residential batteries are being put to work in Puerto Rico as the island’s electric grid faces a summer of high temperatures and energy shortfalls. The home batteries are being used to prevent rolling blackouts when demand spikes and power plants can’t keep up.

Food and Agriculture

Residents in California’s Central Valley are pushing back against a state-backed program that incentivizes methane digesters at industrial dairies, arguing it locks in pollution and worsens environmental health in poor communities, while benefiting Big Oil.

Ugandan farmers are turning to agroforestry and Indigenous planting to protect their land and livelihoods and to fight deadly landslides and climate change.

Climate Justice

Brazil chose Belem, a high-poverty Amazon city, for the UN COP30 climate summit this fall to spotlight deforestation and inequality rather than hide them behind tourist destinations.

Mahi G, an Indian rapper, is spitting bars about climate justice, caste, and Indigenous rights. “The one whose sweat builds your house himself wanders homeless,” she raps in Hindi. “But who cares about the one who died working for you in the sun?”

Ancient Himalayan villages in Nepal need to relocate as climate shifts reshape daily life. Declining snowfall and retreating glaciers cause springs and canals to vanish and when it does rain, the water comes all at once, flooding fields and melting away the mud homes.

Catholic bishops from Asia, Africa and Latin America demanded climate justice for the parts of the world most affected by rising temperatures, in a first-ever joint ecological appeal.

Zohran Mamdani, who won New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, has built a political platform that connects environmental justice to housing, utility costs, and school infrastructure, aiming to reshape how the city tackles climate and inequality. He says, “Climate and quality of life are not two separate concerns. They are, in fact, one and the same.”

Jeff Bezo’s $500 million superyacht comes with all kinds of luxuries: a pool, gym, a private helicopter, and even a private submarine. Its carbon emissions are comparable to that of a small coal-fired power plant.

In South Memphis, an area long plagued by air pollution, Elon Musk’s massive AI data center called the “Colossus” is powered by the illegal operation of 35 gas-fueled turbines.

Climate Action

Climate activist and Buddhism scholar Joanna Macy, who died last month, leaves behind a blueprint for overcoming climate despair and anxiety. She says that we will not be able to solve the climate issue, and its intertwined problems, with technology and policy alone. We need spiritual renewal.

Cities are quietly outpacing nations in climate progress by cutting emissions, greening streets, and adapting to climate threats. This matters because urban areas now house over half the world’s population. They are more nimble because they are less politically divided and officials are more in tune with the immediate needs of their residents.

The Vatican released a new Mass titled “Mass for the Care of Creation.” A Vatican official said it demonstrates the church’s commitment to environmental protection, especially climate action. Pope Leo XIV appears determined to carry forward his predecessor’s engagement on the issue.

Denmark is pushing the European Union to tie climate goals to the new focus on defense and economic strength in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Trump’s tariff threats. They argue that energy independence is critical to Europe’s security and competitiveness.

The GOP’s “Big Beautiful Bill” is eliminating tax credits that cut the costs of solar, EVs, heat pumps, and more — but if you act fast, you can still get discounts.

Vietnam will begin phasing out fossil-fuel motorcycles in central Hanoi starting July 2026, as the country attempts to improve air quality and reduce climate emissions.

In a meeting headed by President Xi Jinping, China marked a shift away from large-scale urban expansion to more sustainable development focused on building green and low-carbon cities.

“So we feel sort of good about that.” More stories about chemical recycling","Eastman Chemical will delay its second U.S. methanolysis plant for two years, as it appeals the revocation of a key federal grant and explores capacity expansions at its flagship site in Tennessee and other locations, CEO Mark Costa said during an investor call Aug. 1.

The company is focusing its strategies on factors that are “to some degree, in our control,” Costa said, acknowledging that the ongoing economic downturn and tariff-related chaos were not among those items.

The second chemical recycling unit, planned for Longview, Texas, was previously expected to break ground late this year. However, in May the U.S. Department of Energy announced it had canceled grants including one of up to $375 million for Eastman to build the plant. The cancellation of the grant, which represented about one-third of the project funding, threw the plant’s future into question.

“We are certainly not happy about losing the DOE grant, and we’re highly engaged to try and get it back,” Costa said. “That’s a highly uncertain process, and so we’re focusing on what else can we do.” In asking the DOE to reinstate the grant award, “we believe we have a strong project aligned with the Department’s objectives and are making that case,” he said.

In addition, Eastman has identified several ways to significantly reduce the plant’s capital requirements in both scope and location, looking both at Longview and “three other sites where we might have some better advantages,” Costa said.

The most near-term option is to increase the existing Kingsport plant to as much as 130% of nameplate capacity by debottlenecking, Costa said, adding that the unit is running well and has demonstrated operating rates of 105% of stated capacity, Costa said. It also is on track to produce over 2.5 times more recycled PET this year than in 2024, Costa said.

The Kingsport methanolysis unit is running well and has demonstrated operating rates of 105% of nameplate capacity, Costa said. The unit is on track to produce over 2.5 times more recycled PET this year than in 2024, Costa said.

Costa added that “our ability to expand the Kingsport facility and potentially add new capacity in creative ways affords us time and optionality to serve our specialty and packaging business models over the next couple of years as we explore these other capital-efficient models. We expect this new path of scale-up will enable us to push out significant capital expenditures for the second plant by roughly two years.”

He cited the macroeconomic slowdown as a contributing factor to the decision to delay the plant. “Given the continued slow demand in consumer durables and our focus on controlling capital, we slowed the pace of construction to manage the platform responsibly,” Costa said. Nevertheless, he maintained that regulatory frameworks will continue to drive demand in both North America and Europe.

Eastman still expects to increase RPET volumes going into food-grade packaging applications in the second half of the year, with “commitments from a number of leading fast-moving consumer goods companies for significant ramp-up in volumes in 2026,” Costa said, and “we are seeing evidence that some brands are struggling to meet their performance requirements with mechanical recycling as they move to higher recycled content.”

In previous calls Costa indicated that rather than displacing mechanically recycled RPET, the company was aiming for food-grade applications that required a higher quality resin than existing means could provide.

A key customer is PepsiCo, which in 2022 signed an offtake agreement with Eastman. “Our contract with Pepsi is still intact and we’re still confident that they’re committed to working with us as we sort of pursue all these different options,” Costa said. “So we feel sort of good about that.”

CEO COMMENT

Greg Ebel, President and CEO commented the following:

""Our all-of-the-above approach to energy investment continues to surface value for shareholders. We are capitalizing on growing power demand and strong natural gas fundamentals. Today we sanctioned projects in GTM that will serve rising natural gas demand. This was on top of our recently announced 600 MW Clear Fork solar project in Texas that will support Meta's data center operations. Looking forward, our backlog is now over $30 billion across all four businesses, highlighting the advantage of Enbridge's scale and diversification. We remain excited about our suite of opportunities in natural gas, liquids, and power infrastructure, and are well set up to win in multiple ways as we deliver energy to our customers across North America.

""High utilization across all our systems and low-risk commercial frameworks continue to drive predictable results despite geopolitical and macroeconomic volatility. We deliver steady, dependable returns and continue to grow through optimizing our existing assets, disciplined project selection and leveraging scale where others can't. This is what allows us to succeed in all market cycles and the second quarter was no different. Enbridge reported record Q2 EBITDA and we expect to finish the year in the upper end of that guidance range. In addition, we're well on track to meet the mid-point of our per share metrics in 2025 and achieve financial guidance for the 20th consecutive year.

""In Liquids, Mainline volumes averaged 3.0 mmbpd for the second quarter, with the system apportioned for six of eight months this year, including July and August. We concluded an oversubscribed Flanagan South Pipeline open season during the quarter bringing us another step closer to sanctioning Mainline Optimization Phase 1 later this year. We also launched the Southern Illinois Connector open season which will leverage Enbridge and its partner's existing infrastructure, allowing customers expanded access to Nederland and providing additional end-market optionality. In the Permian, we completed the first 80 kbpd phase of the Gray Oak Pipeline expansion and expect to complete the remaining 40 kbpd by mid-2026. Overall, the Liquids earnings for the second quarter again underline the breadth and depth of the business that continually delivers for our customers and investors.

""In U.S. Gas Transmission, we sanctioned an expansion of Texas Eastern Transmission for up to 160 mmcf/d which will support rising industrial and power demand in Mississippi. Alongside our partners, we upsized the previously sanctioned Traverse Pipeline from 1.75 bcf/d to 2.5 bcf/d to accommodate strong customer demand. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, we continue to optimize existing assets through low-capital compression projects at highly attractive multiples on both the Southeast Supply Header Pipeline and Tres Palacios gas storage.

""In British Columbia, Aitken Creek is the only underground natural gas storage facility in the province, and we're proceeding with a 40 bcf expansion which will provide enhanced flexibility for our LNG related customers. In addition, we completed our 12.5% equity interest investment transaction with Stonlasec8 Indigenous Alliance on the Westcoast System in British Columbia, delivering sustained economic benefit to Indigenous communities and continuing our track record of recycling capital at attractive valuations.

""In Gas Distribution, we reached a settlement on rebasing Phase II in Ontario and the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio issued its decision on Enbridge Gas Ohio's rate case. Both outcomes are in line with our guidance. We have two more rate cases underway in Utah and North Carolina and expect that we'll reach fair settlements in those jurisdictions with new rates effective for 2026.

""In Renewable Power, we recently sanctioned the US$0.9 billion Clear Fork Solar project which we expect to enter service in 2027 and is fully backed by a long-term offtake agreement with Meta. This project demonstrates the growing demand for renewable power from blue chip companies across North America. Looking ahead, we don't currently expect the changes to renewable tax credits enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to impact Clear Fork or any of our other late-stage development projects.

""We're laser focused on disciplined capital allocation. Since the acquisition of three natural gas utilities in 2024, our leverage has improved and now sits at 4.7x, below the midpoint of the Company's target range. Our strong balance sheet, in combination with $9 to $10 billion of annual investment capacity, provides Enbridge the flexibility to execute on our $32 billion backlog and to continue to pursue the longer term $50 billion opportunity set we laid out earlier this year. Visible growth plans underpin annual expected dividend increases and positions Enbridge as a first-choice investment opportunity.""

FINANCIAL RESULTS SUMMARY

Financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 are summarized in the table below:

GAAP earnings attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2025 increased by $0.3 billion, or $0.14 per share, compared with the same period in 2024. This increase was primarily due to non-cash, unrealized changes in the value of derivative financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, partially offset by the absence in 2025 of a gain on sale from the disposition of interests in Alliance Pipeline and Aux Sable and an impairment of rate-regulated assets in Enbridge Gas Ohio. In addition, the quarterly operating performance factors discussed below contributed to higher earnings, compared to the second quarter of 2024.

The period-over-period comparability of GAAP earnings attributable to common shareholders is impacted by certain unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors which are noted in the reconciliation schedule included in Appendix A of this news release. Refer to the Company's Management's Discussion & Analysis for Q2 2025 filed in conjunction with the quarter-end financial statements for a detailed discussion of GAAP financial results.

Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025 increased by $0.3 billion compared with the same period in 2024. This was due primarily to contributions from the U.S. natural gas utility acquisitions (the Acquisitions), rate settlements and favorable contracting on U.S. Gas Transmission assets, and colder weather and higher distribution margin from increases in rates and customer base at Enbridge Gas Ontario. These factors were partially offset by lower volumes within the Liquid Pipelines Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent segment.

Adjusted earnings in the second quarter of 2025 increased by $0.2 billion, or $0.07 per share, compared with the same period in 2024, due to EBITDA factors discussed above and lower income tax expense mainly driven by higher investment tax credits, partially offset by higher financing costs and depreciation expense from the Acquisitions and capital investments.

DCF for the second quarter of 2025 was comparable with the same period in 2024, primarily due to EBITDA factors discussed above, offset by higher financing costs, maintenance capital expenditures related to new assets, and higher current taxes on higher earnings.

Per share metrics in 2025, relative to 2024, are impacted by the at-the-market (ATM) issuances of common shares in the second quarter of 2024 as part of the pre-funding plan for the Acquisitions.

Detailed financial information and analysis can be found below under Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

The Company reaffirms its 2025 financial guidance for adjusted EBITDA between $19.4 billion and $20.0 billion and DCF per share between $5.50 and $5.90.

The Company also reaffirms its financial outlook presented at its Investor Day on March 4, 2025;

2023 to 2026 near-term growth of 7-9% for adjusted EBITDA, 4-6% for adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and approximately 3% for DCF per share; and

Post 2026; adjusted EBITDA, EPS and DCF per share are all expected to grow by approximately 5% annually.

Enbridge does not expect tariffs to have a material impact on our current operations or deployment of capital, though the Company will continue to monitor developments.

FINANCING UPDATE

In June 2025, Enbridge Gas Ohio issued US$0.5 billion of senior notes consisting of US$250 million of 10-year notes and US$250 million of 30-year notes. Proceeds from these offerings were used to refinance maturing debt at Enbridge Gas Ohio.

In June 2025, Enbridge issued US$2.25 billion of medium term notes consisting of US$400 million of 3-year notes, US$600 million of 5-year notes, US$900 million of 10-year notes, and US$350 million of 30-year notes. Proceeds from these offerings were used to pay down existing indebtedness, fund capital expenditures, and for general corporate purposes.

The Company's rolling 12 month Debt-to-EBITDA metric at the end of the quarter was 4.7x.

SECURED GROWTH PROJECT EXECUTION UPDATE

Enbridge added approximately $2 billion of projects to its secured growth backlog this quarter:

Clear Fork Solar; US$0.9B

North Aitken Creek expansion; $0.3B

Line 31 expansion of Texas Eastern Transmission; US$0.1B

Woodfibre LNG costs have been updated, along with the commercial terms to set the preferred return closer to the completion of construction, resulting in an update to Enbridge's share of the expected capital costs to be US$2.9 billion. The secured growth backlog now sits at approximately $32 billion. Financing of the secured growth program is expected to be provided entirely through the Company's anticipated $9-10 billion of annual growth capital investment capacity.

SECOND QUARTER BUSINESS UPDATES

Liquids Pipelines: Southern Illinois Connector Open Season

Enbridge has launched an open season for long-term contracted service on the proposed Southern Illinois Connector Pipeline, leveraging existing infrastructure on ETCOP (Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline), to provide customers additional end-market optionality to Nederland, Texas.

The open season has been extended to August 8, 2025 based on customer feedback.

Gas Transmission: North Aitken Creek Expansion

Enbridge has sanctioned a 40 Bcf expansion of the Aitken Creek gas storage facility to support growing west coast LNG export demand. The storage expansion involves additional onsite wells, compression and facility modernization, to enhance existing withdrawal capacity and throughput. The development has been substantially de-risked under 10-year storage contracts at the facility, with capacity dedicated to ensuring availability for growing LNG demand across the west coast. Enbridge expects the project to cost approximately $0.3 billion and enter service in 2028.

Gas Transmission: Line 31 Expansion

Enbridge has sanctioned an up to 160 mmcf/d expansion of Texas Eastern Transmission Line 31, including a new lateral connection in Mississippi. The additional capacity will serve growing industrial and power demand in the region under long-term take-or-pay arrangements. Enbridge expects the project to cost approximately US$0.1 billion and enter service in 2028.

Gas Transmission: Permian and Gulf Coast Franchise Strategic Updates

On June 16, 2025, Enbridge closed the previously announced acquisition of a 10% interest in MXP, a leading natural gas infrastructure asset providing 2.5 bcf/d of Permian egress to the Katy area in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. In addition, the Company has announced the upsizing of the Traverse Pipeline from 1.75 Bcf/d to 2.5 Bcf/d, which provides bidirectional service between Agua Dulce and Katy area in Texas. The expanded scope was prompted by strong market demand and customer feedback, and enhances egress optionality across the U.S. Gulf Coast. The pipeline is expected to enter service in 2027.

Enbridge has advanced an expansion on the Southeast Supply Header Pipeline and secured a binding commitment from a southern utility to support growing industrial and data center demand in the U.S. southeast. In addition, the Company has also approved enhancements of the Tres Palacios gas storage facility to support future expansion opportunities.

Gas Transmission: Woodfibre LNG Commercial Update

Enbridge's share of the capital costs has been updated to US$2.9 billion and the preferred return is expected to be set closer to the completion of construction, de-risking Enbridge's return on capital. The project is underpinned by 15-year offtake agreements with BP Gas Marketing Limited for 100% of capacity.

Gas Transmission: Westcoast Pipeline Indigenous Investment

On July 2, 2025, Enbridge closed the previously announced transaction of a 12.5% equity interest investment in the Westcoast natural gas pipeline system by the Stonlasec8 Indigenous Alliance Limited Partnership, a group of 38 First Nations in B.C., for total proceeds of $0.7 billion. The transaction included a $400 million loan guarantee from the Canada Development Investment Corporation, marking a significant milestone in the advancement of Indigenous involvement and ownership within Canada's energy infrastructure.

Gas Distribution: Enbridge Gas Ohio Rate Case

On June 26, 2025, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio issued an order on the Enbridge Gas Ohio base rate case. The order maintains a strong return on equity of 9.8%, an increase to the equity thickness to 51.9%, and protects existing riders that allow for efficient capital returns. In July 2025, Enbridge Gas Ohio filed an application for rehearing regarding certain aspects of the order and continues to assess legal options.

Renewable Power: Clear Fork Solar

On July 22, 2025, Enbridge announced it has sanctioned the Clear Fork Solar project, which is expected to generate approximately 600 MW of renewable power and will be located near San Antonio, Texas. Clear Fork Solar is expected to cost approximately US$0.9 billion and enter service in 2027. All generation is secured under a long-term offtake agreement with Meta Platforms, Inc.

SECOND QUARTER 2025 FINANCIAL RESULTS

GAAP Segment EBITDA and Cash Flow from Operations

For purposes of evaluating performance, the Company makes adjustments to GAAP reported earnings, segment EBITDA and cash flow provided by operating activities for unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors, which allow management and investors to more accurately compare the Company's performance across periods, normalizing for factors that are not indicative of underlying business performance. Tables incorporating these adjustments follow below. Schedules reconciling EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA by segment, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per share and DCF to their closest GAAP equivalent are provided in the Appendices to this news release.

Adjusted EBITDA By Segment

Adjusted EBITDA generated from U.S. dollar denominated businesses was translated to Canadian dollars at a higher average exchange rate (C$1.38/US$) in the second quarter of 2025 when compared with the same quarter in 2024 (C$1.37/US$). A significant portion of U.S. dollar earnings are hedged under the Company's enterprise-wide financial risk management program. The hedge settlements are reported within Eliminations and Other.

Liquids Pipelines

Liquids Pipelines adjusted EBITDA decreased $120 million compared with the second quarter of 2024, primarily related to:

lower contributions from the Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent System due to lower volumes on the Flanagan South Pipeline and Spearhead Pipeline; and

lower contributions from the Bakken System due to lower volumes; partially offset by

the favorable effect of translating U.S. dollar earnings at a higher average exchange rate in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

Gas Transmission

Gas Transmission adjusted EBITDA increased $302 million compared with the second quarter of 2024, primarily related to:

favorable contracting and successful rate case settlements on our U.S. Gas Transmission assets;

contributions from the acquisitions of an interest in the Whistler Parent JV in the second quarter of 2024 and the Delaware Basin Residue Pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2024;

higher volumes at the BC Pipeline and stronger utilization at the Aitken Creek Storage facility due to strong demand;

contributions from the Venice Extension project which entered service in the fourth quarter of 2024; and

the favorable effect of translating U.S. dollar earnings at a higher average exchange rate in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024.

Gas Distribution and Storage

Adjusted EBITDA for Enbridge Gas Ontario, Enbridge Gas Utah and Enbridge Gas North Carolina typically follows a seasonal profile. EBITDA is generally highest in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Seasonal profiles for Enbridge Gas Ontario, Enbridge Gas Utah and Enbridge Gas North Carolina reflect greater volumetric demand during the heating season and the magnitude of the seasonal adjusted EBITDA fluctuations will vary from year-to-year in Ontario reflecting the impact of colder or warmer than normal weather on distribution volumes. Enbridge Gas Ohio's earnings are largely decoupled from volumes and less impacted by weather fluctuations. Enbridge Gas Utah and Enbridge Gas North Carolina have revenue decoupling mechanisms that are not impacted by weather or gas volume variability, but revenues are shaped to align with the seasonal usage profile. Enbridge Gas Ontario revenue is affected by weather variability.

Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter increased $273 million compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily related to:

full-quarter contributions from the Acquisitions;

higher distribution margin resulting from increases in rates and customer base in Enbridge Gas Ontario in addition to higher storage pricing; and

colder weather impacting Enbridge Gas Ontario in 2025.

When compared with the normal forecast embedded in rates, the positive impact of weather to Adjusted EBITDA for Enbridge Gas Ontario was approximately $10 million in the second quarter of 2025 compared to a negative impact of approximately $28 million in the same period of 2024.

Renewable Power Generation

Renewable Power Generation adjusted EBITDA decreased $27 million compared with the second quarter of 2024 primarily related to:

lower contributions from European offshore wind facilities.

Eliminations and Other

Operating and administrative recoveries captured in this segment reflect the cost of centrally delivered services (including depreciation of corporate assets) inclusive of amounts recovered from business units for the provision of those services. U.S. dollar denominated earnings within operating segment results are translated at average foreign exchange rates during the quarter, and the impact of settlements made under the Company's enterprise foreign exchange hedging program are captured in this corporate segment.

Eliminations and Other adjusted EBITDA decreased $119 million compared with the second quarter of 2024 due to:

higher realized foreign exchange losses on hedge settlements in 2025.

Distributable Cash Flow

Second quarter 2025 DCF increased $45 million compared with the same period of 2024 primarily due to operational factors discussed above contributing to higher adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by:

higher debt principal mainly attributable to the Acquisitions, resulting in higher interest expense;

higher current taxes due to higher earnings; and

higher maintenance capital from the Acquisitions.

Adjusted Earnings

Adjusted earnings increased $170 million and adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.07 when compared with the second quarter in 2024 primarily due to higher adjusted EBITDA driven by operational factors discussed above, and:

lower income tax expense mainly driven by higher investment tax credits; partially offset by

higher debt principal mainly attributable to the Acquisitions, resulting in higher interest expense; and

higher depreciation from assets acquired or placed into service since the second quarter of 2024.

Per share metrics were negatively impacted by ATM issuances in the second quarter of 2024, as part of the pre-funding for the Acquisitions.

FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

Forward-looking information, or forward-looking statements, have been included in this news release to provide information about Enbridge and its subsidiaries and affiliates, including management's assessment of Enbridge and its subsidiaries' future plans and operations. This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward looking statements are typically identified by words such as ''anticipate'', ''believe'', ""estimate'', ''expect'', ''forecast'', ''intend'', ""likely"", ''plan'', ''project'', ''target'', and similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward-looking information or statements included or incorporated by reference in this document include, but are not limited to, statements with respect to the following: our corporate vision and strategy, including our strategic priorities and enablers; 2025 financial guidance and near term outlook, including projected DCF per share, EPS and adjusted EBITDA and expected growth thereof; expected dividends, dividend growth and payout policy; expected supply of, demand for, exports of and prices of crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGL), liquefied natural gas (LNG), renewable natural gas (RNG) and renewable energy; industry and market conditions; anticipated utilization of our assets; expected EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA; expected earnings/(loss) and adjusted earnings/(loss); expected DCF and DCF per share; expected future cash flows; expected shareholder returns and asset returns; expected performance of Enbridge's businesses; financial strength, capacity and flexibility; financing costs and plans; expectations on leverage, including Debt-to EBITDA ratio; expectations on sources of liquidity and sufficiency of financial resources; expected costs, benefits and in-service dates related to announced projects and projects under construction; investable capacity and capital allocation priorities; impact of weather and seasonality; expected future growth, development and expansion opportunities, including with respect to the Clear Fork Solar project, Texas Eastern Line 31 expansion, and North Aitken Creek expansion; the characteristics, anticipated benefits, financing and timing of our acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions, including the Acquisitions; government trade policies, as well as possible impacts of potential and announced tariffs, duties, fees, economic sanctions, or other trade measures and the timing thereof; expected future actions and decisions of regulators and courts and the timing and impact thereof; and toll and rate case discussions and proceedings and anticipated outcomes, timelines and impacts therefrom, including those relating to the Gas Distribution and Storage business.

Although Enbridge believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable based on the information available on the date such statements are made and processes used to prepare the information, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. By their nature, these statements involve a variety of assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors, which may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Material assumptions include assumptions about the following: the expected supply of, demand for, export of and prices of crude oil, natural gas, NGL, LNG, RNG and renewable energy; anticipated utilization of our assets; exchange rates; inflation; interest rates; tariffs and trade policies; availability and price of labour and construction materials; the stability of our supply chain; operational reliability and performance; maintenance of support and regulatory approvals for our projects and transactions; anticipated in-service dates; weather; the timing, terms and closing of announced and potential acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions and projects and the anticipated benefits thereof; governmental legislation; litigation; credit ratings; capital project funding; hedging program; expected EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA; expected earnings/ (loss) and adjusted earnings/(loss); expected earnings/(loss) or adjusted earnings/(loss) per share; expected future cash flows; expected future DCF and DCF per share; estimated future dividends; financial strength and flexibility; debt and equity market conditions; and general economic and competitive conditions. Assumptions regarding the expected supply of and demand for crude oil, natural gas, NGL, LNG, RNG and renewable energy and the prices of these commodities are material to and underlie all forward-looking statements, as they may impact current and future levels of demand for our services. Similarly, exchange rates, inflation, interest rates and tariffs impact the economies and business environments in which we operate and may impact levels of demand for our services and cost of inputs and are therefore inherent in all forward-looking statements. The most relevant assumptions associated with forward-looking statements regarding announced projects and projects under construction, including estimated completion dates and expected capital expenditures, include the following: the availability and price of labour and construction materials; the stability of our supply chain; the effects of inflation and foreign exchange rates on labour and material costs; the effects of interest rates on borrowing costs; the impact of weather; and customer, government, court and regulatory approvals on construction and in-service schedules and cost recovery regimes.

Enbridge's forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties pertaining to the successful execution of our strategic priorities; operating performance; legislative and regulatory parameters and decisions; litigation; acquisitions, dispositions and other transactions and the realization of anticipated benefits therefrom, including the Acquisitions; evolving government trade policies, including potential and announced tariffs, duties, fees, economic sanctions or other trade measures; operational dependence on third parties; project approval and support; renewals of rights-of-way; weather; economic and competitive conditions; global geopolitical conditions; political decisions; public opinion; dividend policy; changes in tax laws and tax rates; exchange rates; interest rates; inflation; commodity prices; access to and cost of capital; our ability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at commercially reasonable rates and terms; and supply of, demand for, and prices of commodities and other alternative energy, including but not limited to those risks and uncertainties discussed in this news release and in Enbridge's other filings with Canadian and U.S. securities regulators. The impact of any one assumption, risk, uncertainty or factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty, as these are interdependent, and our future course of action depends on management's assessment of all information available at the relevant time. Except to the extent required by applicable law, Enbridge assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement made in this news release or otherwise, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.

NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS APPENDICES

This news release contains references to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings, adjusted earnings per common share (EPS) and DCF per share. Management believes the presentation of these metrics gives useful information to investors and shareholders, as they provide increased transparency and insight into the performance of the Company.

EBITDA represents earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors on both a consolidated and segmented basis. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to set targets and to assess the performance of the Company and its business units.

Adjusted earnings represent earnings attributable to common shareholders adjusted for unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors included in adjusted EBITDA, as well as adjustments for unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors in respect of depreciation and amortization expense, interest expense, income taxes and noncontrolling interests on a consolidated basis. Management uses adjusted earnings as another measure of the Company's ability to generate earnings and uses EPS to assess performance of the Company.

DCF is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities before the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities (including changes in environmental liabilities) less distributions to noncontrolling interests, preference share dividends and maintenance capital expenditures and further adjusted for unusual, infrequent or other non-operating factors. Management also uses DCF to assess the performance of the Company and to set its dividend payout target.

This news release also contains references to Debt-to-EBITDA, a non-GAAP ratio which utilizes adjusted EBITDA as one of its components. Debt-to-EBITDA is used as a liquidity measure to indicate the amount of adjusted earnings to pay debt, as calculated on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), before covering interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges and impracticability of estimating certain items, particularly certain contingent liabilities and non-cash unrealized derivative fair value losses and gains subject to market variability. Because of those challenges, a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios is not available without unreasonable effort.

Our non-GAAP financial measures and non-GAAP ratios described above are not measures that have standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and are not U.S. GAAP measures. Therefore, these measures may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other issuers.

The tables below provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures.

All eyes were on North Carolina this week, as Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley formally announced a run for Senate in the key battleground state, backed with an endorsement from Donald Trump.

Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has also announced plans to run, kicking off what’s expected to be among the most-watched races of the 2026 midterms.

Whatley has yet to release the details of his platform. But a piece of the top GOP official’s past may inform his approach to issues like climate change and renewable energy in North Carolina, a state still recovering from September’s Hurricane Helene.

Before his journey into Republican leadership—first as chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, later as general counsel and chair of the RNC—Whatley, according to his LinkedIn profile, worked for more than 15 years at HBW Resources, a PR and lobbying firm focused on energy and transportation policy. There, his profile shows, Whatley took a position as executive vice president of a mysterious organization created and staffed by HBW, the Houston-registered nonprofit Consumer Energy Alliance.

On its website, Consumer Energy Alliance claims to advocate for “sensible energy policy,” and has branded itself the “voice of the energy consumer.” But according to tax records and media reports over the last 15 years, the firm has close ties to the fossil fuel industry and a record of questionable, behind-the-scenes tactics to influence energy policy.

HBW asserts on its website that it “built Consumer Energy Alliance from the ground up,” claiming that the group represents 550,000 individuals and “nearly 300 companies spanning America’s economy.” “We build organizations with real governance and corporate structures, real grassroots and grasstops support, and run them with real people,” HBW’s site reads. “We don’t build a website, call a staff member the executive director and pretend that’s real.”

In fact, almost all of Consumer Energy Alliance’s staff also hold roles at HBW, as the Center for Public Integrity reported in 2014, blurring the lines between the two organizations. Whatley himself worked at the nonprofit from 2008 to 2019, during which time he also maintained a position as a partner at HBW.

Consumer Energy Alliance’s nonprofit status means it isn’t required to disclose its funders—but as the Washington Post noted earlier this year, HBW lobbies on behalf of many fossil fuel clients, and Consumer Energy Alliance has reportedly received funding from Big Oil industry groups like American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers and the American Petroleum Institute. Its current members include fossil fuel trade groups, utilities, and oil and gas corporations like Chevron, Shell, and ExxonMobil.

Although the group claims to advocate for “affordable, reliable, and cleaner energy solutions,” much of its work has focused on opposing climate regulations and expanding access to fossil fuels.

In 2011, for instance, Salon reported that it had obtained hundreds of pages of email records between then–HBW staffer Whatley and his friend Gary Mar, a Canadian diplomat, including discussions of plans to oppose low-carbon fuel standards under consideration in several US states in 2009 and 2010. Whatley reportedly wrote to Mar about the possibility of “conducting a grassroots operation” in “target states” that would “generate significant opposition” to the new standards. Later, after federal lawmakers expressed interest in a low-carbon fuel standard, Consumer Energy Alliance launched a $1 million radio and TV ad campaign in four states claiming that the standards would “further damage our ailing economy,” according to the Hill. “Low-carbon fuel standards may sound like a good idea,” the ad reportedly said, “but as usual, Congress wants you to pay the price.”

Further details of the group’s influence came to light in 2014, when the Center for Public Integrity reported that Consumer Energy Alliance and HBW worked closely with the governors of eight states, including North Carolina, to lobby the Obama administration to expand offshore drilling operations in US waters. Consumer Energy Alliance reportedly provided talking points and research to the governors, some of whom relied on the materials in at least one meeting with then–Interior Secretary Sally Jewell—giving industry further back-door access to the administration.

Several more recent media reports raise further ethical questions about the nonprofit’s advocacy tactics.

In 2016, the Toledo Blade reported that Consumer Energy Alliance may have sent the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission hundreds of allegedly fraudulent letters in support of a proposed natural gas pipeline to be built between Ohio and Michigan. Some of the letters appeared to come from Ohio residents—but were, according to the Blade, submitted without the senders’ knowledge, including one letter supposedly from an Ohio man who had died in 1998.

Similar issues arose in 2023 with a Consumer Energy Alliance letter campaign supporting fracking in Ohio state parks, with dozens of Ohioans telling Cleveland.com and the Plain Dealer, a Cleveland newspaper, that their names were used without permission. (Consumer Energy Alliance has denied any wrongdoing in both cases, and has said that any errors in the letters were unintentional.)

Most recently, as the Washington Post reported in January, Consumer Energy Alliance helped launch an advocacy group called the Energy Poverty Awareness Center (EnPAC), “dedicated to advancing the prosperity of minority communities through reliable and affordable energy solutions,” led by former NFL player Gary Baxter. While higher energy costs do disproportionately impact Black and Brown communities, critics like the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters and the Energy and Policy Institute (EPI) call Consumer Energy Alliance a “front group” for industry; EPI has also accused Consumer Energy Alliance of packaging pro–fossil fuel objectives as social justice concerns.

(Neither Whatley, through the RNC, nor Consumer Energy Alliance responded to requests for comment from Mother Jones. In response to the Post‘s reporting, a Consumer Energy Alliance spokesperson characterized the group’s practices as “normal,” its involvement in EnPAC as “something that happens every day in advocacy,” and the Post‘s reporting as “a blatant attempt to generate a headline.”)

It wouldn’t be the first time Consumer Energy Alliance received this kind of criticism. In 2022, the group paid up to $8,000 for a Facebook advertisement featuring two businesswomen in the construction industry that linked fossil fuel access to feminism. “As two women, running a business in a male-dominated field is hard enough,” the ad, first surfaced by the Energy and Policy Institute, read. “Add in energy fluctuations and you’re not only responsible for your employees, but you’re also responsible for the impacts to your neighbors and your community.”

Outside of his work with Consumer Energy Alliance, Whatley has been noticeably quiet about climate change beyond objections to the potential impact of climate regulations on energy costs—at times laying out conflicting positions about renewable energy.

In a 2013 blog post for Consumer Energy Alliance, he responded to then-President Barack Obama’s 21-page “Climate Change Action Plan,” which Whatley described as an overstep of congressional authority (“the word ‘Congress’ isn’t used once,” he wrote, citing DC politics outlet National Journal) and a “mixed bag of incentive programs, new regulations and lofty goals.” Obama’s proposed limits on power plant emissions, Whatley argued, would mean “less fuel diversity and higher electricity costs”—although he conceded that the plan offered “some good news” in its goal to double renewable electricity generation by 2020, and especially its proposals to generate power on public lands, electrify dams, and streamline permitting.

Still, he concluded, “Every homeowner, business, manufacturer and electricity consumer will undoubtedly feel the painful effects of higher energy costs under the President’s proposed plan. Congress must take an active oversight role in order to prevent these negative ramifications.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250731_michael-whatley_2000px.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-08-01 19:02:35.747212

The most recent permitting reform effort, led last year by former U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, failed after negotiations to include it in another continuing resolution failed.
The act would have shortened the timeline for judicial review of energy and mineral permitting projects while accelerating federal decision-making for leasing of energy projects on federal lands.
It’s solar, it’s wind, it’s broadband, it’s housing development, it’s transportation projects,” Capito said.
I feel like this is where we are with permitting,” Capito said.","Permitting reform is once again a major focus of U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, and she believes that lawmakers can get a package to the desk of President Donald Trump by the end of the year.

Speaking to West Virginia reporters on a conference call Thursday afternoon, Capito talked about her speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate Wednesday advocating for permitting reform to speed up energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects.

“I thought it was time to start talking more aggressively about the need for permitting reform,” said Capito, R-W.Va. “If we’re going to have data centers in need of more energy, we need to be able to have a permitting structure that really works.”

Capito, the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, is working with EPW ranking Democratic member Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., on a permitting reform package that can be considered by the full Senate and U.S. House of Representatives sometime in the next five months.

“We both, as chair and ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, wanted to put out a united front as a unit,” Capito said. “I think that is good, and that would be great for West Virginia. Hopefully, we can do something by the end of the year.”

The EPW Committee began work in February on permitting reform, taking testimony in committee and keeping the record open for 30 days to allow stakeholder to submit further testimony and comments. According to Capito, her committee received 107 submissions on behalf of 146 organizations, as well as 854 individual requests providing input on how to improve federal permitting processes.

Congress has been tackling the topic of permitting reform for a number of years, either through individual bills or by including permitting reform provisions in continuing resolutions to keep the federal government funded.

The most recent permitting reform effort, led last year by former U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, failed after negotiations to include it in another continuing resolution failed. Manchin, the former chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, worked with then-ranking Republican committee member John Barrasso of Wyoming on a package called the Energy Permitting Reform Act.

The act would have shortened the timeline for judicial review of energy and mineral permitting projects while accelerating federal decision-making for leasing of energy projects on federal lands. It would have allowed for at least one lease sale for offshore wind and offshore oil and gas projects per year from 2025 to 2029 subject to limitations.

Among other things, the proposal would have reformed current backstop authority for interstate electric transmission lines and required interregional planning. It would have limited how electric companies allocate expenses to customers for transmission line projects, as well as other items to speed up transmission projects.

“We’ve been talking about this for years,” Capito conceded. “The Manchin/Barrasso bill almost passed at the end of last year. They had a lot of permitting for transmission and some easing of some of the judicial reviews so you can’t keep going to court back-and-forth and back-and-forth.”

But Capito said she believes this is the year to push for a large, comprehensive permitting reform package that can appeal to different kinds of projects.

“It’s not just new pipelines or natural gas. It’s solar, it’s wind, it’s broadband, it’s housing development, it’s transportation projects,” Capito said. “I think what we’re seeing here is a convergence of clean energy folks and people like me who are all-of-the-above meeting together with an urgency, and I think that’s why I think we have a better shot at this year than we’ve had over the last few years.”

Over in the U.S. House of Representatives, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, introduced the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. That bill would make reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to streamline permitting processes, shorten timelines for permit approvals, and limit judicial review.

“A lot of times here on Capitol Hill…things have to simmer and cook for a couple years before we really get to the meat of the matter. I feel like this is where we are with permitting,” Capito said. “The House just put out a bipartisan bill. That’s a good sign that there’s bipartisan support in the House and we have to have a bipartisan process.”",https://www.capito.senate.gov/assets/images/sharelogo.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 20:58:47.190074

The actions also include a new Colorado Energy Savings Navigator, which will help Coloradans determine what tax credits they qualify for to save money on clean energy.
“Today we are taking action to ensure that Coloradans can easily access clean energy savings, especially ones that expire soon,” Polis said.
Conservation Colorado CEO Kelly Nordini said, “Coloradans know that expanding clean energy and good jobs is a no-brainer.","Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) is directing state agencies to prioritize solar, storage and wind projects so they may qualify in time for expiring federal incentives.

The governor’s actions aim to ensure renewable energy projects are able to begin construction or placed in service “as quickly as possible” so they may receive federal tax credits and avoid tariff uncertainty.

To move quickly and secure energy projects can successfully meet eligibility for federal tax credits, Polis instructed state agencies in a letter to investigate and eliminate redundancies and inefficiencies in deploying solar, battery storage and wind resources to the electric grid.

“The goal is to integrate maximal clean energy by securing as much cost-effective electric generation under construction or placed in service as soon as possible, along with any necessary electricity balancing resources and supporting infrastructure,” Polis said. “We further commit, across all relevant agencies, to prioritizing expeditious review of projects as they come into the queue for state consultation and permitting.”

Polis also said Colorado will pursue flexible interconnection and voluntary curtailment for distributed energy and community solar projects, and work to facilitate the pre-purchase of project equipment and affiliated electric transmission and distribution infrastructure.

According to the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, new federal policies are projected to increase average Colorado household energy costs by as much as $500 per year by 2035.

“We must provide confidence to the clean energy industry that Colorado is open for business as tariffs, shifting federal rules, supply chain crunches, and market uncertainty risk delaying investment in these affordable domestic energy resources,” Polis said.

The actions also include a new Colorado Energy Savings Navigator, which will help Coloradans determine what tax credits they qualify for to save money on clean energy. The tool enables users to plug in a few relevant details such as their income, and whether they rent or own their home to find out which of the more than 600 energy rebates and 18 different energy bill assistance programs they are eligible for.

“Today we are taking action to ensure that Coloradans can easily access clean energy savings, especially ones that expire soon,” Polis said. “We continue to do all we can to make people aware of how you can reduce costs on energy bills and keep money in your pocket. That’s what the launch of this new tool and executive action are all about.”

According to Rebecca White, Colorado Public Utilities Commission director, only 20% of eligible Coloradans enroll in bill assistance programs, which she attributed to it often taking hours of searching to find these programs. “The CESN tool was developed to change that,” she said.

Wil Gehl, the Solar Energy Industries Association’s InterMountain West senior manager, said the “steps will save Coloradans billions of dollars in avoided energy costs while creating good local jobs and strengthening grid reliability.”

“This action creates a path for continued solar and storage investment in Colorado that will deliver the reliable, affordable power that Coloradans are demanding. It also sets an example for all governors and state leaders to follow across the country,” he said.

Polis has worked to advance and protect the Centennial State’s clean energy for years.

In April, Polis drafted a last-minute bill that would have accelerated the state’s requirement for its investor-owned utilities to eliminate all greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity production by 10 years.

Colorado was the first state to enact a renewable portfolio standard through an initiated state statute and also the first state to enact policy to enable community solar. Polis signed a bill into law last year to modernize its community solar program, start a new dispatchable distributed generation program, upgrade the power grid, and promote energy equity.

Conservation Colorado CEO Kelly Nordini said, “Coloradans know that expanding clean energy and good jobs is a no-brainer. The time to act is now — whether it’s buying an EV or installing a heat pump — while incentives are in place.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/20250801_171622_polarr_filter8868103781076203495-1200x800.jpeg,N,,2025-08-01 19:01:53.318836

Under former President Joe Biden, a BLM rule overhauling oil and gas leasing and royalty rates on public lands offered the public a 60-day comment period.","The Bureau of Land Management implemented four rules today that create more leeway for oil and gas companies wanting to drill on public lands, as required by the spending bill President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress passed in July. But voters will not have a chance to comment on two of the rules.

Lands “eligible” and “available” for oil and gas leases will now be determined using definitions laid out in the bill, as opposed to the discretion of the BLM. These new definitions include areas defined as available for oil and gas leasing in resource management plans, which can sometimes be several decades old.

Other changes require the agency to offer new acres for leasing within 18 months of a company expressing interest, and prevent the BLM from adding any new stipulations to a lease unless they are present in an existing resource management plan. Unused drilling permits now last four years, up from three, and the agency has waived the $5-per-acre nomination fee for companies submitting claims on public lands .

The BLM did not answer questions about how the agency determined these rules were “noncontroversial.”

“Removing the nomination fee will allow companies to propose vast tracts of public lands for leasing, which the BLM will now be required to offer within 18 months,” said Kate Groetzinger, communications manager for Center for Western Priorities, in a statement. Given the recent federal layoffs, “the BLM will have to shift significant resources into preparing these lease sales, effectively making the BLM a single-use agency dedicated to oil and gas management.”

While these changes are the result of new congressional legislation, federal law typically requires agencies to offer public comment periods on new rules. There are exceptions under the Administrative Procedure Act if an agency has “good cause” to find the comment periods are “impractical, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”

To justify changing leasing terminology and eliminating the application fee without public input, the BLM said that “notice and comment are unnecessary because [these rules are] noncontroversial.”

Environmentalists disagreed, taking issue with the way the administration is handling the public comment period.

“By issuing all of these changes as final rather than draft rules, the Trump administration is signaling its disregard for public input,” Groetzinger said. “This is not how public land management is supposed to work.”

Industry groups found the new rules reasonable. “We’re pleased BLM is moving quickly because, in some instances, these rules will help agency staff working in the field offices and judges considering cases on federal leases,” said Melissa Simpson, president of Western Energy Alliance, in a statement. “Congress provided clarification that we’ve seen is necessary as we’ve been defending federal leases over the past decade in multiple venues.”

Simpson did not comment on the agency’s decision to withhold public comment for two of the rules.

Republicans faced broad bipartisan pushback and fierce local objections to their effort to sell off public lands earlier this year, and some say the party has not learned its lesson. By failing to offer a public comment period for some rules and truncating the time allowed for commenting on others, the administration “continues to show a concerning trend for taking regulatory action that risks cutting out the public voice,” said Gregg DeBie, senior staff attorney at the Wilderness Society, in a statement.

“If the Trump administration was listening to the people they are meant to serve, they’d hear loud and clear that our public lands are shared spaces that deserve protections, not places for oil and gas companies to grow even richer and dig us deeper into fossil fuel dependency,” he said.

The other two rules will become effective by Sept. 30, unless the agency receives “significant adverse comments” by Sept. 2.

Some recent state actions are notable for their policy innovations that tackle challenges involving transmission buildout, low-emission industry, transportation emissions, renewable energy siting, and clean firm technologies such as fusion and next-generation geothermal energy.

Here are just a few of the innovative state policies and bills (some passed, others didn’t) that are replicable in other states.

California’s public finance and ownership structure for transmission

Multiple bills in the California State Legislature address alternative financing and ownership for transmission lines. California Assembly Bill 825, is a package of electricity affordability legislation that would, among other things, create a public transmission program to utilize public funding to lower the cost of future transmission projects, a model that can be used in states beyond California. The program would support public-private partnerships for transmission projects developed by investor-owned utilities (IOUs), and the state’s role as a public partner would allow portions of these projects to be publicly financed, while passing the savings on to ratepayers. Other bills include the package of electricity affordability legislation in California Senate Bill 254, which would establish a Clean Energy Infrastructure Authority to implement the approach, and SB 330, which would authorize the governor to establish one or more transmission infrastructure pilot projects that would achieve ratepayer savings.

During development of the bills, CATF experts presented research on public financing for transmission infrastructure to key committees. This analysis, developed by CATF and Net-Zero California (NZC), found public-private financing for transmission infrastructure could save Californians $3 billion per year – about $123 billion over 40 years. CATF’s analysis explored and evaluated four alternative models for financing and developing transmission infrastructure in California: IOU financing and development, wholly public, public-private partnership (concession), and public-private partnership (lease). Resources from CATF’s and NZC’s Wired for Savings research and policy proposals on the topic can be found here.

California’s indirect source review program

California’s AB 914 aimed to affirm the California Air Resources Board’s authority to promulgate Indirect Source Review (ISR) rules. While air districts in the state have successfully implemented regional ISR rules, this bill intended to clarify a pathway for state-wide regulation of pollution from major transportation hubs, driving down harmful air pollution and advancing clean energy technology development.

Under the Clean Air Act, states have the authority to regulate emissions from a building or other stationary facility that attracts mobile sources of pollution. This is a powerful tool states (and other jurisdictions) can use to regulate mobile sources of pollution indirectly, without relying on a federal waiver.

New Mexico’s tax credits for industrial decarbonization

New Mexico HB 538 would have established a production and investment tax credit for industrial decarbonization projects in the state. The bill sought to attract new investment and projects that reduce emissions from the state’s industrial sector by providing a production tax credit per ton of CO2 reduced below an industrial benchmark and an investment tax credit for eligible facilities. Eligible products included concrete, cement, asphalt, iron, steel, glass, hydrogen, critical minerals, or refinement process products. In the context of changing federal incentives, this bill aimed to help stabilize the policy environment to attract climate-forward investment across the state.

Massachusetts comprehensive reforms to clean energy infrastructure siting and permitting

In November 2024, Mass. Governor Healey signed a comprehensive climate and clean energy bill into law (2024 Climate Act) that contains significant reforms of the state’s siting and permitting processes for clean energy infrastructure. The reforms, based on recommendations presented by the Governor’s Commission on Energy Infrastructure Siting and Permitting, streamline permitting by (1) establishing a 12-month deadline for municipal permitting, requiring municipalities to issue a single permit at the end of the process and (2) requiring that state permits be issued together by the Energy Facilities Siting Board (EFSB) after a 15-month period. Further, the law improves equitable siting and community engagement processes by granting municipalities automatic intervenor status in EFSB proceedings and establishing a fund to support stakeholders with legal representation and expert analysis needs.

Additional states to recently tackle energy siting practices include Pennsylvania (bill introduced), New York (law enacted last year), and Colorado (law passed). Updated renewable energy siting policies address barriers to clean energy infrastructure deployment, enabling faster, smoother clean energy buildout. By proactively tackling challenges—like permitting and community concerns—comprehensive, forward-looking siting policies can support timely renewable energy deployment.

Virginia leading on commercial fusion energy

The Governor of Virginia signed into law HB 1779/SB 1338, which adds fusion energy to the list of generation sources that qualify as carbon-free energy or clean energy. This is a significant step forward for the role of fusion energy in Virginia, as it acknowledges its role as a zero emission, clean firm resource. This bill sets the stage for further legislative action to grow the state’s clean firm resources and is an example of an action states can take to advance fusion energy. In addition to Virgina, Washington, New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, and Wisconsin have passed or introduced fusion legislation. View this FAQ to learn more about fusion energy.

Colorado empowers geothermal energy development

Colorado’s HB25-1165 modernized the state’s regulatory structure around geothermal resources. The bill streamlines regulatory approval for next-generation geothermal technology by clarifying regulatory authority over different types of geothermal operations and eliminating unnecessary permitting steps for superhot dry rock wells below 2,500 feet. By making key technical fixes, such as removing overlapping permitting requirements for deep and dry (non-tributary groundwater) wells between the State Engineer and the Energy and Carbon Management Commission and creating new notice requirements for protecting existing geothermal operations, this law will help unlock next-generation geothermal energy development across the state.

Superhot rock geothermal has significant potential to meet long-term demands for zero-carbon, always-on power. Learn more about how this innovative energy source can unlock terawatts of clean, firm power across the globe through CATF’s first-of-its-kind modeling tool and other CATF resources.

Texas nuclear energy fund

Texas recently enacted HB 14, establishing the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office within the Office of the Governor and creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Deployment Fund, supported by an initial $350 million legislative appropriation. The office will lead statewide efforts to plan, coordinate, and promote the development of advanced nuclear energy and will include a nuclear permitting coordinator to help developers navigate regulatory processes. The fund will provide reimbursement-based grants to support early project development and construction expenses. HB 14 marks a strong first step toward positioning Texas as a national leader in advanced nuclear energy, but sustained state investment and additional policy support will be essential to realizing its full potential. Learn more about the bill and CATF’s view of nuclear energy opportunities in Texas with this op-ed in the Texas Insider.

Youth Energy Academy empowers energy careers for minority and underserved students through two days of immersive programming

ST. PETERSBURG, Fla – This summer, the Youth Energy Academy (YEA) hosted a series of career exploration events throughout Florida, designed to expose youth to careers in electric utility industries and related STEM fields.

Duke Energy Florida, Ocala Electric, SECO Energy, Orlando Utilities Commission, Siemens Energy, Gainesville Regional Utilities and the Florida Chapter of the American Association of Blacks in Energy (AABE) worked together to host interactive activities and engaging discussions for underprivileged and disadvantaged youth. Students also had an opportunity to tour utility facilities to gain first-hand exposure to the energy sector.

""The energy industry is full of diverse and engaging career paths, ones that provide growth opportunities, an essential skillset and strong earning potential,” said Melissa Seixas, Duke Energy Florida state president. “The Youth Energy Academy is the best place for students to explore these rewarding options and discover how they can make a real impact in their community and beyond.”

YEA summer events included locations in St Petersburg at the Duke Energy Bartow Power Plant; Ocala at the Lillian Bryant Community Center, in partnership with SECO, Ocala Electric Utilities and Duke Energy Florida; Orlando and Winter Garden, in partnership with Orlando Utilities Commission, Siemens Energy and Duke Energy Florida; and Gainesville at Gainesville Regional Utilities Complex in partnership with Gainesville Regional Utilities and Duke Energy Florida.

At each of the YEA events, students participated in career workshops, virtual reality experiences, panel discussions, interactive games, and more. Some events also included specialized immersions, including live line demonstrations and generation site tours.

Students were issued a survey following each event and the majority of participants reported they were more likely to pursue a career in the energy industry following their immersion through the YEA event.

“According to the California Energy Commission, the valley is estimated to contain enough lithium to support the manufacturing of 5 million EV batteries per year,” he continued.
“Basically, what they’re working on is taking the brine, passing it through their own patented filters, and extracting lithium and other critical minerals from these screens,” Ruiz said.
And while we’re extracting the lithium, we’re producing geothermal energy.
“And I hope it brings chills and excitement to all of you, because this is what we need to do.”","WASHINGTON — Despite a dramatic shift in the federal government’s support of electric vehicles, Rep. Raul Ruiz, D-Calif., continues to believe lithium, a critical component in EV batteries, can and will drive the future of his district in the far southern reaches of the Golden State.

A physician by profession, the representative of California’s 25th Congressional District arrived in Washington believing health care would likely be at the forefront of his legislative agenda.

However, as he told attendees at the recent Congressional Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency EXPO and Policy Forum held in the Rayburn House Office Building, natural resources also consumed a large amount of his time, and he quickly came to see how both they and the well-being of his constituents were intertwined.

“I came to Congress to improve health care access and the overall public’s health in the Imperial Valley, which is both the heart of my district and one of the most impoverished communities in the state of California and across the entire nation,” he said.

“I’ve also learned a lot about energy and natural resources along the way,” Ruiz said. “For instance, I learned that the fifth-largest lithium deposit in the entire world is located in the Salton Sea region of California, which is also part of my district.

“According to the California Energy Commission, the valley is estimated to contain enough lithium to support the manufacturing of 5 million EV batteries per year,” he continued.

“While many countries have significant lithium reserves, the Salton Sea region’s deposit is notable for its potential to significantly impact the United States’ domestic lithium production and reduce reliance on foreign sources,” he added.

So diverse are the uses of lithium in everything from the aforementioned EV batteries to cellphones, that the federal government has declared it to be one of 35 critical minerals vital to the nation’s security and economic prosperity.

But Ruiz sees things from a bit more local perspective.

“In my district there are very low median household incomes. There is a very low college attainment rate and the number one industry in the area is agriculture,” he said.

“Imagine how transformative taking advantage of all those resources could be to our communities,” he added.

Born in Zacatecas City, Mexico, Ruiz was raised by a sister living in Coachella, California, and graduated from Coachella Valley High School before going on to the University of California, Los Angeles.

He later went on to become the first Latino to receive three graduate degrees from Harvard University: a Doctor of Medicine from Harvard Medical School, a Master of Public Policy from the John F. Kennedy School of Government and a Master of Public Health from the Harvard School of Public Health.

Ruiz said his own life story illustrates the good fortune that comes from dreaming big.

“We can do this,” he said of the transformative potential of Southern California’s lithium riches.

“We can transform our transportation sector … and in the process, we can strengthen our position as the second-largest lithium exporting country in the world,” he said.

Ruiz said he sees “an incredible opportunity” to increase battery manufacturing and advance clean energy goals in the half dozen cities he represents, including Cathedral City, Indio, Coachella, El Centro, Calexico, San Jacinto, Hemet and Needles.

“We can build the future and the technology and the industries the U.S. needs right in my district, and in doing so, increase the economic opportunities and median household incomes of the people who live there,” he said.

Ruiz is not alone in that assessment. As he told attendees at the conference hosted by the Environmental and Energy Study Institute and the House and Senate Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucuses, California Gov. Gavin Newsom is also on board, and recently provided $11 million to Imperial Valley College, San Diego State University, and several others to promote workforce development in the area.

“But as exciting as that is, what’s even more likely to get a lot of Democrats excited is that we don’t have to tear up the Earth and mine the minerals in ways that other countries have, ways that have added enormously to local pollution problems and enormous worker hazards,” he said.

The reason is the Imperial Valley is already a hub of geothermal energy production, and at least three of the major players in the region — BHE Renewables, Controlled Thermal Resources and EnergySource Minerals — are developing commercial solutions to recover lithium from the geothermal brine that is a byproduct of their activities.

“Basically, what they’re working on is taking the brine, passing it through their own patented filters, and extracting lithium and other critical minerals from these screens,” Ruiz said.

“The brine then goes to power the generators. It produces steam and it goes back into the earth, so instead of smoke or pollution that you’re seeing, you’re seeing a bunch of steam, and it’s a closed loop system. The carbon footprint is very tiny. And while we’re extracting the lithium, we’re producing geothermal energy. This is a win-win scenario.”

A 2023 study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Department of Energy found that there are more than 17 million metric tons of lithium available in the geothermal brine in the region.

Ruiz said what’s happening in his district can best be described as the creation of a “campus” for a full supply chain wherein battery manufacturers can draw energy from the geothermal plants, at the same time that the plants are “mining” the brine for the raw materials the manufacturers need to make their products.

“This is an incredible opportunity to decrease our reliance on China, which is a national security issue,” he said. “Beyond that, this is our opportunity to extract lithium and other rare earth minerals from our own domestic supply in a way that’s cleaner and healthier and safer for workers and surrounding communities.

“More than any of that, however, this is also an incredible case study on how you can take a marginalized, impoverished community and develop a robust middle class. That’s what brings me chills to my skin,” Ruiz said. “And I hope it brings chills and excitement to all of you, because this is what we need to do.”",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ruiz-4.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 19:01:31.448490

The Canadian pipeline giant on Friday reported record adjusted EBITDA of U$3.36 billion (C$4.6 billion) for the second quarter, up by 7% from a year earlier.

The company expects to finish the year in the upper end of its adjusted EBITDA guidance range, president and CEO Greg Ebel said.

Enbridge’s adjusted earnings rose to US$1.01 billion (C$1.4 billion), or US$0.47 (C$0.65) per common share, up from US$870 million (C$1.2 billion), or US$0.42 (C$0.58), per common share for the same period of 2024.

The C$0.65 earnings per share beat the analyst consensus estimate of C$0.57.

The higher Q2 earnings that also beat Wall Street expectations were the result of strong liquids flows on the Mainline system which Enbridge operates. The pipeline system moves more than 3 million barrels a day of crude oil and liquids from Western Canada to the demand markets in the United States. In total, Enbridge moves 40% of all North American crude.

But surging power and gas demand is also contributing to higher profits.

“We are capitalizing on growing power demand and strong natural gas fundamentals,” Ebel said in a statement.

Enbridge has recently approved the 600-MW Clear Fork solar project in Texas that will support Meta’s data center operations.

In British Columbia in Canada, Enbridge is expanding Aitken Creek—the only underground natural gas storage facility in the province. The expansion will provide enhanced flexibility for Enbridge’s LNG related customers as Canada’s first LNG export project has just started operations.

“We remain excited about our suite of opportunities in natural gas, liquids, and power infrastructure, and are well set up to win in multiple ways as we deliver energy to our customers across North America,” Ebel noted.

GM rolled out the Chevrolet Bolt in 2017; over the following years, it drew a devoted following over its affordable price and nearly 260-mile range, despite what Motor Trend called a “smallish” battery and “poky” fast-charging capabilities.

Pulling the Plug

Sales of the Bolt were on the rise in the early 2020s, but GM pulled the plug on it following the 2023 model year as it turned its focus to other EV models. The Detroit automaker, however, has since vowed that it would eventually return.

Indiana News Service

INDIANAPOLIS — The Trump administration’s long-term plan for artificial intelligence could have far-reaching environmental impacts across the country.

His strategy calls for the removal of land use rules considered prohibitive to the construction of AI data centers. Last year, then Gov. Eric Holcomb announced Microsoft would invest $1 billion to establish a new AI data center in La Porte to generate cloud computing infrastructure.

Ben Murray, senior researcher for the advocacy group Food and Water Watch, said fossil fuel plants are already being reopened to help meet high energy demands.

“We just need to be aware that anything that prolongs our reliance on fossil fuel is going to increase the problems that we’re seeing from the climate crisis,” Murray explained.

Murray argued high-tech progress should not come at the expense of increased household energy prices. Residents’ support is low due to concerns about increased traffic and noise near the centers. The Trump administration said environmental and permitting regulations will only slow America’s dominance in the AI field.

A report last year found emissions from data centers owned by Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft were more than seven times higher than officially reported. Computer servers using AI require far more energy than those without. A ChatGPT query, for example, can use up to 10 times more electricity than a standard Google search.

“These companies can seem as if they’re decreasing their emissions and meeting net-zero goals but in reality, the emissions are amping up faster than ever for these companies,” Murray pointed out.

Murray noted the push for more data centers is already leading Big Tech companies to backtrack on their climate goals. It is possible to power AI services with renewable energy sources, he added, but doing so requires political will.

By Marcene Mitchell

You might have seen the news this week about efforts to strip the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of its power to regulate climate pollution. If you're wondering what that actually means for you and your family, it's pretty straightforward: it would take away one of our main tools for protecting Americans from the climate disasters we're already living through. Nature and a stable climate are vital to securing a livable future—and protecting them is not optional; it's essential.

Here's what's happening. Some leaders want to revoke what's called the ""endangerment finding""—basically the scientific determination that gives the EPA the authority to regulate heat-trapping pollutants like carbon dioxide. They're not arguing the science is wrong (because frankly, it's rock solid). Instead, they're claiming the EPA was never supposed to have this power under the Clean Air Act.

If they succeed, the EPA couldn't take action on climate pollution anymore. All the existing protections would be wiped out, too. What makes this so concerning is that this is affecting real people, right now. We're not talking about some far-off problem anymore. Climate change is happening in communities across the country—regardless of political affiliation. Life on Earth needs nature and a stable climate. We are losing both. And it's going to get worse if we stop implementing the solutions that can make it better.

Maybe you've watched the news coverage of the massive wildfires that destroyed lives in California, wiping out entire towns. Or the floods in Texas that broke records and devastated communities. That's not to mention the hurricanes that become bigger every year, affecting places like North Carolina which never experienced the extreme impacts of these storms before. These aren't random occurrences anymore—they're becoming the new normal, threatening both the communities we love and the natural systems that sustain us.

Taking away the EPA's ability to address climate pollution would leave us defenseless against these threats that are only getting worse. Nature is our most valuable resource for sustaining life, but it is under threat as the problems our planet is facing are increasingly more complex and urgent. We must address the intertwined and accelerating challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss.

With all of this mounting damage, you'd think protecting the places we love—our forests, wetlands, communities, and keeping the air we breathe clean—would be something every American could get behind. In fact, a 2020 study from Pew Research Center found that about two-thirds (65%) of Americans felt the federal government was doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change. And that’s how it’s worked before.

Back when Congress wrote—and later when it amended—the Clean Air Act, lawmakers from both parties stood behind protecting public health from pollution of all kinds. They were smart about how they set it up, too. Instead of trying to list every possible pollutant that might threaten us, they used broad language to let EPA scientists figure out what needed regulating based on the evidence. The resulting rule was simple: if a pollutant ""may reasonably be anticipated to endanger"" human health or welfare, the EPA should take action.

This approach made sense because Congress knew new threats would emerge over time. They wanted the EPA to be able to respond quickly, before problems became full-blown health crises. The Supreme Court even looked at this question and agreed that greenhouse gases clearly fit within the Clean Air Act's definition of ""air pollutant."" When the EPA issued its endangerment finding in 2009, it was the result of years of careful, scientific analysis.

When this happened in 2009, that year was the second-hottest on record. Today? It doesn't even crack the top 10. This past year was by far the hottest we've ever recorded, and it brought climate disasters that cost Americans more than $182 billion and killed 568 people. Since 1980, weather and climate disasters have cost our country nearly $3 trillion.

Let that sink in for a moment. These aren't just numbers on a spreadsheet—they represent real families who lost everything, communities that are still rebuilding, lives that were cut short. Meanwhile, climate scientists keep telling us the same thing: human activities are ""unequivocally"" driving these changes, and the impacts are happening faster than we expected.

We must do all we can to protect the places where we live, work, and raise our families. Nature is not just a casualty of climate change—it is also a critical part of the solution. From nature-based solutions that protect the places we love, to supporting local communities that are stewards of biodiversity, to encouraging corporate sustainability efforts, this is not about one solution or one sector. It's about collective ambition and action.

It really comes down to a simple question: do we want to trust the science and protect American families, or do we want to ignore the evidence and hope for the best? The endangerment finding is our recognition that climate pollution is a real threat that needs real solutions. Clean air, stable climate, and thriving nature aren't luxuries; they're basic rights every American family deserves.

Eliminating the EPA's climate authority right now would be like throwing away our umbrella in the middle of a storm. We have the knowledge. We have the tools. We have momentum. What we need now is the will to act—at the speed and scale this moment demands. Because we need nature. And nature needs us. Now.

Future generations are counting on us to make the right choice here. Let's not let them down.

The lion's roar: Remembering Russ Train and his defense of the endangerment finding

By Will Gartshore

The news out of the EPA this week has me flashing back to 2010 – the last time there was a serious attempt to overturn the agency’s endangerment finding on greenhouse gases. My nostalgia for that moment 15 years ago is less about that first struggle over this critical federal climate policy than it is about the unexpected opportunity it gave me to get to know and with collaborate one of the great lions of the environmental movement – Russell Train, or “Russ” to those who knew him.

Russ Train was the first president of WWF US, from 1978 to 1985. Twenty-five years later he still kept a corner office in our Washington DC headquarters as our Chairman Emeritus. If you walked past on any given day, you could often see him in there working away, even as he approached his 90th birthday. I was 35 at the time, working on our government affairs team (as I am today), and as the 2010 endangerment finding debate heated up, I found myself invited to come join Mr. Train in his office. He had an idea, and he was looking for someone to help him pull it off.

Prior to running WWF, Russ had spent a decade as part of the Nixon and Ford Administrations standing up the legal and institutional frameworks of modern American environmentalism. He was the first Chairman of the Council of Environmental Quality, the second Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and played a central role in helping to shape our landmark environmental laws still standing today, including the Clean Air Act. He was a Republican and a self-described conservative. And on that day in 2010, he was visibly worked up over efforts in Congress to overturn the endangerment finding – the EPA’s landmark, science-based determination that GHGs endanger public health and welfare and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act.

The crux of the arguments then were the same as we are hearing today: not that the science is wrong – in fact, it’s overwhelming and irrefutable – but that EPA has somehow misinterpreted its authority under the Clean Air Act and doesn’t actually have the power to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases under existing law. Were that position to prevail, EPA would no longer be able to take action to address climate change pollution, now or in the future, and any previous such policies would be declared null and void. As far as Russ was concerned, it was an argument without grounds or merit.

The day I first met with Russ, he had been at a dinner the night before where Lisa Jackson was also in attendance. She was the current EPA Administrator at the time, and Russ had left that dinner determined to weigh in and validate the steps her agency was taking on GHGs. So, he spent the next day penning the draft of a letter, scribbled in bold sharpie marker on several pages of unlined paper, which he passed to me to read from across his desk.

His argument was unequivocal: of course the EPA had the authority to regulate GHGs under the Clean Air Act. As the person who steered the agency in its early days and helped enact both the 1970 law and its 1977 amendments (both of which passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan margins), he was something of an authority on the subject. He strongly rejected the premise that, because it makes no mention of greenhouse gases, the Clean Air Act was not intended to regulate them. From his standpoint, this argument was “inconsistent with the history of the law as it has been applied for the past 40 years and misconstrues the original intentions of Congress.” As he articulated in his 2010 letter, which was sent to congressional leaders at the time:

Precisely because existing knowledge was so limited at the time, Congress broadly defined the term “air pollutant” and relied on the experts at EPA to evaluate individual pollutants. Congress also clearly established that the sole criterion triggering EPA action was to be a scientific one: whether a pollutant “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger” human health or welfare.

To drive the point home, he used the example of another emerging issue EPA addressed using the law:

In my own tenure as EPA Administrator, our most pressing challenge was reducing airborne lead pollution from the burning of leaded gasoline in motor vehicles. Like greenhouse gas pollutants, airborne lead was nowhere specifically addressed in the Clean Air Act. However, the scientific evidence strongly suggested that it was resulting in severe health effects, particularly in children. Under the law, the EPA was compelled to issue an “endangerment finding”, which established a risk to human health or welfare and obligated the agency to begin regulating lead in automobiles.

In 1973, I adopted health-based standards to reduce airborne lead levels by more than half in five years. I did this in spite of some lingering scientific uncertainty and over the strong objections of industry. In 1975, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld my decision, arguing that the law “would seem to demand that regulatory action precede, and, optimally, prevent, the perceived threat.”

In 1977, Congress itself explicitly endorsed this reasoning when it amended the Clean Air Act, emphasizing “the Administrator’s duty to assess risks rather than wait for proof of actual harm” and broadening the criteria for action under the law from “will endanger [human health or welfare]” to “may reasonably be anticipated to endanger”. The intention of Congress was clear: to empower the EPA to respond to threats that had not yet arisen or had yet to be perceived. This is precisely what the EPA is doing today in acting to regulate greenhouse gas pollutants.

By all indications, those once again attempting to overturn the endangerment finding are attempting to rerun this legal argument because they know the science is not on their side. George W. Bush’s EPA tacitly acknowledged as much in the early 2000s, when it dragged its feet on making such a finding until the Supreme Court effectively mandated the agency do so in Massachusetts v. EPA. In that closely watched decision, the Court affirmed the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases and declared that these emissions “fit well within” the Clean Air Act’s definition of an “air pollutant” under the law. When the EPA subsequently issued its endangerment finding in 2009, under President Obama, much of the science used to make the decision came from the previous Republican Administration.

Some of those now seeking to overturn that 2009 finding argue that there is new science to consider. But the facts we have gathered over the intervening 16 years demonstrate that, if anything, the science – and SCOTUS – had significantly underestimated the dangerous impacts these air pollutants pose to public health and welfare. At the time, 2009 was the planet’s second hottest year on record, beaten only by 2005. Today, neither year is even in the Top 10.

The hottest year by far at this point has been 2024, which also saw climate- and weather-related disasters in the U.S. costing more than $182 billion dollars and causing 568 deaths. The cost of such disasters to Americans has also been on a sharply increasing trajectory, totaling $2.9 trillion going back 1980. In 2017 alone, they cost nearly $400 billion dollars and resulted in 3,280 deaths. All of the above statistics come from the U.S. government’s own data[1] and reflect only a fraction of the overall costs and impacts facing America’s economy and its communities. Based on the latest science, the EPA should be doubling down on its endangerment finding, not seeking to overturn it.

As was the case in 2010, one can’t help but conclude that the current effort to do just that is based neither on the science nor the law but rather on an entirely different set of considerations. Russ articulated those in 2010 with words that resonate equally well now:

Such proposals are driven not by science but by political considerations – to stall action on an emerging threat and shield elected officials from having to make difficult but necessary decisions. But as Congress itself has made clear, the Clean Air Act was not written to protect politicians; it was written to protect the American people.

In his role as EPA Administrator, Russ understood well his responsibility to do just that. Throughout his life, Russ was a role model of pragmatism and bipartisan cooperation, marked by irrepressible good humor and an intentionally collegial spirit. His legacy stands as a potent reminder of the time when both parties vigorously agreed that protecting our environment should be an urgent issue that bridges political divides. His shoes are big ones to fill. And one can’t help but wish that those following in his footsteps at the EPA would feel his same sense of responsibility to the agency’s mission – drawing inspiration from his example and working to uphold the bipartisan legacy he embodied, as well as the endangerment finding he argued so firmly in support of.

Offshore wind is not unreliable. It’s already producing clean power for homes and businesses all over the world, including the US. In fact, many of the world’s most successful offshore wind developers — including European firms — have decades of experience building turbines in deep waters and tough weather. These companies work hand-in-hand with US firms, bringing expertise and creating good-paying American jobs, from manufacturing to port construction to long-term operations and maintenance.

The government’s rollback affects critical areas for future wind projects in the Gulf of Maine, New York Bight, Central Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, California, and Oregon. By removing these designated offshore zones, Trump’s BOEM is essentially canceling the roadmap for the US’s offshore wind future – one that would have powered millions of homes, stabilized energy costs, and brought climate benefits when we need them most.

Jason Walsh, executive director of the BlueGreen Alliance, released a statement in response to this destructive decision:

Donald Trump should support the country’s progress and do everything he can to foster more resources for the people. Instead, he is trying to wipe an entire sector of the energy industry off the board at a time when our electric grid is overburdened and electric bills are rising. Attacking offshore wind will put America behind its foreign competitors, kill jobs, and weaken our energy sector.

This isn’t just an energy issue – it’s a jobs issue, a climate issue, and a national competitiveness issue. At a time when we need more power on the grid, more affordable energy, and more tools to fight climate change, the Trump administration is deliberately dismantling a homegrown solution. We will all pay for it with our wallets, and our kids will pay with their futures. Europe and China’s offshore wind industries are leaving the US in the dust.

Edwards said the U.S. oil market remains in a wait-and-see mode since OPEC-Plus signaled it won’t exceed previously stated production levels and the EU agreed to long-term purchases of U.S. energy, which it likely would have done anyway.
“Only then will it make sense to ramp back up or continue easing off on rigs and frac crews.” Perryman said the agreement with the EU is good news for the energy market and the economy.
“The proposed purchases of the EU of U.S. energy are not legally binding but are nonetheless an important signal that the U.S. is set to become the EU’s more important source of energy.” Perryman said Russia filled a large role in supplying EU energy in the past, but clearly that is off the table and it’s good for the U.S. energy industry to be the intended supplier.
“Better economic conditions around the globe appear to be surfacing, which increase demand for fuels and provide obvious benefits for the oil and gas industry.","The global oil market just got something of a double boost from a trade and tariff deal between the United States and the European Union and OPEC-Plus’s decision not to boost production beyond its 548,000-barrels-per-day bump set for August.

Odessa oilman Kirk Edwards and Waco economist Ray Perryman say those developments are encouraging but do not mean the market has fully rebounded from the tariffs that depressed prices early this year.

President Trump obtained the EU’s agreement to spend an additional $750 billion on U.S. energy products over the next three years and invest $600 billion in American industries.

Edwards said the U.S. oil market remains in a wait-and-see mode since OPEC-Plus signaled it won’t exceed previously stated production levels and the EU agreed to long-term purchases of U.S. energy, which it likely would have done anyway.

“Ongoing uncertainty around tariffs is affecting U.S. oilfield equipment and materials,” he said.

Referring to the price of the futures contract closest to expiration, Edwards said, “Yes, prompt month oil prices have risen lately, but the 2- to 3-year forward average is still hovering around $65 per barrel, which is not enough to get most Permian and other shale producers excited.

“For new drilling activity to pick up meaningfully we’d need to see the strip closer to the mid-$70s.”

Until then, he said, American producers will likely continue to slow-walk new drilling and completions.

“There’s simply too much uncertainty for anyone to make long-term capital decisions with confidence,” Edwards said. “No independent U.S. oil company can reliably predict where prices are going, so the logical move is to hold back, watch how OPEC’s supply plays out, monitor EU energy commitments on oil and LNG and wait for clarity on tariffs.

“Only then will it make sense to ramp back up or continue easing off on rigs and frac crews.”

Perryman said the agreement with the EU is good news for the energy market and the economy.

“Although the tariffs are higher than in the past and result in some additional economic losses, they are lower than proposed and at least as importantly bring stability to a crucial U.S. trading relationship,” he said. “The proposed purchases of the EU of U.S. energy are not legally binding but are nonetheless an important signal that the U.S. is set to become the EU’s more important source of energy.”

Perryman said Russia filled a large role in supplying EU energy in the past, but clearly that is off the table and it’s good for the U.S. energy industry to be the intended supplier.

“Texas is already by far the largest state in terms of exports to the EU with 22% of the U.S. total and much of that is related to energy,” he said. “The energy sector will continue to face challenges such as future OPEC-Plus actions, worsening of the global economic outlook or a major change in any of several geopolitical conflicts.

“Moreover, the tariff picture is far from clear and additional uncertainty and threats are likely.”

Perryman said the OPEC-Plus production decision is a positive, but enforcement among the various nations involved has been a perennial problem and the current commitment is anything but permanent.

“Nonetheless, resolving the EU trade situation and recent production decisions are positive steps,” he said. “Better economic conditions around the globe appear to be surfacing, which increase demand for fuels and provide obvious benefits for the oil and gas industry.

“Once these positive trends begin to be seen in earnest, assuming we avoid any major tariff or other upheavals, we can begin to consider the industry ‘recovered’ at least for the moment.”",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/070522_OilArt_05-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 18:05:15.434626

With EV tax credits being phased out and tailpipe emissions regulations on the chopping block, we’re going to see far fewer electric cars hit the road in the coming years than previously expected.

That radically shifted outlook has had ripple effects across the EV industry, with automakers from Honda to Nissan canceling or delaying new models. But there’s one bright spot so far: Despite everything, the rapid buildout of EV fast chargers across the country isn’t letting up.

To get a sense of how one of the country’s largest EV charging companies is tackling this current moment, I called up Electrify America’s senior director of sales and marketing, Rachel Moses.

The bottom line? Despite some very real obstacles and a lot of noise, Electrify America isn’t pumping the brakes on its expansion plans one bit.

“Even though we are at this weird time where there are industry headwinds, it is also a really exciting time,” she told me. “Whilst there are market shifts, it’s not detrimental, perhaps, to the extent of which the noise is out there.”

Electrify America isn’t alone in keeping its foot on the accelerator. The U.S. is on track to put 16,700 new public chargers in the ground this year, a new record and a roughly 20% gain over last year’s deployments, according to the charging data firm Paren. Through the first half of this year, charging networks opened some 1,500 new locations in the U.S.

This is a win for both current and future EV owners. Concerns around access to charging infrastructure have consistently held back wider EV adoption. More stations and plugs out there could help entice more Americans to make the switch—particularly those who don’t have a garage to charge in.

EV sales will keep growing, creating demand for its charging stations, the company says.

Photo by: Electrify America

And it’s those new buyers that make Moses confident in Electrify America’s growth strategy.

Even if EV sales don’t grow as quickly over the next few years as they could have under the previous policy environment, millions more electric cars will hit the road. Those people will demand more and more charging options.

""Electrify America alone, one company, will not meet that demand. And so, in all of us together, I don’t think there’s any breathing room,” she said. “I think we all have to continue to make sure that we are investing to close that gap and to keep our pace of growth.”

The company’s forecast for EV market growth is “not as aggressive” in the next 2-3 years, but picks up after that, she told me. The last couple of years also hint at what the future holds for charging demand.

Over the last 18 months or so, EV sales growth has downshifted as early adopters gave way to more hesitant mainstream buyers. U.S. EV sales grew by a modest 7% in 2024 to hit 1.3 million units, after shooting up 46% in 2023. And yet, Electrify America says it dispensed over 600 gigawatts of energy in 2024, a 65% increase year-over-year. It logged 16 million charging sessions last year, up from 11 million in 2023.

“What we’re seeing is that that continues to increase. And that is a reflection of the attractiveness of the vehicles, the volume of vehicles that are still being sold,” Moses said.

Electrify America is focused on building larger stations in urban areas.

What about the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, or NEVI? This $5 billion project, passed under the Biden administration, funds the buildout of fast chargers along highways. Then the Trump administration came in and froze the funds for months, throwing the program into chaos. In June, a federal judge ordered the DOT to unfreeze the funds after 16 states sued. It’s still in legal limbo.

According to Moses, Electrify America did win some NEVI money, mostly on behalf of its commercial clients that it sells turnkey charging solutions to. “For the most part,” she says, those projects are receiving the funds they were awarded. The majority of the company’s own NEVI-funded projects are also underway, she said, though there is “a little bit of uncertainty.”

She says the NEVI funding is nice to have, but not make or break for Electrify America’s business.

“We continue to want to see that money being allocated and being spent for those projects, but the federal incentives themselves are not what our business is based on,” she told me. “So it hasn't had a direct negative consequence to our longevity and our business model and how we continue to grow and expand.” (To be sure, some smaller EV charging startups are more impacted by Trump’s funding cuts and freezes, as Heatmap News reported this week.)

The company is replacing old chargers that created reliability problems.

So what exactly does that growth and expansion look like?

After initially focusing on building out locations along highways when it launched in 2017, Electrify America is now zeroing in on bigger stations in urban areas. That means at least 10 chargers per site from now on—save for some smaller ones that are already in development—to help alleviate the lines that form at some of its busiest stations.

It’s also investing in upgrading old hardware that Moses says wasn’t up to snuff and contributed to reliability issues. It’s replaced around 1,800 chargers over the last 18 months. And it’s starting to expand its stations with the North American Charging Standard, or NACS, the Tesla-designed charging plug that is becoming the industry standard.

The company has two stations with NACS connectors right now: one in Florida and one in Connecticut. It’s evaluating the customer experience there and getting a sense of automakers’ plans for NACS-equipped models before deciding where else to install the plugs and how quickly to do it.

“We are committed to embracing the standard. There's no concern from that perspective,” she said. “It's about how we are deploying it and at what scale, at what time.”

The rough waters ahead for the EV industry are nothing to sneeze at. But for Moses, a 16-year veteran of the space, they aren’t entirely new either.

“We’ve seen these ups and downs in this industry over the last 15, 20 years, as long as it’s been a commercialized industry,” she said.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/nAqR11/s1/electrify-america-station.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 18:03:07.034087

But some answers are starting to emerge.

The tax, which aimed to penalize wind and solar projects that used parts from China and other U.S. adversaries, popped up in a late June draft of the Senate Finance Committee’s portion of the bill. It was panned by the industry and its backers as a “kill shot” and an attempt to further hobble wind and solar after ending the technologies’ tax credits.

Senators removed the tax days later, thanks to a push from some Republican clean energy supporters. But its journey to the bill remained a head-scratcher, with many lawmakers and observers pointing fingers and hazarding guesses about it, and no one taking credit.

“I brought it up at the lunch [soon after the text’s release] and leadership had not heard about it,” Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah), a key negotiator pushing to save renewable energy incentives, told our Kelsey Brugger.

“Some members of Finance got surprised when I brought it up.”

Kelsey spoke with lawmakers, congressional aides, lobbyists and others, and pieced together new details about what happened: Finance Committee staff worked and took meetings for more than a year, trying to find a policy to support domestic manufacturing jobs while rolling back the tax incentives in a way that Senate Republicans could support.

The aides came up with the tax after talking with the Joint Committee on Taxation and legislative counsel. But with President Donald Trump’s July 4 deadline for passing the bill fast approaching and staff juggling numerous other changes, the committee didn’t have time to discuss the ideas broadly and get consensus.

“It was a perfect MacGuffin for the most frenzied point in the process,” said Liam Donovan, a political strategist at the firm Bracewell. He called it a “reminder to industry that things could get worse.”

Adrian Deveny, founder of Climate Vision and a former top energy aide to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, said there “aren’t that many tools in the toolbox” if lawmakers want to reshore domestic manufacturing without the tax credits.

“The truth of how a lot of this stuff happens, much of the policy is not requested by a member, it’s committee staff, it’s not a new phenomenon,” Deveny added.

Senate GOP leadership referred questions to the Finance Committee, which did not return requests for comment.

Nonetheless, there was no shortage of finger-pointing around the excise tax. Prominent fossil fuel supporter Alex Epstein, who had been vocally pushing to end the tax credits quickly, was one person being blamed, but he said he opposed it.

“We don’t want to punish solar and wind, but we don’t want to give it special preferences,” he said, characterizing his advocacy.

The Solar Energy Manufacturers for America Coalition offered some support for the excise tax — but also wanted to retain the tax credits to incentivize domestic solar production.

But Mike Carr, the group’s executive director, said SEMA did not play a role in formulating it. “The first time we saw the excise tax provision was the same time as everyone else. We didn’t provide any input on that provision,” he said.

Full steam ahead for offshore wind project

The largest offshore wind project in the U.S. is on track to start producing electricity next year — a bright spot for an industry that has been under attack, Benjamin Storrow writes.

Dominion Energy officials said in an earnings call Friday that their project named Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind is 60 percent complete. And a turbine installation vessel that is the first American-flagged ship of its kind could arrive as soon as this month.

“This project remains consistent with the goal of securing American energy dominance and is part of our comprehensive all-of-the-above strategy to affordably meet growing energy needs,” Dominion CEO Robert Blue said on the call, echoing Trump’s language.

FEMA boss has two jobs

The acting head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency also holds a senior position at the Department of Homeland Security, raising questions about disaster response as hurricanes enter their most active season, Thomas Frank writes.

DHS oversees both FEMA and the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office, and the department confirmed to Tom that David Richardson leads both.

Trump appointed Richardson in January to oversee the DHS weapons office and put him in charge of FEMA in May. At the time, the president did mention Richardson’s status at DHS.

Heading FEMA “is 24/7, every day of the year and requires your full attention every single day, every single minute,” said Peter Gaynor, who led the agency in Trump’s first term.

CO2 storage site gets ready to reopen

Archer-Daniels-Midland expects to resume carbon dioxide injections later this summer at an Illinois site that was shuttered last year after a possible leak was detected, Carlos Anchondo writes.

The company is the first to operate this kind of permanent storage site under EPA permitting. The well was regularly being injected with 2,000 metric tons of CO2 before EPA sent the company a notice of violation last September. The agency at the time said ADM had failed to comply with the terms of its permit.

ADM is still in talks with EPA about meeting the compliance measures for the site.

“We take our commitment to safety and being transparent in reports we submit to the government and in relevant information we share with stakeholders very seriously,” ADM spokesperson Jackie Anderson said in a statement.

Radiant Rays, you weren’t just told to sit quietly and take notes.","Halifax County Commissioner Gary Redding knows the real challenges his county faces, he said at the Center for Energy Education during a symposium in which a group of students called the Radiant Rays presented the results of their summer research project.

As the keynote speaker for the event today, he also said he knows the county has real assets.

The challenges, he said, include aging infrastructure, workforce development, and economic mobility.

The assets, he said, “Are people who care, who show up, and who want to build a stronger future together.”

He said renewable energy is more than just an environmental issue. “It’s an opportunity for economic development, energy savings and jobs that don’t leave our young people behind.”

Success, he said, “Depends on local voices shaping the process.”

Addressing the audience, he said, “As a community, we have a responsibility to invest in our youth — not just with words, but with action. That’s why I successfully proposed the creation of a county recreation department and dedicated staff in Halifax County. My hope is that we can partner with the Center for Energy Education to incorporate renewable energy into our recreational facilities and programs so young people grow up seeing sustainability as a part of everyday life.”

He said, however, “Some of the loudest conversations happening in our communities aren’t focused on young people at all. We can’t say we care about our youth while cutting education budgets, canceling almost $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks, including ours in Tillery, to buy food from local farmers, ranchers and producers, banning books, or prioritizing culture wars over access to affordable healthcare.”

Redding said, “We have to do better and that starts by making youth development a real priority — not just a talking point. That’s exactly what this program models.”

What he likes best about the Radiant Rays “is that it gives students the opportunity to lead. Radiant Rays, you weren’t just told to sit quietly and take notes. You were encouraged to dig in, ask questions and to shape ideas.”

That belief in youth leadership is why he is launching a junior county commissioners club so high school students can understand how local government works, how policy is made, and how they can get involved — “Not just years from now.”

As an instructor at Halifax Community College, Redding said he tries to bring the real world into the classroom. “One way I do this is by challenging students to write grant proposals in my English 112 class that uses clean energy to repurpose vacant or abandoned buildings.”

Students have proposed transforming unused structures into medical clinics, affordable housing, mixed use developments, and community recreation centers powered by renewable energy and built with long-term sustainability in mind. “These ideas just aren’t creative. They show how renewable energy can directly serve the needs of underserved neighborhoods while revitalizing forgotten spaces.”

That, Redding said, is, “exactly what the Radiant Rays have done — taken knowledge, connected it with local reality and created something that can spread meaningful conversations and ideas moving forward.”

Halifax County and other counties like it, “Don’t have to be left behind. In fact, we can lead. We have the land, the people, the values and the potential. What we need is continued investment in education, our economy, clean energy, strong partnerships and, above all, people like the Radiant Rays.”

Said Redding: “Imagine a Halifax County where every student sees a future here, where every abandoned building holds new life, and where every policy decision considers the long-term good. That’s not just a dream. It’s a direction and together we can move in that direction with purpose.”",https://www.rrspin.com/images/8125redding.jpeg,N,,2025-08-01 18:03:20.513968

The story is being republished here via a collaborative agreement between Signal and Source Media Properties.

New natural gas-fired power plants in Ohio, built solely to fuel data centers owned by the likes of Google and Amazon, are eligible to take advantage of a huge state sales tax break, state officials said Tuesday, hitting several lawmakers and lobbyists by surprise.

This means Ohio could lose out on millions of dollars of tax revenue from two booming industries – big data and natural gas – at a time when state lawmakers are already slashing revenues through income tax cuts.

Plus, it’s yet another public subsidy for the data center industry, which lawmakers, regulators, grid operators and utility officials have warned are demanding more energy than the regional electric grid is equipped to supply, a dynamic likely to drive electricity prices upward.

The tax break at issue dates back to 2013, when Ohio sought to lure major technology companies to build data centers here through different tax incentives. But language in that law, which predates the modern era of massive data centers at the heart of the artificial intelligence boom, stretches the definition of “data center” to include natural gas generation plants on site owned by the technology companies.

“I was unaware of this. I don’t think it was ever brought up,” Rep. Roy Klopfenstein, a Paulding County Republican who sponsored a major overhaul of Ohio’s energy policy earlier this year, said in a phone call.

The legislation Klopfenstein sponsored, among other changes, set new rules for such “behind the meter” natural gas plants for data centers’ private use. It also decreased property tax rates for newly built natural gas plants. Both changes were aimed to attract development of natural gas generators in Ohio, in part because of the new energy demand brought by the data centers themselves.

In hours and hours of testimony on the legislation, plus dozens of private meetings, he said the apparent sales tax exemption for behind the meter natural gas plants never came up once. Other policy analysts and lobbyists contacted by Signal Ohio expressed surprise to hear about the seemingly new tax break.

Big data, big costs

Ohio offers a full or partial exemption to the state’s 5.75% sales tax to large data centers approved by state officials. But the legal definition of data centers includes all property used “to generate, transform, transmit, distribute, or manage electricity necessary to operate … a computer data center business.”

Data centers in the state, which use massive amounts of energy, have recently begun the process of building their own power sources. If a data center has won approval for the sales tax exemption, the break would apply for costs to build both the data center and a gas power plant they own, according to Andrea Lannom, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Taxation, in response to questions from Signal Ohio.

The change means a tax break designed for data centers now extends to the investors behind natural gas plants as well.

State estimates say Ohio will waive $127 million in sales taxes for data centers this year alone, an estimate that predates the behind-the-meter generation projects.

Since Jan. 1, developers have asked state officials for permits to build six new gas plants on data center campuses. These facilities could be eligible to save tens of millions in sales taxes.

No financial estimate is available for the value of the tax credit to the generation plants. But in 2023, it cost about $1,250 per kilowatt to build a plant, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The plants now in the development queue for private use range from 200 to 1600 kilowatts.

Gov. Mike DeWine saved the tax break with veto pen

Earlier this year, Republicans in the statehouse voted to repeal the data center tax exemption, which also would have repealed the exemption for natural gas plants owned by the same facility.

However, Gov. Mike DeWine, also a Republican, vetoed the provision, citing the economic importance of the data centers.

The facilities – jumbles of racks, cooling equipment, and servers spread over stadium-sized campuses – consume vast sums of energy. Grid officials and state policy makers have expressed concern for years that their demand could outstrip the available power supply over the next decade. And ratepayer advocates have warned of risks that residential ratepayers get stuck paying the costs of grid investments that are only necessary because of the new data centers.

Dan Tierney, a spokesman for DeWine, said the governor supports the growing data center industry, which is coming to rely on independent power generation to remain viable. Other states offer a similar tax credit, he said, and getting rid of it would chase off that investment.

“So the bottom line is, if you’re not going to support any piece of this, it’s going to undermine the state’s ability to compete for these projects,” he said.

Six new gas plants apply to power data centers

This year alone, six data centers have announced plans or asked the Ohio Power Siting Board for permission to build. That includes:

The AlphaStruxure Millersport, a 1600 megawatt behemoth planned in Fairfield County

The Bluegrass Power Generation Facility Project in Fayette County, a 400 megawatt project that might add another 400 megawatts down the line

The PowerConneX II New Albany Energy Center project, a 216 megawatt project to power an EdgeConneX data center

The Socrates North and Socrates South projects, both 200 megawatts, to power a Meta (parent company of Facebook) data center.

Tax breaks for data centers, gas plants ‘no longer necessary,’ top Republican says

House Speaker Matt Huffman said through a spokesman that he supports ending the sales tax break for gas plants on data centers, which is “no longer necessary” given other tax breaks for new generation plants “and the dramatic expansion of data centers throughout Ohio.” He has said he’s interested in overriding the veto, but hasn’t announced any specific plan to do so.

A spokesman for Senate President Rob McColley didn’t respond to inquiries.

The Data Center Coalition, an industry trade association, declined to comment.

Data centers get local tax breaks too

There are 188 data centers in Ohio, mostly around Columbus, according to Data Center Maps, an industry consultancy. Besides the sales tax breaks, the facility owners regularly strike property tax abatement deals with local governments, lasting 15 to 30 years.

As just one example of the favorable tax treatment, take the $420 million Microsoft facility planned over 200 acres of New Albany, in Central Ohio. Last year, the New Albany City Council approved a 15-year, 100% property tax abatement deal for the facility.

That same month, the state Tax Credit Authority gave the company a 100% sales tax exemption for 15 years, in exchange for a commitment to create 20 full-time jobs. Estimates from Policy Matters Ohio, a progressive economic think tank, peg the value of the credit for Microsoft at $72.5 million.

Now, if Microsoft were to build a power plant on site, it too could avoid the sales taxes on costs of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in equipment to build a generation apparatus. Plus, that power plant would also pay a lower property tax rate, thanks to the energy legislation Klopfenstein sponsored.

Sales tax exemption has strings attached

While the behind-the-meter gas plants are eligible for the sales tax exemption, they aren’t guaranteed to receive it.

The data centers must win approval for a full or partial sales tax exemption from the Tax Credit Review Authority, a panel of gubernatorial appointees. That exemption would apply to both the data center, and any behind-the-meter generation.

First Hydrogen Corp., a Vancouver-based company, is teaming up with the University of Alberta to explore the potential of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) as a sustainable power source for large-scale hydrogen production. This partnership represents a significant step in the quest for low-carbon energy solutions, with a focus on producing “green” hydrogen—hydrogen generated without emitting carbon dioxide. This ambitious endeavor comes at a time when energy demands are escalating, driven largely by the needs of artificial intelligence and data centers, which are projected to consume a substantial portion of the world’s electricity by 2030.

Understanding the SMR Advantage

Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are gaining attention for their potential to revolutionize the nuclear energy sector. Unlike traditional nuclear plants, which generate power at gigawatt scales, SMRs produce only a few hundred megawatts. Their compact design allows them to be manufactured as modules, easily transported by truck or barge, and assembled on-site. This modular approach offers several advantages, including reduced construction times and lower upfront costs.

Advocates of SMRs argue that their smaller size makes them ideal for locations where conventional reactors would be impractical. They can be installed at industrial sites, remote towns, or mining operations. Additionally, their simplified designs, often placed underground, aim to enhance safety and extend operational cycles between refueling. With a 60-year safety track record from its CANDU reactors, Canada is well-positioned to lead in SMR technology. The Canadian government views SMRs as a key component of future energy independence, with plans for multiple projects across different provinces.

Nuclear-Powered Hydrogen: A Vision for the Future

The integration of nuclear power into the hydrogen production process offers a promising path toward sustainable energy. First Hydrogen Corp. is exploring how SMRs can provide a stable and low-carbon energy source for producing hydrogen. This initiative aligns with the company’s broader Hydrogen-as-a-Service model, which envisions fleets of hydrogen-powered vehicles refueling at company-owned hubs.

The company’s collaboration with the University of Alberta involves refining reactor fuels, core materials, and overall plant design to optimize SMRs for hydrogen production. By leveraging nuclear energy, First Hydrogen aims to mitigate the challenges posed by volatile electricity prices and the intermittency of renewable sources. This approach holds the potential to revolutionize the way hydrogen is produced, making it a viable and competitive alternative to fossil fuels.

Challenges and Opportunities Ahead

While the promise of SMRs and nuclear-powered hydrogen is compelling, significant challenges remain. Regulatory hurdles and financing questions loom large, as the nuclear sector is heavily regulated to ensure safety and environmental compliance. Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of carbon-free, round-the-clock power have captured the interest of utilities and heavy industries worldwide.

First Hydrogen’s exploration of SMR technology is part of a broader trend toward sustainable energy solutions. The company’s decision to collaborate with Canadian academia and industry experts underscores the importance of interdisciplinary approaches in tackling complex energy challenges.

The Broader Implications for Energy and Mobility

The integration of SMRs into hydrogen production could have far-reaching implications for the energy and mobility sectors. As data centers and AI technologies drive up electricity demand, the need for reliable and sustainable energy sources becomes increasingly urgent. SMRs offer a potential solution by providing consistent and low-carbon power, which is crucial for supporting the growing digital infrastructure.

Moreover, the successful implementation of nuclear-powered hydrogen production could accelerate the transition to zero-emission transport. First Hydrogen’s experience with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles demonstrates the feasibility of this technology, and the addition of nuclear power to the supply chain could further enhance its viability. As the world grapples with climate change and energy security, innovative solutions like these are essential for building a sustainable future.

The collaboration between First Hydrogen Corp. and the University of Alberta represents a significant step toward realizing the potential of SMRs and hydrogen as key components of a sustainable energy future. As these technologies continue to develop, they may offer new opportunities for reducing carbon emissions and meeting the growing energy demands of an increasingly digital world. What other innovative collaborations might emerge as industries seek to address the challenges of climate change and energy sustainability?

It's part of a production shift powered by a $1.4 billion investment, according to the Detroit Free Press.

The stored cleaner solar and wind power can be used to charge EVs in remote locations and for much-needed grid support, per the Free Press.

""We have a solution: We can provide energy storage in any location where the energy is being used,"" LG North American President Bob Lee said in the story. The growth has given the location enough production ability to power 165,000 EVs a year.

The news comes amid changing government policy that's creating uncertainty in the sector. President Donald Trump's recently passed spending bill eliminates tax incentives for clean energy projects as part of a plan friendlier to dirty fuels, NPR reported.

LG's effort started before the incentives were in place under the previous administration. Company leaders added to it when the perks were passed in 2022.

And while the latest bill guts EV and solar incentives, battery storage credits remain. Now, LG must figure out how its project fits into the new policy's provisions. LG has been making EV batteries in Holland since 2012, according to Columbia Business School and Free Press reporting.

The expansion is also an effort to secure a domestic manufacturing base for a unique pack chemistry. LG now has the first American plant producing promising lithium-iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries, per the Free Press and Canary Media.

​""It's a testament and demonstration of the industry's commitment to onshoring manufacturing and ramping it up in short order,"" Noah Roberts, vice president for energy storage at the American Clean Power Association, told Canary.

The report added that the U.S. has had to rely on China for LFPs, though Samsung and other well-known companies are developing the tech as well. LFPs are billed as being safer, cheaper, and more durable to heat and high voltage. Slower cold-weather charging, shorter range, and lower storage capacity per pound have been hurdles, Recurrent reported.

But breakthroughs are improving the tech. LG is cutting production costs by going with LFPs, which should translate into less expensive EVs. The battery accounts for more than a third of the cost, per the Free Press.

LG, based in South Korea, is also planning some new batteries using other chemistry types as part of ongoing innovation, the report continued.

Battery storage is crucial to the shift to cleaner, renewable energy. Tesla Megapacks are already deployed around the world, providing grid-boosting power. A group of eight automakers has joined forces on a plan to bring 30,000 EV fast-charging stations to America within five years.

The investments are key to providing cleaner energy and transportation, which reduces heat-trapping air pollution generated by burning nonrenewable sources. Each EV that replaces a gas car prevents thousands of pounds of planet-warming tailpipe fumes each year. The exhaust includes carcinogens and increases other health risks, according to government-cited studies and data.

EVs bought before Sept. 30 still qualify for up to $7,500 in tax rebates for certain new models. Up to $1,500 in yearly gas and service savings can be heightened by charging the ride with a household solar panel setup. EnergySage is a vetted service that can help you source quotes, lock in incentives while they last, and save thousands on upfront costs.

In Michigan, efforts to move the industry forward continue. The expanded LG site covers the equivalent of 42 football fields, employing 1,700 people at full tilt, per Canary.

The decision affects the automaker’s EQ models, including the EQS Sedan, EQS SUV, EQE Sedan, and EQE SUV. Vehicles already scheduled for delivery before September 1 will still reach customers, though.

Mercedes Confirms EV Pause in the US

According to reports, a Mercedes spokesperson cited “market conditions” as reason behind the move. The representative explained that with over 30 production facilities worldwide, including plants in Alabama and South Carolina, the luxury brand aims to optimize its network by balancing export demands and local market trends.

Mercedes declined to offer any timeline for the resumption of its EQ production in the US. It maintained silence on the matter “for competitive reasons.”

A Huge Blow to Mercedes’ EV Ambitions in the US

The pause follows a significant cool down in Mercedes’ EV sales. In its Q2 earnings report, the company revealed a nearly 25% drop in battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales year-over-year, falling from 45,843 units to 35,027 units.

The slump was a huge setback in the company’s EV ambitions in the US market after huge expectations during the launch production of the EQS SUV and EQE SUV in Alabama in 2022. The Mercedes-Maybach EQS SUV also made it in the US due to the automaker’s positive projections in 2023.

The decision comes amid broader headwinds for EVs in the US. A recent spending bill signed by President Donald Trump eliminated a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, effective September 30.

Industry analysts had warned that losing this incentive could dampen consumer interest, impacting not only Mercedes but also competitors like Tesla and General Motors. North American EV sales grew by just 5% in the first four months of 2024, lagging behind Europe’s 25% and China’s 35%, according to Rho Motion.

Optimism Remains

Despite the setback, Mercedes remains optimistic about the future of EVs in America. During the company’s earnings call, a representative expressed confidence that demand will recover over the medium to long term, albeit potentially at a slower pace without the tax credit.

“We don’t believe BEV demand in the US will drop to zero,” the representative noted, signaling Mercedes’ commitment to its electric future despite the current slowdown.",http://www.benzinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Mercedes-EV.webp,N,,2025-08-01 17:04:00.264548

U.S. Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin of Illinois were among 17 senators who signed a letter earlier this week urging the Trump administration to reinstate Environmental Protection Agency employees placed on leave after they signed a statement criticizing the administration for “recklessly undermining the EPA mission.”

“We urge you to restore these employees to active service immediately and affirm your employees’ ability to express their viewpoints without fear of retaliation, because debate and dissent are valuable policymaking tools,” the senators wrote in a Wednesday letter, which was addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

About 140 EPA workers, including some in the Chicago area, were placed on administrative leave in early July for signing a letter addressed to Zeldin titled, “Declaration of Dissent,” which laid out how they believed various policies by the Trump administration undermined the agency’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.

An EPA spokesperson said in a statement the agency has a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting” the Trump administration’s agenda.

Employees were notified that they had been placed in a “temporary, non-duty, paid status” for the next two weeks, pending an “administrative investigation,” according to a copy of the email obtained by The Associated Press. “It is important that you understand that this is not a disciplinary action,” the email read.

The senators argued in their letter federal employees are permitted to speak out on matters of public concern in their personal capacities, even in dissent, because the First Amendment protects their speech. The senators also noted the EPA initially indicated concluding its investigation on July 17, with reports indicating it was then extended through Friday.

“We trust that once your investigation is complete, you will reinstate the EPA employee signatories to active service immediately and take steps to protect workers from retaliation when exercising their First Amendment rights,” the letter read.

In their “declaration of dissent,” EPA employees described how the Trump administration has undermined the EPA mission through its embrace of a “fossil fuel-powered auto industry,” cuts to the agency’s workforce and grants, along with actions that “contradict EPA’s own scientific assessments on human health risks,” particularly regarding asbestos, mercury and greenhouse gases.

Environmental advocates, elected leaders and EPA workers gathered at Federal Plaza downtown Monday ahead of the Trump administration’s now proposed repeal of a landmark federal determination that allows the EPA to help combat climate change.

Loreen Targos, executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704 union, said Monday the “endangerment finding” has allowed the EPA to regulate man-made contributors of climate change, including carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

“The rate of climate change is accelerating beyond what scientists have said is safe for the species alive on this earth, including humanity,” Targos said. “I see the rate of extreme storms that are supposed to be 1,000-year floods happening every year, the intensity of hurricanes and how they’ve changed in these ways that even our strongest predictions didn’t predict.”

Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China.
It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations.","During the cold war, the United States and Soviet Union were locked in a desperate race to develop cutting‑edge technologies like long-range missiles and satellites. Fast forward to today and the frontiers of global technology have pivoted to artificial intelligence (AI) and next‑generation energy.

In one domain, AI, the U.S. has far outpaced any other nation – though China looks to be closing the gap. In the other, energy, the U.S. has just tied its shoelaces together. The reason isn’t technology, economics or, despite the government’s official line, even national security. Rather, it is politics.

Since returning to the White House in January, Donald Trump has handed out huge wins to the coal and oil and gas industries. This is no great surprise. Trump has long been supportive of the U.S. fossil fuel industry and, since his reelection, has appointed several former industry lobbyists to top political positions.

According to the Trump administration, national security requires gutting support for renewable energy while performing political CPR on the dying coal industry.

The reality is that, since 2019, the United States has produced more oil, gas, and coal annually than Americans want to use, with the rest exported and sold overseas. The U.S. is currently one of the most prolific exporters of fossil fuels in the world.

In short, the U.S. does not have an energy security problem. It does, however, have an energy cost problem combined with a growing climate change crisis. These issues will only be made worse by Trump’s enthusiasm for fossil fuels.

Over the past six months, the Trump administration has upended half a decade of green industrial policy. It has clawed back billions of U.S. dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.

Meanwhile, China has roared forward. Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined. To China’s delight, the U.S. has simply stopped competing to be the world’s clean energy powerhouse.

While Trump repeats the tired mantra of “drill, baby, drill,” China is building factories, cornering the market for critical minerals such as lithium and nickel, and locking in export partners. Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China. Many of the newest high‑tech batteries are also being developed and patented there.

At the same time, household energy spending in the U.S. is expected to increase by $170 each year between now and 2035 as a result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The bill, which includes sweeping changes to taxes, social security, and more, will raise energy costs mainly because it strips away support for cheap and abundant renewables like wind and solar.

Household energy costs could go up even more as Trump threatens to make large‑scale clean energy development much more onerous by putting up bureaucratic hurdles. The administration recently issued a directive requiring the secretary of the interior to approve even routine activities for wind and solar projects connected to federal lands.

Meanwhile, climate change is hitting American communities harder with each passing year. As recent flooding in Texas and urban fires in California and Hawai‘i have shown, fewer Americans still have the luxury of ignoring climate change.

As the cost of these disasters mount – $183 billion in 2024 – the grifting of the oil and gas industry will become an increasingly bitter pill for the nation to swallow.

China, with its authoritarian government, is less susceptible to the petroleum-obsessed dogma fueling the Republican party. It does not have prominent leaders like U.S. politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, who previously warned that Democrats are trying to “emasculate the way we drive” by advocating for electric vehicles. Rather, China’s leaders are seeing green – not in the environmental sense, but in a monetary one.

It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations. According to a June 2025 report by Lazard, an asset management company, electricity from new large-scale solar farms costs up to $78 per megawatt hour – and often much less. The same electricity from a newly built natural gas plants, by comparison, can cost as much as $107 per megawatt hour.

Across the world, utilities are embracing clean energy, choosing lower costs for their customers while reducing pollution. China saw the writing on the wall decades ago, and its early investments are bearing a rich harvest. It now produces more than half of the world’s electric vehicles and the vast majority of its solar panels.

The United States can still compete at the leading edge of the energy sector. American companies are developing innovative new approaches to geothermal, battery recycling, and many other energy technologies.

But in the battle to become the world’s 21st-century energy manufacturing powerhouse, the U.S. seems to have walked off the playing field.

In Trump’s telling, the U.S. may have simply exited one race and reentered another. But the fossil fuel industry – financially, environmentally and ethically – is obviously a dead end.",https://thediplomat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/sizes/td-story-s-2/thediplomat_2025-06-23-143232.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 19:02:32.233366

August 1, 2025 California Air Resources Board

1001 I Street

Sacramento, CA 95814

Dear Chair Randolph and Members of the Air Resources Board:

As the Federal government continues to gut critical climate regulation and defund clean energy projects, the undersigned organizations urge the California Air Resources Board to recommend and adopt transformative clean vehicle policies that reduce tailpipe emissions through electrification, clean up the supply chain, while creating sustainable and long-lasting good union jobs.

While vehicle electrification is essential to reducing transportation-sector emissions, it is not enough to meet California’s climate goals on its own. The full climate impact of electric vehicles (EVs) depends not just on how they operate, but also on how they’re made. Without targeted policy intervention, auto manufacturers will continue to source emissions-intensive materials like coal-based steel and rely on outdated, opaque battery supply chains. Embodied emissions, the greenhouse gas emissions generated during the extraction, processing, and manufacturing of materials, can account for a substantial portion of an EV’s total lifecycle emissions. In fact, steel production alone is responsible for 30% to 50% of a vehicle’s manufacturing-related emissions. If California fails to establish strong demand signals or procurement standards that prioritize low-carbon materials, clean steel and ethical battery sourcing will continue to play only a marginal role in vehicle manufacturing.

California is uniquely positioned to lead the way in decarbonizing vehicle materials, starting with steel. The state’s steel sector already relies almost entirely on electric arc furnace technology, which uses recycled scrap instead of carbon-intensive virgin iron ore. When paired with California’s low-carbon electricity grid, this process yields steel with significantly lower embodied carbon intensity than conventionally produced alternatives. California is also emerging as a hub for next-generation clean steel production, with two major initiatives underway: Pacific Steel Group’s Mojave Micro Mill, which will be the first “zero process carbon emissions” melting and rolling facility in the state, and a pilot project involving U.S. Steel, Molten Industries, and CPFD Software that aims to develop near-zero emissions iron reduction. These innovations position California to demonstrate scalable pathways for clean steel manufacturing, but policy support will be necessary to accelerate market adoption and direct demand toward in-state producers.

The state’s growing EV battery industry presents a similar opportunity and challenge. Although California has made notable investments in lithium extraction and battery innovation, it still lacks robust policy tools to ensure these developments align with climate, labor, and environmental justice priorities. Globally, up to half of battery lifecycle emissions stem from mineral processing, much of which occurs overseas under limited environmental oversight. At the same time, California’s battery sector is rapidly expanding, with companies like QuantumScape and Amprius Technologies pioneering solid-state and silicon-anode technologies, respectively, and infrastructure like Sparkz’s new Sacramento plant supporting domestic production of key materials.

To ensure that EVs deliver their full climate benefit, California must adopt policies that strengthen oversight, incentivize low-carbon sourcing, and direct public support to battery supply chains that are not only efficient but also sustainable and ethically aligned. Additionally, policies aimed at reducing emissions in the steel and battery supply chains open an opportunity to bring cutting-edge technology to California while creating good union jobs.

We believe that California has the ability to position itself as a global leader for the deployment of innovative technologies for decarbonized steel and battery supply chains.

Given the necessity of policies that address not only vehicle tailpipe emissions, but also embodied emissions, we ask that CARB consider the following policy options:

Assess the Feasibility of Embodied Emissions Policy: Sponsor a feasibility study to analyze the policy opportunities to incentivize cleaner production of batteries and primary steel and/or mandate the use of lower-carbon primary steel and batteries in vehicles and other infrastructure and transportation projects. As precedent, the CalEPA contracted with the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies and the University of California Santa Barbara to conduct two studies funded by the state of California:

The ITS demand-side study, “Driving California’s Transportation Emissions to Zero,” identifies strategies to significantly reduce transportation-related fossil fuel demand and emissions.

The UCSB supply-side study, “Enhancing equity while eliminating emissions in California’s supply of transportation fuels,” analyzed several tools to reduce in-state fossil fuel extraction in parallel with the demand reductions modeled in the ITS study.

Subsidies: Assess the feasibility of creating additional subsidies for vehicles with lower lifecycle emissions aligned with targeted goals for the steel and battery supply chains.

Disclosure of Disaggregated Scope 3 Emissions: Disclosure of Scope 3 emissions is key to understanding the embodied emissions of electric vehicles and assessing the efficacy of policy interventions. As an extension of SB253, CARB should consider requiring or incentivizing disaggregated emissions disclosure for targeted vehicle supply chains such as steel, aluminum, and batteries.

Promoting High-Road Labor Standards: Further, To support momentum in the EV industry, threatened by the repeal of Federal EV Tax Credits, and empower Californians to purchase high quality EVs that are manufactured responsibly, the state of California should develop a consumer EV tax credit program that makes purchasing EVs for Californian families more accessible while rewarding manufacturers committed to curbing the impacts of climate change and creating high quality jobs across the supply chain of electric vehicles. To incentivize the creation of safe, high quality, green jobs with family sustaining wages throughout the auto manufacturing supply chain, manufacturers must obtain certification of eligibility for EV Tax Credits or rebates. In order to apply for eligibility for a vehicle model, a manufacturer must:

Certify that their vehicles are not manufactured through the use of any forced labor or child labor.

For each vehicle seeking eligibility for the tax credit program, manufacturers should be required to disclose 1) the location of the domestic facility where manufacturing occurs, 2) the number of workers employed at the facility, and 3) the minimum wage/salary paid to each classification of manufacturing workers at the facility.

Certify that the following requirements are met as they pertain to the manufacture of vehicles seeking eligibility for the tax credits:

All workers employed by the manufacturer, suppliers, staffing firms, or other agents employing those performing work related to the manufacturing of the vehicles and their parts are paid compensation equal to that of comparable workers and no less than the applicable federal, state, or local minimum wage, whichever is greater.

All workers employed by the manufacturer, suppliers, staffing firms, or other agents employing those performing work related to the manufacturing of the vehicles and their parts shall be placed in the proper employment classification as either employees or independent contractors.

The manufacturer, suppliers, staffing firms, or other agents employing those performing work related to the manufacturing of the vehicles and their parts are prohibited from using misleading or fraudulent practices during recruitment of employees including making misrepresentations regarding their wages and fringe benefits, job duties, work locations, living conditions in employer provided housing, costs charged to employees, and hazardous nature of the work.

The manufacturer, suppliers, staffing firms, or other agents employing those performing work related to the manufacturing of the vehicles and their parts shall comply with all applicable safety and health requirements and shall comply with sections 6310 and 6311 of the California Labor Code, pertaining to protection of employees who file complaints or refuse to work in the face of hazardous conditions.

California has long led the nation in climate policy and clean transportation innovation. By adopting forward-looking policies that reduce embodied emissions in vehicles, the state can extend its leadership to the upstream supply chain, accelerating decarbonization, supporting domestic manufacturing, and delivering real economic and environmental benefits to California communities.

These actions are not only necessary to meet the state’s climate commitments, but they also represent a strategic opportunity to build a cleaner, more resilient, and more equitable transportation future. We urge CARB to move swiftly and decisively to consider these policies outlined above in its recommendations.

Sincerely,

Solar panels generate energy from the sun; and turbines generate energy from the wind; so perhaps it’s logical to conclude that clean energy technology is pointless at night and during calm skies.
But power grid operators have always had to deal with variability.
Many forms of power generation can unexpectedly trip offline without notice and some only produce power at certain times.
There is also uncertainty due to ever-changing loads (energy demand) that cannot be perfectly predicted.","Donald Trump has railed against clean energy technology for years, and when targeting solar and wind power, the president has routinely repeated a familiar mistake: After sundown or when the wind isn’t blowing, those energy sources are practically useless.

He’s not, however, the only Republican who’s expressed confusion about this. The Washington Post’s Marc Thiessen, George W. Bush’s former chief speechwriter and a Fox News contributor, told a national television audience last week, “Just so people understand, wind and solar only work when there is wind and sun. We don’t have technology to store the energy from wind and solar.”

A week later, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum pushed similar rhetoric during an on-air Fox Business interview.

“Of course, when the sun goes down, you have a catastrophic failure called ‘sunset’ and there’s no solar energy produced,” the Cabinet secretary claimed, “and yet we’re subsidizing these things that are intermittent, unreliable and expensive.”

For casual viewers watching these interviews, that rhetoric might seem compelling. Solar panels generate energy from the sun; and turbines generate energy from the wind; so perhaps it’s logical to conclude that clean energy technology is pointless at night and during calm skies.

There’s just one problem: Battery technology exists. As MSNBC host Catherine Rampell explained in a Washington Post column last year:

Growth in clean-electricity generation is a longer-term trend driven largely by technological improvements that have improved solar’s and wind’s cost-competitiveness. But recent policy changes, such Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, have also accelerated development. The same forces are boosting battery development, which is helping solve intermittency problems caused by relying on wind or solar when the weather doesn’t cooperate. The Energy Information Administration recently forecast that U.S. battery storage capacity will nearly double [in 2024] alone.

If the GOP response is that battery storage technology is still in the process of advancing, that’s fine. I’ll gladly concede the point.

But as some Republicans seem inclined to pretend that batteries don’t exist at all, I came across an FAQ that the right should find interesting.

The U.S. power grid consists of a huge number of interconnected transmission lines that connect a variety of generation sources to loads. The wind does not always blow, and the sun does not always shine, which creates additional variability and uncertainty (as nobody can perfectly forecast wind or solar output). But power grid operators have always had to deal with variability. Many forms of power generation can unexpectedly trip offline without notice and some only produce power at certain times. There is also uncertainty due to ever-changing loads (energy demand) that cannot be perfectly predicted.

The same online document added, “Grid operators use the interconnected power system to access other forms of generation when contingencies occur and continually turn generators on and off when needed to meet the overall grid demand. Integrating variable renewable power to the grid does not change how this process of balancing electricity supply and demand works.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-04/240422-solar-panels-kentucky-mn-0835-9f5ad0.jpg",N,,2025-08-01 17:01:33.610102

US District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Tyler, Texas, agreed to dismiss just three of the 21 counts in the states’ lawsuit, that also names institutional investors State Street and Vanguard.

The lawsuit is among the highest-profile cases targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the three companies “created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans,” and that “today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable.”

The three asset managers said they would continue to defend against the claims, with Vanguard calling the ruling disappointing, and State Street calling the case a risk to investors and energy markets.

“By pursuing forced divestment, the Attorneys General are undermining the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” BlackRock said.

The ruling by Kernodle, who was appointed by President Trump, means the states can move forward with their claims that the asset managers violated US antitrust law by joining Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative to take action to combat climate change, and used their shareholder advocacy in furtherance of its goals.

Kernodle, however, dismissed claims that the asset managers violated Louisiana and Nebraska consumer protection laws.

The companies have denied wrongdoing and called the case “half-baked.” But the states’ theories garnered support from Trump-appointed antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission.

The outcome of the lawsuit could have major implications for how the companies, which together manage some $27 trillion, approach their holdings and passive funds.

One possible remedy sought by the plaintiffs would be for the fund firms to divest holdings in coal companies, which BlackRock has said would harm the companies’ access to capital and likely raise energy prices.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/blackrock-larry-fink-climate.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1754055480&w=1024,N,,2025-08-01 16:05:21.093743

Some members of the Chief of Staff Office and the Ministry of Transport reportedly side with the business sector on this issue.
Another section likely to be vetoed concerns the distribution of environmental licensing authority across different levels of government.
The document was prepared by the Office for the Environment and Cultural Heritage, the Office for Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities, and the Office for the Protection of Citizens’ Rights, all part of the Office of the Prosecutor General (PGR).
Among the contested provisions are the creation of more “permissive” licensing categories, exemptions from licensing for sectors such as agribusiness and infrastructure, and the automatic renewal of environmental licenses.","The environmental wing of Brazil’s government plans to recommend that President Lula partially veto the new environmental licensing law. The proposal, to be presented Monday (4), includes introducing new bills, or even a provisional presidential decree, to replace sections expected to be struck down. Mr. Lula has until August 8 to sanction the bill.

The Ministry of Environment and Climate Change, led by Marina Silva, believes the legislation passed by Congress two weeks ago should not be entirely vetoed, Valor learned. Environmentalists, however, have strongly criticized the bill and continue to call for a full veto.

One of the most controversial provisions expected to face a veto is the nationwide adoption of the License by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC), a self-declared environmental permit that does not require prior approval from environmental authorities

Marina Silva’s ministry is working on an alternative bill that would allow the LAC only for projects deemed to have “low environmental impact.” Several Brazilian states—including São Paulo, Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, and Bahia—already use this mechanism for low-impact developments.

However, the version approved by Congress extends the LAC to some projects classified as having “medium impact,” which the Federal Supreme Court (STF) has already ruled unconstitutional in previous state-level laws.

Lula has until August 8 to decide on environmental licensing bill

Marina Silva said her ministry is completing a technical review of the legislation in coordination with the Planalto Palace, the Brazilian government’s seat. “It’s not enough to veto, we need to have something to put in its place,” she said on Tuesday at an event hosted by IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental protection agency.

Supporters of the bill, particularly in the infrastructure sector, argue that it streamlines the environmental licensing process and will help unlock stalled investments and construction projects. Some business groups also support allowing LAC for medium-impact projects, claiming that, under regulation and oversight, the process can yield positive outcomes.

Valor found, however, that there are divisions within the federal government over whether to veto the use of LAC for medium-impact activities. Some members of the Chief of Staff Office and the Ministry of Transport reportedly side with the business sector on this issue.

Another section likely to be vetoed concerns the distribution of environmental licensing authority across different levels of government. As passed by Congress, the bill shifts some licensing power from the federal government to state governments, a move the Lula administration opposes.

On Wednesday, the Federal Prosecutor’s Office (MPF) submitted a technical note to the Planalto Palace recommending vetoes to more than 30 provisions of the bill. The document was prepared by the Office for the Environment and Cultural Heritage, the Office for Indigenous Peoples and Traditional Communities, and the Office for the Protection of Citizens’ Rights, all part of the Office of the Prosecutor General (PGR).

Among the contested provisions are the creation of more “permissive” licensing categories, exemptions from licensing for sectors such as agribusiness and infrastructure, and the automatic renewal of environmental licenses.

“ This is just a stake through the heart of decades of hard work towards trying to address the most significant challenge that humanity faces today, which is climate change,” Sinding Daly said.
Once the federal endangerment finding is killed, Sinding Daly said, the onus to combat climate change will shift to state and city governments.
Massachusetts lawmakers in recent years have enacted legislation to address climate change.
""This decision to argue that climate change isn’t dangerous isn’t driven by the law, and certainly isn’t driven by the science,"" he said in a statement.","Massachusetts environmental lawyers and advocates warned this week that a regulatory change proposed by the Trump administration will make it more difficult for the government to rein in climate change.

Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, announced Tuesday that his agency will take steps to overturn the “endangerment finding,” which gives the government the legal authority to regulate planet-warming emissions from cars and trucks, oil and gas industries and other sources.

The move comes as parts of New England are already experiencing extreme weather made worse by climate change. Such events include longer, more intense heat waves and increased flooding from heavy rain, said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the Boston-based Conservation Law Foundation.

“ This is just a stake through the heart of decades of hard work towards trying to address the most significant challenge that humanity faces today, which is climate change,” Sinding Daly said.

In a statement, Zeldin said the proposal would boost the auto industry and make cars more affordable by unwinding exhaust emissions regulations.

“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” he said.

Once the federal endangerment finding is killed, Sinding Daly said, the onus to combat climate change will shift to state and city governments. But it's not clear if local leaders are able — or willing — to ramp up their efforts.

Massachusetts lawmakers in recent years have enacted legislation to address climate change. That includes initiatives to ease the transition to renewable energy and curb air pollution.

Now is the time to make sure those laws are being implemented, Sinding Daly said.

""If the federal government isn't going to tell industry and polluters that they have to stop spewing the stuff into the air, the states do it instead,"" she said.

But tackling the global problem of climate change will require federal support, said Jody Freeman, head of the environmental and energy law program at Harvard Law School and a former White House counsel for the Obama administration.

The endangerment finding stems from a landmark 2007 Supreme Court case, Massachusetts v. EPA, in which the justices ruled greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants. Two years later, the EPA declared that these pollutants threaten public health, and the agency could regulate them under the Clean Air Act.

The move to repeal the finding is ""really the most aggressive thing they could possibly do"" to limit the federal government's ability to regulate emissions from the largest polluters, Freeman said.

It could also hamper efforts in states like Massachusetts.

“ We're a leader state, and when you don't have a partner in the federal government, it's just a lot harder,"" she said.

New England has made strides to increase energy supplies from renewable sources such as solar and hydropower, Freeman said. For example, rooftop solar has helped residents stay cool during this summer’s hottest days, relieving stress on the power grid.

Massachusetts U.S. Sen. Ed Markey condemned the Trump administration's proposal, calling it a lie to the public.

""This decision to argue that climate change isn’t dangerous isn’t driven by the law, and certainly isn’t driven by the science,"" he said in a statement. ""This is nothing more than selling out Americans’ safety and future just for the convenience of polluters.""

President Trump has argued that American car companies and consumers have suffered from overregulation of greenhouse gas emissions. Trump campaigned on a platform to end “electric vehicle mandates,” which refers to regulations on tailpipe emissions designed to encourage production of more EVs and fuel-efficient vehicles.

Transportation is the largest source of direct greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., according to EPA data.

Steven Higashide, director of clean transportation at the Cambridge-based Union of Concerned Scientists, said more fuel-efficient vehicles have improved the economy, the environment and the health of residents.

""Decades of vehicle fuel economy and tailpipe emission standards have saved car and truck drivers trillions of dollars at the pump, reduced our collective exposure to toxic air pollution, and avoided the extraction and burning of billions of barrels of oil,"" Higashide said in a statement.

Some critics of the administration's plan said it could set back the domestic auto industry, especially as electric vehicle sales increase in countries like China.

“It’s essentially a kill shot to the American car industry,” said Larry Chretien, head of the Boston-based Green Energy Consumers Alliance.

At the state level, Chretien said the adoption of EVs has slowed in recent months because of changes to tax credits meant to incentivize clean energy use. A massive federal spending law signed by Trump last month will eliminate tax credits for people who install home solar panels or buy EVs. There's still time to take advantage of the tax credits before the program sunsets at the end of this year, Chretien said.

There were 140,000 EVs on the road in the Massachusetts last year, according to the state's climate report card. The goal is to increase that figure to 900,000 by the end of the decade.

Chretien said there are reasons to be optimistic about some state efforts around clean energy. That includes a rebate program for EVs, the continuing expansion of public charging infrastructure, and electricity companies offering discounted rates for heat pump users this winter.

Still, the federal proposal to repeal the endangerment finding is a blow to environmental advocacy, many nonprofit leaders said, going against decades of scientific consensus about the harms of climate change.

The move will likely face challenges from environmental groups as the federal review process gets underway.

“ We could be supporting clean energy,” Freeman said. “And instead all of this is a giant step backwards.”",https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/themes/ecane/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-01 19:01:59.108131

The mission is clear: reimagine the iconic Scout brand for the 21st century while honoring its rich heritage and authenticity.
Scout Motors isn’t simply creating another electric vehicle startup.
As Scout Motors looks to the future, it maintains its connection to the passionate Scout community that kept the brand alive during its dormant years.
The revival of Scout Motors isn’t just about nostalgia; it’s about recognizing that great product designs stand the test of time when properly evolved with technological advancements.","The revival of Scout Motors represents one of the most exciting developments in the American automotive landscape. As the second employee hired at Scout Motors, Ryan Decker has been instrumental in shaping the company’s strategy and brand direction since its inception in September 2022. The mission is clear: reimagine the iconic Scout brand for the 21st century while honoring its rich heritage and authenticity.

Scout Motors isn’t simply creating another electric vehicle startup. Instead, they’re taking a uniquely balanced approach that merges what Decker calls “old world American trucks” with cutting-edge technology. This philosophy is captured in their internal approach of creating an “eight-day-a-week truck” — a vehicle capable of handling every use case imaginable, from Monday through Sunday and beyond. The company is developing two models: the Scout Terra pickup truck and the Scout Traveler SUV.

What truly distinguishes Scout from competitors is its powertrain strategy. While many EV manufacturers are focusing solely on all-electric vehicles, Scout is offering two powertrain options: a fully electric version and their innovative “Harvester” range-extended powertrain. The latter incorporates a gasoline engine elegantly packaged in the rear of the vehicle, acting as a generator to deliver over 500 miles of total range while maintaining the performance benefits of electric drive, including nearly 1,000 pound-feet of torque.

The design philosophy behind these vehicles carefully considers what made the original Scout models so beloved. Working closely with the existing Scout community, Decker and his team identified essential Scout DNA elements: proud, upright proportions, significant ground clearance, broad shoulders, and distinctive styling cues like the window cinch by the D-pillar and the subtly placed Scout script. These iconic elements are preserved while incorporating modern technologies and capabilities.

Scout Motors is committed to creating vehicles with genuine off-road credibility. Features like body-on-frame construction, solid rear axle, large tires, robust suspension, mechanical four-wheel drive lockers, and impressive approach angles ensure these vehicles will perform in demanding conditions. The company is even designing for factory compatibility with 35-inch tires, a clear indication of their serious off-road intentions.

What’s particularly impressive about Scout’s approach is its determination to appeal across all market segments. Rather than focusing exclusively on coastal markets, Scout aims to create products with universal appeal, “cool enough to win in places like Malibu and the Hamptons, but credible enough to win in places like Texas and Indiana,” as Decker puts it. This broad appeal is reflected in their reservation holders, who currently span all 50 states and drive everything from electric vehicles to traditional gas-powered trucks.

Production is slated to begin in 2027 at Scout’s massive new factory in Blythewood, South Carolina. This facility represents a serious commitment to scale, with over 1,000 acres of land, 3 million square feet of buildings, and 36 million cubic feet of earth being moved during construction. The buildings are already taking shape, and the company plans to begin installing process equipment by the end of the year, with maintenance personnel already being hired.

As Scout Motors looks to the future, it maintains its connection to the passionate Scout community that kept the brand alive during its dormant years. Through dedicated forums and in-person events, Scout actively engages with fans, reservation holders, and curious observers. This community-oriented approach, which Decker describes as having “a certain neighborliness,” is central to the Scout brand identity and will remain so as the company grows.

The revival of Scout Motors isn’t just about nostalgia; it’s about recognizing that great product designs stand the test of time when properly evolved with technological advancements. By combining heritage with innovation, Scout Motors aims to deliver vehicles that honor their legacy while meeting the demands of today’s drivers – truly eight-day-a-week trucks for the modern era.",https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Terra-Scout-Truck.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 16:06:43.572295

The EPA first put the steel standards on hold for three months.
But last year, the EPA estimated the standards would cost steel companies less than 1 percent of their annual revenue.
Earthjustice is representing the groups Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, Hoosier Environmental Council, the Sierra Club and Just Transition Northwest Indiana in court.
The air pollution standards are one of many rules the EPA vowed to reconsider in March.","Indiana environmental groups are suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for once again pausing standards to control air pollution at steel mills.

The standards set by the Biden administration aim to address a kind of pollution that isn't being controlled right now — leaks of toxic heavy metals and fine particles that don't come from a single point like a smoke stack. This pollution puts people living nearby at a greater risk for lung and heart problems as well as certain cancers.

The EPA first put the steel standards on hold for three months. Now they aren't expected to take effect until April 2027.

This comes after steelmakers told the agency they would have trouble complying with deadlines in the rule.

In a statement, U.S. Steel said it supports regulations that are based on ""sound science, available and proven technology, and that consider costs and other non-air quality impacts.""

""Unfortunately, the 2024 rule does not meet these criteria. In addition, implementation of the 2024 rule would have come at exorbitant costs and would have provided little, if any, environmental benefit while significantly impacting American jobs and the nation's critical infrastructure,"" the company said.

But last year, the EPA estimated the standards would cost steel companies less than 1 percent of their annual revenue. And while the standards would only reduce emissions by about 10 percent, attorney Jim Pew with Earthjustice said it means a lot to the people breathing in that pollution.

Earthjustice is representing the groups Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, Hoosier Environmental Council, the Sierra Club and Just Transition Northwest Indiana in court.

Pew said there's no reason why steelmakers shouldn't be able to comply with the standards — especially since they've had a year to address any concerns with EPA.

""These are not just the standards that require some sort of innovation or something new, or they're sort of an icing on the cake. These are really basic requirements that EPA should have met a long time ago,"" he said.

The air pollution standards are one of many rules the EPA vowed to reconsider in March. Pew suspects that's the real reason behind the delay.

""The idea that these protections need to be put off for two years has never been about implementing technology. What it's really about is giving EPA time to get rid of these rules all together,"" he said.

The lawsuit states the EPA also didn't provide the public with notice of the two-year stay or time to comment on it. The agency refused to provide anyone for an interview.",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_yZzKJOXo.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 16:06:32.663269

● Actions will support and accelerate Tucson’s Climate Action and Adaptation Plan without burdening electric utility system reliability or utility customer costs

● The initial phase of Project Blue is enabled by local solar and energy storage projects sourced through Tucson Electric Power’s recent all-source requests for proposals

Beale Infrastructure announced today that it will work with Tucson Electric Power (TEP) to support the development of new carbon free energy resources to accelerate the City of Tucson’s progress toward a clean energy future. TEP and Beale will work collaboratively on an associated plan for release within the next sixty days. Beale will engage with the energy development community alongside key local stakeholders to inform the plan.

The new clean energy resources would help TEP serve data center projects that Beale is actively developing in the Tucson area. Those projects, referred to as “Project Blue,” represent a potential initial investment of $3.6 billion, could support 3,180+ full time and long term construction jobs, and could add $97M in tax revenue for the City of Tucson from 2026 to 2035. This investment is in addition to improvements to power infrastructure, fiber and reclaimed water system expansions.

Beale is a specialist digital infrastructure developer committed to close partnership with communities and sustainable long-term impact. Beale was drawn to Tucson due to the City’s commitment to responsible climate planning and the region’s access to abundant clean energy resources.

Subject to approvals by the local government, and the Arizona Corporation Commission, Beale will support TEP’s development of clean energy resources to directly serve Project Blue with no cost impact to other customers. Beale Infrastructure and TEP will evaluate carbon free energy procurement options like “green tariff” or other potential programs that create opportunities for customers to develop clean energy resources that support their operations.

“We look forward to working with Beale Infrastructure to develop new clean energy resources to support service to Project Blue,” said Erik Bakken, Senior Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of TEP. “This collaboration would extend our shared efforts to ensure that Project Blue is developed in a way that benefits our existing customers and supports the continued availability of safe, reliable and affordable energy for our community.”

TEP is developing new solar and energy storage capacity that would allow it to serve the first phase for Project Blue, which could come online in 2027. Beale will work with TEP and the City of Tucson to evaluate a roadmap for future phases of growth aligned with the City’s Climate Action Plans and Beale’s commitment to sustainable development and operations. The first phase of the data center project is being planned in the Pima County Southeast Employment and Logistics Center located near the Pima County Fairgrounds and Arizona State Prison Complex, where Beale plans to fund substantial investments to upgrade area infrastructure.

While TEP’s recently-procured solar and energy storage resources are currently under construction, future phases of Project Blue would require new energy resources. The recent passage of H.R. 1 sunsets federal clean-energy tax incentives, creating urgency for Project Blue to maximize procurement from advanced stage solar, wind and energy storage projects.

Beale’s collaboration with TEP is intended to ensure that the project’s energy needs can be met in a way that supports local climate action initiatives. “Beale Infrastructure is crystal clear about our sustainability goals for Project Blue and the evaluations we are driving, which are to enable new carbon-free energy supply and capital investments directly aligned with Tucson’s Climate Action Plans,” said Michael Nudelman, Beale’s Chief Development Officer.

“The kind of investment that Project Blue represents is few and far between – a once-in-a-generation opportunity. $3.6 billion capital investment, $100 million in new reclaimed water infrastructure, 3,000 construction jobs and $250 million in new tax revenue from a single project would represent a monumentally positive shift for our community,” said Joe Snell, president, The Chamber of Southern Arizona. “To achieve this, Beale is partnering closely with community stakeholders throughout the evaluation process to align project roadmaps with Tucson’s sustainability plans.”

,EVs,2025-08-01 19:15:39+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Trump's EPA puts California in its crosshairs with its proposed car rules - Los Angeles Times,"Hayley Smith, www.latimes.com, hayley-smith",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2025-08-01/trump-epa-car-rules-target-california,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s recent proposal to repeal its own 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health marks a major U-turn for the nation’s climate progress.
The waivers were also the basis for California’s nation-leading plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and transition to electric vehicles.
According to the EPA, that $1-trillion savings would come from rescinding vehicle regulations built upon the endangerment finding.
With California’s rules repealed, “you end up with fewer EVs, more gasoline cars, more demand for gas and higher gas prices,” he said.
But major U.S. automakers such as GM and Ford have already committed to an electric future — as have international competitors such as China, which is investing heavily in electric vehicles.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s recent proposal to repeal its own 2009 finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health marks a major U-turn for the nation’s climate progress. While it’s impact will be felt nationwide, the plan takes direct aim at California.

In supporting documents released in the wake of Tuesday’s proposal, the nation’s top environmental agency outlined the justifications for its plan to rescind the so-called endangerment finding and roll back its longstanding regulations for planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from all motor vehicles, including cars and trucks.

“As a result of these proposed changes, engine and vehicle manufacturers would no longer have any future obligations for the measurement, control, and reporting of [greenhouse gas] emissions for any highway engine and vehicle,” the agency wrote in its rule summary.

But the documents, including an 80-page notice of proposed rulemaking and 60-page draft regulatory impact analysis, also contain several nods to California policies, referencing the state by name 27 times — by far more than any other state.

That’s largely because for more than 50 years, California has been granted unique authority from the EPA to set stricter tailpipe emissions than those mandated by the federal government.

This authority, obtained through waivers issued by the EPA, has been critical to the state’s efforts to address its notorious smog and air quality issues, which are driven partly by transportation emissions and by California’s unique topography that traps pollutants in its interior basins. The waivers were also the basis for California’s nation-leading plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 and transition to electric vehicles.

The EPA’s documents repeatedly state that California’s waivers have officially been repealed. As of publication, however, the Trump administration’s unprecedented effort to do so in June is still winding its way through the court system following a lawsuit from the state.

Notably, the EPA’s own analysis of the possible outcomes of its proposal indicate that without California’s leadership — and without the tax credits created under President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act — national adoption of electric vehicles will decline. At the same time, gasoline prices will increase because of the higher demand from more gas-powered vehicles on the road.

“They don’t seem to have put together that strong of a case,” said Chris Busch, director of transportation and a senior economist with Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, a nonpartisan think tank, who reviewed the analysis. “What this shows is that the net impact is less favorable when you reduce the California [Advanced Clean Trucks rule], when you take away the California waivers and remove the IRA credits.”

In a statement this week, EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said repealing the endangerment finding would have economic benefits for the American people. “If finalized, rescinding the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations would end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families,” Zeldin said.

According to the EPA, that $1-trillion savings would come from rescinding vehicle regulations built upon the endangerment finding. That includes the Biden administration’s electric vehicles sales target, which the agency refers to as an “EV mandate.”

The EPA also said removing the endangerment finding would save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of greenhouse gas standards.

Busch said he could not readily see how the agency arrived at that figure based on the analysis provided. With California’s rules repealed, “you end up with fewer EVs, more gasoline cars, more demand for gas and higher gas prices,” he said.

The EPA also argues that electric vehicles are sucking up energy that could be better used elsewhere — “from factories to data-center servers to air-conditioning.” It uses California as an example of this perceived misappropriation of electricity, pointing to a 2022 memo from the California Independent System operator that urged people to reduce energy use, including EV charging, during a record-breaking heat wave.

The EPA’s announcement stunned many members of the environmental community who condemned it as a dangerous abdication of the agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment. Among the agency’s many claims are that no technology currently exists to reduce greenhouse gases enough to measurably affect global climate change concerns without risking greater harm to public health and welfare, such as increased vehicle prices.

But major U.S. automakers such as GM and Ford have already committed to an electric future — as have international competitors such as China, which is investing heavily in electric vehicles. According to the California Energy Commission, about 22% of new vehicles sales in the state in the second quarter of this year were zero-emission vehicles.

“Despite Trump’s full-on attack, Californians are choosing the clean simplicity of ZEVs,” read a statement from CEC Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “Make no mistake: California is not backing down from its ZEV goals. We will continue to heavily invest in accessible and reliable ZEV infrastructure, making the ZEV driving experience better each day.”

Busch said California has several tools at its disposal to defend itself and preserve its clean vehicle progress.

In the heavy-duty space, the California Air Resources Board already has the Clean Truck Partnership — an agreement with nearly all truck manufacturers in the state to meet advanced emissions reduction targets. The state’s heavy vehicle incentive program also provides funding opportunities for fleet owners to replace older heavy-duty diesel vehicles with zero-emission ones.

There are also legislative possibilities, such as Assembly Bill 914, which would give CARB more authority to regulate indirect sources of pollution such as warehouses. One way those warehouses could meet those rules would be by increasing their electric truck fleets, Busch said.

CARB also employs a clean-mile standard for transportation companies such as Uber and Lyft, which will see them gradually increase their zero-emission miles, and a similar tactic could be employed for the freight sector, he said.

“States have a lot of options still,” Busch said. “There is a lot of momentum.”

In a statement this week, CARB chair Liane Randolph described the EPA’s proposals as “the latest moves from this feckless federal government that choose polluter fantasyland over proven science.”

“Meanwhile, back on Earth, the planet continues to suffer from the consequences of unchecked carbon pollution as heatwaves, floods and wildfires threaten increasingly uninsurable communities everywhere,” Randolph said. “Unlike this negligent administration, California won’t turn our backs on what is happening right before our eyes. We choose reality, science and innovation — and we know we are not the only ones.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d1e66b4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fff%2F4a%2F62e9610647d68fcc5952fc53d5c3%2F1513228-me-ev-chargers-ces-0242.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 17:01:29.362303

Polis to ensure state agencies prioritize renewable energy projects that save money and drive Colorado’s economy.
“Today we are taking action to ensure that Coloradans can easily access clean energy savings, especially ones that expire soon.
“Coloradans need accurate information about the many rebates, tax credits and other incentives available for clean energy and energy efficiency home improvements.
“This executive direction fast-tracks affordable, reliable clean energy in Colorado by removing local barriers, streamlining permitting, accelerating interconnection and advancing utility-scale procurement.","Gov. Jared Polis today announced new actions to expand Colorado’s nation-leading progress on saving people money on renewable energy and improve lower-cost clean energy access for people across the state. This includes a new Colorado Energy Savings Navigator, which will help Coloradans determine what tax credits they qualify for to save money on clean energy, as well as an executive action from Gov. Polis to ensure state agencies prioritize renewable energy projects that save money and drive Colorado’s economy.

“Today we are taking action to ensure that Coloradans can easily access clean energy savings, especially ones that expire soon. We continue to do all we can to make people aware of how you can reduce costs on energy bills and keep money in your pocket. That’s what the launch of this new tool and executive action are all about,” said Gov. Polis.

New federal policies are projected to increase average Colorado household energy costs by as much as $500 per year by 2035.

Today’s actions will mitigate these potential harms and help maintain Colorado’s leadership in delivering clean, affordable energy and helping Coloradans save money and provide greater certainty to businesses investing in Colorado.

Gov. Polis announced that he will be directing state agencies to streamline and accelerate the development of eligible clean energy projects to provide reliable, affordable energy. This will ensure expedited and cost-effective deployment of new clean energy infrastructure to support Colorado’s growing economy, maximize the utilization of federal resources to reduce the costs, and enable Colorado energy consumers to invest in energy-saving technologies in time to access federal resources.

This includes strategies to ensure that qualifying, cost-effective renewable energy generation starts construction or is placed in service as quickly as possible, especially to receive federal tax credits and avoid tariff uncertainty. That will include leveraging existing PUC authorities while also ensuring decisions are issued in a timely manner to ensure utilities can continue moving forward with their projects, which means economic investment and jobs in Colorado.

States across the country are competing to accelerate the deployment of affordable renewable energy resources, and today’s action augments Colorado’s nation-leading work opening up Colorado for new energy investments. These efforts will improve Colorado’s air quality, advance economic competitiveness, and unlock billions in new investment in Colorado communities and businesses.

“This online portal is a win for anyone looking to cut down on energy waste, save money or reduce pollution,” said CoPIRG Foundation Advocate Kirsten Schatz. “Coloradans need accurate information about the many rebates, tax credits and other incentives available for clean energy and energy efficiency home improvements. We’re excited that Gov. Polis has created a one-stop shop for Coloradans to benefit from available resources.”

The governor also launched the Colorado Energy Savings Navigator (CESN), a new, easy-to-use digital tool that connects Coloradans to more than 600 energy rebates and 18 different energy bill assistance programs including federal tax credits expiring later this year. The CESN tool was developed by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC), Colorado Digital Service (CDS), the Colorado Energy Office (CEO), Gary Community Ventures/MyFriendBen and Rewiring America, with grant funding from the Statewide Internet Portal Authority, to provide Coloradans with a one-stop resource to access programs that save money and reduce energy bills. This tool is part of the governor’s broader Operational Agenda and, in particular, his vision to build a digital experience that helps Coloradans easily access what they need when they need it, regardless of what State agency or program is responsible.

“As Washington retreats from clean energy leadership and energy costs rise nationwide, Gov. Polis is stepping up to protect Colorado’s energy future,” said Wil Gehl, InterMountain West senior manager for SEIA. “This executive direction fast-tracks affordable, reliable clean energy in Colorado by removing local barriers, streamlining permitting, accelerating interconnection and advancing utility-scale procurement. These steps will save Coloradans billions of dollars in avoided energy costs while creating good local jobs and strengthening grid reliability.”

Whether renting or owning, Coloradans can quickly discover what programs and incentives they may be eligible for by visiting the Colorado Energy Savings Navigator at https://puc.colorado.gov/energy-savings.

Data Center At Site Of Former Cheswick Coal-Fired Power Plant In Allegheny County -- PennLive: 750,000 Square Foot A.I.","The day began with site visits to two pioneering lithium extraction facilities utilizing produced water from the Marcellus Shale.

The Avonlea/Kendra II facility in Springville and the Gradiant/C2G facility in Montrose showcased groundbreaking technologies that recover lithium from fracking brine—reducing environmental waste while strengthening America's energy independence.

“These facilities represent the future of American energy,” said Congressman Meuser. “What we saw today is innovation in action—private sector ingenuity transforming waste into strategic resources. They’re proving that we don’t need to look overseas to meet our energy needs. By responsibly tapping into what’s available domestically, we can create jobs, protect the environment, and secure our national supply chain from adversaries like China.”

Following the tours, Congressman Meuser participated in a roundtable hosted by Rep. Fritz at The Community Foundation of the Endless Mountains.

The discussion focused on how federal and state policymakers can work with private industry to expand critical mineral production, streamline permitting, and create rural economic opportunities.

Tax Credit Proposal

Congressman Meuser also announced that he will soon introduce legislation to establish a production tax credit for companies extracting critical minerals—including rare earth elements from coal byproducts and lithium from fracking brine.

These credits are aimed at unlocking overlooked domestic resources, strengthening U.S. manufacturing, and turning existing waste into valuable supply chain inputs.

“America imports nearly 90% of our critical minerals—many of them from foreign adversaries. That is unacceptable,” Meuser said. “My legislation will help reverse that dependency by turning underutilized materials like coal ash and brine water into strategic assets. It’s about pairing innovation with environmental reuse—converting industrial waste streams into sustainable inputs for clean energy, defense systems, and advanced manufacturing.”

Meuser concluded, “This is a win-win for Pennsylvania. We bring new opportunity to our legacy energy regions, revitalize local economies, and help the U.S. lead the next industrial revolution. It’s time to match bold policy with private sector potential—and this bill will do just that.”

Meuser thanked Rep. Jonathan Fritz and William desRosiers of Coterra Energy for organizing such an insightful and productive day.

Meuser said in his announcement “Coterra Energy is helping lead innovation in Pennsylvania. Through community engagement and investment, Coterra will help drive Pennsylvania into a new age of energy production.”

,Congress,2025-08-01 19:07:05+00:00,The Eno Center for Transportation,EPA Proposes to Reverse GHG Endangerment Finding - The Eno Center for Transportation,Not Available,,,,,https://enotrans.org/article/epa-proposes-to-reverse-ghg-endangerment-finding/,"However, greenhouse gases (GHGs)—such as carbon dioxide and methane—were not regulated by the EPA until after the April 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA.
In the landmark case of Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that EPA does have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases.
In response to this finding, the EPA under President George W. Bush spent about six months conducting intensive analysis and, according to EPA staff disclosures to Congress, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson signed off on his agency’s positive endangerment finding and transmitted the endangerment finding for White House review.
Despite the directive from the Supreme Court and the positive finding from the EPA that greenhouse gases endanger public welfare, the Bush Administration refused to release the endangerment finding.
The NPRM notes that “the Administrator has serious concerns that many of the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding are materially weaker than previously believed” and that the “Administrator no longer has confidence in the assumptions, methodology, and conclusions in the Endangerment Finding in light of the scientific record”.","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has long regulated both mobile (cars, trucks and aircrafts) and stationary (industry, buildings,) sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act (CAA) of 1970. Widely regarded as the nation’s most influential environmental law, the CAA established the EPA and set the legal foundation for major reductions in air pollution. Early successes included regulating tailpipe emissions, introducing technologies like catalytic converters, and mandating fuel changes such as unleaded gasoline.

However, greenhouse gases (GHGs)—such as carbon dioxide and methane—were not regulated by the EPA until after the April 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. Before this decision, EPA’s regulatory focus was limited to pollutants causing smog, soot, and other pollutants with immediate health impacts, not the heat-trapping gases scientifically linked to global warming. In the landmark case of Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that EPA does have the authority to regulate greenhouse gases. Further, since Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA requires the EPA Administrator to set emission standards for air pollutants from motor vehicles if they’re judged to endanger public health or welfare, the ruling directed EPA to formally assess whether GHG emissions do endanger public health or welfare.

In response to this finding, the EPA under President George W. Bush spent about six months conducting intensive analysis and, according to EPA staff disclosures to Congress, EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson signed off on his agency’s positive endangerment finding and transmitted the endangerment finding for White House review. Despite the directive from the Supreme Court and the positive finding from the EPA that greenhouse gases endanger public welfare, the Bush Administration refused to release the endangerment finding. Instead the Administration released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on their concern that the CAA was designed and intended “to control regional pollutants that cause direct health effects,” and that therefore using the law to regulate GHG emissions “would inevitably result in a very complicated, time-consuming, and, likely, convoluted set of regulations” that would have a “potentially damaging effect on jobs and the U.S. economy.”

After the election of President Barack Obama, the EPA again undertook an extensive public comment process and ultimately issued the Endangerment Finding in 2009, finding that greenhouse gases endanger both public health and welfare. This determination required the EPA, for the first time, to regulate carbon emissions from new vehicles and engines. The Endangerment Finding underpins significant federal climate action such as clean car and truck standards targeting GHG-driven warming, providing the legal and scientific basis for limits on transportation emissions.

On Tuesday July 29, in response to a Day One Executive Order from President Trump, and after signaling his intent since March, the EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin formally proposed to rescind the Endangerment Finding. Along with reversing the finding on the effect of greenhouse gases on public health and welfare, the proposed rule also would eliminate all resulting GHG emission standards for new motor vehicles and engines, including the light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicle and engine standards for model years (MY) 2012 to 2027 and beyond.

Responses and Legal Hurdles

Administrator Zeldin was joined at the announcement only by one sitting member of Congress, Representative Jim Baird (R-IN), and by Governor Mike Braun. While the move is likely to be generally welcomed by Republican members of Congress, Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chair Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) “applauded the Administration’s efforts” but also acknowledged that it will certainly be “tested in the courts and probably go all the way to the Supreme Court.”

Indeed the legal hurdles to finalize this proposal to rescind the endangerment finding will be significant and recent changes to agency deference may cut against the agency’s efforts. EPA’s first task will be to accept public comments, the docket for which is open until September 15. The agency will also have virtual public hearings on the proposal on August 19 and 20. Given the significance of the finding, the agency could anticipate hundreds of thousands of comments, if not millions. (The record for number of comments on a rulemaking was 22 million comments submitted to the 2017 proposed rule on net neutrality from the Federal Communications Commission.) The task of responding to these comments while avoiding arbitrariness will be made more challenging by the agency’s cutting the size of its workforce by at least 23% and closing its Office of Research and Development.

The agency will be defending their proposal in the context of the Supreme Court’s 2024 decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo—which overturned the Chevron doctrine that stated that a court must defer to the agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute. Importantly, the Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA concluded that “The statute is unambiguous” with regard to the question of whether greenhouse gases are air pollutants, stating that such gases “are without a doubt ‘physical and chemical … substances which are emitted into … the ambient air’” and therefore meet the statutory definition in the CAA. In this case, the EPA will have to argue that the facts have changed since their 2009 finding, regarding the relationship between greenhouse gases and public health and welfare. The NPRM notes that “the Administrator has serious concerns that many of the scientific underpinnings of the Endangerment Finding are materially weaker than previously believed” and that the “Administrator no longer has confidence in the assumptions, methodology, and conclusions in the Endangerment Finding in light of the scientific record”.

In substantiating this claim, the EPA points to a report released this week by the Department of Energy entitled “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate” that argues that elevated concentrations of CO2 will enhance agricultural productivity and that the costs of mitigating climate impacts will exceed the benefits. (The report is written by five academics well known for their long denial of the relationship between greenhouse gases and climate change, and has been fact checked by multiple sources and skewered by climate scientists as misrepresenting and cherry-picking data.) Despite this report, in legal proceedings the agency will be confronted with data compiled by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which has found that in the years since 2009 the impacts of climate change on public health and welfare have become more significant and that the relationship between greenhouse gases and climate change has become more certain.

The Endangerment Finding is often described as the legal “on-switch” for modern U.S. climate policy—analogous to how Miranda rights transformed police procedure or how Title IX reshaped gender equity in education and sports. It has fundamentally influenced not just regulatory standards but also the kinds of vehicles Americans drive, and the way manufacturers design vehicles. This itself may constitute a barrier to repeal, as the agency will have to consider the effect of repeal on the hybrid and electric vehicle manufacturers that will be harmed by the new finding. EPA’s NPRM notes that they seek “comment on the nature and extent of any reliance interests that may have arisen from our assertion of regulatory authority over GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines and is committed to assessing any such interests, determining whether they are significant, and weighing such interests against competing rationales, as required by law.”

One perennial concern with changes to emissions standards is the impact on federal preemption. The proposed rule indicates that this “repeal also would not impact Federal preemption of emission standards for new motor vehicle and engine emission standards.” Per the proposed rule: “Because new motor vehicles and engines currently subject to GHG emission standards would remain subject to Title II of the CAA, the statute would continue to preempt “any” State or local “standard relating to the control of emissions.” However, California has specific authority under the CAA Section 209(b) to obtain a waiver of the federal preemption therefore the effect on California and other states’ ability to set their own GHG regulations of mobile sources will likely continue to be a subject of debate and litigation. (In any case though, the waiver request would have to be approved by the EPA, which is unlikely in the current administration.)

The EPA’s proposed rollback of the light duty vehicle standards will not automatically affect the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, which have recently been weakened by DOT Secretary Sean Duffy. CAFE, regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975, is primarily aimed at reducing oil consumption by improving fleet fuel economy. By contrast, the EPA’s authority focuses on cutting GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. Despite some overlapping enforcement mechanisms, the legal bases, primary metrics (GHG emissions vs. fuel consumption), and technology incentives differ. In the recently enacted budget reconciliation law, Congress removed the penalties for violations of both CAFE and emissions standards, undermining the enforcement of both regulations. Recent policy moves by both agencies are widely viewed as steps to disincentivize electrification within the transportation industry.

Revoking the Endangerment Finding would sharply curtail federal climate regulation for transportation, reduce incentives for cleaner and electric vehicles, and significantly hinder future efforts to cut carbon pollution nationwide. Existing regulations could become vulnerable to legal challenges and future administrations would lose crucial tools to reduce transportation emissions, which are the country’s largest source of climate pollution. In addition to public health and welfare effects, the change would also impact the pace of automotive innovation, the industry’s ability to compete internationally, and the nation’s role in global climate leadership.",https://enotrans.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/car-emissions-pollution-exhuast-pipes-traffic-environment-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 16:04:17.207126

PRESS CONTACT: Jessica Ortiz, Jessicao@mifamiliavota.org

WASHINGTON, DC – Mi Familia Vota today expressed significant concern for the health of the Latino community nationwide, noting Latinos will be among the most affected by the Trump administration’s decision to delay implementation of methane pollution standards for another twelve months. The Trump Environmental Protection Agency's move this week to delay implementation of 2024 methane standards effectively tables commonsense protections that would prevent 58 million tons of methane emissions, as well as 16 million tons of volatile organic compounds, and 590,000 tons of air toxics in the coming years. Latinos are already among the communities most afflicted with asthma and other respiratory issues that are exacerbated by smog-forming compounds. The EPA itself has previously published information showing Hispanic children are almost twice as likely to be hospitalized for asthma as White children.

Methane is also one of the largest contributors in the United States to a warming climate, which is resulting in more severe natural disasters including stronger storms, floods, and wildfires. A report published Tuesday by insurance company Munich RE showed that U.S. natural catastrophes have dominated global losses in the first half of 2025, which amount to $131 billion. Almost $80 billion of those losses were mainly driven by wildfires in the U.S.

The Trump Administration used a regulatory tool called an “interim final rule” that is typically reserved for emergencies and that precedes any public input to delay these common sense protections.

Angelica Razo, Mi Familia Vota National Director of Campaigns & Programs, issued the following statement:

“Simply put, the Trump Administration’s delay of these methane standards represents a clear and present danger to Latino communities across the country, from both a health and economic perspective. Our community is over represented in fields that require working outdoors, even in extreme heat settings. Latinos are also among the most affected by asthma and other respiratory issues, made worse by emissions from the oil and gas industry. Additionally, the mental, physical and financial cost of devastating natural disasters driven by climate change has increased significantly in recent years over prior averages. Latino voters are paying attention because our lives are at risk, and we call on elected leaders at the local, state, and federal level to stand up to Trump’s EPA and insist they treat methane emissions and climate change as the critical issues they truly are.”

The grant aims to reduce the risk of home loss to wildfire in Central Texas by using fuel reduction practices, including hand-cut and mulching treatments.

Eligible applicants can receive up to $750 per acre for hand-cutting treatment, $2,000 per acre for mulching treatment or $1,500 per acre for a combination of hand-cutting and mulching treatments.

Thirty-three Texas counties are eligible for this grant. Full eligibility is available in Austin, Brazos, Brown, Burleson, Coke, Coleman, Colorado, Concho, Ector, Fayette, Glasscock, Grimes, Irion, Kimble, Lampasas, Lee, Llano, Madison, Mason, McCulloch, Menard, Midland, Mills, Runnels, San Saba, Sterling, Tom Green, Waller and Washington counties. Counties with partial eligibility include Bastrop, Bell, Travis and Williamson.

“The Mechanical Fuel Reduction Grant helps landowners, municipalities and homeowners associations take proactive measures in protecting their homes, land and communities,” said Victoria Wenkman, Texas A&M Forest Service wildfire mitigation and prevention specialist. “Landowners and communities can slow the progression of wildfire by reducing fuel sources, such as removing flammable materials near structures and creating defensible spaces.”

Utilizing grants to reduce fuel loads

Fuel reduction practices include the removal of excessive or hazardous fuels, such as vegetative debris, immature trees, shrubs and dead or downed branches. Shrubs and small trees can serve as ladder fuels, which can carry a ground fire into the crown of trees, increasing the complexity of the fire.

Other wildfire mitigation practices include creating fuel breaks and defensible spaces around structures.

Fuel breaks are a section of removed vegetation that can slow incoming wildfires, decrease the intensity of fires and protect first responders by providing wide access lanes.

“A fuel break can also benefit native vegetation and wildlife, allowing for shaded fuel breaks where large native trees remain and smaller invasive species are removed,” said Wenkman.

Defensible spaces in residential and commercial landscapes are natural or manmade areas spanning at least 30 feet around a structure where combustible material has been cleared or removed, providing a barrier between an advancing wildfire.

Funding uses

Funding reimburses landowners for the costs associated with hiring a contractor to create defensible spaces and hand-cut fuel breaks. This can be completed with chainsaws or through mechanical methods using brush cutters, forestry mulchers or similar equipment.

Since 2005, the counties eligible for the program have experienced a combined 1,271 wildfires, burning 895,790 acres.

Novogradac, CPA",,,,,https://www.novoco.com/periodicals/articles/community-development-tax-credits-the-road-ahead-for-equity-markets,"Clean energy tax credits constitute the largest share of the 2025 federal tax credit market, followed by low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs), new markets tax credits (NMTCs) and historic tax credits (HTCs).
Higher tax credit equity pricing would generate more tax equity, which would translate into more clean energy, affordable housing, community development and historic preservation.
Summary Tax credit equity generally trades at less than a dollar, so the actual tax credit equity amount invested is generally lower than the tax credit allocation total.
The Supply Road Ahead The OBBBA directly affects the future supply of three of the four major community development tax credits mentioned here.
That includes such things as encouraging more individual investment, allowing tax credits to reduce tax liability beyond the current 75% limit, expanding the carryback period for community development tax credits to five years and more.","We estimate the federal community development tax credits marketplace for 2025 to be roughly $80 billion–and our impression is that it will likely grow slightly next year, and then may start declining for a few years, due in large part to the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in early July. Clean energy tax credits constitute the largest share of the 2025 federal tax credit market, followed by low-income housing tax credits (LIHTCs), new markets tax credits (NMTCs) and historic tax credits (HTCs). Each of these credits can stand alone in financing properties and facilities, though they are often combined.

Many factors affect tax credit equity pricing, including the supply of tax credits, other OBBBA tax law changes, the state of the economy, inflation, interest rates and corporate profits, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s appetite for tax credits, banking regulations, and what future tax bills may hold.

My two previous columns discussed specific actions Congress and/or regulators could take to increase tax credit equity pricing. Higher tax credit equity pricing would generate more tax equity, which would translate into more clean energy, affordable housing, community development and historic preservation. This month, I examine the major components of the national federal tax credit market and some of the anticipated effects of the enactment of OBBBA and other factors on tax credit equity pricing.

A Broad and Diverse Market

Let’s start with a review of the estimated size of each tax credit market:

Clean Energy

Clean energy tax credits are the largest market, and the one most difficult to estimate in terms of size. A market analysis by the green energy services group Reunion estimated the 2024 and 2025 clean energy tax credit market–solar, wind and other technologies–at $45 billion to $50 billion per year, split about evenly between tax credit equity investments and the transferable market.

Pricing for clean energy tax credits varies greatly, with equity pricing often exceeding $1 per tax credit. Pricing refers to the amount a tax credit equity investor agrees to invest in a partnership in exchange for their allocable share of tax credits. However, tax equity investors in partnerships anticipate being allocated more than just tax credits to achieve their desired returns. Their returns are usually comprised of their share of tax credits, tax loss benefits and cash flow and when combined, those factors are expected to exceed their investment, or pricing. According to transactions studied by Novogradac in 2024, renewable energy investment tax credit (ITC) prices for partnership transactions averaged about $1.08 per tax credit dollar, while standalone credit only transfers averaged closer to 90 cents per tax credit dollar. Production tax credits (PTCs), which are claimed over 10 years, generally receive an average of 90 cents in equity per dollar of credit. There is a broad variety of other clean energy tax credits, including battery storage, clean hydrogen, advanced energy projects, carbon sequestration and more. Those markets are less mature, with no clear data on the price per credit for non-ITC and non-PTC equity.

LIHTC

Novogradac estimates that the 2025 LIHTC equity market for newly minted tax credits is about $25, based on nearly $11 billion in population-based 9% LIHTC allocations and an estimated $14 billion in 4% private activity bond (PAB) generated LIHTCs. We say newly minted, as these estimates do not include remarketing by current investors of existing LIHTC investments. The amount of 4% credits is a bit rough due to the lack of detailed information regarding 2025 PAB bond issuance levels and related tax credit basis.

As of June 2025, Novogradac data shows both 9% and the 4% LIHTCs received average per-tax credit-dollar equity bid prices of roughly 85 cents. This 85-cent price reflects a 7-cent decline from the average pricing of 92 cents immediately after the enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 2017, wherein lowering the corporate tax rate caused a sharp drop from average pricing of $1.05. These are average equity bid prices, with some developments in high-demand CRA markets transacting at much higher prices and others in more challenging markets transacting at lower spot prices.

NMTC

The NMTC is a 39% credit, meaning in a year with a $5 billion allocation, there is $1.95 billion in credits. NMTC pricing is slightly lower than LIHTCs, according to members of the Investor Insights panel at the Novogradac 2025 Spring New Markets Tax Credit Conference in Washington, D.C. Panelists said that a median 78 to 80 cents per tax credit dollar was a reasonable pricing expectation. This lower pricing is due in part to the taxable nature of the NMTC.

HTC

The National Park Service’s annual report on the HTC for 2024 said there was $6.15 billion in estimated qualified rehabilitation expenditures in fiscal year 2024, meaning the 20% tax credit would generate $1.23 million in HTCs. A panel at the Novogradac 2024 Historic Tax Credit Conference in Kansas City, Missouri, set the pricing range for most federal HTCs from just below 80 cents to close to 90 cents.

Summary

Tax credit equity generally trades at less than a dollar, so the actual tax credit equity amount invested is generally lower than the tax credit allocation total. The amount of equity per credit dollar varies by credit, transaction structure, types of projects, credit timing, losses and other factors, but based on the aforementioned factors, our estimate of approximately an $80 billion 2025 tax credit market (roughly $50 billion in clean energy credits, $25 billion in LIHTCs, $2 billion in NMTCs and $1 billion in HTCs) translates into an estimate of roughly $75 billion in tax equity per year.

The Supply Road Ahead

The OBBBA directly affects the future supply of three of the four major community development tax credits mentioned here. The tax legislation expanded the LIHTC, made the NMTC permanent and sharply reduced the RETC supply over the coming years. The HTC remained untouched by the bill. Here’s a look at the near future for the credits:

Clean Energy

The tax legislation includes major rollbacks in clean energy tax incentives, including provisions created or expanded by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Those changes are expected to lead to the loss of billions of dollars in tax credits that would have been generated from 2026 through 2035, as well as a substantial reduction in power available to meet our nation’s increasing energy demands, not to mention the loss of overall economic activity and employment opportunities these power plants create within their communities. It is unclear how dramatically and rapidly the total will drop.

The legislation generally requires that solar and wind facilities begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed in service no later than Dec. 31, 2027, to be eligible for the ITC or PTC. Facilities that start construction before July 5, 2026, have until Dec. 31, 2030, to be placed in service. The ITC and PTC generate the largest amount of energy credits.

President Donald Trump doubled down on the phasedown when he issued an executive order July 7 directing the Secretary of the Treasury Department to take all action deemed necessary to strictly enforce the termination of the PTC and ITC, calling for guidance within 45 days, “to ensure that policies concerning the ‘beginning of construction’ are not circumvented.” That leaves open the possibility that Treasury could make the beginning-of-construction criteria more difficult to satisfy, further accelerating a decline in use of the ITC and PTC going forward.

Subject to future tax guidance from Treasury and other factors, industry participants expect the market in 2026 and 2027 to be in the range of $40 billion to $50 billion then dropping by $5 billion to $10 billion a year until 2031, where we estimate the market will level off.

LIHTC

The OBBBA enacts a permanent 12% increase in 9% LIHTC allocations, which means more than $1 billion per year in additional allocated tax credits. The new law also lowers the 50% financed-by test to 25% which means more affordable rental homes will be financed by PABs. By lowering the 50% test, the same amount of PABs can finance twice the rental housing. These increases in LIHTC resources will spur an increase in the construction and renovation of affordable rental housing. Novogradac estimates these changes could facilitate the financing of over 1.2 million units over the next 10 years. Historically, roughly 50% of PABs have financed new construction and 50% renovation of existing housing. That said, in recent years many housing agencies have prioritized the use of PABs for the construction of new residential rental housing, with the assistance of additional soft financing to help fill funding gaps. This often led to a dearth of renovation and preservation financing. Lowering the 50% test to 25% is expected to spur a rise in the financing of renovation and preservation developments. The market of LIHTCs is expected to rise to $32 billion to $35 billion, or more.

Many market participants believe current equity pricing is anticipating the increase in housing tax credit supply, with expectations of a 2 to 3 cent net reduction in average pricing, with the pricing of individual transactions varying more widely.

NMTCs

The OBBBA made the NMTC permanent, eliminating the uncertainty around its pending expiration. OBBBA did not include a much-desired inflation adjustment, so the annual newly minted NMTC will be about $1.95 billion a year, indefinitely.

However, this year the CDFI Fund combined two rounds into one, which means $10 billion in allocation issuance authority will be awarded, and $3.9 billion in NMTCs will be available in the marketplace, possibly beginning late this year, and certainly spilling over to all of next year, and likely beyond.

HTCs

The OBBBA left the HTC untouched, so that market will continue as before, with between $1 billion and $1.5 billion in credits anticipated to come to market annually over coming years.

Summary

The federal community development tax credits marketplace for 2025 is roughly $80 billion, and is predicted to rise several billion dollars in 2026 and 2027, as the expanded LIHTC resources reach the market and renewable energy transactions race to meet deadlines. Starting in 2028, the national supply of tax credits is likely to fall by $10 billion or more and continue an annual decline of $5 to $10 billion, leveling off in about 2031 to about $55 billion a year.

Further Factors in the Tax Credit Equation

Many factors on the macro and micro level affect the supply and demand for community development tax credits, the intersection of which determine tax credit equity pricing.

Below are some key factors. For many of them, it is easy to predict the direction each factor will have on equity pricing, but the magnitude of the effect is hard to discern. This makes it challenging to identify the aggregate net effect on equity pricing.

Other OBBBA Tax Law Changes

The OBBBA included many additional tax law changes that indirectly affect community development tax incentives and will affect the appetite for and value of tax incentive equity investments. Two of the changes are:

The OBBBA makes 100% bonus depreciation generally available for personal property and land improvements placed in service after Jan. 19, 2025. Compared to the previous phasedown to 40% for 2025 (which would have then dropped to 20% in 2026), the change accelerates tax loss benefits for renewable energy and LIHTC investments, generally making them more attractive. OBBBA also allows full expensing for specified manufacturing plants.

The bill makes permanent the expanded ability to deduct interest expense under Internal Revenue Code 163(j), by allowing depreciation and amortization to be added back in calculating interest expense deduction limits.

State of the Economy, Inflation, Interest Rates, Corporate Profits

Perhaps the most unpredictable factors in the tax credit space is the state of the economy, interest rates and corporate profits.

The state of the economy affects investor demand for tax credits. A mild recession generally adversely affects the profits and tax liability for major tax credit investors and brings unforeseen consequences. An extreme example is the Great Recession of 2008-2009, which resulted in both Fannie and Freddie going into conservatorship, unprecedented losses for major investors (federal corporate tax income receipts dropped from $370.2 billion in 2007 to $138.2 billion in 2009) and a dramatic drop in pricing for tax credits (Novogradac data shows LIHTC per-dollar costs decreased from around 90 cents in 2007 to about 60 cents by late 2009). Additionally, new construction of multifamily properties (of at least five units) dropped from an annual rate of 347,000 units in October 2007 to 53,000 two years later, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In that case, the economy was hit so hard that legislation (The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) passed, including provisions to boost affordable housing.

There were similar dips in HTC and NMTC markets (and an extra allocation of NMTCs) during the Great Recession. Neither market fully recovered until 2013–for instance, according to National Park Service data, the annual amount of private investment in HTC properties was at $5.64 billion in 2009 (which is when projects were certified, meaning most were started before the recession), but didn’t reach that amount again until 2013.

Similarly, inflation and interest rates significantly affect community development feasibility and financing. Higher inflation means higher development and operating costs, as well as higher interest rates. Higher interest rates further increase development costs and reduces the amount of long-term debt financing otherwise available. Higher interest rates also adversely affect tax credit equity pricing, as the price per tax credit dollar falls so investment yields rise to remain competitive with comparable non-tax-credit investments.

Fannie and Freddie Investment Appetite

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are each limited to investing $1 billion annually in LIHTC properties, with a subrequirement that they invest more than $500 million each in areas that have difficulty attracting investors. If the caps were raised, that higher limit would increase the demand for LIHTCs. Note, President Trump has suggested that the government-sponsored entities move out of conservatorship, which could affect the LIHTC investment limit, as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s desire to invest in LIHTCs–although it’s unclear the magnitude and direction of any effects.

Community Reinvestment Act, Capital Charges, Investment Limits

The 1995 version of Community Reinvestment Act regulations, which govern how financial institutions should meet the credit needs of their communities (including tax credit investments), appear likely to remain in place for the short term. Over the longer term, changes are possible, given new leadership at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and Federal Reserve and such changes likely would affect tax credit appetite.

Similarly, amendments to bank capital regulations, including the rejection of a proposal that would have increased the capital requirements for clean energy tax incentives, would alter the attractiveness to banks of investing in community development tax incentives. Reductions in capital requirements for community development investments would increase their comparative attractiveness, and more wide spread reductions could lead to greater bank profits and a larger need for tax credits.

Current law limits bank investments in community development projects to 15% of capital and surplus. An increase in this cap would likely increase bank investment in community development tax credits.

Future Tax Bills

Immediately after passage of the OBBBA, some Republicans in Congress suggested future spending and tax reconciliation legislation, which could affect community development tax incentives. House Ways and Means Committee chair Jason Smith, R-Missouri, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, both suggested a second reconciliation bill. Congress has not yet considered the FY 2026 budget resolution, so it’s possible that such a budget resolution could include reconciliation instructions to address spending and tax proposals.

In this space in recent months, I suggested provisions that could be included in such legislation–provisions that would affect the community development tax credit market. That includes such things as encouraging more individual investment, allowing tax credits to reduce tax liability beyond the current 75% limit, expanding the carryback period for community development tax credits to five years and more.

There also remains the possibility of a year-end bipartisan tax bill to address expiring provisions and other tax issues, which could include enhancements to the HTC, health care-related tax provisions and the work opportunity tax credit.

The threat of a proposed global minimum tax–which the Trump administration pushed back against–appears to be a considerably lower threat.

Opportunity Zones

The OBBBA makes the opportunity zones (OZ) incentive permanent. The OZ incentive is complementary to tax credits as some affordable housing, clean energy, and historic tax credit developments have accessed OZ equity financing, as well as some businesses financed with NMTCs.

The success of the OZ incentive, with more than $100 billion in investment since becoming law in late 2017, make the outlook for OZ positive.

The manner in which the new law phases in the next round of zones, is likely to create a “dead zone” for OZs in 2026, because investments in funds made in 2026 only gain deferral through the end of the year, while any investment made Jan. 1, 2027, or later is eligible for basis step-up and deferrals for five years. This translates into a large investment volume in 2027, and then a leveling for 2028 and beyond. The benefit of OZ investment as a twin or sidecar partner with community development tax credits will likely slow in 2026, then pick up in 2027.

Key Takeaways

With a living, changing, organic tax credit and tax credit equity market, there are, as former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld once said, “known knowns,” “known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns.”

Known Knowns

The effect of the OBBBA on clean energy tax credits is obvious–over time, the market will see a dramatic decrease in the amount of credits available, although the magnitude and rate of the decline is unclear. Similarly, the 12% increase in allocated LIHTCs and the lowering of the financed-by test for PABs mean that there will be more LIHTCs on the market in the coming years, although again the speed at which those credits enter the market and their effect on pricing is not clear.

The $10 billion NMTC round ensures that there will be a doubling of that credit in the marketplace, although we don’t yet know the rate and effect on pricing. After that, the NMTC and the HTC will both remain at or near their current level in the volume of tax credits entering the market.

Known Unknowns

In addition to the aforementioned questions about the rate and effect on pricing of the OBBBA’s changes for clean energy and LIHTCs, known unknowns include the state of the economy, inflation, interest rates and corporate profits, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac’s appetite for tax credits, banking regulations and what future tax bills may hold.

Unknown Unknowns

By definition, we don’t know what the unknown unknowns are. But when they appear, their effect on the tax credit equity market could be substantial.",https://www.novoco.com/static/images/favicon.4c5b39a4ae2a.ico,N,,2025-08-01 16:05:17.013627

Catastrophic coal ash spills in Kingston, Tennessee and on the Dan River in North Carolina and Virginia show that health, environmental, and economic impacts of an unthinkable coal ash tragedy take decades to recover from.
“Alabama Power must join utilities across the South cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps.
In Virginia, Dominion Energy is excavating all its unlined coal ash impoundments, and Appalachian Power is excavating its sole open coal ash impoundment.","On behalf of Coosa Riverkeeper, the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC) filed a lawsuit against Alabama Power Company over ongoing groundwater pollution from Alabama Power’s failed closure by capping its leaking toxic coal ash lagoon at the former Gadsden Steam Plant. This ongoing pollution has been a problem since the lagoon was capped in a manner that violates of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule, which regulate coal ash disposal.

Coal ash is the byproduct of burning coal for energy generation. Alabama Power chose to store nearly 1.5 million tons of toxic coal ash created at Plant Gadsden in an unlined pit, in the floodplain, on the banks of Neely Henry Lake and the Coosa River. Alabama Power “capped” the pond in an unlined leaking pit, but the company’s own reports show the ash underneath remains in contact with water — in fact, nearly 40 percent of the ash remains saturated in water. As recently as October 2024, Alabama Power reported levels of arsenic forty times the legal standard in groundwater in its testing wells. This shows that Alabama Power’s chosen method of burying its toxic coal ash does not protect important groundwater resources. Alabama Power also relies on a faulty groundwater monitoring system that does not adequately measure how the magnitude of coal ash contamination of the environment. These are clear violations of national coal ash disposal standards.

“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” said Justinn Overton, Executive Director and Riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness. It’s time for Alabama Power to do the right thing and move their ash.”

The coal ash pond is less than a mile upstream from a drinking water intake for the Gadsden Water Works and Sewer Board that provides drinking water to over 14,000 customers.

Neely Henry Lake’s estimated economic impact for the region was up to $570 million in 2017. Catastrophic coal ash spills in Kingston, Tennessee and on the Dan River in North Carolina and Virginia show that health, environmental, and economic impacts of an unthinkable coal ash tragedy take decades to recover from.

“There is no excuse for a company with Alabama Power’s resources to risk a community and commercial riverfront with this type of hazard,” said Barry Brock, director of SELC’s Alabama office. “Alabama Power must join utilities across the South cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps. This type of waste must be in safe storage away from waterways like the Coosa and Neely Henry Lake.”

Coal ash contains dangerous heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic, which are known to cause cancer and other serious illnesses, according to the EPA.

Utilities across the Southeast have moved more than a quarter of a billion tons of toxic coal ash to safe, dry, lined landfills, or they are recycling ash into cement and concrete. Every unlined pond in North and South Carolina has been excavated or is being excavated, including Duke Energy who is excavating more than 145 million tons. In Virginia, Dominion Energy is excavating all its unlined coal ash impoundments, and Appalachian Power is excavating its sole open coal ash impoundment. The Tennessee Valley Authority is excavating 12 million tons of coal ash. Alabama Power’s sister company, Georgia Power, is excavating half of the coal ash it has stored in unlined ponds, and in May 2024 submitted plans to excavate another 16 million tons.

The Southern Environmental Law Center is one of the nation’s most powerful defenders of the environment, rooted in the South. With a long track record, SELC takes on the toughest environmental challenges in court, in government, and in our communities to protect the region’s air, water, climate, wildlife, lands and people.

Important note to investors regarding operating, reported earnings

Dominion Energy uses operating earnings (non-GAAP) as the primary performance measurement of its results for public communications with analysts and investors. Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the company's incentive compensation plans, and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the company's fundamental earnings power. In providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, the mark-to-market impact of economic hedging activities, gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning trust funds, market-related impacts on pension and other postretirement benefit plans, acquisitions, divestitures, or extreme weather events and other natural disasters. At this time, Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings. Accordingly, Dominion Energy is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.

Rader cited progress made under the Clean Air Act, including a 21% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions between 2005 and 2020, improved asthma outcomes for children, and a booming clean energy job market. He also raised alarm over growing fossil fuel industry influence, pointing to recent internal conflict at the EPA, where over 140 employees were placed on administrative leave after opposing the proposal.

“Ohioans are already suffering the impacts of climate change, from extreme heat to toxic air,” said Rep. Rader. “We need an EPA that follows the science, respects the law, and puts people before polluters.”

Rep. Rader also encouraged Ohioans and all Americans to submit public comments opposing the rollback before the official deadline on September 15, 2025. To submit written comments, please do the following:

This week, China took a major new step down that path of progress with about $2.1 billion in new funding that positions Shanghai-based company China Fusion Energy Co. as the central state-controlled commercialization vehicle for fusion in China.

Chinese state and industrial leaders are positioning the country to lead the world in innovation. They’re working to replicate the ecosystem of ideas and invention that has made the U.S. so special on the world’s stage, touching billions of lives with core technologies like the automobile and the internet.

Doing so supports China’s own economic development and extends the country’s long-term geopolitical influence, the exact same advantages the innovation ecosystem brought to the U.S. over the last century. The Chinese effort is forward-looking, placing bets on the technologies that will dominate the global economy for generations.

That means funding both for basic research areas like life sciences, materials science, and quantum computing and for applied research in areas like semiconductors, electric vehicles, AI, batteries — and fusion, the last new energy source humanity will need.

This week, China took a major new step down that path of progress with about $2.1 billion in new funding that positions Shanghai-based company China Fusion Energy Co. as the central state-controlled commercialization vehicle for fusion in China. China Fusion Energy Co. links expertise from major universities, industrial powers and state-owned energy companies — several of which are investors in the new company. Their aim — develop a Chinese fusion industry. As one Chinese press report put it, “the national team has arrived.”

This is a direct competitor to the company I co-founded and have been building for the last seven years. Like Commonwealth Fusion Systems, the Chinese effort aims to build a fusion device called a tokamak to generate electricity. Also like Commonwealth, this effort will use high-temperature superconductors, an approach that enables a more compact and therefore competitive power plant. It’s highly validating that our technical approach is very promising, but it also shows that coordinated state action has now fully entered the race for fusion energy.

From afar, it can be hard to understand exactly what China’s blend of government and private efforts is doing. It’s clear, though, they are organized and well resourced. Some of their fusion work is significant enough that you can see the facilities from space. Add China Fusion Energy Co. to the list of signals that China understands the importance of fusion and is moving aggressively to lead the race to develop it.

“This is a clear signal that Beijing is consolidating its fusion efforts into a full-scale, nationally coordinated industrial strategy,” concludes RAND analyst Jimmy Goodrich, who tracks Chinese science and innovation efforts closely.

We’ve seen this movie before. China’s manufacturing might, deep supply chains, workforce development and centrally driven development has let it dominate new industries like solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles. Many of these technologies were invented in the U.S.

In contrast, the U.S. government isn’t keeping up when it comes to fusion. A recent report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that only about 1 percent of Department of Energy-funded fusion efforts supported commercialization — through the department’s modestly funded Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program. If the U.S. is to compete with other nations in the race to commercialize fusion, the federal government needs to radically improve its commitment to deploying fusion.

We know other ways Congress and the administration could help fusion besides funding the Milestone program to match the ambition of China and other competitors. The Department of Energy Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee in 2020 published a new long-range plan — “Powering the Future: Fusion and Plasmas” — that details the research facilities that could help all fusion energy companies deploy power plants and scale more quickly. But it’s China, not the U.S., that’s building these research test stands and facilities the U.S. fusion industry needs to accelerate fusion’s deployment and rapid scaling.

Energy unlocks prosperity for people, businesses and nations. Whoever controls that energy commands an outsized impact on the world and on the future of everyone who lives on it. Right now Washington is focusing on American energy dominance, powering AI and improving energy security. It’s clear what the government could do to cultivate that instead of its present course that fails to respond to Chinese energy dominance for fusion.

Those groups now face the difficult decision of how to handle environmental projects which are usually years in the making.

The Illinois Environmental Council [IEC] is a nonprofit organization working to make sure environmental and climate communities are heard in public policy and legislative affairs.

IEC published its own analysis of the bill, claiming it would set back environmental progress, jobs and initiatives across Illinois. The organization is worried how the law will affect the wallets and livelihoods of Illinoisans.

“We don’t have a specific breakdown number of everyone that would be impacted, but we know that that’s a large number,” said Senior Policy Manager Cate Caldwell. “We could see as little as thousands or as many as hundreds of thousands. It’s definitely concerning.”

As renewable energy will be less abundant than environmental activists had hoped, Caldwell said residents are likely to see their electricity bills increase substantially. She said IEC expects bills to increase by approximately 21% over the next year for industrial energy bills in Central Illinois, as solar and wind farms become more expensive.

“We’re seeing that it can be as little as $121 increase for energy bills for homeowners, but up to $400 annually and that can be for commercial or industrial energy bills,” she said.

Caldwell is also concerned with job cuts — the jobs that come along with the construction, installation and operation of those renewable energy sites. IEC estimates somewhere between 20,000 and 52,000 jobs that could be lost.

McLean County Board Member Lea Cline said the impact for McLean County will not be known until it is already in effect.

The chair of the board’s land use and transportation committee said the Future Energy Jobs Act and the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act in Illinois protect some renewable energy employment.

“And both of those are focused on ensuring that as renewable energy technology is being increasingly deployed in the state that we are providing for job training and that we are providing for good paying jobs, local jobs, Illinois jobs in the process,” Cline said. “Those things aren’t going to go away.”

Cline said the county could still be more attractive for developers compared to other counties after a recent upgrade to high voltage transmission lines.

Caldwell said the greater concern for IEC is what lies in the future for the environment and the clean energy sector. Those long-term challenges can keep a community from bouncing back.

“Let’s just say … you’re seeing like maybe a $50 increase on your energy bill, then let’s just say by 2030, 2032 you’re seeing almost $100, $200,” Caldwell said. “Then let’s just say you are someone that works in the energy industry … and you’ve been laid off. It’s really hard to recover from that, especially if you don’t have that federal assistance and even at the state level.”

Caldwell said the districts most reliant on the soon-to-be ending tax credits are largely the Republican ones, like those of U.S. Reps Mike Bost, Mary Miller and Darin LaHood, all of whom voted in favor of the bill.

Illinois was previously on track to sustain a 100% clean energy grid by 2050, another objective which IEC said is in jeopardy. Caldwell said it is not out of reach yet. She said legislators can still pass the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act [CRGA].

“I think the main driving point right now is that we can’t put our belief in the federal government that we’re going to be able to be successful with these rollbacks happening, but I think we can hold our state lawmakers accountable to continue that work,” she said. “I think if we actually pass CRGA … I think we’ll still be on track.”

Caldwell said CRGA could be taken up by lawmakers during the upcoming veto session in October. It would strengthen energy efficiency, prioritize clean energy resources and promote transmission improvements to strengthen the power grid.

The reconciliation bill made cuts to agriculture subsidies as well, according to IEC. Caldwell said the cap of payments and eligibility rules changed to favor large scale producers. She said there are caps on how much one producer can receive and income limits on what subsidies they can receive, resulting in agrobusinesses qualifying for more than their small-scale peers.

“So, it’s almost like they’re creating different loopholes to where large operations, they receive far more than the cap would actually suggest,” Caldwell said.

Solar developer's perspective

One of the most consequential elements of the bill in reference to clean energy is the loss of tax credits, prompting some developers to give special care to their projects.

Michael Larkin is development manager at PureSky Energy, a solar developer based in Denver. PureSky has five projects in McLean County ranging from one and a half to five megawatts, with four of those being in Bloomington and one in Gridley.

Larkin said their smallest project in rural Bloomington is currently being constructed and it is the furthest along; it is planned to be energized by November and fully operational by the end of the year. The remaining sites are expected to be operational next summer.

While PureSky is sticking to the original schedule for its solar projects, Larkin said the new law is not making the timeline any easier. They were depending on incentives like the Investment Tax Credit [ITC], which was extended to 2030 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Under the Trump bill, it will be heavily restricted after 2027.

“These projects were under the assumption that the modules, the transformers, the inverters, there would be a 30% tax rebate on the value of all that equipment, back when we were getting these projects submitted,” he said. “Basically, from how we understand it now is these projects need to be built and operating by … 2027.”

ITC, which is a common credit used by developers, was not eliminated but rather heavily restricted. New restrictions of ITC go into effect after Dec. 31, 2027. All renewable energy projects must be in operation by the date, otherwise they are not eligible for the credits.

Larkin said PureSky investigated the possibility of buying materials before the ITC ended to see if they would still be eligible for the rebate, but an executive order by Trump clarified they would not be. Larkin said his company does not take advantage of the rebate, rather they pass the savings onto the people funding construction loans.

PureSky is an independent power producer building, owning and operating the solar farms they develop for community solar projects. A key branch of its development is finding new locations for solar.

“We have a decent portion of the company that’s land origination, like goes out just to sign new contracts with new landowners to develop new projects, and we’ve really slowed that down with sort of the uncertainty of 2027 and beyond here,” Larkin said.

PureSky had a round of layoffs in July almost exclusively in their land origination team as they slow down inspection of new sites, according to Larkin. He said land origination development in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts has stopped almost entirely.

Larkin said tax incentives are not the only changes his company is facing. On top of having to change an engineer of records which slowed the projects down already, Trump’s tariffs on solar farm materials are disrupting the project as well.

“We’ve changed the type of inverters that we’re buying, as well as the panels,” Larkin said. “Sometimes we wait a little later in the process to start procuring, but we’re kind of getting it done earlier here to make sure everything is here and there’s no equipment delivery delays that are going to hold up construction.”

Larkin said he does see fewer projects from his company and others moving forward. His assessment was also that the slowdown will probably take a few years to be seen after the pipeline of projects empties out after current ones are built.

“Where all the projects that are currently undergoing study or in the queue have been processed by the utility … and then we get several years in the future here and there weren’t projects in the queue behind applying because they didn’t think it was economically feasible without the tax credit,” he said. ""It is a multi-year process, and you got to plan out years in advance.”

While the reconciliation bill had other cuts aside from renewable energy, Larkin said he felt the industry is still “singled out” by the Trump administration. He referenced a memo from Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum as evidence. The memo surrounded a U.S. Fish and Wildlife requirement where developers must consult them to not endanger any animals in the area where they wish to build.

“Now that is just for renewable projects, wind and solar, you have to get the interior secretary’s sign off,” he said. “It’s just another stage gate, another pinch point that could potentially slow down this review and then also it’s not being reviewed by U.S Fish and Wildlife anymore.”

McLean County impact?

Cline said it is not feasible for the county to offer incentives that may make up for federal ones.

“So, I think there’s going to be a kind of renegotiation or a reconsideration by a lot of these developers, but there’s nothing really that we ever provided other than we’ve got a lot of space and willing landowners,” she said. “So, there’s really not going to be a big impact … at least not immediately, locally.”

She said the business side of the projects is not the role of the board. While they do work with developers for new projects, she said they don’t have as much power as it may appear when it comes to the politics of renewable energy.

“I don’t know if we can be a gamechanger in any way in the state other than … being consistent,” she said. “Being consistent with our rules and how we execute them, by being consistent with how we deal with these projects once they come into the county … how good of a partner we are to them.”

McLean County has had renewable energy since 2007, which marked the start of operations for the first wind turbines in the area. Coupled with community support and cooperative landowners, the county has proven to be somewhat of a leader in the sector, according to Cline. An exception might be 2023’s Public Act 102-1123, which standardized all zoning in the state for renewable energy.

“I think we have positioned ourselves the best we could coming up to this legislation. We have a community that seems ready and willing to engage,” she said. “So, yeah, we’re quite lucky to have some very lucrative projects in the county.”

Cline said the new legislation transitioned the county — specifically the land use and transportation committee — into more of an overseer of the projects instead a development partner. Cline said the county simply ensures all proposed projects are adhering to state standards.

“I do try, and I know our land use colleagues try, to be open and honest and available to the developers, to talk to them about how to maintain good relationships with, for instance, the township road supervisors and folks in the county,” Cline said. “So, all we can really do is to be, sort of, good partners as they develop or at least bring their big ideas to fruition in our county.”

Cline said in her experience, developers are most often seeking clarity on zoning and other rules from the county.

Despite the loss of funding and tax credits, Cline does not see a reduction in interest for renewable energy in McLean County, at least initially.

“So, if you’ve got projects in the pipeline, or you’re developing them now, there’s an incentive to do that quickly so you don’t have to follow these new rules. So … in the short term, we might see a bit of a burst,” she said. “After that point, I think we might see a bit of a slowdown … I think it’s going to be about the availability of product.”

While Cline does not argue with the idea of the county being a leader in renewable energy, she does not agree the county is sacrificing large patches of valuable farmland. By her estimation, less than 1% of arable farmland in the county has been dedicated to wind and solar projects.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c8ab269/2147483647/strip/true/crop/729x383+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fda%2F34%2Feeab2d1f4dd0878ef752ff99615b%2Fwind-energy-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 15:03:18.399266

“We’re going to see more people get sick, more people get asthma, more people come in with COPD exacerbations. I mean, the data is there. It’s very clear what’s happening.”

The MiCCA said in a release that EPA cites no sources supporting its claim that the endangerment finding is costing Americans $54 billion a year.

Rabin said exacerbating the effects of climate change does no one any good. He primarily treats the elderly for emphysema and other COPD ailments, but said they’re not the only ones who could be harmed.

“We all have kids, we all have grandkids and whether you’re a Republican, or a Democrat, or Independent, we all breathe the same air. And at the same time, the people who probably have the least voice, are also the greatest affected,"" he said.

As previously reported, climate change is particularly hard on young children.

If the proposal to rescind greenhouse gas regulations is finalized, environmental groups are likely to challenge the EPA’s action in court.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3381218/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1371x720+56+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F4f%2Ff653616e49c6821fdaf8c76bcf4d%2Ffeaturedimage-reds-air-quality-20220522.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 15:04:05.121028

Polis delivered the instruction in a letter Friday. He told reporters his intent was to “get red tape out of the way” so that the state could approve clean energy projects more quickly. His letter specifically calls out projects that qualify for three tax credits that were limited by the sweeping tax-and-spend bill passed by Congress and signed into law last month.

The credits have provided tax incentives for homeowners who install clean energy systems like solar panels and for energy producers that use clean technology, including wind or solar. The tax bill gave homeowners and producers a shorter runway to make use of them.

Polis also urged utilities and private sector energy producers in the letter to “bring forward the investment, equipment, and workforce to augment our efforts to deploy this infrastructure as quickly as possible,” alongside local governments.

“We can confidently commit to utilities, investors, developers, and customers that we will work to ensure qualifying, cost-effective energy generation starts construction or is placed in service in time to receive federal tax credits,” Polis wrote.

To do that, the governor said, the Public Utilities Commission and the Department of Public Health and Environment will both work to provide faster responses, prioritize clean energy-related permitting and decisions, and provide technical assistance to local governments.

With the rise of AI-driven computing, cloud storage, real-time streaming, and hyperscale platforms, data centers are emerging as one of the most energy-intensive facilities globally. These operations demand 100% uptime, resilient off-grid capability, and cleaner, more efficient energy sources that reduce exposure to aging grid infrastructure and rising utility costs.

To respond to these demands, Energy America is deploying modular CHP power stations as the cornerstone of its global data center energy strategy. These stations will deliver continuous 24-hour power generation, leveraging advanced thermal and electrical conversion systems to optimize fuel use while ensuring grid independence and operational resilience.

Strategic Drivers Behind EA's CHP Program

🏗 Land-Intensive Development Requires On-Site Energy

As data center campuses grow in physical scale, especially in Tier 1 markets like Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and international zones like the UAE, South Africa, and Southeast Asia, EA is meeting the need for on-premises, high-density energy systems by integrating CHP units directly into master-planned data center utility zones.

⚡ Uninterrupted, High-Efficiency Power Delivery

EA’s CHP systems achieve thermal-electric efficiency levels of over 85%, generating both electricity and usable heat from a single fuel source (natural gas, hydrogen-ready blends, or biogas). This dual-output model is particularly valuable for data centers with advanced HVAC or water-cooling systems, allowing for energy reuse and lower operating costs.

🧠 AI, Edge, and HPC Compatibility

Whether deployed at hyperscale campuses or distributed edge nodes, EA’s CHP architecture is optimized for power-intensive applications such as AI model training, blockchain processing, and high-performance computing (HPC). With load-following capability and rapid dispatch response, EA CHP solutions keep latency low and performance high.

🔄 Hybrid Energy Integration with Solar + Storage

CHP stations are designed to be deployed alongside EA’s core renewable assets—utility-scale solar farms and advanced battery energy storage systems (BESS). This hybrid design allows EA clients to benefit from maximum uptime, reduced carbon intensity, and enhanced energy security, even in grid-unstable environments.

Global Expansion Strategy

EA is actively rolling out its CHP deployment strategy in:

United States: California, Texas, North Carolina, Virginia, and New York—co-located with existing EA solar and BESS infrastructure.

Middle East: Strategic zones in Saudi Arabia and the UAE where data center megaprojects are underway.

Africa: Tier 2 locations with grid reliability challenges—Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa.

Southeast Asia & LATAM: Where digital infrastructure demand is growing and land-based energy security is critical.

Each CHP deployment will be backed by Energy America’s vertically integrated development platform, including EPC services through Ganymede Utilities, in-house energy project financing, and long-term O&M under a dedicated infrastructure management division.

Statement from Leadership

“Our clients—whether hyperscale operators, AI infrastructure companies, or sovereign governments—are looking for resilient, low-emission energy strategies that can be rapidly deployed at scale,” said Zoheb Khan, Vice President of Energy America. “CHP isn’t just a backup; it’s the backbone of our next-generation energy strategy. It ensures our customers have guaranteed, 24/7 power—regardless of grid conditions.”

As if that weren't enough, exhaust fumes can also wreak havoc on air quality and public health, as Los Angeles discovered when it became choked with smog in the mid-20th century. Thankfully, stricter EPA standards tamped down on (though didn't fully solve) the problem, and there's absolutely no way the EPA would ever go back on— oh, wait, uh, forget that part.

Zero emission vehicles like EVs, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen cars have long been talked about as a key part of the solution to global warming, but what about public health? Would driving around in a refreshed Chevy Bolt actually make your neighbors live longer? Well, according to a new study out of the University of Southern California, the answer is yes, actually.

As the USC scientists note in their report, a number of studies have been done based on projections of pollution and public health, but until now, there hadn't been one on actual real-world data. With California's relatively high adoption rate for EVs, the team was able to comb through data from 2013 to 2019 to see what impact electrification was actually having. How's this for an effect: An increase of just 20 ZEVs per 1,000 people resulted in a 3.2% drop in asthma-related visits to the emergency room. That's an enormous health benefit for just 20 cars.

The report points out that Americans spend $56 billion on asthma every year, including $50 billion on treating it. Other studies cited in the report have calculated that switching over to ZEVs altogether would save $1.2 trillion in healthcare by 2050, preventing 2.7 million asthma attacks and saving 110,000 lives. The team at USC have found tangible evidence that this is plausible. That's a lot of lives either saved or improved just by purchasing a different ride.

The fact that car pollution is bad for you isn't exactly new; again, the major takeaway here is just how big an impact comes from only a few more ZEVs on the road. However, the other big finding is that these effects are highly localized. Rich zip codes tend to have more ZEVs than poorer ones, which means the associated health benefits are concentrated there. With federal tax credits expiring, not to mention tariff chaos, electric car prices are only going to get more out of reach for many people.

America needs to wean itself off of its dinosaur juice addiction, but the speed at which that happens won't be the same for everyone. Things are likely to get better in wealthy neighborhoods first, unless there's a systemic effort to make the solutions more affordable. Alas, that's not exactly the direction we're all headed in right now.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/just-a-few-extra-evs-in-your-neighborhood-might-save-you-from-an-asthma-attack/l-intro-1753920849.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 17:02:51.443028

That means even if Aypa Power doesn't appeal the decision, a similar facility could pop up elsewhere in the county.

The Hamilton County Board of Zoning Appeals voted unanimously to deny Aypa Power a land use change that would allow the Kingfisher Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) to move forward on 70 acres of farmland at 21598 Overdorf Road.

Aypa asserted the storage was needed to answer increased energy demand as the county is being developed. The power from gas, solar and wind sources would be sent to the Midcontinent Independent Systems Operator (MISO) grid when needed at times of high consumption such as heat waves.

“We need infrastructure growth to meet business growth and an energy shortfall in the MISO territory,” Aypa lead developer Brandon Grahman told the board.

The rows of tall container cubes would use lithium batteries to store enough electricity to power 60,000 homes for four hours. That stoked the fears of residents nearby who said the risk of environmental and health damage caused if a fire broke out made the plant unsafe. The lithium batteries burn for a long time and can be difficult to extinguish; a fire in a California battery plant in January burned for three days.

“Our current fire department is not equipped to have a fire that involves this complex industrial technology,” said Alicia Kiovsky, of Arcadia, at the recent BZA meeting. “We should not approve a project that puts first responders and the community at risk.”

Sondra Pearson, who lives in a cluster of homes blocks from the proposed site, said a tornado could pick up the boxes and drop them anywhere.

“Hazardous components will leak in the soil,” she said. “It is an unsafe environment for the species that live there and the humans that live there.”

Noblesville resident Danny Ariaga said he worried that the county did not have qualified inspectors to make sure the company was complying with the terms of operation, such as the voltage and amount of energy being stored.

“What effect will they have on the White River and wells? he asked. “It is about preserving the safety, beauty and character of our rural community.”

Though the plant would be on land that is currently zoned for agriculture, a Duke Energy substation is already nearby, next to the proposed site. Grahman said that makes sending power to the grid easier, faster and safer and the storage containers would be non-intrusive.

“This is using zero panels and zero wind turbines,” Grahman said. “We need infrastructure growth to meet business growth and an energy shortfall in the MISO territory.”

Aypa has two other battery storage projects in Indiana, in Jefferson and Decatur counties.

The BZA’s staff had recommended that the board approve the plan but the panel’s members appeared concerned about safety during questioning.

Grahman told them that the company would supervise emergency training and had one training session already and a couple of meetings with local fire departments and emergency management employees. He said the high-profile Moss Landing fire in California, at a facility owned by Vistra Corp., was made worse because of improper planning by the company.

“It was a blueprint for how you do not want to construct and battery storage system,” he said.

Moss Landing was indoors with all the battery containers under one roof and nothing to stop the fire from spreading, Grahman said. The Hamilton County project would have have separate containers so fires would be restricted to them. Vistra also used a more volatile battery type, which wouldn't be used here, Grahman said.

All four board members voted against the zoning variance, with two saying it didn’t comply with the county’s long range comprehensive plan.

The company can appeal the decision to the Hamilton County Superior Court but officials declined to answer IndyStar inquiries into whether it planned to do so.

Could energy shortage lead to rolling blackouts?

In a recent report, MISO said its 14-state region could face a shortage of 32% of needed power by 2040. That could lead to rolling blackouts of three to four hours, 13 to 26 days a year.

“Such interruptions would most likely occur after sunset on hot summer days with low wind output and on cold winter days before sunrise and after sunset,” concluded the report, titled “MISO’s Response to the Reliability Imperative,” released in February 2024.

Kerwin Olsen, executive director of the utility watchdog group Citizens Action Coalition agreed there is a need for energy storage — and it is growing more urgent because of the proliferation of data processing centers in Indiana.

“It’s all connected,” he said. “The centers and AI (artificial intelligence) will substantially increase energy demand.”

The CAC has called for a moratorium on approval of the data centers, which use an inordinate amount of electricity to operate and water to cool the plants. The center’s hoarding of utilities could force other economic development projects to be delayed or scrapped. The centers themselves provide few jobs, though they get large tax subsidies, the CAC said.

At least 20 data centers are either under construction or have been proposed in Indiana, including those in Boone, Hendricks, Morgan and Hancock counties. Google is building a center in Fort Wayne and plans one on the southside of Indianapolis.

Citing a study by Indiana Michigan Power, Olsen’s organization said the data centers will use more electricity per year by 2030 (35 million MWh per year) than all 6.8 million Hoosiers use in their homes today.

Olsen said the risk of fires at battery storage plants are relatively minor and get overblown and “exploited by the anti-renewable crowd,” because they store mostly wind and solar energy in reserve.

Hamilton County Commissioner Mark Heirbrandt said the public needs to get “educated” on the need for energy storage.

“The energy needs need to be conveyed better,” said Heirbrandt, a water and energy industry consultant. “Once they see that they are losing power during high usage they’ll see we don’t have enough.”

But Heirbrandt said the BZA made the right call in this case.

“I don’t think the company showed why it needed to happen there,” he said. “We’ll end up putting something somewhere.”","https://www.indystar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/29/PIND/85430241007-battery-2.png?crop=1101,618,x100,y0&width=1101&height=618&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-01 15:04:40.152081

Now, in the face of an administration actively dismantling clean car standards and climate investments, California must double down—codifying its clean vehicle rules, electrifying public and private fleets, and ensuring equitable access to clean transportation is at the center of its transition.”

In the letters, groups including Public Citizen call on the California Air Resources Board to enact state policies that uphold its authority and accelerate adoption of zero emission vehicles (ZEV) across the state. The recommendations include:

Strengthening California’s ZEV rules

Mandating fleet vehicles transition to zero emissions

Building and incentivizing equitable access to charging infrastructure

Positioning the state as a leader in the effort to decarbonize steel and battery supply chains

Ensuring California enforces strong labor and human rights standards across EV supply chains

Implementing legal defense strategies that will protect these policies from federal attack

“California can continue to be a climate visionary by leading on not only EV adoption but also taking concrete steps to address the emissions associated with clean vehicle supply chains while creating good jobs in the state,” said Abhilasha Bhola, auto supply chain campaign director with Public Citizen’s Climate Program. “California can and must send clear signals to the steel industry, battery manufacturers, and other companies operating in the vehicle supply chain that decreasing emissions is essential to continuing to be competitive in the largest car market in the United States.”

In the most detrimental climate change–related regulatory action ever, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed this week to withdraw its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases “endanger public health or welfare.” EPA had consistently invoked this endangerment finding in its regulatory actions, including during the Trump administration’s first term.

In addition, EPA proposed to repeal all its greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks. To justify these deeply misguided actions, the agency engaged in a shocking display of professional ineptitude, invoking legal, scientific, and economic arguments so weak that, if raised before a court, they might trigger disciplinary sanctions.

In its legal claims, EPA argued that the definition of “air pollutant” for the purposes of the Clean Air Act applies only to “local and regional” pollution, not to global pollution like greenhouse gas emissions. The “local and regional” limitation does not appear anywhere in the text of the statute. Quite to the contrary, the definition of “welfare” in the Clean Air Act includes “effects on … weather … and climate.” The Supreme Court has recently made clear that “when Congress chooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, courts apply the broad rule.” EPA has violated this clear command in making up a limitation out of whole cloth.

Besides running roughshod over the statute, EPA also ignored at least three important Supreme Court decisions related to climate change. Massachusetts v. EPA, a case that also involved EPA’s authority to regulate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions, explicitly rejects EPA’s argument that the Clean Air Act’s vehicle provisions apply only to local or regional pollutants. The court was clear that the “statutory text forecloses EPA’s reading” that “Congress did not intend it to regulate substances that con­tribute to climate change.”

EPA also mischaracterized UARG v. EPA, claiming that this case established that the agency “may not treat greenhouse gases as a pollutant” for the purposes of two other important Clean Air Act programs. In fact, in UARG, the court did exactly the opposite, upholding EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under these programs in certain circumstances.

And EPA ignored American Electric Power v. Connecticut, which held that the Clean Air Act “authorize[s] EPA to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions,” which are the most prevalent vehicle greenhouse gas emissions, under a range of Clean Air Act programs. This ruling is squarely at odds with EPA’s central claim in its new proposal.

As to the science, EPA claimed that “reducing GHG emissions from such vehicles to zero would not measurably impact GHG concentrations in the atmosphere or the rate of global climate change.” The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gases in the U.S., and only China emits more greenhouse gases than the U.S. If zeroing out the emissions of one of the largest sources of climate pollution makes no difference, then nothing that any country could do would likely matter. EPA is essentially saying that we are doomed to the adverse consequences of climate change.

EPA also called into question the well-established scientific consensus on the harmful effects of climate change, claiming, for example, that the 2009 endangerment finding “was unduly pessimistic in attributing health risks from heat waves to increases in global temperature.” On this point, it relied heavily on a report by five self-proclaimed “dissenters” from the scientific consensus who were handpicked by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.

EPA paid lip service to scientific “transparency and reliability.” But in its repeated invocation of the contrarian report, it violated the most basic scientific norms. The authors were not independent experts picked through a public process, and their report has not yet been subject to public comment or independent peer review. In contrast, EPA’s prior work on climate change, most recently its 2023 report on the adverse impacts of greenhouse gases (which the agency now ignored altogether), complied with the scientific gold standard in terms of the selection of the experts and the vetting of the report.

EPA fares no better on economics than it did on law and science. In its analysis, EPA cast aside the two major classes of benefits for the vehicle rules: greenhouse gas emissions reductions and savings in gasoline costs. The agency ignored the benefits of greenhouse gas reductions altogether, pretending they don’t exist. On fuel savings, EPA dismissed, with little explanation, the “energy efficiency paradox,” which establishes that, for myopia and other reasons, consumers undervalue the energy savings that will accrue to them over time from purchasing more efficient cars or appliances. EPA’s analysis merely shows—tautologically—that if one ignores the benefits of regulation, regulation has only costs.

In its cynical attempt to avoid addressing climate change, EPA is wrong on law, science, and economics. Its cruel, head-in-the-sand, misguided efforts are nothing but an embarrassment.",https://compote.slate.com/images/97f67c88-ad8c-469b-97ae-350154e095af.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,N,,2025-08-01 15:03:43.253893

The 300-foot barge, flagged and crewed in the US, is being built in Louisiana and tested in the Gulf of America/Mexico. Designed to Nexans specifications, the unit will be operated by American mariners under Crowley management.

The barge will be equipped with a 3,500-tonne cable carousel, with the option to upgrade to 7,000 tonnes via a dual-carousel setup. It features vertical injectors, a dynamic positioning system, and a multiple-anchor positioning system, all intended to enable accurate cable installation in coastal and nearshore environments.

“This barge will support our existing fleet of cable laying vessels, the Nexans CLV Aurora, Nexans C/S Skagerrak and Nexans CLV Electra, and we are pleased to be working with Crowley on developing the capability to lay nearshore subsea cable in the U.S.,” said Pascal Radue, Executive Vice President of Nexans’ PWR-Transmission Business Group.

Initially targeted to support cable burial for Equinor’s Empire Wind project offshore New York, the vessel is being built for flexibility. It will be capable of laying or repairing cables using burial tools such as a vertical injector, a jet sled, or a jetting remotely operated vehicle (ROV), and is intended to serve telecoms and other heavy industry subsea needs beyond offshore wind.

“The cable lay barge will provide a productive supply chain solution for offshore energy, telecommunications and other sectors,” said Graham Tyson, Vice President of Operations, Crowley Wind Services.

“Coupled with our U.S. maritime fleet and mariners providing feedering services and other logistics and project management capabilities, we could not be better equipped to serve the needs of industries seeking subsea cable solutions.”

The project is also backed by maritime labor unions, with the vessel expected to contribute to the US mariner employment.

“AMO is proud to be the leading source for United States Coast Guard licensed officers in the wind farm space. Our long-lasting partnership with Crowley, and our new relationship with Nexans, will help to provide clean, affordable and sustainable energy to millions of Americans and will open the door to future offshore projects,” said American Maritime Officers National President, Willie Barrere.

“The SIU welcomes this exciting opportunity and looks forward to providing dedicated, well-trained mariners to help ensure the new vessel’s success,” said Seafarers International Union President David Heindel. “SIU members have sailed aboard cable-laying vessels for decades, so we are more than up to the task. This is a worthwhile project that will boost American shipboard manpower while reinforcing the great importance of the Jones Act, which has protected United States national, economic and homeland security for more than a century.”

In March, Nexans secured a major framework agreement, valued at above EUR 1 billion, with Réseau de Transport d’Electricité (RTE) for the design, manufacturing, and supply of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) cables for offshore wind farms in France.

As an alternative, EPA proposes to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding and resulting motor vehicle standards because the finding analyzed endangerment and contribution in an unreasonable manner.","On Tuesday, EPA proposed to repeal its 2009 Endangerment Finding (Repeal Proposal). That’s a big deal, with expansive implications. The 2009 Endangerment Finding determined six greenhouse gases (GHG) are air pollutants that endanger public health and welfare, and subsequently allowed EPA to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles. EPA’s Repeal Proposal, which relies heavily on recent Supreme Court decisions in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and West Virginia v. EPA, is an early product of the January 2025 Executive Order Unleashing American Energy specifically referencing the finding. It’s also an outgrowth of the February 2025 Executive Order Ensuring Lawful Governance, which directed agencies to review regulations for consistency with the Constitution and the “best reading of the authorizing statute.”

On its face, this proposal is limited to EPA’s findings under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act to regulate mobile sources of pollution. But it’s not so narrow. EPA has referred to and relied on the 2009 Endangerment Finding to regulate other sources of GHGs using its Clean Air Act authority. Repeal of this foundational Finding is like removing a critical block in the game of Jenga®. As EPA moves forward with the reconsideration or repeal of various standards, including methane standards for oil and gas and carbon pollution standards for fossil-fuel fired power plants, those regulations are on increasingly unstable footing without the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

Key Takeaways

EPA’s Repeal Proposal focuses on the auto industry, but signals a broader deregulatory effort. In the past, EPA has pointed to this foundational legal Finding to regulate GHG emissions across multiple sectors, including oil and gas, power plants, and commercial aviation.

Litigation over EPA’s ultimate decision is all but guaranteed. Comments submitted in this rulemaking may build the record for far-reaching decisions.

Staying aware and involved in the rulemaking process is essential to a cohesive long term legal strategy.

Why the Endangerment Finding Is the Critical Block: Sector Impacts and Legal Uncertainty

The proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding represents a dramatic shift in the foundation of U.S. climate policy and regulatory authority. The Finding, issued in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, provided the prerequisite for EPA’s regulation of GHG emissions from motor vehicles under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act.

Over the years, EPA has used the Finding under section 202(a) as a building block for regulations of other sectors under different provisions of the Clean Air Act. For example, EPA relied on the Finding, and its cited science, in the 2015 methane standards for oil and gas, 2016 finding that GHG emissions from aircraft similarly endanger public health and welfare, 2021 (and subsequent) regulations to phasedown and regulate hydrofluorocarbons, and 2024 carbon pollution standards for fossil-fuel fired power plants. The EPA’s recent proposal rejects the essential underpinnings of the 2009 decision. While EPA’s proposal purports to be limited to motor vehicles, its questions and rationale will likely further destabilize a multitude of other regulations too.

What’s in the Proposal

In short, in the Repeal Proposal, EPA is proposing to repeal all GHG emission standards for light-duty, medium-duty, and heavy-duty vehicles and engines. EPA has offered three potential pathways to this result, all of which illuminate the Agency’s overall policy and likely approach to climate regulations still on the books.

As the primary proposal, EPA asserts that section 202(a) doesn’t authorize standards based on global climate change or allow EPA to make an endangerment finding without simultaneously issuing emission standards. Here, EPA cites to Loper Bright, West Virginia, and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, positing that global climate change is a major question that Congress did not authorize EPA to regulate. EPA proposes that the best reading of section 202(a) is that Congress only permits EPA to regulate pollutants that are themselves dangerous in localized concentrations (or that interact with airborne constituents to then become dangerous—like SO2 and acid rain). That GHG emissions have “indirect” impacts means they may not be “air pollution” in EPA’s view.

As an alternative, EPA proposes to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding and resulting motor vehicle standards because the finding analyzed endangerment and contribution in an unreasonable manner. Relying on a draft report issued this month by the Department of Energy’s Climate Working Group, EPA posits that reality has not borne out the temperature increases, heat waves, sea level rise, or extreme weather events prognosticated in the 2009 finding.

Finally, as its third option, EPA proposes that independent of any action on the endangerment finding, the GHG standards for motor vehicles should be repealed because there is no “requisite technology” to reduce GHG emissions to zero from vehicles because it wouldn’t measurably impact GHG concentrations in the atmosphere or rate of global climate change. Essentially that the Clean Air Act’s tools here won’t have a material impact on global emissions.

EPA repeatedly make statements that attempt to limit this proposal to motor vehicles and flags that other regulations for other sectors will be handled in separate regulatory efforts. That said, much of EPA’s rationale here, especially pronouncements regarding global climate policy as a major question, will transfer easily to those efforts.

What Happens Next

The comment period for EPA’s proposal ends on September 21, 2025. Comments received during this period will form the record for EPA’s ultimate decision and any resulting litigation. Entities outside of the auto sector should consider getting involved given the potential ripple effects of the Agency’s reasoning, or at least stay informed.

With the revocation of the California waiver and the repeal of the 2009 Endangerment Finding, EPA has dismantled the state and federal regulation of GHG emissions from cars and light duty trucks. However, fuel economy standards issued by NHTSA remain in place.

We might see enhanced regulatory activity in some states inclined to impose stricter climate regulations on stationary sources within their jurisdiction.

EPA signaled in this proposal that it will handle GHG standards in other sectors in separate rulemakings. However, it is clear that this proposal is a precursor to additional deregulatory action.",https://www.womblebonddickinson.com/sites/default/files/2024-10/Cars_Auto_Dealership_iStock_000000750486_LargeRET_0.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 17:01:46.368211

Americans are used to whiplash in their climate policy. The US has been in and out and in and out again of the key Paris climate agreement over the past four presidencies.

But in his second administration, President Donald Trump is not just approaching climate science with skepticism. Instead, his administration is moving to destroy the methods by which his or any future administration can respond to climate change.

These moves, which are sure to be challenged in court, extend far beyond Trump’s well-documented antipathy toward solar and wind energy and his pledges to drill ever more oil even though the US is already the world’s largest oil producer.

His Environmental Protection Agency announced plans this week to declare that greenhouse gas emissions do not endanger humans, a move meant to pull the rug out from under nearly all environmental regulation related to the climate.

But that’s just one data point. There are many others:

► Instead of continuing a push away from coal, the Trump administration wants to do a U-turn; Trump has signed executive orders intended to boost the coal industry and has ordered the EPA to end federal limits on coal- and gas-fired power-plant pollution that’s been tied to climate change.

► Tax credits for electric vehicles persisted during Trump’s first term before they were expanded during Joe Biden’s presidency. Now, Republicans are abruptly ending them next month.

► The administration is also ending Biden-era US government incentives to bring renewable energy projects online, a move that actually appears to be driving up the cost of electricity.

► Republicans in Congress and Trump enacted legislation to strip California of its authority to ban the sale of new gas-powered vehicles beginning in 2035.

► Trump is also expected to overturn national tailpipe standards enacted under Biden’s EPA and is also to challenge California’s long-held power to regulate tailpipe emissions.

► The authors of a congressionally mandated report on climate change were all fired; previous versions of the report, the National Climate Assessment, which showed likely effects from climate change across the country, have been hidden from view on government websites.

► Other countries, large and small, will gather in Brazil later this year for a consequential meeting on how the world should respond to climate change. Rather than play a leading role — or any role at all — the US will not attend.

► Cuts to the federal workforce directly targeted offices and employees focused on climate change.

The list goes on.

But it is the Trump administration’s move to undo the “endangerment finding” that could have the most lasting effect. The 2009 declaration that planet-warming pollution from fossil fuels endangers human health is what allows the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Turning the EPA into a deregulatory agency

Now, anticipating the end of that endangerment finding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin bragged of the “largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

That’s the kind of statement that will excite people who don’t see a threat from climate change and strike fear in the hearts of those who do.

Zeldin is a former congressman with little background in environmental policy but a demonstrated loyalty to Trump. He has described his mandate at EPA less in terms of protecting the environment than in terms of unleashing businesses from regulation.

The government’s new climate report was written by skeptics

The Trump administration is justifying its move to gut the endangerment finding based on a report it commissioned from five climate skeptics.

After a public comment period, the Trump administration can move to undo the endangerment finding in the fall. It would essentially close off the Clean Air Act as a vehicle to combat climate change.

Energy secretary has a unique take

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who made millions in the fracking industry, commissioned the report. In a preface, he did not deny that climate change exists.

“Climate change is real, and it deserves attention,” he wrote. “But it is not the greatest threat facing humanity. That distinction belongs to global energy poverty.”

In other words, Wright sees more damage to humans from cutting back on carbon emissions.

That is a minority view in the scientific community, which has a much, much larger body of peer reviewed studies that raise the alarm about climate change. Most notably, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues peer-reviewed reports with hundreds of authors from around world. The Trump administration has barred US government scientists from taking part in the next installment, due out in 2029.

You don’t need a government report to see the effects of climate change

Katie Dykes, the commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, told me that you no longer need a government report to see the effects of changing climate.

“We see that the impacts of climate change have become part of everyday lives of our residents and our communities,” Dykes said. “In ways that scientists were predicting years ago, we’re seeing those impacts are happening faster and they’re more severe than we had anticipated.”

By moving to declare that greenhouse gas emissions don’t endanger humans, the Trump administration is shifting the burden for dealing with climate change.

“This effort to undo this long-standing framework is really abandoning our communities and our residents to shoulder these costs and these impacts of climate change,” Dykes said.

Those include health risks like respiratory illness, safety risks from extreme weather events, and impacts on infrastructure, housing and neighborhoods.

“We’ve seen these impacts already in our state in terms of extreme heat and drought, wildfires and flooding,” Dykes said.

“Seeing EPA walk away from decades of their core mission of protecting public health, reducing pollution and setting common sense standards at a national level is really concerning,” she added.

A legal document, not a scientific one

The Trump administration’s report should not be viewed as a scientific document, according to Andrew Dessler, director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M University.

“Their goal is not to weigh the evidence fairly but to build the strongest possible case for CO2’s innocence,” he told my colleague Ella Nilsen. “This is a fundamental departure from the norms of science.”

Nilsen reached out to numerous scientists after the report’s release.

Phil Duffy, the chief scientist at Spark Climate Solutions, a nonprofit focused on climate change, told her tens of thousands of Americans die every year as a result of particulate pollution, but the numbers have declined as the US has reduced its dependence on coal.

But many of those investments are now being cut or scaled back in the federal tax and spending cut megabill Republicans passed in July.

Researchers at Portland State University and the nonprofit Seattle-based Northwest Environmental Justice Center analyzed federal spending patterns between 2010 and 2024 on 468 energy, environment and infrastructure programs across the country. Overall, federal agencies sent about $2.24 trillion to state and local governments, tribes and private companies, nonprofits, individuals and higher education institutions across the country for energy and environmental infrastructure programs from 2010 to 2024.

The share of that money benefiting rural counties and economically distressed counties nationwide more than tripled in the last decade, the researchers found, and accelerated dramatically after former President Joe Biden issued an executive order creating the Justice40 Initiative to direct 40% of new federal climate and clean energy spending to underserved communities.

Historic investments in clean energy, infrastructure and environmental protection projects followed under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that passed in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022.

“I would say that if you look at the change of proportional investment in rural communities and tribes over time, in particular the last couple years, what the federal programs were doing was working,” said Bobby Cochran, a senior project manager at Portland State University’s Hatfield School of Government and one of the co-authors of the report.

But in March, President Donald Trump terminated the Justice40 Initiative. And Lee Zeldin, head of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, cancelled more than a billion worth of grants related to environmental justice.

Of the more than 400 federal grant programs that researchers analyzed, Republicans cut or scaled back 30 of them that provided about half of all federal energy and environment money to Oregon in 2024.

Investments in rural Oregon, tribes

In Oregon, investments in rural counties and economically distressed counties doubled between 2010 and 2024, Cochran and his team found. Tribes in Oregon received 20 times the amount in 2024 that they received in 2010.

Funding for Oregon’s nine federally recognized tribes increased from about $14.45 million in 2010 to more than $324 million by 2024.

Of the more than $30 billion from the federal government that flowed to Oregon energy and environment programs during between 2010 and 2024, about 20% — more than $6 billion — went to rural or economically distressed counties in Oregon.

Sherman, Gilliam, Wallowa, Benton and Baker counties received the most per capita federal energy and environmental protection funding through the Biden-era energy and investment programs.

Researchers also looked at how money flowed in each of the state’s congressional districts.

Northwest Oregon’s 1st Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat, received the most federal funding for energy environment projects in 2024. Her district got nearly $700 million.

The 2nd Congressional District, repped by the state’s lone Republican congressman, Cliff Bentz, received the second highest proportion of federal funding for energy and environmental protection projects — more than $470 million. Bentz voted against the Inflation Reduction and Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs acts, and voted to pass the recent Republican tax bill that rolls back funding spurred by those acts.

Nationally, slightly more money went to Democratic-led Congressional districts than Republican-led ones, but it was mostly even over the 10 years analyzed, Cochran said.

In 2024, about 57% of energy and environmental infrastructure investment was distributed to Democrat-held districts and 43% to Republican-held districts.

“It doesn’t appear that there’s anything political going on,” he said.

Among the cuts

Among the EPA grants cut by Zeldin was the one providing the funding for Cochran and his collaborators’ work, which also includes providing technical assistance to people, groups and governments applying for federal energy, infrastructure and environment grants in Oregon.

The five-year grant they received in 2023 was terminated by the EPA in May, and with it, $8 million in funding. The reason? The work was “inconsistent with federal administration priorities,” Cochran said.

He said in one year, they had provided technical assistance statewide that helped bring in about $50 million to groups and local governments.

The study of where federal money is and has flowed, he said, was supposed to help them understand where people are succeeding in getting more federal dollars, and where they could use help from people like him.

Investment Implications Toyota's strategy is not without risks—solid-state battery delays or regulatory changes could slow its EV rollout.","In the evolving automotive sector, Toyota's electrification strategy stands out as a masterclass in balancing innovation, caution, and resilience. While competitors like Tesla and BYD race to dominate the all-electric vehicle (EV) market, Toyota is leveraging its hybrid dominance, strategic R&D investments, and geographic diversification to position itself as a long-term winner—especially in the face of U.S. trade pressures. For investors seeking a stable, undervalued player in the EV transition, Toyota offers a compelling case.

A Hybrid-First Strategy: Funding the Future

Toyota's 2025 electrification plan is anchored by its continued leadership in hybrid vehicles, which accounted for 40% of global sales in 2024. This stable revenue stream provides critical funding for its EV ambitions, including the development of 70 electrified models (15 BEVs) by 2025. By prioritizing hybrids, Toyota avoids the financial risks of an abrupt shift to pure EVs, ensuring cash flow while investing in next-generation technologies. This approach contrasts sharply with Tesla and BYD, which have bet heavily on BEVs and are more exposed to volatile battery costs and supply chain disruptions.

The company's $13.6 billion investment in solid-state batteries—a technology promising 750-mile range and 10-minute charging times by 2027–2028—positions Toyota to redefine the EV market if successful. Unlike lithium-ion rivals, solid-state batteries offer superior safety, longevity, and energy density, potentially giving Toyota a first-mover advantage in the next phase of electrification.

Navigating U.S. Trade Pressures: Localization as a Shield

The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and rising tariffs on Chinese EV components have created a volatile environment for automakers. Toyota's response? Strategic localization. A $14 billion battery plant in North Carolina is set to produce hybrid and EV components, aligning with IRA incentives for domestic manufacturing. This move not only reduces reliance on Chinese supply chains but also insulates Toyota from potential tariffs, which could add $8,000–$20,000 per BEV.

In contrast, Tesla's Q1 2025 net profit fell 71% year-over-year due to aggressive price cuts and production bottlenecks, while BYD's dependence on Chinese mineral supplies leaves it vulnerable to U.S. trade restrictions. Toyota's hybrid models, with lower battery intensity, are less affected by these costs, giving it a competitive edge in a market where price sensitivity is rising.

Geographic Diversification: Expanding Beyond Risk

Toyota's geographic strategy further enhances its resilience. A new Shanghai-based Lexus EV subsidiary, targeting 2027 production, taps into China's booming EV market, while rugged models like the Hilux EV cater to oil-rich emerging markets. This diversification bypasses import tariffs and leverages regional demand, creating a buffer against geopolitical shifts.

Meanwhile, competitors like BYD face headwinds as U.S. tariffs threaten their expansion into Europe and Latin America. Toyota's localized production in Thailand and Argentina also positions it to capitalize on demand in Southeast Asia and South America, where EV adoption is accelerating.

Financial Strength: A Low P/E and Strong Margins

Toyota's financials underscore its appeal. In Q2 2025, electrified vehicles accounted for 48.1% of sales, with a 11.4% pretax profit margin and $48 billion in revenue. Its P/E ratio of 6.97 is significantly lower than industry peers, suggesting it is undervalued relative to its potential. This financial stability provides room for error in its EV transition, whereas Tesla's high P/E (25.3) and BYD's dependence on Chinese subsidies make them riskier long-term bets.

Strategic Partnerships and Alternative Mobility

Beyond EVs, Toyota is investing in hydrogen fuel cells through its Mirai model and a new Hydrogen Factory in Japan, aiming for 50% cost reductions by 2030. A $1 billion stake in Joby Aviation also signals a broader vision for mobility, diversifying its revenue streams. These initiatives complement its EV strategy, offering multiple pathways to carbon neutrality and insulating it from regulatory shifts.

Investment Implications

Toyota's strategy is not without risks—solid-state battery delays or regulatory changes could slow its EV rollout. However, its hybrid-first approach, localized production, and financial discipline create a robust foundation. For investors, Toyota represents a safer, more resilient play in the EV transition compared to high-growth but volatile peers.

Conclusion: A Long-Term Winner in a Fragmented Market

As the automotive sector grapples with trade pressures, supply chain volatility, and regulatory uncertainty, Toyota's balanced approach—combining hybrid dominance, strategic R&D, and geographic diversification—positions it as a long-term leader. With a low P/E, strong cash flow, and a roadmap to solid-state innovation, Toyota offers investors a compelling mix of stability and growth potential.

The company is partnering with Redwood Materials to supply battery modules for energy storage systems, particularly targeting the growing power needs of AI data centers.

These energy storage systems utilize both new and used EV batteries to power microgrids, offering a cleaner energy source for AI infrastructure.

While the long-term viability of repurposed batteries for large-scale energy storage is uncertain, this strategy allows GM to maximize its battery production capacity and explore new revenue streams.

General Motors' electric vehicle sales may be on the rise, but consumer demand for battery-powered vehicles is far from what the company anticipated.So GM is flipping the switch to target a new kind of customer:

Artificial intelligence firms, whose hunger for juice fits nicely with what the automaker has to provide.

After pouring billions into electric vehicle battery development, GM is finding new ways to maximize the technology. Enter battery energy storage systems, another profit center for battery production — and, thanks to the Detroit automaker's recently expanded partnership with Redwood Materials, a way to sell new and used batteries profitably today.

Across its two Ultium Cell facilities — in Springhill, Tennessee, and Warren, Ohio — GM could produce enough battery cells for between 600,000 and 800,000 electric vehicles annually. Additional capacity from a joint venture with Samsung planned for Indiana could soon bring the company close to producing 1 million electric vehicles in the United States per year, according to Sam Abuelsamid, vice president of market research at Telemetry.

“The chance of GM selling that number of EVs in the next couple of years? Very small. Given that, the last thing you want to do is have underutilized capacity,” Abuelsamid said. “That’s why they’re looking for alternatives.”

In the first six months of 2025, GM has sold 78,000 electric vehicles. Adding in the vehicles it produces for Honda Motor Co., the electric Acura ZDX and Honda Prologue, GM was responsible for producing 104,819 electric vehicles that sold through June.

Demand for EVs is growing but still not growing enough, and that has prompted GM's battery partner, LG Energy Solution, to add battery energy storage system production to its plant in Holland, Michigan, he added.

As for who needs the power that can be stored in GM-made batteries, artificial intelligence firms are shaping up to be the largest contender.

“Our expertise in leading cell chemistries and formats is also creating new business opportunities,” GM CEO Mary Barra told investors July 22 during the company’s second-quarter earnings call. “We're finalizing an agreement with Redwood to supply battery modules to Redwood Energy, their new energy storage business, which has been formed to meet surging power demand for AI data centers and other applications.”

The power of power

The Detroit automaker said July 21 that it had signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding” to deploy new and used electric vehicle batteries for storage systems that power a Nevada microgrid, which, in turn, powers a modular data center for AI infrastructure company Crusoe. Barra did not clarify during the investor call how much GM estimates the new business opportunity will generate.

But demand for power is on the rise, particularly as technology companies continue efforts to grow artificial intelligence systems for commercial use, said Mosharaf Chowdhury, associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the University of Michigan. Along with his students, Chowdhury has been working on projects that measure and reduce the energy demands of artificial intelligence since 2020.

“The problem everybody is facing is that the amount of power you need, we don’t necessarily have that much power available. Money is not really a problem, they can get everything, they just don’t have enough power,” Chowdhury said. “That’s why power — and people who can provide power — is a big business.”

What's a microgrid, anyway?

In order to power artificial intelligence more economically, GM’s latest partnership with Redwood uses batteries to charge what it calls a microgrid, a localized energy production and distribution network separate from a main electric grid.

The draw of microgrids is that they can operate “self-sufficiently” through providing stored power during outages, according to Amanda Smith, senior scientist at Project Drawdown. The microgrid in Nevada where GM batteries are currently in use, for example, can deliver 12 megawatts of power at any instant, and the total capacity of the site is 63-megawatt hours, the company said.

Microgrids are on the rise for that reason and can serve multiple purposes — but they cannot replace the regulated energy grid upon which the United States currently relies. The key is what generated the electricity, and renewables are preferable to gas for environmental reasons, she said.

“The idea is not to get all of our electricity consumption on to all of their little individual microgrids,” Smith said. “There are cases where microgrids make a lot of sense, and where people want to demonstrate they can match their supply and demand on a small scale. But often they’re relying on fossil fuels for that match.”

Clean(er) energy from batteries

Artificial intelligence data centers cropping up across the country come at what environmentalists claim is a significant toll on the surrounding areas.

That GM would venture into energy storage systems through production of new batteries as well as repurposing those coming out of its electric vehicles is positive news for the planet, climate experts say. If the proliferation of AI data centers is inevitable, at least they can be powered by cleaner energy.

Elon Musk’s xAI’s Colossus supercomputer in Tennessee has drawn questions about air pollution, water usage and the equity of government incentives for the project. Musk, the CEO of the largest electric vehicle company in the world by sales in Tesla, uses gas turbines to power the data center.

The world’s richest man built what he calls the world’s biggest supercomputer in Boxtown, a South Memphis neighborhood that is 99% Black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly half of Boxtown’s 2,865 residents have annual household incomes below $25,000 a year, yet many are homeowners.

Tesla's reliance on gasoline may soon change, however.

LG Energy Solution said July 30 that it had signed a $4.3 billion contract to supply LFP batteries over three years globally, without identifying the customer or saying whether they would be used in vehicles or energy storage systems. However, Reuters reported later that day that Tesla Inc. was the company in question and plans to receive batteries for energy storage systems that LG produces in Michigan. The report cited a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity because the details were not public.

Rising power demand

Benchmark currently estimates the global demand for battery energy storage systems to be 297 GWh, with 55 GWh in the U.S. in 2025. To put that in perspective, even 1 gigawatt is enough to power 2,000 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 engines generating 1.34 million horsepower.

Any repurposed batteries coming out of the GM EVs will have a shorter lifespan than those freshly produced for the purpose of energy storage systems, said Evan Hartley, research manager at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence in London.

“We can see the reason why any company with battery technology now would target the energy storage market,” Hartley said, but added that AI companies and other users of these systems may prefer battery modules designed specifically for long-term storage, not a hodgepodge of new and used batteries with less consistent energy output.

Roughly 80% of all the EVs were built in the last five years, Abuelsamid said, and could still operate with those original batteries for the next five to 10 years.

“When people talk about how EVs aren't taking off — we're just getting started on this,” Abuelsamid said. “You’re probably not going to have a huge quantity of second-life batteries until around 2030.”

Hartley, who focuses on cathode materials and battery cell manufacturing and pricing, said the space has changed drastically in the last three years, particularly with the Detroit Three automakers inking high-profile partnerships in order to better compete with China.

Which is why tariffs on Chinese imports will only strengthen relationships like the one between GM and Redwood, he added.

“If you’re selling cells that are as cheap if not cheaper (than those from China) that you don’t need, that you’ve already made, to a market where there is a serious local deficit — sure, why not,” he said. “Even if those batteries aren't as tailored to demand as they could be.”

Meanwhile, when an electric vehicle is no longer considered valuable, that doesn't mean that it's entirely depleted of energy storage potential. Depending on the manufacturer, a battery is considered end-of-life in an electric vehicle, when around 70 kilowatt hours remain. In 2025, the new electric vehicle is equipped with a battery that has an average of 93 kilowatts of charge.

“The battery is still useful but it’s not going to give what someone will want in terms of reliability and acceleration to power a car,” Smith said. “They also have a lot of the same materials. To let all those valuable minerals go to waste would be a huge waste for the planet.”

The project is a rare bright spot for the U.S. offshore wind industry, which has been battered by high construction costs and attacks from Trump. Some offshore wind developers have shelved plans for new projects in the face of the president’s decisions to halt new offshore wind leases, temporarily pause construction of a New York project and revoke an EPA permit for a third development planned off New Jersey.

But Dominion has consistently argued that the Virginia project is crucial to its strategy to meet growing electricity demand in the state, which is at the heart of the country’s data center boom. With a total capacity of 2,600 megawatts, the offshore wind facility is the largest of five projects under construction in the United States. Dominion estimates it will be capable of powering 660,000 homes. The utility is also pursuing plans for a 1,000-MW gas plant.

Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on steel and other imports has increased the project’s cost, which Dominion said could rise to $10.9 billion in September, compared with its initial estimate of $10.8 billion. The utility said its total budget, after accounting for Trump’s tariffs, is expected to be $11.3 billion when the project is completed next year.

The pending arrival of the installation vessel, named the Charybdis, which was built in Brownsville, Texas, marks a major milestone for Dominion and the U.S. offshore wind industry more broadly.

Developers have struggled to book time with a limited number of vessels, many of which fly European flags. To comply with the Jones Act, a law that bars foreign vessels from traveling between U.S. ports, developers have had to employ a complicated barge system, where turbine components are staged onshore and floated on barges out to installation vessels. That will not be necessary with the Charybdis, which will be able to pick up turbine components from the Portsmouth Marine Terminal in Virginia, where the project is being staged, and transport them to the project area, where it will install them.

“We’re highly confident in the schedule” for completing the project, Blue told investors. “What really gives us confidence is the de-risking associated with this kind of installation.”

Something remarkable happened between 2022 and 2023 in the global energy workforce. Jobs in renewable energy jumped from 13.7 million to 16.2 million—an 18% year-over-year increase that outpaced most other sectors 1. This growth trajectory shows little sign of slowing, with projections indicating that renewable energy positions could exceed 30 million worldwide by 2030 1.

APAC sits squarely at the centre of this employment surge. The region has contributed approximately 60% of new renewable energy capacity in recent years 2, creating a diverse landscape of career opportunities that extends far beyond traditional engineering roles. Entry-level positions are becoming more accessible, while specialized fields like electric vehicles have witnessed explosive 26.2% growth, generating nearly 22,000 new opportunities3. Remote monitoring roles, offshore wind positions, and renewable finance jobs are expanding as the sector matures and diversifies.

The numbers tell only part of the story. Behind this growth lies substantial financial commitment—the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act alone has triggered more than $300 billion in clean energy projects and incentives 1. Nearly 1,500 companies across APAC have committed to the Science-Based Target Initiative, ranking the region second only to Europe in corporate climate action 2.

Yet challenges persist beneath this optimistic surface. The International Energy Agency estimates that at least 3,000 gigawatts of renewable power projects currently wait in grid connection queues 4. More than 80 million kilometres of grid infrastructure need to be added or upgraded by 2040 4. These bottlenecks create both obstacles and opportunities for the skilled professionals who can address them.

TGRC operates at the intersection of this supply and demand challenge. With strategic offices in Beijing and Singapore, the company has developed specialized expertise in connecting organizations with renewable energy professionals across the APAC region. This article explores the hidden growth areas and emerging job markets that are reshaping career opportunities throughout Asia Pacific—from the engineers designing tomorrow's smart grids to the finance specialists structuring billion-dollar clean energy deals.

Three Technologies Reshaping the Regional Job Market

The renewable energy landscape across APAC has evolved well beyond the familiar territories of solar panels and wind turbines. TGRC's recruitment specialists, working from their Beijing and Singapore offices, have identified three distinct technology areas that are generating substantial employment opportunities—often in roles that didn't exist five years ago.

Smart Grids and Storage: Southeast Asia's Technical Frontier

Southeast Asia faces a unique challenge that mirrors the early days of internet infrastructure: how do you build a flexible, intelligent energy network from the ground up? The answer lies in smart grid technologies and energy storage systems that require an entirely new category of technical specialists.

Singapore's job market data reveals the scale of this shift. Positions such as Energy Storage Specialist, Grid Connection Technical Expert, and SCADA and Smart Grid Software Developers now rank among the fastest-growing technical roles 5. These aren't simply rebranded traditional jobs—they require expertise in battery technology, grid digitization, and sophisticated monitoring systems that can balance renewable supply with fluctuating demand across increasingly complex distribution networks.

The integration of AI into energy management has spawned even more specialized positions: Engineer - Energy Management Systems Infrastructure, Senior Engineer (System Stability & Planning), and Technical Delivery Manager (Renewable Delivery) 5. Remote monitoring roles continue expanding as distributed energy systems require round-the-clock oversight. For professionals willing to work across time zones, these positions offer both competitive compensation and the opportunity to manage multiple projects simultaneously.

Green Hydrogen: From Concept to Career Catalyst

Green hydrogen represents perhaps the most intriguing employment story in APAC renewables. Malaysia's Hydrogen Economy and Technology Roadmap projects that their hydrogen economy could create more than 200,000 potential job opportunities while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 15% 6. Vietnam anticipates its renewable-powered hydrogen ecosystem will generate 40,000-50,000 jobs and contribute between CNY 289.74-45 billion to annual GDP 6.

Australia has set particularly ambitious targets, with projections pointing to CNY 362.17 billion in annual revenue and thousands of new engineering jobs across production, storage, and logistics by 2050 7. These aren't merely aspirational figures—they reflect the cross-sectoral nature of hydrogen careers spanning electrochemical engineering, safety systems, and transportation infrastructure.

Singapore's approach focuses on workforce development, aiming to ""equip Singaporeans with the skills and knowledge needed to thrive in a hydrogen economy"" 6. This emphasis on skills development underscores a critical point: hydrogen jobs require specialized knowledge that traditional oil and gas or renewable energy professionals may lack.

Bioenergy: The Overlooked Employment Engine

Whilst green hydrogen captures headlines, bioenergy projects across Indonesia and Vietnam are quietly creating substantial employment opportunities. According to Koaksi research, renewable energy development in Indonesia alone could generate direct employment for approximately 432,000 engineers by 2030 and 1.12 million engineers by 2050 8.

The waste-to-energy sector has become particularly active, with engineering firms recruiting Senior/Lead Consultants in Waste-to-Energy and Bioenergy 9. These roles typically involve design review, technical due diligence, feasibility studies, and project management 9—skills that translate well from other engineering disciplines.

Vietnam offers the most promising regional outlook, accounting for 56% of ASEAN's projected renewable employment growth, followed by Indonesia (10%), Myanmar (11%), and the Philippines (9%) 10. Biofuels specifically support millions of agricultural supply chain jobs globally, with concentrated growth throughout Indonesia 11.

TGRC's experience suggests that entry-level bioenergy positions often provide exceptional career advancement pathways. These projects require diverse skillsets from feedstock logistics to lifecycle analysis and sustainability auditing—creating natural progression routes for professionals who master multiple aspects of the value chain.

Where the Jobs Are: APAC's Renewable Energy Hotspots

Geography matters in renewable energy, and 2025 reveals distinct patterns across APAC where talent demand is concentrating. TGRC's recruitment specialists, positioned strategically in Beijing and Singapore, observe how different locations are becoming magnets for specific renewable technologies and the professionals who build them.

Taiwan and South Korea: Offshore Wind's New Frontier

Taiwan has claimed its position as APAC's second-largest offshore wind market after China, adding 692 MW of new offshore capacity in 2023 12. The Taiwan Strait's favourable 180-kilometer expanse offers ideal conditions as onshore sites reach capacity limits. This geographic advantage has created urgent demand for specialists in wind turbine technology, marine engineering, and offshore construction.

South Korea presents an even more ambitious picture. The country targets 14.3 GW by 2030, expanding to 40.7 GW by 2038 12. These numbers translate to substantial employment potential—over 770,000 job opportunities spanning high-skilled engineering to mid-level logistics and maintenance roles 13. The government has committed 73 trillion won (approximately CNY 44.18 billion) through 2025 for decarbonization 12. Coastal cities like Incheon, Gunsan, and Mokpo stand to benefit most from this economic transformation 14.

India's Solar Manufacturing Surge

India's solar manufacturing sector tells a story of rapid expansion, though China's dominance remains unchallenged. Last year, India produced approximately 80 gigawatts of solar modules while China manufactured more than ten times that amount 15. However, India's production capacity more than doubled between 2020 and 2023 16, driven by government incentives and export opportunities.

Tamil Nadu has emerged as the epicentre of this growth, attracting major players including First Solar, Vikram Solar, and Tata Power 15. The export trajectory is particularly striking—module exports grew 23-fold between 2022 and 202416, with more than half destined for American markets 15. Industry projections suggest India could become the world's second-largest solar PV manufacturer by 2026, reaching 110 GW production capacity 16.

Australia and New Zealand: The Hydrogen-Hydro Nexus

Australia and New Zealand are experiencing parallel developments in hydropower and hydrogen sectors. High-profile pumped storage projects in Australia and dam developments in New Zealand are creating demand for engineers across multiple disciplines: civil, structural, geotechnical, mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical 17.

The hydrogen economy shows particular momentum, with 131 projects in advanced planning or construction stages representing 3.57 million tons per year of renewable or low-carbon hydrogen 18. Australia's Hydrogen Headstart program (CNY 28.97 billion) signals continued government support, with new tender rounds expected 18. The Whyalla Hydrogen Power Plant exemplifies this trend—construction begins in early 2025 for a project combining a 250-MW electrolyser with a 200-MW hydrogen-fuelled power plant 18.

TGRC's regional presence enables access to this distributed talent pool, connecting organizations with professionals from entry-level positions to highly specialized roles requiring advanced technical certifications.

The Specialists: Roles That Didn't Exist Five Years Ago

The renewable energy sector's rapid maturation has spawned entirely new categories of professionals. TGRC recruiters in Beijing and Singapore increasingly field requests for specialists who bridge multiple disciplines—professionals whose job descriptions would have seemed like science fiction a decade ago.

Virtual Eyes on Distant Assets

Project monitoring has gone remote in ways that would surprise even the most forward-thinking energy executives from 2019. Companies now actively seek specialists to oversee dispersed energy assets from centralized command centres, with job boards currently listing over 43 remote project management opportunities across APAC's solar, wind, and storage sectors 19. These positions command serious compensation—salaries ranging from CNY 557.74k to CNY 1303.82k reflect the premium placed on professionals who can manage multiple projects simultaneously while ensuring optimal performance of distributed systems 20.

The Money Follows the Mission

Climate Finance Specialists occupy a unique intersection between sustainability ambition and investment reality. These professionals identify opportunities across renewable energy, efficiency retrofits, and carbon markets while working with financial institutions to mobilize capital 21. The finance sector's embrace of ESG principles has created distinct career tracks for analysts, sustainable finance specialists, and impact investment advisors 22. Financial Modelers working in carbon markets tackle complex commercial structuring challenges, building robust models that evaluate investment viability and project multi-decade cash flows 23.

Grid Intelligence Architects

Smart Grid Engineers design systems that weave advanced sensors, automation, and analytics into traditional power infrastructure 24. Their SCADA counterparts develop central systems for networked infrastructure, configure control systems, and implement grid services 25. The technical demands are considerable: experience with industrial communication protocols (OPC DA, XML, UA, IEC 104, Modbus), MS SQL Server administration, and Windows Server management represent baseline requirements 25. Add knowledge of protective relays, automation systems, and network troubleshooting, and the skill set becomes highly specialized 26.

The Compliance Translators

ESG Consultants serve as interpreters between regulatory frameworks and business operations, helping organizations navigate risk assessment and strategy development within frameworks like CSRD, SFDR, and TCFD 27. Circular Economy specialists focus on practical applications—renewable infrastructure maintenance, energy efficiency projects, sustainable bioenergy development, and battery recycling programs 28. Academic research supports this trend: exponential growth in Circular Economy and Renewable Energy research publications since 2018 directly translates into industry demand for professionals who can implement theoretical insights in real-world applications29.

TGRC's experience suggests these specialized roles represent just the visible portion of a much larger shift toward interdisciplinary expertise in APAC's evolving energy landscape.

The Credentials Arms Race: Skills That Matter in APAC's New Energy Economy

The renewable energy sector across APAC has entered what might be called a credentials arms race. TGRC recruiters in Beijing and Singapore report a fundamental shift—employers now prioritize candidates with specific micro-credentials over those armed with generalized qualifications. This trend reflects the sector's rapid technical evolution and the urgent need for specialized expertise.

Hydrogen Safety: The New Engineering Frontier

Engineers Australia recently launched hydrogen energy micro-credentials to address what they describe as ""a severe talent shortage in hydrogen engineering"" that directly impacts ""the path to net zero"" 30. The program includes four specialized tracks: ""Handling Hydrogen for Engineers,"" ""Hydrogen Fuel Cell Operation, Safety and Maintenance,"" ""Hydrogen Electrolysers,"" and ""Hydrogen in the Built Environment"" 30. These credentials aim to bridge critical knowledge gaps across energy, transport, planning, water, and government sectors by June 2025 30.

If you're struggling to visualize why these matters, consider the complexity of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Unlike conventional fuels, hydrogen requires specialized handling protocols, safety systems, and maintenance procedures that differ significantly from traditional energy infrastructure. The micro-credential approach allows professionals to develop targeted expertise without pursuing lengthy degree programs.

Field Safety: Where Compliance Meets Reality

Field technicians face a different challenge—comprehensive safety certifications that focus on hazard recognition and risk mitigation. The Specialist Certification in Safety in Renewable Energy Sector equips professionals with ""essential knowledge and skills to ensure safety in the dynamic renewable energy industry"" 31. This certification covers ""risk assessment, emergency response planning, and compliance with industry regulations"" 31. With projections indicating ""over 400,000 jobs by 2030"" in the renewable energy sector 31, properly certified safety professionals have become indispensable for offshore operations.

Data Analytics: The Silent Revolution

TGRC observes that entry-level positions increasingly require basic proficiency in data analytics. Remote monitoring roles typically demand specialized skills in AI applications for grid management. These positions offer excellent pathways for professionals transitioning from other technical fields, provided they obtain relevant certifications.

The data revolution in renewable energy mirrors the broader digitization of industrial systems. Grid optimization, predictive maintenance, and performance monitoring all depend on professionals who can interpret complex datasets and translate insights into operational decisions. Candidates who combine analytical capabilities with industry-specific knowledge consistently rank among the most sought-after professionals in APAC's evolving energy landscape.

The Talent Paradox: Bridging Skills and Geography

Talent acquisition in APAC's renewable sector resembles a complex puzzle where the pieces exist but don't always fit together easily. TGRC recruiters encounter this challenge daily — qualified professionals cluster in major cities while projects often emerge in remote locations where few want to relocate.

The Remote Location Challenge

Rural renewable projects face a persistent dilemma despite offering competitive compensation packages. Most candidates prefer urban centres, creating talent gaps precisely where large-scale installations require expertise. This geographic mismatch particularly affects offshore wind farms and remote solar installations that demand both technical competence and comfort with isolated working conditions.

The challenge extends beyond personal preferences. Remote projects often lack the professional networks, career advancement opportunities, and lifestyle amenities that attract top talent. A skilled grid engineer might command an attractive salary at a remote wind farm, but questions remain about long-term career development and professional connections.

TGRC's Strategic Network Approach

TGRC addresses these challenges through its dual-hub strategy across Beijing and Singapore. This positioning enables the firm to maintain extensive talent networks spanning both established energy corporations and emerging clean technology startups. Their consultants understand that effective recruitment requires more than matching resumes to job descriptions.

The firm's approach recognizes that many qualified professionals remain invisible to conventional recruitment methods. Engineers transitioning from oil and gas, finance specialists with infrastructure experience, or software developers with industrial automation backgrounds often possess transferable skills but lack direct renewable energy credentials. TGRC's consultants identify these hidden candidates and help bridge the knowledge gaps through targeted development programs.

Developing Tomorrow's Clean Energy Workforce

Entry-level talent development represents another dimension of TGRC's strategy. Rather than simply placing candidates, the firm actively creates pathways for professionals entering the renewable sector. This includes connecting candidates with mentorship opportunities, identifying relevant transferable skills from adjacent industries, and providing guidance through certification requirements.

The approach extends beyond initial placement. TGRC maintains ongoing relationships with placed professionals, supporting their advancement from entry-level positions to specialized roles in engineering, project management, or renewable finance. This long-term perspective helps build the sustainable talent pipeline that APAC's expanding renewable sector requires.

The New Energy Workforce Takes Shape

APAC's renewable energy transformation mirrors the industrial shifts that have defined previous generations. Just as the telecommunications boom of the 1990s created entirely new professions, today's clean energy transition is spawning career paths that barely existed five years ago. Battery storage specialists, hydrogen safety engineers, and ESG compliance experts now command premium salaries across markets from Seoul to Singapore.

The geographical spread of opportunities tells its own story. Taiwan's offshore wind sector, South Korea's ambitious 770,000 job pipeline, India's solar manufacturing surge, and Australia's hydrogen export ambitions demonstrate how different nations are carving distinct niches in the global energy economy. Each region plays to its natural advantages while creating specialized employment ecosystems.

What sets this transition apart is the interdisciplinary nature of the roles emerging. Remote monitoring specialists need both technical acumen and data analytics skills. Climate finance experts bridge sustainability knowledge with complex financial modeling. SCADA engineers must understand both legacy grid infrastructure and cutting-edge automation systems. These hybrid professionals command the highest premiums in today's market.

The certification landscape reflects this complexity. Engineers Australia's hydrogen micro-credentials program, safety certifications for field technicians, and AI applications for grid optimization represent just the beginning of a more specialized credentialing system. Professionals who combine these technical certifications with practical experience consistently outperform their peers in compensation and career advancement.

TGRC's position across Beijing and Singapore provides a unique vantage point on these developments. The company's recruitment specialists observe daily how talent flows between established energy giants and emerging clean technology startups. This dual perspective enables identification of professionals who might otherwise remain hidden from conventional search methods.

The infrastructure bottlenecks that currently constrain the sector—those 3,000 gigawatts waiting in grid connection queues, the 80 million kilometres of transmission lines needing upgrades—represent tomorrow's employment opportunities. Every challenge creates demand for specialists who can solve it. The question facing professionals today is not whether opportunities exist, but which specialization will provide the strongest foundation for a career in Asia Pacific's clean energy future.

Food trucks will be a new addition this year as will DTE Energy’s offering of EV test drives. A chunk of EV test drives are already booked, but Amy Rogghe, founder of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance, the nonprofit host of the cruise, said DTE will keep a portion available to book on the day of the cruise. The Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Jeep Wagoneer S, Tesla Model Y and Cadillac Lyriq are the EVs listed on the registration page.

Despite the killing of federal tax incentives and other efforts to gut clean energy in the United States, EV sales have grown through the second half of this year, according to Cox Automotive, and the technological advances aren’t slowing down, although the market is facing challenges. Automakers also continue to promote their EV strategies, as evidenced by announcements like Ford CEO Jim Farley's pledge of an upcoming ""Model T moment"" for the company's EV strategy.

It’s why supporters of the Clean Cruise say it’s an important showcase that can help educate in a setting that lets EV owners share their passion. It’s a way to get beyond politics, they say.

Campbell coal-fired plant online under a federal emergency order cost Consumers $29 million between May and June 2025, according to the utility’s latest quarterly filings.

Consumers Energy had planned to close the power station by May 31 as part of a transition to cleaner energy. But the U.S. Secretary of Energy (DOE) intervened just days earlier, saying the plant must remain open, at least until late August, because of possible electricity shortfalls in the central U.S. Eight utility commissions challenged DOE’s emergency order.

Consumers has continued to make J.H. Campbell available and is seeking cost recovery of the $29 million through FERC and a proposed MISO Tariff modification.

“We do not believe the costs should be borne solely by Consumers Energy customers,” A Consumers Energy spokesperson told The Detroit News.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which manages the flow of electricity in the central U.S., said it should have adequate generating capacity this summer but faces “significant uncertainty” in overall resource adequacy projections.

“This administration is committed to ensuring Americans have access to reliable, affordable and secure energy that isn’t dependent on whether the sun shines or the wind blows,” DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich said at the time of the order.

J.H. Campbell is a three-unit, 1,560 MW coal-fired plant in West Olive, Michigan. Its first unit came online in 1962.

J.H. Campbell is also not the first fossil-fired plant to run past its expected retirement date due to resource adequacy concerns. DOE this week allowed the 400 MW oil-fired Herbert A. Wagner Generating Station in Maryland to continue running at the request of grid operator PJM Interconnection.

H.A. Wagner and Brandon Shores, both owned by Talen Energy, have been allowed to run past their May 31 retirement dates under a “reliability-must-run” agreement. The RMR agreement is intended to provide the power necessary to maintain grid reliability in and around Baltimore until “necessary transmission upgrades” to provide reliable power to the area from other sources are complete.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-2.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 14:05:37.355665

“Coloradans know that expanding clean energy and good jobs is a no-brainer.
This Executive Action will give people tools they need to save money on energy and accelerate clean energy deployment.
“Coloradans need accurate information about the many rebates, tax credits and other incentives available for clean energy and energy efficiency home improvements.","DENVER - Governor Polis, joined by Public Utilities Commission Director Rebecca While, Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor, Conservation Colorado Executive Director Kelly Nordini, Kristen Schatz with COPIRG and homeowner Mark Zammuto, today announced new actions to expand Colorado’s nation-leading progress on saving people money on renewable energy and improve lower-cost clean energy access for people across the state. This includes a new Colorado Energy Savings Navigator, which will help Coloradans determine what tax credits they qualify for to save money on clean energy, as well as an executive action from Governor Polis to ensure state agencies prioritize renewable energy projects that save money and drive Colorado’s economy.

“Today we are taking action to ensure that Coloradans can easily access clean energy savings, especially ones that expire soon. We continue to do all we can to make people aware of how you can reduce costs on energy bills and keep money in your pocket. That’s what the launch of this new tool and executive action are all about,” said Governor Jared Polis.

New federal policies are projected to increase average Colorado household energy costs by as much as $500 per year by 2035.

Today’s actions will mitigate these potential harms and help maintain Colorado’s leadership in delivering clean, affordable energy and helping Coloradans save money and provide greater certainty to businesses investing in Colorado.

Governor Polis announced that he will be directing state agencies to streamline and accelerate the development of eligible clean energy projects to provide reliable, affordable energy. This will ensure expedited and cost-effective deployment of new clean energy infrastructure to support Colorado’s growing economy, maximize the utilization of federal resources to reduce the costs, and enable Colorado energy consumers to invest in energy-saving technologies in time to access federal resources.

This includes strategies to ensure that qualifying, cost-effective renewable energy generation starts construction or is placed in service as quickly as possible, especially to receive federal tax credits and avoid tariff uncertainty. That will include leveraging existing PUC authorities while also ensuring decisions are issued in a timely manner to ensure utilities can continue moving forward with their projects, which means economic investment and jobs in Colorado.

States across the country are competing to accelerate the deployment of affordable renewable energy resources, and today’s action augments Colorado’s nation-leading work opening up Colorado for new energy investments. These efforts will improve Colorado’s air quality, advance economic competitiveness, and unlock billions in new investment in Colorado communities and businesses.

“Coloradans know that expanding clean energy and good jobs is a no-brainer. The time to act is now — whether it’s buying an EV or installing a heat pump — while incentives are in place. This Executive Action will give people tools they need to save money on energy and accelerate clean energy deployment. Colorado is stepping up!” said Conservation Colorado CEO Kelly Nordini.

“This online portal is a win for anyone looking to cut down on energy waste, save money or reduce pollution,” said CoPIRG Foundation Advocate Kirsten Schatz. “Coloradans need accurate information about the many rebates, tax credits and other incentives available for clean energy and energy efficiency home improvements. We’re excited that Governor Polis has created a one-stop shop for Coloradans to benefit from available resources. It also makes sense that Colorado should maximize federal tax credits now in order to minimize the cost of wind and solar projects that we were already going to build. Taken together, these actions will help cut costs on utility bills and save Coloradans money when they choose energy-saving technologies such as solar panels, heat pumps or better insulation for their homes.”

“Colorado is showing true leadership and once again, Governor Polis is stepping up to meet the moment,” said Emilie Olson, Colorado lead at the national business association Advanced Energy United. “This kind of swift executive action is exactly what’s needed in light of the devastating impacts of federal rollbacks from H.R. 1. It sends a clear signal that Colorado will move forward in spite of Washington, D.C, and that the state is all in on investing in clean energy, protecting families from higher energy bills, and giving businesses the certainty they need to keep investing in and building the clean energy future Colorado has been a beacon for. We urge other Governors to follow this example in marshaling a whole-of-government response and doing what is in their power to maintain American competitiveness in the clean energy industry.”

The Governor was also proud to launch the Colorado Energy Savings Navigator (CESN), a new, easy-to-use digital tool that connects Coloradans to more than 600 energy rebates and 18 different energy bill assistance programs including federal tax credits expiring later this year. The CESN tool was developed by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC), Colorado Digital Service (CDS) y, the Colorado Energy Office (CEO), Gary Community Ventures/MyFriendBen, and Rewiring America, with grant funding from the Statewide Internet Portal Authority, to provide Coloradans with a one-stop resource to access programs that save money and reduce energy bills. This tool is part of the Governor’s broader Operational Agenda and, in particular, his vision to build a digital experience that helps Coloradans easily access what they need when they need it, regardless of what State agency or program is responsible.

“The PUC is ready to meet the urgency of the moment and help keep energy affordable for ratepayers.. The CESN tool was developed by multiple state agencies, to offer a one stop solution to connect Coloradans with the benefits that can save them money and energy. While there are many programs out there to reduce bills, it can take hours of searching to find them which is likely why only 20% of eligible Coloradans enroll in bill assistance programs. The CESN tool was developed to change that,” said Public Utilities Director Rebecca White.

“We are invested in making innovative, cost-saving technologies such as electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and heat pumps accessible to all Coloradans through various state, utility, and other incentives,” said Colorado Energy Office Executive Director Will Toor. “But our programs are only as good as the number of Coloradans who use them. The Colorado Energy Savings Navigator tool will help Coloradans identify which opportunities may be available to them to save money on energy costs, improve home comfort and safety, and be part of Colorado’s efforts to achieve net-zero pollution by 2050.”

“CDS builds digital tools that center on users and deliver real value for Coloradans—the Colorado Energy Savings Navigator is a perfect example. It transforms the complex process of finding energy rebates and incentives into something simple, straightforward, and accessible to everyone,” said Colorado Digital Services Director Sarah Tuneberg.

""Colorado is helping lead the way in making clean energy upgrades more accessible and affordable for households across the state,"" said Rewiring America’s Sr. Manager of Western Regional Policy, Rebecca Curry. “By connecting households with federal and state programs, Colorado is helping more people save money on their energy bills, improve home comfort, and take meaningful action on climate. With some federal incentives set to phase out or decline in the coming years, a tool like this is arriving at a pivotal moment and gives households the chance to maximize their savings while these programs are still available.”

Whether renting or owning, Coloradans can quickly discover what programs and incentives they may be eligible for by visiting the Colorado Energy Savings Navigator at https://puc.colorado.gov/energy-savings.

In a year defined by accelerating clean energy ambitions and growing geopolitical competition for resources, a transformative initiative has been taking shape across the Global South. The Council for Critical Minerals Development in the Global South—launched in mid-2024 by Sustainable Energy for All, Global South Centre for Clean Transportation, UC Davis, and Swaniti Global—was born from a simple but urgent premise: the developing countries, whether resource-rich or dependent, must have a more defining voice and role in global supply chains for energy transition technologies to ensure a just energy transition. In its first year, the Council has deepened engagements with governments, produced strategic research, convened over a dozen closed-door and public forums, and built action-oriented coalitions across continents. Together, they are reshaping how the Global South navigates its mineral future aligned with principles of equity and justice as emphasized by the United Nations Secretary General Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals.

Over the past year, the Council has emerged as a strategic platform to facilitate collaboration and exchange between countries worldwide—not just on sustainable extraction but also local beneficiation, manufacturing, trade, and equitable community benefits sharing. Countries are increasingly viewing the energy transition as a generational opportunity to build domestic industry, create jobs, and advance industrialization goals.

The Council’s first convening in July 2024 opened with a critical question: How can mineral development deliver long-term benefits for local communities? Experts from India, Brazil, and South Africa explored models for Community Benefit Agreements (CBAs). The roundtable highlighted the need for social infrastructure investment, going beyond compensation, and mitigation of long-term socioeconomic dependency on mining. Participants underscored that local communities must be partners in development—not passive recipients—to ensure the success and equitable development of these projects.

Momentum continued in September 2024, when the Council co-hosted a roundtable in Indonesia with the KADIN Net Zero Hub, focused on strengthening ASEAN green value chains for energy transition technologies. Discussions centered on how industrial clusters and Special Economic Zones could serve as platforms for building regional value chains and facilitating intra-ASEAN trade—from mineral extraction and processing to end-use products like batteries and electric vehicles. The discussions served as the basis for a deeper engagement beginning January 2025 on developing an ASEAN critical minerals demand-supply assessment analysis in support of key regional frameworks, including the ASEAN Carbon Neutrality Strategy, and the under development ASEAN Minerals Development Vision.

Later that month, the Council hosted a high-level roundtable at the UN General Assembly 2024 with the Africa Program of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The session convened Ministers from Nigeria, Ghana, and Malawi, alongside heads of financing institutions, UN agencies, and development partners. The roundtable identified gaps in data, tools, capacities, and policy frameworks that currently limit critical minerals development in the Global South and potential solutions. The discussion anticipated recommendations from the UN Secretary-General’s Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals. Alongside the high-level roundtable, the Council engaged with the Africa Minerals Strategy Group - an intergovernmental organization representing 16 African countries with the goal of promoting exploration, extraction, production, local beneficiation and commercialization to ensure a sustainable, transparent and secure supply of critical minerals.

The Council strengthened its south-south engagement activities hosting a public webinar Mineral Edge to Economic Boost in October 2024. Speakers from India, Brazil, and South Africa highlighted that while many critical minerals are found in the Global South, the majority of processing, manufacturing, and market power remains concentrated in the Global North. Discussants emphasized that without industrial policy, South–South cooperation, and strategic investment, mineral-rich countries risk remaining locked into low-value extraction. It explored specific areas of collaborations where action is needed to address pertaining barriers and what lessons are emerging from the Global South countries.

At COP29 in November 2024, the Council supported a private roundtable convened by Swaniti Global and the India Climate Collaborative. The focus was on cooperation between Brazil, India, and South Africa to develop local mineral value chains and implementation of ESG standards. Participants discussed how Global South countries can balance resource extraction with social equity and regional economic goals as they face similar constraints in investment, capacity, and trade.

In February 2025, the Council hosted two panels at Mining Indaba in South Africa, marking a milestone in engagement in key African policy forums. The first panel focused on how governments can enable mineral value chain development and the importance of south-south collaboration, featuring high-level decision makers from the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development, Nigeria and the Ministry of Mines, India. The second addressed what it would take to scale midstream and downstream investment, including insights from multilateral development banks, private equity, and industry leaders.

At Mining Indaba, the Council also shared an update with the Nigerian Minister for Solid Minerals Development on the national critical minerals demand-supply assessment being undertaken by the Council, which will highlight opportunities for Nigeria in the value chains of energy transition technologies such as batteries.

Building on its country-level data and analytics, the Council completed its minerals demand-supply assessment analysis for India, led by the UC Davis’s India ZEV Research Centre, with a deep-dive on lithium. Coming in the backdrop of the recently launched National Critical Minerals Mission, the study provides strategic inputs to the government on securing minerals supply chains and the role of south-south cooperation in advancing local value. In May 2025, the Council and the Indian Ministry of Mines hosted a closed-door roundtable in New Delhi focused on “Securing India’s Clean Energy Supply Chains: Upstream Lithium Sourcing Strategies for India”.

The session outlined a structured approach for India to build supply resilience through asset acquisition, strategic international cooperation, and the expansion of domestic recycling. Officials from India’s Ministry of Mines, National Security Council Secretariat, and NITI Aayog joined representatives from Australia, Argentina, the Netherlands, and the United States.

At the heart of the Council’s work is a commitment to evidence-based decision-making. Over the past year, it has produced a growing body of analysis to inform policy and guide implementation. A forthcoming report, led by Swaniti Global on behalf of the Council, examines how Community Development Agreements can serve as vehicles for domestic investments in infrastructure, jobs, and governance. A comparative brief Transition Minerals in South Africa, Brazil, and India: A Brief on Current Value Chains and Strategic Priorities analyzes the current state of critical mineral value chains in South Africa, Brazil, and India, identifying national strategies, gaps, and opportunities for collaboration among Global South countries. These insights are further consolidated in the Council’s Roadmap for South–South Collaboration, which outlines five priority areas for joint action: investment platforms, workforce development, regional R&D, interoperable ESG standards, and coordinated trade policy. Together, these publications form a strategic foundation already in-use by stakeholders that are exploring regional partnerships and cross-border initiatives.

As the world accelerates toward net-zero, demand for key energy transition minerals is set to skyrocket—lithium by nearly 12×, with strong growth projected for cobalt, graphite, nickel, and rare earth elements. This projected surge, based on the IEA's net-zero scenario, underscores the urgent need for investment in mineral value chains. For mineral-rich Global South countries, this is not just a supply challenge—it is an opportunity to lead across these value chains via sustainable, locally anchored development.

Governments and industry in the U.S., EU, and China are realizing national strategies to secure supply access. If Global South producers are to shape global markets, coordination is no longer optional—it’s essential. Africa alone holds over 30% of the world’s critical mineral reserves, including 70% of global cobalt and 85% of manganese; yet, the continent holds just a fraction of processing capacity[1]. Without bold policy and regional cooperation, the Global South could miss out on an estimated $1.5 trillion in downstream value by 2040[2].

In that landscape, the Council’s model stands out. It not only brings stakeholders together—it helps build the tools, data, and analyses needed to chart a new path. One year in, the Council is proving that critical minerals can power not just the clean energy transition, but a fairer global economy.

One year in, the Council is already demonstrating that the Global South can lead not only in supplying minerals—but in defining how they are produced, by whom, and to what end.

The Wood Mackenzie view The trends in activity for oil and for gas “could not be more different,” says Ryan Duman, a director on Wood Mackenzie’s US Upstream research team.
Crude prices have risen in the past week, supported by President Trump threatening to use secondary sanctions to hit Russia’s oil exports.
In the longer term, we project global oil demand to hit a plateau in the early 2030s.
Meanwhile, expectations for US domestic gas demand have been revised up sharply because of projected growth in gas-fired power generation.","President Donald Trump has said he doesn’t like the slogan “Drill, baby, drill”, because it has become too much of a cliché. But it is still a commonly used message from his administration.

First coined in 2008 by Republican politician Michael Steele, as a play on the 1960s radicals’ chant “burn, baby, burn”, it encapsulates a central goal of the party’s energy policy: increasing oil and gas production.

Even if you have your doubts about the slogan, the reality behind it is undeniable. The surge in US drilling activity that began in 2003 changed the world, transforming the nation from an oil importer to an exporter, and cutting energy costs for consumers at home and abroad.

However, President Trump’s ambitions to make the oil and gas industry a key driver of economic transformation in his second term appear to have been disappointed, at least so far. The number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the US has fallen since he took office, from 576 at the time of the inauguration in January, to 542 this week, according to Baker Hughes, the oilfield services group.

The primary drivers of drilling activity in North America are commodity prices, corporate cash flows and capital allocation strategies, not government policies. And those factors have not, in general, incentivised management teams to pursue growth this year.

“Drill, baby, drill” may work well at political rallies and on social media. It is less of a winning message in boardrooms and in investor meetings.

That said, there is an important distinction between oil and gas. While the number of rigs drilling for oil in the US has dropped over the past year by 67, or 14%, the number of rigs drilling for gas has risen by 21, or 21%.

The Trump administration’s claims of “unleashing” US energy may be over-hyped. But in the gas industry, something real is happening.

The Wood Mackenzie view

The trends in activity for oil and for gas “could not be more different,” says Ryan Duman, a director on Wood Mackenzie’s US Upstream research team. The number of active rigs in the oil-focused Permian Basin has fallen by 44 this year, while the number in the Haynesville gas-producing play has risen by 10.

Those contrasting trends reflect significant differences in demand and price outlooks. For oil, market conditions are challenging. Crude prices have risen in the past week, supported by President Trump threatening to use secondary sanctions to hit Russia’s oil exports. But on Wood Mackenzie’s base case view, crude prices will be lower next year than this.

In the longer term, we project global oil demand to hit a plateau in the early 2030s. We see US production levelling off before then. And if crude prices do drop significantly next year, with West Texas Intermediate remaining below US$60 a barrel for a sustained period, then we would expect US oil production from the Lower 48 states to fall even faster than our base case.

For gas, the outlook is very different. Two factors are driving US demand higher: increased gas-fired power generation and a surge in LNG exports.

Wood Mackenzie is forecasting that North America’s domestic gas demand plus exports will rise by about 33% over the next 10 years, from about 1.26 trillion cubic metres (tcm) in 2025 to about 1.67 tcm in 2035.

Within those numbers, LNG exports are expected to more than double, rising from about 143 billion cubic metres (bcm) to about 373 bcm over the same period. The momentum in the US LNG industry was highlighted this week by Venture Global, which announced that it had taken the final investment decision to proceed with its CP2 LNG plant in Louisiana.

Meanwhile, expectations for US domestic gas demand have been revised up sharply because of projected growth in gas-fired power generation. Data centres for AI and new factories are driving a surge in US electricity demand, and gas-fired plants will play a key role in meeting that increased demand.

One of the main themes of President Trump’s Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit two weeks ago was using the gas resources of the Marcellus and Utica shales to supply new generation to power data centres for AI. Blackstone and PPL have formed a joint venture to build combined-cycle gas turbine plants in Pennsylvania. They have already secured potential sites, and are working with pipeline companies and manufacturers to secure gas supplies and turbines.

US gas producers are already moving to take advantage of these trends. EQT this month signed two supply agreements, covering about 20% of its total production, for gas-fired power plants at two sites in Pennsylvania.

Robert Clarke, Wood Mackenzie’s vice president of Upstream research, said the deals “mark a strategic turning point for Appalachian producers”. They signal the rise of a new asset class for Lower 48 shale gas: driven by data centre demand, adjacent to infrastructure and supported by long-term contracts.

Although activity has been increasing, this new demand growth has not yet led to a surge in investment. Some of the leading listed gas-focused E&Ps are restraining their spending and prioritising financial strength, because they still face pressure from investors to maintain capital discipline, cut borrowings and return cash to shareholders.

Most of the recent upturn in activity and M&A in US gas has come from privately held companies and international groups, including both operators such as TG Natural Resources and Osaka Gas, and non-operated players such as TotalEnergies and Mubadala.

That means there will still be attractive opportunities available, according to Wood Mackenzie’s Duman. “The window of opportunity is now,” he says. “Those who move early can form the right partnerships, capture the best inventory and structure the right marketing agreements with demand centres, including both LNG players and AI-linked hyperscalers.”

The Trump administration moves to undo fundamental climate ruling

The Trump administration has launched a review of the “endangerment finding”: the regulatory decision that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide threaten public health and welfare. If successful, the move would remove the legal basis for current emissions standards for vehicles and make it harder for future administrations to regulate greenhouse gases.

The finding was made by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Obama administration in 2009, in response to a Supreme Court ruling in 2007. Initially used to set standards for vehicles, it has also underpinned attempts to regulate emissions from other sectors, including power generation.

Lee Zeldin, head of the EPA, said reversing the finding would save US businesses and families US$1 trillion or more in regulatory costs. If finalised, the move would remove all greenhouse gas standards for vehicles in the US, going back to regulations first applied in 2010.

The EPA said new scientific and technological developments had changed the position since the 2009 ruling. It also argued that recent Supreme Court judgments showed that decisions on major policy issues such as climate change must be made by Congress, not by administrative agencies.

The agency added that, along with a package of deregulatory measures announced in March, the move to overturn the endangerment finding “represents the death of the Green New Scam and drives a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion”.

In support of the EPA’s move, the Department of Energy (DoE) published a report on the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on the US climate. The report’s authors, five scientists including Judith Curry and Steven Koonin, concluded that “carbon dioxide-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed” and argued that aggressive mitigation strategies could be more harmful than beneficial. Three of the five authors were recently hired by the DoE.

An article in Science, the journal published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science, said mainstream climate scientists would acknowledge some of the report’s points, but also cited critics of its use of evidence and key conclusions.

The DoE report, and the review of the endangerment finding, are now open for public comment.

In brief

The EU and US reached a new trade deal, with energy a central part of the agreement. As part of the deal, the EU has pledged to import US$750 billion worth of energy from the US over the next three years, prompting some scepticism among commentators.

The European Commission published an explanation of the energy plan, showing that it would mean more than doubling EU imports of US oil, gas and nuclear fuel, which are currently running at about US$100 billion a year. The Commission suggested that replacing EU energy imports from Russia, and importing nuclear technology, including small modular reactors, could help close the gap to US$250 billion a year.

Leading Chinese producers of polysilicon, used in solar panels, are in talks about working together to buy and shut down roughly a third of the industry’s production capacity, Reuters reported.

One of the world’s largest offshore wind projects, Berwick Bank in the North Sea, has been given the go-ahead by the Scottish government, despite opposition from wildlife groups concerned about the impact on seabirds. The project, which will have a capacity of up to 4.1 gigawatts, is seen as essential for meeting the UK government’s goals for offshore wind development.

Meanwhile, the US government has rescinded its designations of areas of federal waters as suitable for offshore wind development.

Quote of the week

“North Sea Oil is a TREASURE CHEST for the United Kingdom. The taxes are so high, however, that it makes no sense. They have essentially told drillers and oil companies that, “we don’t want you.” Incentivize the drillers, FAST. A VAST FORTUNE TO BE MADE for the UK, and far lower energy costs for the people!”

President Donald Trump, who visited the UK this week, was sharply critical of the country’s oil and gas tax regime.

Chart of the week

This comes from our latest Horizons report: ‘Staying power – How new energy realities risk extending coal's sunset’, by Anthony Knutson and David Brown. It shows global coal demand, actual and projected, to 2050 in Wood Mackenzie's base case forecast. You can see how consumption is dominated by China (maroon) and India (pink). Asia as a whole accounts for about 78% of global coal use.

The key point is that the Wood Mackenzie forecast, which is consistent with about 2.5 °C of global warming by the end of the century, depends on a steep decline in China's coal consumption over the next couple of decades. The report tackles the question: what if coal consumption does not fall in line with that projection?","https://www.woodmac.com/siteassets/frontify_media_download/photography/upstream/macro/macro_upstream_gettyimages-155420181.jpg?w=800&h=480&mode=crop&center=0.5,0.5",N,,2025-08-01 16:04:09.044490

We’re going to continue to fight to make sure that the EPA does protect us from the dangers of climate change.
The first president to ask Congress for legislation that would cover climate change and carbon dioxide was Lyndon Johnson 60 years ago, in 1965.","AMY GOODMAN: The Environmental Protection Agency has formally proposed revoking the Obama-era scientific determination that greenhouse gases are a danger to public health and welfare because they cause global warming. The endangerment finding is the basis of a 2009 rule that allows the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars, power plants and other sources under the authority of the Clean Air Act. It’s been one of the most important legal underpinnings in the federal effort to combat climate change.

EPA chief Lee Zeldin called the move to rescind the finding the, quote, “largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.” Zeldin spoke on Fox News Tuesday.

LEE ZELDIN: After the endangerment finding came out, not only were there all sorts of mobile source emission standards, but they also came out with trying to regulate out of existence all sorts of stationary sources. They started applying it to airplanes and more. We’re talking about many trillions of dollars. Where does the authority come from? It came from the Obama EPA deciding, very creatively, with a whole bunch of mental leaps, that they were going to just claim an authority, that we believe, after a very plain reading of these Supreme Court cases, we don’t have.

AMY GOODMAN: While EPA chief Zeldin was talking about dismantling climate regulations, Fox News was airing an extreme heat alert warning on the bottom of the screen. The graphic said 162 million Americans were under high heat alerts at the time of that interview.

The EPA relied on a new report from the Department of Energy to justify the proposal. The authors include several scientists well known for their rejection of the scientific consensus on climate change. Meanwhile, the EPA’s own data shows transportation is the sector most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions.

The Sierra Club condemned Zeldin’s move, writing, quote, “As if any doubt remained, the Trump Administration has formalized climate denial as the official policy of the United States government,” unquote.

Democratic Senator Ed Markey spoke at a rally outside the EPA Tuesday.

SEN. ED MARKEY: Listen up, Lee Zeldin. The science is against you. The law is against you. You can try to censor our information. You can try to silence our scientists. You can try to fire hundreds of biologists and chemists and physicists. But you cannot change the science. You cannot change the reality of the harm which is being done by greenhouse gases as they are sent up into the atmosphere. The endangerment finding is backed by the science. It’s backed by the law. It has withstood every attempt to challenge it so far, and it will continue to withstand any challenge which is being made.

AMY GOODMAN: The Texas climate scientist Manuel Salgado of WE ACT for Environmental Justice also spoke outside the EPA. He described last month’s devastating floods that killed over 130 people in Texas.

MANUEL SALGADO: Unfortunately, my hometown and the surrounding communities know quite viscerally what the danger of climate change is. Less than a month ago, on July the Fourth, the area was struck by catastrophic floods. This flooding resulted in an egregious and, frankly, quite preventable loss of life, over 135 people, including 27 children and young people passed away at Camp Mystic. This is all due to supercharged floods from greenhouse gases. …

I cannot imagine how awful it feels to lose a child in a climate disaster, but what I do know is that if Lee Zeldin, Donald Trump and the billionaire polluters that they serve get their way, millions of Americans will know that feeling quite well. We can’t afford that future. We’re going to continue to fight to make sure that the EPA does protect us from the dangers of climate change. Thank you.

AMY GOODMAN: We’re joined now by two guests. David Doniger is senior attorney and strategist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, the NRDC, Climate and Energy Program. Michael Mann is an acclaimed climate scientist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, also director of the Penn Center for Science, Sustainability and the Media. His forthcoming book with Dr. Peter Hotez is titled Science Under Siege.

Let’s begin with David Doniger. Can you explain what exactly EPA chief Zeldin is doing? Talk about the 2009 endangerment finding and the significance of this moment.

DAVID DONIGER: Thank you. Yes.

I need to start even further back. The first president to ask Congress for legislation that would cover climate change and carbon dioxide was Lyndon Johnson 60 years ago, in 1965. And Congress voted that authority in the 1970 Clean Air Act. So, as the science continued to become stronger and stronger, finally, EPA began to move towards regulating the pollution that drives this climate change. And first, there was a big court case in 2007 called Massachusetts v. EPA, where the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act definitely does cover the kind of pollution that causes climate change, and that if EPA determined on the science that there was a danger to our health and to our environment, then it had to regulate these chemicals. So, that’s what EPA determined in 2009: Reviewing all the science, there is grave danger to health and to many, many aspects of the environment, and these chemicals need to be regulated.

So, the first step was to establish motor vehicle emission standards. And today’s cars emit one-half as much climate-changing pollution as cars made in 2008. We’ve made a lot of progress. But now Zeldin is attempting, against the science, to revoke the determination this stuff is dangerous, and knock the legs out from under his own legal authority to curb the pollution. He would repeal all of those standards for carbon pollution from vehicles, from power plants and other industries.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you take us through the legal history of regulating greenhouse gases, from the creation of the Clean Air Act to where we are today, David Doniger?

DAVID DONIGER: Right. So, as I said, President Johnson asked for legislation. The Congress passed that legislation in 1970. It specifically says that one of the adverse effects to be prevented was an adverse effect on the weather and on the climate. They knew — they were informed by scientists back then — that carbon dioxide has this heat-trapping property, and it should be treated as a pollutant. Now, it took a long time, but EPA began to move towards regulating at the end of the Clinton administration. When President Bush came in, though, they changed their position pretty much to the one that Zeldin’s taking now: We don’t have the authority. And a bunch of states, led by Massachusetts, and a bunch of environmental groups, including NRDC, sued the EPA. And as I said a moment ago, the Supreme Court ruled that this stuff is actually in the definition of air pollution, and this stuff must be curbed if EPA determines, based on science, that it’s dangerous. So, that’s the legal background.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to bring in Michael Mann. You are a well-known, world-renowned climate scientist, now distinguished professor at University of Pennsylvania. Can you talk about the implications of this? We just heard a clip about what happened in Kerr County in Texas, the more than 130 people who just died there. No one particular weather event, of course, can be attributed to climate change, but the intensity and the frequency of these events, not only in the United States and around the world. Can you talk about what rescinding this so-called endangerment finding will mean globally?

MICHAEL MANN: Yeah. It’s good to be with you, Amy.

And let me first actually add a data point to that timeline that David very nicely provided us. It’s worth noting, at the very beginning of George W. Bush’s first term, in 2000, his own EPA administrator, Republican EPA Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, declared that CO2 is a pollutant that should be regulated under the Clean Air Act. And it was only later, when they got rid of Christine Todd Whitman, that they went down this road that takes us to where we are now. And so, this wasn’t always such a partisan political issue, but today it obviously is.

And, you know, what we’re talking about can be measured in human lives. As you allude to, those floods in Texas, these extreme weather events that we have been enduring here in the United States summer after summer, the heat waves, the wildfires, the floods, the superstorms, the science is very clear here: Human-caused warming has amplified these events. It’s made them more intense, it’s made them more destructive, and it’s made them more deadly. And it’s made them far more unhealthy. And so, this really is a demonstration. What we’re seeing play out, these extreme weather events, are a demonstration that carbon emissions do pose a danger to our health and, in fact, to the health of the planet.

And so, what rescinding the endangerment finding does is take away from the federal government the main lever arm we have, the main tool we have, to reduce carbon emissions and to meet our obligations to the rest of the world under the commitments that we have made. And when the United States fails to lead, it leaves a vacuum, and it leads other nations to sort of ease off in their own efforts. And so, what the United States is doing here, what this administration is doing, is a danger to the entire planet, and it has to be viewed that way.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk more about the EPA announcing, Michael Mann, that it’ll eliminate its scientific research arm and begin firing hundreds of chemists, biologists, toxicologists and other scientists, what this means?

MICHAEL MANN: Yeah, no, it’s already been doing that. They’ve already been eliminating large segments of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, scientists who study our atmosphere, our oceans, our climate. In every government agency, they’re doing this right now. They’ve actually defunded the Mauna Loa laboratory, the laboratory where we have been measuring CO2 concentrations for half a century, which demonstrate the sort of inexorable increase in carbon dioxide concentrations, the famous Keeling Curve that many of your viewers will have seen.

And so, it’s literally as if they think that if they stop measuring the state of our climate, our atmosphere, our oceans, if they stop measuring it, it will somehow go away. It’s pernicious. It’s dangerous. And, you know, we were a country that was founded on science. The progress that we’ve made, the economy we’ve built, the infrastructure we’ve created, was because we embraced science. And now these latest actions by the administration betray that legacy.

AMY GOODMAN: On Tuesday, the Department of Energy also released a new report that challenges the scientific consensus on the climate impacts of greenhouse gas emissions and provides, quote, “a critical assessment of the conventional narrative on climate change,” unquote. This is Secretary of Energy Chris Wright speaking on Fox News.

ENERGY SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: The goal is to restore confidence in science, in data, in rationalism. That’s what — that’s what enabled the creation of modern science. Then we slid back into sort of a cancel culture, Orwellian squelching of science and talking about the science, as opposed to the process that is science. So, at the Department of Energy, we released a report, which is sort of a critical overview of what do we know today about climate science, about climate data, and what impacts that might have on the American people.

AMY GOODMAN: So, that’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright, standing right next to, in his interview on Fox News, Lee Zeldin. Let’s start with David Doniger responding to this, as he talks about pushing back against the “Orwellian squelching of science.”

DAVID DONIGER: Well, it’s truly an upside-down world when you listen to Chris Wright. He called upon, and actually hired, as special government employees, five people picked because they are climate skeptics and deniers of major elements of the science. These are people who have been advancing fringe views for a long time. And the science community does exactly what Chris Wright wants. It reviews anybody’s assertions against evidence. And these views have been consistently found to be fringe and unreliable and contrary to the evidence. I have not seen anything like this since Tuesday, where scientists are coming out of the woodwork to point out the flaws in this work by the five fringe scientists. There’s a comment period. I’m sure that hundreds of scientists are going to point out the flaws in this work. And for Chris Wright to represent this as an open, neutral process is nonsense. He handpicked five people who have been on the fringe for 20 or 30 years, to tell him what he wants to hear, which is that fossil fuels are the cat’s meow.

AMY GOODMAN: Finally, Michael Mann, your final thoughts, as we go back to the inauguration, when President Trump vowed to declare a national energy emergency in order to fulfill his campaign pledge to “drill, baby, drill.”

MICHAEL MANN: Yeah, it’s, again, you know, the irony — and David laid it out there — this is what we call projection, right? The very things that they are accusing scientists and others of are the things that they are doing. What’s Orwellian here is them claiming they’re doing this for the good of our economy, when, of course, these extreme weather events that have been amplified by climate change are devastating our economy, are devastating agriculture, these wildfires and floods, represent a near and present danger to us. And the cost of inaction, of not preventing further damage, it far outpaces any reasonable estimate of the cost of taking action, of the investment in clean energy that can help create a thriving economy and protect us from the ravages of ongoing climate change.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you both for being with us. Of course, we’ll continue to follow this story. Michael Mann, acclaimed climate scientist, professor at University of Pennsylvania, and David Doniger, senior attorney at NRDC’s Climate and Energy Program. That’s the Natural Resources Defense Council.

Next up, a group of activists from Louisiana have come here to New York to confront the financial backers of natural gas projects in what’s known as “Cancer Alley.” We’ll speak with The Vessel Project’s Roishetta Ozane and her 12-year-old daughter Kamea, who suffers from asthma, like so many in Cancer Alley. Stay with us.

First Solar shipped 3.554GW of CdTe modules in Q2 2025, and produced a total of 4.2GW. Sales were up 30% sequentially and 9% year-on-year.

The company’s gross profit percentage was 45.6%, a 4.8 percentage point increase from Q1 and a 3.8 point fall from Q2 2024.

In Q2, First Solar sold US$312 million in Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing tax credits for cash proceeds of US$296 million. Yesterday, PV Tech reported that the company sold another US$391 million of 45X credits to a “leading financial institution”, bringing its total 45X sales to over US$1.5 billion to date.

In its earnings report presentation, First Solar said it continues to ramp up its Alabama module production facility and has begun integrated production at its Louisiana site.

‘Strengthened First Solar’s relative position’

First Solar CEO, Mark Widmar, said the recent changes to tax credits for solar manufacturing, particularly the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions introduced in July’s budget reconciliation bill, “Places First Solar in a greater position of strength than it was following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022.”

The FEOC restrictions limit access to the 45X manufacturing credit for products manufactured by or receiving “material assistance” from certain foreign entities, which, for the solar industry, amounts to Chinese companies. We have heard from industry analysts who said that the FEOC restrictions will make it hard for many solar manufacturers to access 45X tax credits, as the global solar supply chain is dominated by China and Chinese-backed firms. It may only be the biggest players able to access the credits. Read more on that in the latest edition of PV Tech Power (subscription required).

First Solar, largely by using CdTe technology in place of crystalline silicon, is isolated from much of the China-dominated supply chain. It is also the largest solar manufacturer in the US, and well-poised to benefit from more difficult circumstances.

“These [FEOC] provisions address one of the biggest loopholes under the IRA,” Widmar said on the company’s Q2 earnings call. “In our view, it is not unreasonable to expect that there will be limited Chinese solar manufacturing in the US in the foreseeable future … which may reduce the supply of domestic content.”

In March 2024, Widmar addressed the Senate Finance Committee, calling for the exclusion of Chinese solar manufacturers from IRA tax credits. He said the US “cannot line China’s pockets with US taxpayer dollars.”

The budget reconciliation bill also brought in deadlines for the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and Production Tax Credit (PTC) for solar projects. New sites will have to “begin construction” by 4 July 2026, or be operational by the end of 2027, to receive the credit.

Widmar said that if projects continue as scheduled, it “strengthens the resilience of our existing contracted backlog … which we believe creates a strategic foothold to integrate our international supply with the US, and potentially create a US finishing line” for the company’s international supply and manufacturing operations.

He also said that the near-term rush of projects trying to gain the tax credits could create demand that sees orders fulfilled for the rest of the decade.

First Solar has also been a proponent of antidumping and countervailing duty (AD/CVD) tariffs on solar modules and cells entering the US. Along with fellow manufacturers Qcells and Mission Solar, it is one of the companies pushing the Department of Commerce to impose tariffs on products that it claims are illegally subsidised and sold at unfairly low prices in the US market.

These tariffs “meaningfully decreased” imports of cells and modules from Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia and Vietnam, Widmar said, and the companies have recently launched a new petition against Laos, Indonesia and some Indian manufacturers.

As the automotive industry hurtles toward a carbon-neutral future, the Japanese automaker is recalibrating its electrification strategy, navigating a delicate balance between its hybrid dominance and the urgent need to scale battery-electric vehicle (BEV) production. With revised 2025 targets, a $14 billion investment in North Carolina, and a roadmap to 3.5 million EVs by 2030, Toyota's approach is neither a blind leap into all-electric fervor nor a retreat from innovation—it is a calculated, multi-technology bet on sustainability. For investors, the question is whether this strategy will position Toyota to outperform in a decarbonizing world or leave it trailing behind Tesla and Chinese EV upstarts.

The 2025 Roadmap: A Pragmatic Shift, Not a Retreat

Toyota's 2025 EV production targets have been adjusted from an ambitious 1.5 million units by 2026 to 1 million, a 33% reduction. On the surface, this appears to signal hesitation. But context is critical. Hybrid vehicles (HEVs) still account for 40% of Toyota's global sales, generating consistent cash flow to fund EV R&D. By 2025, the company aims to offer 70 electrified models, including 15 BEVs, with the C-HR+ and bZ4X as flagship entries. Crucially, Toyota is not abandoning its hybrid expertise; it's leveraging it. The company's $13.6 billion investment in solid-state batteries—promising 750-mile ranges and 10-minute charging by 2027–2028—could redefine the EV landscape and give Toyota a technological edge.

Toyota's revised targets also reflect a pragmatic response to market realities. The U.S. and EU are imposing stricter emissions regulations, while Chinese EVs flood global markets with aggressive pricing. Toyota's strategy now prioritizes localized production: two new U.S.-built EVs in 2025 at Georgetown, Kentucky, and Princeton, Indiana, plus a $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina. This vertical integration reduces exposure to supply chain volatility and tariffs, while its $70 billion electrification investment by 2030 signals long-term commitment.

The Hybrid Advantage: Funding the Future

Toyota's hybrid dominance is both a strength and a shield. In 2024, HEVs accounted for 17.8% of U.S. electrified vehicle sales, with the Prius and RAV4 Hybrid leading the charge. This cash cow funds BEV development without requiring massive upfront subsidies. Meanwhile, the company is expanding its plug-in hybrid (PHEV) lineup, targeting 150,000 units annually by 2027. This “bridge technology” strategy caters to markets where BEVs remain cost-prohibitive, such as Europe's ICE-dependent commercial fleet sector.

Toyota's hydrogen ambitions further diversify its electrification portfolio. The Mirai's second-generation fuel cell modules, produced in Europe, and partnerships in hydrogen infrastructure could unlock a $300 billion market by 2030. Unlike rivals like BMW and Mercedes, Toyota isn't betting solely on batteries—it's hedging against uncertainty in energy storage and charging infrastructure.

Competitive Positioning: A David vs. Goliath Scenario?

Toyota's U.S. EV market share in Q2 2025 was 1.9%, lagging behind Tesla (46%), GM (14.9%), and even Honda (9.7%). But this metric obscures a critical truth: Toyota's electrified vehicles (HEVs, PHEVs, and BEVs) already represent 43% of its U.S. sales—a figure that dwards the 1.9% BEV share. This underscores the company's unique value proposition: it's not just transitioning to EVs; it's transitioning with customers, offering low-emission options at every price point.

However, the competition is intensifying. Chinese EV giants like BYD and Nio are exporting affordable BEVs to the U.S. and Europe, while European automakers are accelerating hydrogen and battery R&D. Toyota's delayed EV entry (compared to Tesla's 2008 launch) creates a headwind, but its global manufacturing scale and financial discipline could mitigate this. The company's $1 billion investment in Joby Aviation, for instance, signals a broader vision of mobility—potentially unlocking new revenue streams in urban air mobility.

Valuation and Investor Sentiment: A Discounted Leader?

Toyota's stock trades at a P/E of 7.2 and P/S of 0.7, starkly lower than Tesla's 183 and 11.2. This valuation gap reflects skepticism about its EV growth potential but offers a compelling risk/reward profile. With a dividend yield of 3.9% and a 13.55% stock surge in July 2025, Toyota's shareholder-friendly policies are a draw for income-focused investors. Analysts are split: 3 “Buy” ratings, 8 “Hold,” and no “Sell” as of July 2025, with an average price target of $117.10 (7% upside from current levels).

The company's financials reinforce its investment case. Despite a 34% projected decline in 2026 net income due to tariffs and input costs, Toyota's $314 billion revenue and 11.4% pretax margin provide a buffer for reinvestment. Its $50 million Arizona Vehicle Testing Grounds expansion and $13.9 billion North Carolina battery plant are not just strategic—they're defensive, ensuring it can meet EU and U.S. regulatory demands without relying on volatile global supply chains.

The Long Game: Can Toyota Outrun the EV Revolution?

Toyota's 2025 roadmap is a masterclass in incrementalism. By 2030, it aims to produce 3.5 million EVs, a 23-fold increase from its 2024 output of 140,000. This trajectory is ambitious but realistic, especially given its hybrid-driven cash flow and focus on cost-effective battery tech. The company's solid-state battery breakthrough, if commercialized as planned, could erase current EV range and charging limitations—a $200 billion market opportunity.

For investors, the key risks are execution and market share erosion. Toyota must accelerate its EV launch cadence (seven models by 2027) and avoid the “innovation lag” that plagued its early EV efforts. However, its global scale, diversified electrification strategy, and financial discipline create a moat that few rivals can match.

Conclusion: A Buy for the Patient Investor

Toyota's stock may lack the speculative allure of Tesla or BYD, but its valuation, dividend yield, and strategic flexibility make it a compelling long-term holding. The company is not merely adapting to the EV revolution—it's engineering a path that leverages its hybrid legacy, hydrogen ambitions, and battery breakthroughs to redefine mobility. For investors willing to overlook short-term EV market share metrics, Toyota offers a unique blend of defensive strength and growth potential. As the world shifts toward decarbonization, the automaker's multi-technology roadmap and financial resilience may prove to be its greatest assets.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-01 14:06:19.474386

The most recent permitting reform effort, led last year by former U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, failed after negotiations to include it in another continuing resolution failed.
The act would have shortened the timeline for judicial review of energy and mineral permitting projects while accelerating federal decision-making for leasing of energy projects on federal lands.
It’s solar, it’s wind, it’s broadband, it’s housing development, it’s transportation projects,” Capito said.
I feel like this is where we are with permitting,” Capito said.","CHARLESTON — Permitting reform is once again a major focus of U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, and she believes that lawmakers can get a package to the desk of President Donald Trump by the end of the year.

Speaking to West Virginia reporters on a conference call Thursday afternoon, Capito talked about her speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate Wednesday advocating for permitting reform to speed up energy, transportation, and infrastructure projects.

“I thought it was time to start talking more aggressively about the need for permitting reform,” said Capito, R-W.Va. “If we’re going to have data centers in need of more energy, we need to be able to have a permitting structure that really works.”

Capito, the chairwoman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, is working with EPW ranking Democratic member Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., on a permitting reform package that can be considered by the full Senate and U.S. House of Representatives sometime in the next five months.

“We both, as chair and ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, wanted to put out a united front as a unit,” Capito said. “I think that is good, and that would be great for West Virginia. Hopefully, we can do something by the end of the year.”

The EPW Committee began work in February on permitting reform, taking testimony in committee and keeping the record open for 30 days to allow stakeholder to submit further testimony and comments. According to Capito, her committee received 107 submissions on behalf of 146 organizations, as well as 854 individual requests providing input on how to improve federal permitting processes.

Congress has been tackling the topic of permitting reform for a number of years, either through individual bills or by including permitting reform provisions in continuing resolutions to keep the federal government funded.

The most recent permitting reform effort, led last year by former U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, failed after negotiations to include it in another continuing resolution failed. Manchin, the former chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, worked with then-ranking Republican committee member John Barrasso of Wyoming on a package called the Energy Permitting Reform Act.

The act would have shortened the timeline for judicial review of energy and mineral permitting projects while accelerating federal decision-making for leasing of energy projects on federal lands. It would have allowed for at least one lease sale for offshore wind and offshore oil and gas projects per year from 2025 to 2029 subject to limitations.

Among other things, the proposal would have reformed current backstop authority for interstate electric transmission lines and required interregional planning. It would have limited how electric companies allocate expenses to customers for transmission line projects, as well as other items to speed up transmission projects.

“We’ve been talking about this for years,” Capito conceded. “The Manchin/Barrasso bill almost passed at the end of last year. They had a lot of permitting for transmission and some easing of some of the judicial reviews so you can’t keep going to court back-and-forth and back-and-forth.”

But Capito said she believes this is the year to push for a large, comprehensive permitting reform package that can appeal to different kinds of projects.

“It’s not just new pipelines or natural gas. It’s solar, it’s wind, it’s broadband, it’s housing development, it’s transportation projects,” Capito said. “I think what we’re seeing here is a convergence of clean energy folks and people like me who are all-of-the-above meeting together with an urgency, and I think that’s why I think we have a better shot at this year than we’ve had over the last few years.”

Over in the U.S. House of Representatives, House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Bruce Westerman, R-Ark., and U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, introduced the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development (SPEED) Act. That bill would make reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to streamline permitting processes, shorten timelines for permit approvals, and limit judicial review.

“A lot of times here on Capitol Hill…things have to simmer and cook for a couple years before we really get to the meat of the matter. I feel like this is where we are with permitting,” Capito said. “The House just put out a bipartisan bill. That’s a good sign that there’s bipartisan support in the House and we have to have a bipartisan process.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.weirtondailytimes.com/images/2016/08/19083913/fbLIKE.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 15:03:47.858373

DTE will offer drives in EVs from Tesla, Chevy, Ford, Jeep and Cadillac.

The Woodward Dream Cruise draws thousands of gas-powered cruisers, car buffs and more casual visitors to the iconic roadway every August, and for the second year in a row, fans of electric vehicles will take a spin there in the weeks beforehand, hoping to build on their inaugural outing.

Clean Cruise 2025, which organizers acknowledge is inspired by the Dream Cruise, promises a bigger show, with speakers and kids activities and more EVs for year two of the electrified celebration, scheduled for 11 a.m.-4 p.m. on Saturday, Aug. 2, at Memorial Park, near 13 Mile and Woodward, in Royal Oak.

The official EV cruise will hit Woodward Avenue from 4-4:30 p.m., led by a blue Kia EV 9, “making two loops between Emmons Road in Birmingham and 9 Mile Road in Ferndale,” according to organizers.

Last year saw 40 EVs participate in the organized cruise on Woodward and 250-275 people attend the event itself. As of Wednesday, July 30, 60 EV owners had already signed up to bring their rides out for the cruise (you can still sign up until the morning of the event at https://michiganeva.org/clean-cruise/ and organizers expect upwards of 500 people to come out.

Food trucks will be a new addition this year as will DTE Energy’s offering of EV test drives. A chunk of EV test drives are already booked, but Amy Rogghe, founder of the Michigan Electric Vehicle Alliance, the nonprofit host of the cruise, said DTE will keep a portion available to book on the day of the cruise. The Ford Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Equinox EV, Jeep Wagoneer S, Tesla Model Y and Cadillac Lyriq are the EVs listed on the registration page.

Despite the killing of federal tax incentives and other efforts to gut clean energy in the United States, EV sales have grown through the second half of this year, according to Cox Automotive, and the technological advances aren’t slowing down, although the market is facing challenges. Automakers also continue to promote their EV strategies, as evidenced by announcements like Ford CEO Jim Farley's pledge of an upcoming ""Model T moment"" for the company's EV strategy.

It’s why supporters of the Clean Cruise say it’s an important showcase that can help educate in a setting that lets EV owners share their passion. It’s a way to get beyond politics, they say.

“People are curious to get on the dance floor, but they don’t want to be the first ones to take that step, and events like the Clean Cruise help to do that,” said Chris Aina, director of EV charging at Gasser Bush Associates and a member of the alliance.

What’s happening globally will also have an influence on jobs in Michigan, and stagnation in the EV arena can be viewed as a threat, he said.

The “political ping-ponging that’s going on is not going to stop the technology at all,“ Aina said. “The wave is not stopping and … I think we just need to get our heads out of the sand a little bit here in Michigan.”

Rogghe noted that the Michigan Conservative Energy Forum, a group that’s definitely not liberal or left wing, is a main organizer of the cruise, highlighting how EVs don’t represent a specific brand of politics. She acknowledged that she’s gotten a lot of questions about the pullback in federal incentives but noted that EVs sales remain robust.

“It’s a free market, and people are going to go with what they want,” she said, noting that the goal is to tell the truth, dispel myths and “show people how awesome it is to own” an EV.

The cruise will showcase a wide range of EVs to highlight offerings for “all interests and all pocketbooks,” Rogghe said.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/31/PDTF/85462785007-clean-cruise-2024.JPG?crop=2399,1351,x0,y146&width=2399&height=1351&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-01 14:05:44.903228

This week, the EPA officially proposed revoking its endangerment finding: a 2009 declaration that affirmed greenhouse gas emissions harm human health. The finding underpins many of the agency’s most powerful regulations of planet-warming emissions, and if it’s repealed, it could take those rules with it.

In its Tuesday announcement, the EPA made the case that the agency overstepped its legal authority with the finding and doesn’t actually have the power to implement emissions rules. The EPA also offers an ​“alternative” justification for the reversal, in which it attempts to downplay the link between human-caused emissions and global warming.

The proposed rollback is a denial of consensus climate science and would have serious implications for the federal government’s ability to cut climate pollution if it stands. For starters, it would knock out the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon emissions from vehicles. The Biden administration’s strict tailpipe-emissions limits, meant to push the U.S. toward EVs, would collapse.

Reversing the endangerment finding would also make it even easier for the Trump administration EPA to gut power-plant emissions rules. That includes a Biden administration rule that would’ve required many coal and gas plants to capture their carbon emissions or shut down, and which the Trump administration was already looking to repeal. An EPA rule that regulates methane pollution from oil and gas facilities is also at risk.

The rule change probably won’t be published until 2026, after the EPA has reckoned with a likely barrage of public comments, former White House counsel Jody Freeman told Heatmap. After that, it’ll probably face a wave of legal challenges and may ultimately be considered by the Supreme Court. If the court’s conservative majority rules in the Trump administration’s favor, a future presidential administration may not be able to bring it back without Congress’ help.

Two ways to save rooftop solar

The rooftop solar industry isn’t in a great place. The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill last month will soon erase federal tax credits that for 20 years have helped homeowners afford solar panels. Rising interest rates and state policies devaluing electricity generated by residential solar panels have also been eroding the economic case for installing panels for years now, Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports.

But some solar advocates see the setback as an opportunity to get creative. Solar industry veteran Andrew Birch tells Jeff that cutting non-equipment ​“soft costs” like permitting and project management, which make up roughly two-thirds of an installation’s price tag, can help solar stay cost-competitive. And Sachu Constantine, executive director of advocacy group Vote Solar, says a focus on pairing panels with batteries to create ​“virtual power plants” also adds to their value, as they can back up the grid when power demand is high.

New York embraces all-electric buildings

New York is now leading the country on cleaning up building emissions. State officials approved a new building standard last week that prohibits the use of gas and other fossil fuels in new buildings, with some exceptions. While cities around the country have enacted all-electric building codes, New York is the first to do so statewide.

The gas ban faced opposition from construction and fossil-fuel industry groups, who argued that it will raise costs for homeowners, Canary Media’s Alison F. Takemura reports. It’s true that residential construction costs will likely rise, a state-commissioned report found. But residents can recoup those higher costs in 10 years or less via lowered energy bills — and they’ll also see health benefits from locking dangerous fossil-fuel pollution out of their homes.

By Jody Godoy

(Reuters) -A U.S. judge on Friday largely rejected a request by top asset managers including BlackRock to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Texas and 12 other Republican-led states that said the companies violated antitrust law through climate activism that reduced coal production and boosted energy prices.

U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle in Tyler, Texas agreed to dismiss just three of the 21 counts in the states' lawsuit, which also names institutional investors State Street and Vanguard.

The lawsuit is among the highest-profile cases targeting efforts to promote environmental, social and governance goals.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said the three companies ""created an investment cartel to illegally control national energy markets and squeeze more money out of hardworking Americans,” and that “today’s victory represents a major step in holding them accountable.""

The three asset managers said they would continue to defend against the claims, with Vanguard calling the ruling disappointing, and State Street calling the case a risk to investors and energy markets.

""By pursuing forced divestment, the Attorneys General are undermining the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,"" BlackRock said.

The ruling by Kernodle, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, means the states can move forward with their claims that the asset managers violated U.S. antitrust law by joining Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative to take action to combat climate change, and used their shareholder advocacy in furtherance of its goals.

Kernodle, however, dismissed claims that the asset managers violated Louisiana and Nebraska consumer protection laws.

The companies have denied wrongdoing and called the case ""half-baked."" But the states' theories have garnered support from Trump-appointed antitrust enforcers at the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission.

The outcome of the lawsuit could have major implications for how the companies, which together manage some $27 trillion, approach their holdings and passive funds.

One possible remedy sought by the plaintiffs would be for the fund firms to divest holdings in coal companies, which BlackRock has said would harm the companies' access to capital and likely raise energy prices.

As part of DRIVE, Governor Healey will file legislation proposing $400 million in state funding to retain world-class talent, preserve and create jobs across industries, and support a key foundation of the Massachusetts economy.

Massachusetts has long been a global leader in research, innovation and development. In addition to producing lifesaving cures for diseases that impact everyone, this industry is a major driver of the state's economy. A new report by the UMass Donahue Institute’s Economic & Public Policy Research Group analyzed the impact of federal research and development funding in Massachusetts.

The report found that the $8.57 billion in annual federal research and development funding that Massachusetts receives supports 81,300 jobs, $7.8 billion of income, and generates more than $16 billion in economic activity. The funding also represents a good return on investment. For every dollar invested, the state sees an economic benefit of double that amount.

Massachusetts is home to one in every 10 jobs in research and development in the United States. Two out of every five of the jobs created by this funding are in sectors outside of research and development, including: construction, food services, health care, retail and administrative support.

“Massachusetts is the global leader in innovative research and the discovery of lifesaving cures,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Research funding is also foundational to the Massachusetts economy – it's economic infrastructure here. This bill is about creating jobs across industries from construction and food services to health care and education. And in the face of uncertainty from the federal government, this is about protecting one of the things that makes Massachusetts so special – our global leadership in health care and helping families across the world.”

“This is an innovative proposal that demonstrates our administration’s commitment to supporting the game changing scientific and medical research that happens every day in Massachusetts, while creating new jobs and strengthening our economy,” said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. “With other states and other countries trying to surpass us, and uncertainty at the federal level, it’s more important than ever that we have a Governor who will bring people together – public, private and philanthropic – to deliver the resources our research and innovation sector needs to succeed and maintain our competitive edge.”

The Governor’s legislation proposes $400 million in state funding to leverage private and institutional resources to retain world-class talent, preserve jobs and protect the engines of Massachusetts’ innovation economy. This will include $200 million to a one-time multi-year research funding pool, housed at MassDevelopment. This fund will support research projects at hospitals, universities, and independent research institutions, as well as a one-year fellowship program for early career professionals. It will be paid for using the interest off the state’s stabilization fund.

The other $200 million will be placed in a public higher education bridge funding reserve, funded by Fair Share surtax revenue. This will provide Massachusetts public higher education campuses support for direct and indirect costs of research, cross-regional partnerships and joint ventures. Additionally, the reserve sets aside funding to preserve and hire positions in research and teaching, including graduate, post doctorate, and other early career professionals.

This legislation will also broaden the eligible use for federal match funds to further protect Massachusetts from federal cuts that seriously threaten public health, safety or welfare, or the fiscal stability of the state. Included in the new eligible uses is authority to transfer funds to the Health Safety Net Trust Fund to support hospitals and community health centers and ensure care for our most vulnerable residents.

Through MassDevelopment, Governor Healey is also creating a new 501(c)(3) entity, the Research Catalyst Fund, which will serve as a vehicle to accept and distribute philanthropic contributions and matching funds from industry. Donors will be able to direct funds toward particular institutions or projects or contribute to a shared pool, complementing public investments to expand their impact. Together, these funds will be governed by a newly created Research Opportunity Review Board, which will identify and support high-impact projects that benefit the public and advance the state’s innovation economy.

Governor Healey will also sign an Executive Order establishing an Advisory Commission on Advancing Research and Discovery in Massachusetts. This Commission will convene leaders from medical, higher education, and economic development sectors and will be charged with recommending additional solutions to strengthen the research and innovation ecosystem and advance scientific discovery and job creation in Massachusetts.

“This legislation will strengthen institutions that are essential to both our state’s economy and our reputation as a national leader in education, health care, and scientific research,” said Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew J. Gorzkowicz. “By deploying Fair Share revenue and repurposing resources from our Federal Match Fund to support our innovation sector, the investments proposed in this bill are responsible, strategic, and designed to deliver maximum benefits to all of Massachusetts.”

“This proposal is a critical investment in the Massachusetts economy and scientific discovery,” said Director of Federal Funds and Infrastructure Quentin Palfrey. “By leveraging both public and private investment, the Governor's proposal will enable vital research and innovation to solve some of humanity's greatest challenges, all while preserving and creating new jobs here in Massachusetts.”

Sally Kornbluth, President, Massachusetts Institute of Technology:

“With the DRIVE Initiative, Governor Healey provides a welcome endorsement of the Commonwealth’s ‘eds-and meds’ ecosystem, which benefits all of us in Massachusetts. And of course, advances that spring from our universities, hospitals and laboratories benefit all Americans; if we see these institutions diminished or compromised, all Americans stand to lose. At MIT, our work is crucial to America’s economic strength, global scientific leadership, and national security. Though no other source can replace federal funding for sheer scale, I applaud the Governor’s announcement of a new advisory commission to find ways to sustain the Commonwealth’s leadership in research, education and innovation for decades to come.”

Melissa Gilliam, President, Boston University:

“At Boston University, our research and teaching focuses on service, solutions, and improving lives. This initiative is the latest example of Governor Healey’s commitment to ensuring that our scientists and scholars can continue to conduct research that has a positive impact on the people of Massachusetts, and beyond.”

Todd Golub, Director, Broad Institute:

“Massachusetts has long been on the cutting edge of life sciences, whether it’s sequencing the human genome, developing life-saving treatments with advanced gene editing, or pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in cancer care. This is where the next generation of creative thinkers come to learn, build connections, and push their ideas forward. Longstanding bipartisan support for education, science, and innovation in the Commonwealth have made this possible. This initiative is another way for Massachusetts - the hub for innovation in the life sciences - to continue to lead the world, attract talent, and create great jobs while improving human health everywhere.”

Benjamin L. Ebert, MD, PhD, President and CEO, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute:

We look forward to partnering with policymakers on this initiative.""

Brooke Thomson, President and CEO, Associated Industries of Massachusetts:

“The DRIVE Initiative represents the sort of creativity that Massachusetts needs to remain a global leader in research and innovation during a time of uncertainty. The proposal would use state funding to leverage private investment to create jobs and accelerate the research that provides billions of dollars in economic benefit to Massachusetts. The 3,400 member companies of AIM are also pleased that the newly formed Advisory Commission on Advancing Research and Discovery in Massachusetts will review additional strategies to advance scientific discovery and job creation in Massachusetts.”

J.D. Chesloff, President and CEO, Massachusetts Business Roundtable:

“Massachusetts is an innovation based, research based, talent based economy that is fueled in large part by a decades long partnership with the federal government. That partnership has led to global leadership in some of the state’s foundational industries, such as higher education, health care, life sciences and clean energy. With uncertainty surrounding the future of that partnership, the state must think differently about how to maintain its leadership and support the transformative innovations that are developed here. Today’s proposal by the Healey-Driscoll Administration is a bold statement about the state’s intention to continue to lead, to innovate, and to attract and retain the best talent in the world.”

Brian Johnson, President, MassMEDIC:

“MassMEDIC welcomes and emphatically supports the Healey Administration’s initiative to protect our innovation economy. For decades, public investment in Massachusetts research institutions has driven R&D. Our state’s commitment to responsibly translating research into tools, therapies, and treatments that impact people across the globe is what makes Massachusetts the worldwide leader in medical technology and life sciences. We cannot afford to lose ground and cede innovation to our global competitors. This plan will help keep the Commonwealth at the forefront, continue to foster great job growth, and ensure patients around the world benefit from this critical work.”

Max Page, President, Massachusetts Teachers Association:

“The federal administration is waging a war on our universities that threatens life-saving and world-improving research, as well as the Commonwealth’s leadership in academic research and innovation. UMass Amherst alone has lost $30 million in federal research funding this year; it is likely that this coming year will bring even more cuts. The vast majority of those research dollars went to pay for the outstanding faculty, staff, graduate students and post-doctoral students who do research that is crucial to the health and welfare of our nation. There are other threatened cuts, including federal funding for the TRIO programs which help underprivileged students, often first-generation college students, succeed. The MTA applauds the Healey administration for using revenue from the Fair Share Amendment to protect the invaluable research and academic work taking place at public colleges and universities. We are proud to have played a significant role through our Raise Up Massachusetts coalition to pass Fair Share, which is exceeding expectations and thereby making this kind of funding for public education, in preK through public higher education, possible.”

Navjeet Bal, President and CEO, MassDevelopment:

“MassDevelopment is pleased to partner with the Healey-Driscoll Administration in this important initiative, and our team stands ready to help facilitate public and private investment into critical research projects across Massachusetts as proposed by the legislation. With innovation at the heart of our state’s economy, taking steps to strengthen our research sector will have crossover benefits for a wide range of industries and serve to bolster our overall economic competitiveness.”

Charlie Hipwood, CEO and President, MassVentures:

“Research and academic spinouts create lifechanging technologies as well as new industries, businesses, and jobs. These initiatives are critical for advancing and commercializing research and innovation.”

Kirk Taylor, MD, President and CEO, Massachusetts Life Sciences Center:

“Massachusetts is the best place in the world for the life sciences because of our government’s continued support and partnership. Today’s announcement is another example of the leadership that is needed now more than ever. DRIVE has the potential to leverage and amplify the very best of our ecosystem to create jobs and provide for patients nationally and globally.”

Natural gas was next, and there was zero new coal or nuclear, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Through 2030, the US energy landscape looks a lot like these last six months in terms of the mix of new power plants, with solar and batteries leading the way, according to the EIA’s list of planned power plants.

I’m digging into the numbers to try to make sense of the contrast between the Trump administration’s push to expand use of natural gas, coal, and nuclear power, and the reality of which kinds of power plants—mainly renewables—are on track to serve the grid of the near future.

Some of this contrast can be explained by the normal lag to develop a power plant. Most of the recently completed projects have been in the works since about 2020, which feels like ancient history.

The Trump administration’s policy changes, which tend to favor fossil fuels and disfavor renewable energy, haven’t had much time to translate into projects with firm timelines.

But even so, it’s important to note that the administration is limited in how much, and how quickly, it can change trends in energy development, said David Victor, a professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California San Diego.

“There’s a lot of inertia in the system, which means that when you’re trying to build new clean stuff, it takes a long time to get going in that direction, but when you’re trying to stop building clean stuff and build dirty stuff, which seems to be the Trump policy, it takes a long time for that signal to be felt in the system,” he said.

Some wind and solar projects may be cancelled because of the rapid phaseout of tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed this month. The new law affects the investment tax credit and production tax credit, the main incentives for companies building utility-scale renewables.

But Victor views this as more of a slowdown than a reversal of momentum. One reason is that demand for electricity continues to rise to serve data centers and other large power users. The main beneficiaries are energy technologies that are the easiest to build and most cost effective, including solar, batteries, and gas.

In the first half of this year, the United States added 341 new power plants or utility-scale battery systems, with a total of 22,332 megawatts of summer generating capacity, according to EIA.

More than half the total was utility-scale solar, with 12,034 megawatts, followed by battery systems, with 5,900 megawatts, onshore wind, with 2,697 megawatts, and natural gas, with 1,691 megawatts, which includes several types of natural gas plants.

The largest new plant by capacity was the 600-megawatt Hornet Solar in Swisher County, Texas, which went online in April.

“Hornet Solar is a testament to how large-scale energy projects can deliver reliable, domestic power to American homes and businesses,” said Juan Suarez, co-CEO of the developer, Vesper Energy of the Dallas area, in a statement from the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

The plants being completed now are special in part because of what they have endured, said Ric O’Connell, executive director of GridLab, a nonprofit that does technical analysis for regulators and renewable power advocates. Power plants take years to plan and build, and current projects likely began development during the COVID-19 pandemic. They stayed on track despite high inflation, parts shortages, and challenges in getting approval for grid connections, he said.

“It’s been a rocky road for a lot of these projects, so it’s exciting to see them online,” O’Connell said.

Looking ahead to the rest of this year and through 2030, the country has 254,126 megawatts of planned power plants, according to EIA. (To appear on this list, a project must meet three of four benchmarks: land acquisition, permits obtained, financing received, and a contract completed for selling electricity.)

Solar is the leader with 120,269 megawatts, followed by batteries, with 65,051 megawatts, and natural gas, with 35,081 megawatts.

There are zero coal-fired power plants, and one nuclear plant: Kemmerer Unit 1in Lincoln County, Wyoming, developed by TerraPower, which is listed with projected completion by December 2030. The proposed restarts of closed nuclear plants, such as Palisades in Michigan, have not yet shown up in the data.

The planned capacity is a lot. For perspective, the country’s current power plants, including the ones that began operation this year, have about 2.5 million megawatts.

A caveat: When comparing different power technologies, generating capacity is only part of the picture. It’s important to consider the typical electricity production of a plant and how predictable this output will be.

For example, a combined cycle gas plant, the most common type of gas plant, has an average “capacity factor” of 60 percent. This is a number that shows how much electricity a plant produces compared to if it were running at full strength all the time.

Utility-scale solar has an average capacity factor of 23 percent, limited by the fact that the sun goes down at night. (You can see 2024 capacity factors for fossil-fuel technologies here and non-fossil technologies here.)

So, solar’s dominance in terms of new capacity coming online is tempered by its limitations. Developers work around this by building solar alongside battery energy storage. Some of the largest projects this year were solar arrays located next to battery systems, such as Sun Streams 4, which is a 300-megawatt solar project and a 300-megawatt battery project in Maricopa County, Arizona, developed by Longroad Energy of Boston.

Gas also has plenty of problems, including vulnerability to interruptions in fuel supply and fluctuations in fuel prices, long waits for parts required for new plant construction, and, of course, the release of greenhouse gases that are making the earth less habitable.

These problems are part of why O’Connell is skeptical of the Trump administration’s ability to encourage more growth in gas-fired power than was already happening.

“There are real questions about how much gas we can really build,” he said.

I realize this view may be hard to swallow, considering all of the attacks on renewable energy and the government’s support for fossil fuels. But I also know from years of covering energy that times like these—with major policy changes and uncomfortable levels of chaos—are some of the worst moments to think with clarity about what may be ahead.

Despite this year’s improvement, the five-year running average remains high at 4,755 square miles—still more than double the federal benchmark.
The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force, a coalition of federal and state agencies, has worked for over two decades to reduce nutrient pollution flowing into the Gulf.
The EPA established a dedicated Gulf Hypoxia Program in 2022 to accelerate these efforts.
NOAA also partners with the Northern Gulf Institute and Gulf of Mexico Alliance to expand observational capabilities and state-level technical support.","The Gulf of America’s “dead zone” has shrunk significantly this summer, with scientists measuring a hypoxic area of just over 4,400 square miles — roughly a third smaller than last year and far less than the long-term average, federal officials announced Wednesday.

The dead zone, a stretch of oxygen-depleted water that forms annually off the Louisiana and Texas coasts, is caused primarily by excess nutrients washing into the Gulf from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin.

This year’s zone, measured during a July 20–25 survey aboard the research vessel Pelican, was 4,402 square miles — 21% smaller than NOAA’s early-season estimate and the 15th smallest on record, according to NOAA-supported scientists from LSU and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium.

“This year’s significant reduction in the Gulf of America’s ‘dead zone’ is an encouraging sign for the future of this area,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “It highlights the dedication and impactful work of NOAA-supported scientists and partners, and serves as a testament to the effectiveness of collaborative efforts in supporting our U.S. fishermen, coastal communities, and vital marine ecosystems.”

The measured area is equivalent to roughly 2.8 million acres of bottom habitat temporarily made unavailable to marine life such as fish and shrimp due to low oxygen levels.

That marks a 30% drop from 2024, when the zone spanned a massive 6,703 square miles — more than 1.3 times the long-term average and nearly 3.5 times larger than the target goal of 1,930 square miles set by the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force.

Despite this year’s improvement, the five-year running average remains high at 4,755 square miles—still more than double the federal benchmark.

Dead zones emerge when excess nutrients — mostly nitrogen and phosphorus from upstream agriculture and wastewater — fuel algae blooms. As algae die and sink, their decomposition consumes oxygen in bottom waters. Without sufficient oxygen, marine species must flee or perish.

In 2024, the area west of the Mississippi River experienced heavy hypoxia with extremely low oxygen readings and little water mixing, according to NOAA.

“The stratification of warmer surface water over cooler, saltier bottom water was strong enough to prevent oxygen replenishment,” researchers wrote in a followup report.

Some bottom waters saw oxygen drop across the lower five meters of the water column.

Even with relatively low chlorophyll readings — indicating modest live algae near the surface — researchers noted high concentrations of degraded algae and organic detritus near the seafloor, still enough to drive significant bacterial oxygen consumption.

The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Task Force, a coalition of federal and state agencies, has worked for over two decades to reduce nutrient pollution flowing into the Gulf. The EPA established a dedicated Gulf Hypoxia Program in 2022 to accelerate these efforts.

“The Gulf of America is a national treasure that supports energy dominance, commercial fishing, American industry, and the recreation economy,” said Peggy Browne, acting assistant administrator for the EPA’s Office of Water. “I look forward to co-leading the work of the Gulf Hypoxia Task Force to assess evolving science and address nutrient loads from all sources.”

So far, nitrogen loading from the Mississippi River has not declined since the 2001 adoption of the Hypoxia Action Plan, scientists noted. NOAA’s June 2025 forecast, which had predicted a dead zone of 5,574 square miles, was based on U.S. Geological Survey nutrient data from spring river flows and fell within model uncertainty ranges.

NOAA’s Coastal Hypoxia Research, Ocean Technology Transition, and Uncrewed Systems programs are working to improve monitoring and prediction tools. This year, several autonomous surface vehicles were deployed alongside ship-based crews to compare mapping methods.

Researchers said ASVs may provide a more cost-effective way to track dead zones in the future.

“Business is exploding right now,” said Nolie Diakoulas, director of business development for Virginia Beach-based Convert Solar, which operates statewide.
The federal tax credit “has been a very, very large driver over the past 13 years or so that we've been in business,” he said.
That means the tax credit saves homeowners an average of $9,000 in upfront costs, which he said is often a deciding factor for customers.

Solar installers in Hampton Roads say they’re seeing a surge in demand for rooftop panels as homeowners seek to get a federal tax credit that expires at the end of this year.

“Business is exploding right now,” said Nolie Diakoulas, director of business development for Virginia Beach-based Convert Solar, which operates statewide.

The federal tax credit “has been a very, very large driver over the past 13 years or so that we've been in business,” he said. “Specifically, right now, people are understanding, ‘Oh, wait a second, it’s going away.’”

The Investment Tax Credit first started rewarding homeowners who installed solar in 2006, but the amount fluctuated over the years. President Joe Biden’s signature climate legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, expanded and stabilized the credit by setting it at 30% through 2032.

President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, recently passed by Congress, gets rid of the residential credit, along with several others meant to help stimulate growth in clean energy.

People who want to take advantage before it expires will have to have panels installed and in service by Dec. 31.

Diakoulas said the cost of home solar systems varies depending on the size, but the average is about $30,000, which can be paid with cash or through loan financing.

That means the tax credit saves homeowners an average of $9,000 in upfront costs, which he said is often a deciding factor for customers. People without a tax liability that large can split the credit across several years.

Donny Damon, who lives in the Thoroughgood area of Virginia Beach, installed panels through Convert Solar a few years ago, and said it was a “no-brainer.”

“We want to comply with what's going on in the world and try not to use as much energy – and, of course, get the tax credit,” he said.

Damon said his monthly electric bill is now less than $8 per month, with the solar panels covering a majority of electricity needs even in the peak summer heat.

He pointed to his thermostat set at 64 degrees. “I keep it frosty in here, because I can.”

Deborah Arenstein is program manager with Solarize Virginia, an outreach initiative of the nonprofit Local Energy Alliance Program based in Charlottesville. Rising energy costs are another big reason she encourages the switch.

The regional power grid operator recently held an auction that set record-high prices for electricity, amid surging demand from data centers and delays in new energy projects.

“Energy prices are going up,” Arenstein said. “By going solar, it is guaranteed that your electric bills will not be going up (significantly) over time.”

Dominion Energy is also proposing changes to a different type of credit that benefits homeowners, called net metering.

“If you produce more energy than you are using, you're banking it, which means that you can then access that energy when you are not producing as much, without a charge,” Arenstein said.

The current ratio is 1:1, meaning if you produce one extra kilowatt-hour, that’s the same amount you earn back. Dominion plans to reduce the ratio of return starting next year.

Each year, Solarize requests proposals from solar installers and selects vetted companies to offer discounted pricing to its participants.

The group recently extended its deadline for interested homeowners to sign up for the 2025 program through Aug.15, allowing people an additional window to secure tax credits.

Diakoulas said the cutoff for Convert Solar to accept new orders that can be completed in time will likely be around mid-October.

Installers will then shift their focus toward the leasing model of rooftop solar, in which a third party owns and maintains the system, while the homeowner pays a set monthly fee.

Virginia’s General Assembly only started allowing solar leasing last year. That change is now key to keeping solar companies alive, Diakoulas said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/83648fe/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+675/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9a%2Ff6%2F8756a768468586ce558b27efdf88%2Fimg-2666.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 14:04:01.453099

Asia-Pacific Leads the Charge

Asia-Pacific dominated the market in 2020, with China at the forefront, and is expected to maintain its lead through 2030. Europe and North America follow as key regions driving EVSE adoption.

Technology and Policy Driving Growth

Key growth enablers include:

Government incentives such as India’s FAME-II policy and Japan’s EV roadmap.

Development of advanced solutions like wireless charging and Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) systems.

Increasing rollout of public charging stations on highways and in urban hubs.

Barriers and Opportunities

Despite strong momentum, high costs of EVs and charging infrastructure remain challenges. However, innovations such as ABB’s ultra-fast all-in-one EV charger – capable of delivering 100 km of range in under three minutes – highlight the industry’s drive to overcome adoption hurdles.

COVID-19 Impact

The pandemic slowed manufacturing and supply chains, delaying EV rollouts. Yet, the rebound in EV sales—up 160% in the first half of 2021—has reignited demand for charging infrastructure.

Market Outlook

Residential charging generated the highest revenue in 2020.

Like many liberal organizations preparing for a Trump administration, the letter also discussed shifting focus to state and local climate action.
Lobbying efforts by the American Conservation Coalition and its advocacy arm have met mixed success with the Trump administration.
“The tax credits empower the private sector to invest in clean, reliable energy,” Danielle Franz, ACC’s chief executive officer, told Grist.","In early July, the Bureau of Land Management quietly announced plans to trade away 2 million acres of public land along Alaska’s Dalton Highway. The immense stretch of boreal forest totters into tundra, an area almost three times the size of Rhode Island. It will be handed over to the state, likely opening the door to mining and development.

The exchange is one of many moves by the Trump administration to privatize public land and roll back climate and environmental protections. In just six months the White House has announced plans to shrink iconic national monuments, reopened oil and gas leasing, rescinded watershed protections to pave the way for mining, and opened millions of acres of national forest to logging. These decisions have been joined by a broader dismantling of climate and environmental regulations, including efforts to eliminate the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to curb greenhouse gases.

Even as he continued upending how the country’s natural resources are managed, President Donald Trump signed an executive order vowing to “Make America Beautiful Again.” His directive, issued July 3, called for balancing environmental stewardship with economic growth, and established a commission to “advise and assist the President regarding how best to responsibly conserve America’s national treasures and natural resources.” It is unclear what policies this commission might develop or how much authority it will hold.

Benji Backer, a 27-year-old conservative conservationist, hopes to influence some of those details. He has built a national platform around the idea that caring about the environment and climate change is a bipartisan issue. After founding the nonprofit American Conservation Coalition, or ACC, eight years ago, Backer launched Nature is Nonpartisan this spring. While ACC was “strictly meant for conservatives, by conservatives,” he sees the new organization transcending partisanship, pursuing environmental action regardless of who holds political power. “If there’s a future for our environment, there has to be a center voice that’s willing to call balls and strikes, and not care about who they could potentially piss off,” he said.

The group’s board includes notable conservative figures like David Bernhardt, a lawyer who served as interior secretary during the first Trump administration and was investigated for failing to recuse himself from decisions affecting Halliburton, a former client. He now consults for oil and gas firms. Other advisers include Chris LaCivita Jr., a political consultant and son of the president’s 2024 campaign manager, as well as more centrist figures like Van Jones and David Livingston.

Shortly after the president took office Backer delivered a draft order to the White House containing a list of policy goals he’d developed in consultation with groups like Ducks Unlimited and the National Wildlife Federation. These included goals like restoring forests and combating plastic pollution. Though the final order, announced at the Iowa State Fair, does not explicitly mention climate change, Backer says it helps the EPA administrator and interior secretary “move in the right direction.” Based on his conversations with them, Backer says, “They’ve been focused on cutting. It’s my hope that they start building soon.”

Though the Trump administration’s revisions substantially altered the order, Backer was quick to celebrate it. “Working with the White House on this EO for the past six months has been an honor,” he posted on X shortly after Trump signed the document. “This is an incredible step that will leave a positive mark for our environment for generations!”

Backer’s optimistic tone marks a shift from a letter he co-signed with nine other Republican leaders in December, stating that Trump’s win “raises serious questions about both the durability of recent climate gains and the prospects for future progress.” At that time, the coalition statement focused on the election of climate-engaged Republicans like representatives John Curtis and Marianette Miller-Meeks, both members of the Conservative Climate Caucus. Like many liberal organizations preparing for a Trump administration, the letter also discussed shifting focus to state and local climate action.

Lobbying efforts by the American Conservation Coalition and its advocacy arm have met mixed success with the Trump administration. They appear to have spent $2.65 million trying to preserve key parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, particularly clean energy tax credits. “The tax credits empower the private sector to invest in clean, reliable energy,” Danielle Franz, ACC’s chief executive officer, told Grist. “It’s important to use our resources to reward innovation, and to have those free market or market-based incentives.” She added that the document Grist obtained that outlines the lobbying effort was a “leaked, outdated draft that was never finalized or published,” and “appears to conflate” ACC and its advocacy group’s work. Those efforts ultimately failed: The reconciliation bill made significant cuts to clean energy policy, effectively halting federal incentives for wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects. The bill did retain some support for nuclear and geothermal power. Franz declined to criticize the decision or discuss specific energy policies, saying “in any bill you’re going to have give and take.”

The budget bill debate also demonstrated how effective conservative voices can be in shaping environmental policy. When Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee proposed requiring the sale of millions of acres of federal land, it sparked swift and broad backlash, including from hunters, anglers, and right-leaning influencers like Joe Rogan. After widespread conservative criticism, Lee scaled back the bill, then withdrew it — underscoring the significant influence GOP conservation groups like ACC can have in determining environmental policy.

It was, Backer says, “a perfect example of what is possible. It basically just allowed us to go out there and show that millions of Americans are willing to stand together for the same environmental outcome.” He hopes to build on that momentum with practical goals: Nature Is Nonpartisan is developing a short list of priorities he believes are politically feasible, including providing more funding for easing water pollution, reforming the Endangered Species Act, and tackling the backlog of maintenance in the nation’s 63 National Parks. (His list made no mention of climate change.) To garner support, Backer recently organized a coalition meeting of conservation groups, including right-leaning organizations like American Forests and Safari Club International, as well as more liberal conservation groups like The Nature Conservancy.

It’s part of a broader effort to tap into what he and others see as a growing awareness among conservatives. As Franz puts it, if you asked most conservatives if “climate change is real, they would say yes.” She points out conservation has deep roots in the Republican Party, from Teddy Roosevelt championing the creation of national parks to Ronald Reagan approving the Montreal Protocol to address the ozone hole.

Public opinion has shifted sharply since then, however. According to a 2024 Gallup poll, only 11 percent of Republicans consider climate change a great personal threat, down from 29 percent a decade ago. A Pew Research Center survey reveals that while a majority of Republicans support concrete policies like expanding solar farms and joining international climate agreements, only 12 percent say climate change should be a top national priority — underscoring how political polarization shapes broader attitudes. Though there may be pragmatic support for specific policies, Republicans still consistently prioritize consumer costs, and fossil fuels over renewable energy. “Most conservatives understand the issue,” Franz says. “They’re just tired of the moralism and want solutions aligned with their values.”

In the past, ACC has advocated for streamlining permitting and boosting nuclear energy, promoting an “all‑of‑the‑above” strategy that includes renewables. Franz says ACC is happy with Trump’s “energy abundance” strategy, arguing that traditional energy produced in the United States has “a net reduction for global emissions” because “American-made fossil fuels are cleaner than some other countries.”

The data tell a different story. The International Energy Agency has been unequivocal: To stay within global climate goals, no new fossil fuel development can move forward. Studies show U.S. methane emissions are severely undercounted, especially from shale gas fields, and claims of American fossil fuels being cleaner obscure the urgent need to shift away from them altogether. “Look, I’m not here to defend what Trump’s done on the environment over the last six months,” Backer said. “This is not a black-or-white thing. This is a four-year administration, and we’re trying to shift them in the direction towards conservation as much as we possibly can.”

But hoping for a gradual course correction is at odds with the urgency of the crisis and the need for swift action, said Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey who led the EPA under President George W. Bush. She is upset by the Trump administration’s dismantling of that agency, saying the president “has no respect for science.”

In the absence of climate leadership from Washington, Whitman said states will have to step up with their own agreements, like the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a coalition of 11 eastern states that aims to limit and reduce emissions from the power sector. Although each of those states is currently led by a Democrat, several of them have had Republican governors since the coalition’s inception in 2005. “There are Republicans that really care about the environment and are doing work,” Whitman said. But while she agrees bipartisan advocacy is essential, she says there’s a clear disconnect between the rhetoric in Make America Beautiful Again and the administration’s policies. “You’ve got to watch what they’re doing, not just what they’re saying,” she added. The gap, she said, “is pretty stark.”

Still, Franz is optimistic about building conservative consensus around a sustainable future. “Our message to conservatives is that this country is worth protecting,” she says.

In its first six months, the Trump administration has aggressively expanded oil and gas leasing, rolled back critical environmental regulations, and weakened methane emissions, reversing previous conservation protections and U.S. progress on global climate commitments. Asked about these policies, Franz said, “I think oftentimes these pieces want to relitigate and relitigate and relitigate the past, instead of talking about the future that conservatives see.”

Franz and Backer see themselves as guardians of a tradition that protects a natural heritage alongside economic freedom. They don’t see a gulf between a livable future and the reality unfolding in Washington — a White House that praises abundance while leasing away the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; an administration that talks about stewardship while gutting the laws that made it possible.

Franz recently became a parent, an experience that’s deepened her commitment to her work. She wants her 4-month-old son to grow up seeing the north woods of Minnesota the way she did — deer tracks in the snow, the bite of a November wind, the smell of rifle oil. Franz talks about caring about outcomes, not performative belief tests, how conservatives are tired of virtue signaling, and focusing on solutions. She doesn’t see a tension between supporting oil and gas and promoting conservation at the same time. “It assumes a binary choice between use and between care, and I think that we can do both.”

Whether that’s true is no longer just an ideological debate. It’s a matter of time. As Franz says, “It’s not really a question of, ‘Do you believe in climate change?’ anymore. It’s more a question of, ‘What do you want to do about it?’”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/make-america-beautiful-again-climate-trump-rollbacks.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-08-01 16:04:30.949177

Finally, the bill formalizes new National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) constraints that could impact long-established environmental protections by reducing the environmental reviews undertaken before projects are approved.","As Congress spent the first half of the year developing and finalizing its comprehensive budget reconciliation bill, H.R. 1, Audubon and its members, chapter leaders, and partners worked tirelessly to influence habitat protections, clean energy, and investments in programs to benefit birds, people and our local communities. The final bill, now signed into law, includes provisions that span a wide range of federal priorities, including energy, agriculture, and conservation.

Where we made progress: Most significantly, the final bill did not include any of the proposals that would have set a new precedent for the sale of federal public lands. For instance, a Senate proposal would have sold more than two million acres across the West with limited public input, potentially endangering essential habitat by opening it to development.

The final bill also preserved, and in some cases increased, future funding for agricultural conservation programs, including the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP), Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP), and Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). These key programs support the conservation and restoration of habitat important to birds on farm, ranch, and private forest lands.

Where progress stalled: The final bill presents several challenges for conservation and birds, such as a consequential setback in advancing utility-scale renewable energy, by sunsetting and imposing limitations on clean energy tax credits to render them unworkable over time. This is expected to limit not only the deployment of low-cost, renewable energy in the United States, but also the domestic manufacture of energy technologies. These provisions risk reducing the reliability of our electric grid and increasing electricity costs for consumers nationwide.

The final bill also repeals dedicated funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) that supports coastal resiliency projects that restore and maintain important sea and shorebird habitats, and mandates expanded oil and gas lease sales in ecologically sensitive parts of Alaska. These provisions could weaken protections for important bird habitats across the United States. Finally, the bill formalizes new National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) constraints that could impact long-established environmental protections by reducing the environmental reviews undertaken before projects are approved.

As we move forward, Audubon remains committed to working with lawmakers in a bipartisan fashion to advance durable policies and investments that protect birds and the places they need.

A couple of interesting nuggets: In PJM, data centers account for roughly 7 GW of the 9 GW in AEP’s projected customer load.
In ERCOT, crypto customers surpass data centers, with 5 GW compared to 2 GW.
And in SPP, data centers make up 2.1 GW of the 2.5 GW in total projected load for AEP’s subsidiaries.
Earlier this month, the Ohio Commission established enhanced financial obligations that data centers will need to undertake to fund necessary infrastructure.","American Electric Power (AEP) is projecting 24 gigawatts (GW) of new load to come online by 2030, all backed by signed customer agreements, the utility said in its second-quarter earnings call this week. This is a 14% increase in just one quarter, driven primarily by data centers, along with rising demand from crypto, manufacturing and other economic development.

Looking beyond the short-term, customers are looking to connect 190 GW to AEP’s grid, a whopping five times the utility’s current size of 37 GW. While only a fraction is likely to come online, it still speaks volumes about the projected growth, said William Fehrman, AEP President and CEO.

“Demand for power is growing at a pace I have not seen in my 45-year energy career,” said Fehrman.

Through its regional utility subsidiaries, AEP operates across 11 states, including Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas.

According to Fehrman, of the 24 GW in AEP’s projected load, more than half is in ERCOT (Texas). About 9 GW of that is in PJM territory, with about 2.5 GW located in Southwest Power Pool (SPP).

A couple of interesting nuggets: In PJM, data centers account for roughly 7 GW of the 9 GW in AEP’s projected customer load. In ERCOT, crypto customers surpass data centers, with 5 GW compared to 2 GW. And in SPP, data centers make up 2.1 GW of the 2.5 GW in total projected load for AEP’s subsidiaries.

Potential customers like data centers are drawn to AEP’s footprint because it operates the largest transmission network in the U.S. They’re still coming despite the utility implementing dedicated large load tariffs, which aim to protect other ratepayers from shouldering the costs of grid improvements required to meet these energy-intensive customers’ demands.

Earlier this month, the Ohio Commission established enhanced financial obligations that data centers will need to undertake to fund necessary infrastructure. This approved data center tariff provides assurances that there will be reliable electric grid infrastructure to deliver the power we all count on while keeping costs as low as possible for all customers.

The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) last month approved AEP’s tariff requiring large new data center customers to pay for a minimum of 85% of the energy they are subscribed to use – even if they actually use less. This approval joins other large load tariffs previously secured in Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky.

Last November, AEP reached an agreement to secure up to 1 gigawatt (GW) of Bloom Energy solid oxide fuel cells for data centers and other large energy users who need to quickly power their operations while the grid is still being built out to accommodate demand. The customer-sited fuel cells would be required to meet the interconnection rules of the local operating company and would not be designed to send any energy back to the electric grid.

Fehrman noted in Ohio, AEP has two customers, Amazon and Cologix, that have secured fuel cells while working through a 5-to-7-year interconnection process.

“I would say that’s not unusual in many of our locations as we work through this,” he said, adding that other areas of its system still have available transmission to allow for quicker connections.

When factoring in this projected load growth, AEP plans to increase its five-year capital spend from $54 billion to $70 billion. Roughly half of the new spend would cover transmission infrastructure, including $7 billion in AEP Texas territory alone.

On OBBBA and renewable energy tax incentives

AEP has almost $10 billion of planned renewables projects in its current five-year, $54 billion plan. During the utility’s earnings call, several questions arose about the future of these projects in light of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and a recent executive order, both of which are expected to impose new constraints on federal tax credits for wind and solar.

As of right now, Fehrman said the utility believes 100% of the renewable projects in its five-year plan would be eligible for the tax incentives before they sunset. Depending on new guidelines that come from the Treasury Department, a couple of projects on the back-end of the plan could need to be reassessed for tax credit eligibility.

“I would say worst-case scenario, we would see maybe a couple of billion dollars that we would reallocate from renewables to other sources of generation,” said Fehrman. “I would say this – [OBBBA] does not impact our renewables generation as written right now, and all of our projects qualify.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 14:06:44.174740

“Climate change is a challenge – not a catastrophe,” wrote the energy secretary, Chris Wright, in the report’s introduction.
By contrast, the Trump administration report was crafted by five handpicked scientists who are seen as having fringe or contrarian views by mainstream climate scientists, with no peer review.
‘I’m embarrassed by this report’ Mainstream climate scientists, however, condemned the findings as distorted and inaccurate.
“This is a report written by a couple of scientists who are outliers in their arguments for climate change,” said Natalie Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University.","A new Trump administration report which attempts to justify a mass rollback of environmental regulations is chock-full of climate misinformation, experts say.

On Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposal to undo the 2009 “endangerment finding”, which allows the agency to limit planet-heating pollution from cars and trucks, power plants and other industrial sources. Hours later, the Department of Energy (DOE) published a 150-page report defending the proposal, claiming scientific concern about the climate crisis is overblown.

“Climate change is a challenge – not a catastrophe,” wrote the energy secretary, Chris Wright, in the report’s introduction.

Esteemed climate scientist Michael Mann said the report was akin to the result he would expect “if you took a chat bot and you trained it on the top 10 fossil fuel industry-funded climate denier websites”.

The DOE published the report hours after the EPA announced a plan to roll back 2009’s “endangerment finding”, a seminal ruling that provided the legal basis for the agency to regulate climate-heating pollution under the Clean Air Act. If finalized, the move would topple virtually all US climate regulation.

In a Fox News interview, Wright claimed the report pushes back on the “cancel culture Orwellian squelching of science”. But Naomi Oreskes, a history of science professor at Harvard University and expert in climate misinformation, said its true purpose is to “justify what is a scientifically unjustifiable failure to regulate fossil fuels”.

“Science is the basis for climate regulation, so now they are trying to replace legitimate science with pseudoscience,” she said.

‘This is an agenda to promote fossil fuels’

The attack on the research underpinning the endangerment finding – which says greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare – comes as part of Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” agenda to boost fossil fuels, which are the primary cause of global warming.

“This is an agenda to promote fossil fuels, not to protect public health and welfare or the environment,” said Rachel Cleetus, a director at climate and science non-profit Union of Concerned Scientists who was an author on the sixth US national climate assessment.

Asked about scientists’ assertions that the new report is rife with misinformation, a DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich, said: “This report critically assesses many areas of ongoing scientific inquiry that are frequently assigned high levels of confidence – not by the scientists themselves but by the political bodies involved, such as the United Nations or previous presidential administrations.”

But the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produces what is widely considered the gold standard compendium of climate science, compiled by a huge multinational team of scientists, peer reviewed and agreed to by every national government.

The latest IPCC synthesis report, released two years ago, was a vast undertaking involving 721 volunteer scientists around the world. It states that it is “unequivocal” that human activity has heated the planet, which has “led to widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people”.

By contrast, the Trump administration report was crafted by five handpicked scientists who are seen as having fringe or contrarian views by mainstream climate scientists, with no peer review. The experts behind the report have previously denied being climate deniers. The DOE did not respond to a question about the authors.

“This report had five authors and was rushed over four months, and would not pass muster in any traditional scientific peer review process,” said Zeke Hausfather, a research scientist at the climate non-profit Berkeley Earth, who called the paper a “farce”.

Wright, the energy secretary, insisted he had not steered the report’s conclusions, while Judith Curry, one of the report authors, said in a blog post she hoped the document will push climate science “away from alarmism and advocacy”.

‘I’m embarrassed by this report’

Mainstream climate scientists, however, condemned the findings as distorted and inaccurate. “This is a report written by a couple of scientists who are outliers in their arguments for climate change,” said Natalie Mahowald, a climate scientist at Cornell University. “This document does in no way depreciate the value of previous assessments, but rather just cherrypicks the literature to pretend to create a new review.”

Mahowald said the lack of peer review means it’s “obviously not as robust” as the IPCC report or the US government’s periodic national climate assessment, which the Trump administration recently took offline. The latest national climate assessment, compiled by a dozen government agencies and outside scientists in 2023, concluded that the “effects of human-caused climate change are already far-reaching and worsening across every region of the United States”

“If almost any other group of scientists had been chosen, the report would have been dramatically different,” Andrew Dessler, a climate researcher at Texas A&M University, said of the new report. “The only way to get this report was to pick these authors.”

Hausfather agreed that the authors’ work “might represent their views but is not consistent with the broader scientific literature on climate change”. He was among the scientists whose work the authors cited.

The new paper includes a chart from a 2019 report which he led, claiming it demonstrates how climate models “consistently overestimated observations” of atmospheric carbon. But Hausfather’s research actually showed that climate models have performed well.

“They appear to have discarded the whole paper as not fitting their narrative, and instead picked a single figure that was in the supplementary materials to cast doubt on models when the whole paper actually confirmed how well they have performed in the years after they were published,” he said. The DOE did not respond to a request for comment about Hausfather’s concerns.

That approach to research seems to underpin the entire paper, said Hausfather, who is also the climate research lead at tech company Stripe.

“This is a general theme in the report; they cherrypick data points that suit their narrative and exclude the vast majority of the scientific literature that does not,” he said.

Dessler said scientists are obliged to engage with the full range of evidence, even if it contradicts their initial assumptions. Ignoring this principle “can rise to the level of scientific misconduct”, he said.

“The report they produced should be thought of as a law brief from attorneys defending their client, carbon dioxide,” Dessler said. “Their goal is not to weigh the evidence fairly but to build the strongest possible case for CO2’s innocence.”

The lack of peer review in the administration’s report led to conclusions that deviated, sometimes wildly, from the scientific literature. Many of its claims are based on long-debunked research long promoted by climate deniers, said Mann.

“It is shop worn, decades-old, discredited climate denier talking points, dressed up in the clothing of some sensible new set of revelations,” he said. “What’s different is that it has the imprimatur of the EPA and the federal government now.”

The report, for instance claims that warming trends have been overstated, despite evidence to the contrary. It was published as extreme heat is affecting millions of Americans.

“They’re literally trying to tell us not to believe what we see with our own two eyes … and instead buy into their denialist framing that rejects not just the science, but what is plainly evident if you look out your window,” said Mann.

The authors also write that ocean acidification is occurring “within the range of natural variability” and beneficial for marine life despite the ocean’s acidic levels currently being the highest since 14m years ago, a time when a major extinction event was occurring.

And the report references the apparent health of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, which it says “has shown considerable growth in recent years”. The reef was recently hit by its sixth mass bleaching event since 2016, a devastating phenomena for corals where they whiten and sometimes die due to high sea temperatures. No widespread bleaching events were recorded on the reef prior to 1998.

The report is “tedious” and at times “truly wearisome”, according to Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University. Kopp recently worked on a paper showing how rising temperatures and drought will worsen crop yields, counter to the report’s claims that crops will flourish with extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

“Carbon dioxide fertilization is largely irrelevant to how increasingly extreme heat and intense drought will impact crop yields,” Kopp said. “As a former department of energy fellow, I’m embarrassed by this report.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/477624dadfcc046b6646ce3fb75131eda1555d5f/127_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c51a8ad08319db9445f27d629f67ae13",N,,2025-08-01 13:04:28.441277

WEAs were originally established to identify offshore locations deemed most suitable for wind energy development.

Trump’s Fight Against Clean Energy The Trump administration has tried everything to stop offshore wind development, including trying to get Equinor to stop work on the fully permitted Empire Wind.","The U.S. offshore wind industry has been treading deep water for quite some time now. This week, the Bureau of Ocean Management held its head under and finished the deed.

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced it is rescinding all designated Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The action follows through on a pair of decrees from the Trump administration, Secretary’s Order (SO) 3437 (titled Ending Preferential Treatment for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources in Department Decision-Making), and a Presidential Memorandum issued January 20, 2025, the wordy but apt Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the OCS from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects.

WEAs were originally established to identify offshore locations deemed most suitable for wind energy development. By rescinding them, BOEM is ending the federal practice of designating large areas of the OCS for wind development, and is de-designating more than 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.

Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, announced four policy measures “ending special treatment for unreliable energy sources, such as wind.” They included:

Stopping Preferential Treatment for Wind Projects: SO 3437 calls for identifying policies biased in favor of wind and solar energy and halting support for energy supply chains “controlled by foreign rivals.” In line with the January 20, 2025, Presidential Memorandum on Wind Energy, the department will review its policies to identify and remove “favoritism toward unreliable energy,” with a report of recommended reforms to be submitted under Section 5 of Executive Order 14315.

Restoring Congress’s Mandate to Consider All Uses of Our Public Lands and Waters Equally: Interior will consider withdrawing areas onshore with high potential for wind energy development to ensure compliance with legal requirements for multiple use and sustained yield of public lands. This means balancing energy development with other uses, such as recreation and grazing, and protecting BLM-managed lands, as envisioned by Congress. By terminating WEAs, the department says it is “safeguarding our coastal environments and local economies from unchecked development, while ensuring our power grids are not underpinned by unreliable, subsidized energy sources.”

Enhancing Stakeholder Engagement for Offshore Wind Development: Interior will strengthen its guidance to ensure more meaningful consultation regarding offshore wind development, especially with tribes, the fishing industry, and coastal towns. The construction and operation of offshore wind turbines have disproportionate impacts on these stakeholders, from disrupting commercial fishing to driving away tourism, the department argues, and by addressing current gaps this updated guidance is intended to “support greater collaboration, transparency, and respect for community and regional priorities.”

Reviewing the Consequences of Developing Wind Turbines on Migratory Birds: Interior will conduct a careful review of avian mortality rates associated with the development of wind energy projects located in migratory flight paths and determine whether such impacts qualify as “incidental” takings of birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and related laws. The department will also conduct a review of the applicable regulations to determine the appropriate approach to permitting these activities, identifying violations of the applicable statutes, and related penalties.

“These policy changes represent a commonsense approach to energy that puts Americans’ interests first,” stated Secretary Burgum. “Leveling the playing field in permitting supports energy development that’s reliable, affordable, and built to last. We’re also making sure tribes and local communities have a real seat at the table. This move is about responsible energy growth that works for every American.”

The Writing on the Wall

In late July, New York State pulled the plug on planning the massive transmission projects needed to bring offshore wind energy to shore, a harbinger of BOEM’s decision. The New York State Public Service Commission (NYPS) said canceling transmission plans would protect ratepayers from shouldering the burden of paying for a potential bridge to nowhere, citing “significant federal uncertainty” in the announcement of its strategic termination of its Public Policy Transmission Need (PPTN) process. NYPS started that process in 2023, determining a need for a coordinated transmission project to deliver between 4.77 and 8 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy into New York City.

Federal decisions to halt the permitting and construction of offshore wind generation platforms make achieving New York’s offshore wind goal impossible in the near term and undermine the central purpose of its transmission solicitation.

Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump instituted a sweeping moratorium on offshore wind development, likening turbines to “garbage in a field” that “litters” the country, assuring “no new windmills” would be built during his second term in office. The recently passed budget reconciliation bill championed by Trump disincentivizes both onshore and offshore development by shortening the window for developers to capitalize on tax credit incentives for wind projects. As one might expect, a growing list of well-intentioned developers has either paused work or pulled out of the U.S. market entirely.

In June, a federal judge in Massachusetts announced intent to deny a motion by the Trump administration to dismiss a lawsuit over its blocking of wind energy projects, siding with a coalition of state attorneys general. Led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are suing in federal court to challenge Trump’s day one executive order halting leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump’s Fight Against Clean Energy

The Trump administration has tried everything to stop offshore wind development, including trying to get Equinor to stop work on the fully permitted Empire Wind. President Trumps oil lobby favoritism flies in the face of his “energy dominance” and “all-of-the-above” lip service, and his particular bloodlust against offshore wind development has already killed tens of thousands of jobs, jeopardized tens of billions of dollars in investments, and has ensured gigawatts of clean capacity will never reach the shores of power-constrained parts of the country during an “all-in” AI race (which, if you’re paying attention, we’ve already lost because China isn’t disconnecting power projects).

In the meantime, the very recently broadly respected U.S. Department of Energy has transformed itself into a disinformation mechanism that shills for coal we haven’t mined in eight decades and spreads outright lies about clean energy.",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/image-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 17:03:13.571414

Full transcript - Dominion Energy Inc (D) Q2 2025:

Conference Operator: Welcome to the Dominion Energy Second Quarter twenty twenty five Earnings Conference Call. At this time, each of your lines is in a listen only mode. At the conclusion of today’s presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions will be given for the procedure to follow if you would like to ask a question. I would now like to turn the call over to David McFarlane, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.

David McFarlane, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer, Dominion Energy: Good morning, and thank you for joining Dominion Energy’s second quarter twenty twenty five earnings call. Earnings materials, including today’s prepared remarks, contain forward looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10 ks and our quarterly reports on Form 10 Q for a discussion of factors that may cause results to differ from management’s estimates and expectations. This morning, we will discuss some measures of our company’s performance that differ from those recognized by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non GAAP measures to those most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which we can calculate, are contained in the earnings release kit.

I encourage you to visit our Investor Relations website to review webcast slides as well as the earnings release kit. Joining today’s call are Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer Stephen Ridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and other members of the senior management. I will now turn the call over to Stephen. Thank you, David,

Stephen Ridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dominion Energy: and good morning, everyone. Since the conclusion of the business review last year, we’ve focused on three principal priorities: first, consistent achievement of our financial commitments second, continued on time achievement of major construction milestones for the Coastal Virginia offshore wind project and third, constructive achievement of regulatory outcomes that demonstrate our ability to work cooperatively with regulators and stakeholders to deliver results that benefit both customers and shareholders. As we successfully execute against these priorities, we both empower our employees to provide the reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy that powers our customers every day, and we position ourselves to deliver on the commitments we made to our investors at the conclusion of the business review. We believe that consistent execution against these commitments will deliver compelling value for our shareholders. We had another strong quarter of execution across each of these priorities.

I’ll begin with our financial results, and then Bob will address CVOW and regulatory progress. As shown on Slide three, second quarter operating earnings were $0.75 per share, which includes $02 of RNG45Z credits and $01 of better than normal weather. Relative to second quarter twenty twenty four, positive factors for the quarter included $07 from regulated investment growth, $0.07 from increased sales and $05 from our DESC rate case settlement in 2024. Second quarter results also included a $07 impact from the regular cadence refueling outage at Millstone Unit 3. Second quarter GAAP results were $0.88 per share.

A summary of all adjustments between operating and GAAP results is included in Schedule two of the earnings release kit, and a summary of all drivers for earnings relative to the prior year period is included in Schedule IV of the earnings release kit. We’re reaffirming existing financial guidance, including 2025 operating earnings per share of between $3.28 and $3.52 inclusive of RNG 45Z income with a midpoint of $3.4 Turning to financing on Slide four. As highlighted on our last call, we’ve completed our 2025 ATM equity and we’ve taken steps this quarter to also derisk our 2026 ATM program. We view this level of steady equity issuance under existing programs in the context of our sizable growth capital spending program as appropriate to keep our consolidated credit metrics within the guidelines for our strong credit ratings category. We remain very focused on balance sheet conservatism and there is no change to our previously communicated credit related targets.

Turning briefly to sales. We’re continuing to see strong sales in our service areas driven by continued data center expansion and economic growth. Notably, nine of our top 10 all time peak days in Virginia have occurred this year, including six in the last six weeks, and our all time peak in South Carolina was set just a few days ago. With regard to data center activity, we will refresh our standard detailed disclosures later this year, which will highlight our growing contract backlog. But in the meantime, I’ll just say that data center interest is as robust as we have ever seen it.

We look forward to continuing to meet this demand as we always have in a timely and responsive way that allows us to reliably and affordably serve all of our customers. In conclusion, I’ll reiterate that I’m highly confident in our ability to deliver on our financial plan, including our 2025 operating EPS and credit targets. We’ve built our financial plan to be appropriately, but also not unreasonably conservative to weather unforeseen challenges that may come our way. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bob.

Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominion Energy: Thank you, Stephen. Before we move into business specific updates, I just want to take a moment to acknowledge the outstanding work of our colleagues who have carried out our mission thus far this summer. In addition to operating the system reliably to meet the new peaks that Stephen just mentioned, they have worked around the clock in consistently trying weather conditions to serve our customers and communities. I’m incredibly proud of our team members for their commitment and dedication to provide the reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy that powers our customers every day. With that, I’ll turn to Slide five and address our safety performance.

Our employee OSHA injury recordable rate for the first half of the year was 0.28, reflecting the continued positive trend from the last several years. This is a good start. But as we were reminded in March, when we lost our colleague, Ryan Barwick, in a railcar unloading accident, safety is much, much more than just a statistic. Safety is our first core value, and we’re redoubling our efforts to drive to zero workplace injuries. Turning now to the Coastal Virginia offshore wind project.

We’ve made consistent and noteworthy progress across all aspects of the project since our last call. As summarized on Slide six, the project is now 60% complete, just months away from first delivery of electricity to customers in early twenty twenty six and still on schedule for full completion at the 2026. It represents the fastest and most economical way to deliver almost three gigawatts of electricity to Virginia’s grid to support America’s AI and cyber preeminence in the largest data center market in the world support U. S. Shipbuilding, including Huntington Ingalls, the largest naval shipbuilding company in The United States and one of our largest customers and supports some of the country’s largest and most important military and defense installations.

It has robust bipartisan support from Virginia government and congressional leaders, local communities, military and defense interests, the commercial marine industry, as well as civic, educational, environmental, labor, and community partners. It’s created about 2,000 direct and indirect American jobs and generated $2,000,000,000 in American economic activity. And finally, it’s supported by Virginia law, approved by the Virginia State Corporation Commission and fully permitted by federal agencies. Turning to Slide seven. To date, we’ve installed 134 or 76% of the project’s 176 monopiles as well as 100% of the project’s 12 penpiles.

Today’s totals reflect the installation of 56 monopiles and eight penpiles over the first half of the current installation season. In July, we set a new project record by successfully installing 26 monopiles in a month. Consider that performance relative to the fact that we have 42 monopile installations remaining and three full months of installation season left. Note that fabrication of the final monopile is now complete, and over 90% of the project’s monopiles have now been successfully delivered to Virginia. That effectively means we have just two barge loads left to deliver to Portsmouth.

With regard to transition pieces, 148 or approximately 84% of the project’s transition pieces have now been fabricated, including the 59 that we have already successfully installed. We continue to expect the final transition piece to be completed and delivered to Portsmouth in the fourth quarter. Commissioning of the first offshore substation, which was installed on March 10, is now complete. The remaining two offshore substations are 9970% complete, respectively, and on track to be delivered this fall with installation to be completed by Q1 twenty twenty six as planned. With regard to turbines, Siemens Gamesa continues to make excellent and on time progress in the fabrication of the project’s turbines.

The sections for 58 full towers have been completed with 12 delivered to Portsmouth. In addition, 97 nacelles or 55% are complete, and 42 blades have been fully cast. On Slide eight, you can see the start of turbine tower stacking onshore. All nine deepwater export cables have now been installed, and inter array cabling and onshore work continues on track. Now with regard to Charybdis, our made in America Jones Act compliant installation vessel.

Slide nine has a great picture of the vessel with the full complement of C fasteners now installed. And if you’ll turn to Slide 10, I’ll provide some additional detail regarding vessel status and next steps. We’ve completed testing of all major systems, including the crane, jacking system, normal and emergency generators and all seven thrusters. In addition, we successfully performed the blackout test, which confirms safe integrated operations of all electrical and drive systems during emergency conditions. The remaining tests are commissioning of the final fire zone circuits and testing of the emergency lighting.

That puts us confidently in the position to conclude commissioning next week and begin sea trials immediately thereafter. The scheduled duration for sea trials is eight days, but we’re giving ourselves a little cushion by providing a range of up to fourteen days. During sea trials, the vessel will recertify many of the tests that were already successfully completed during commissioning. Upon successful completion of sea trials, the vessel will officially enter service and commence the charter with C Val. It then takes about ten days to travel to Virginia.

We will install our first turbine in September, which is in line with our original schedule. We had expected the vessel to complete sea trials last month, which would have enabled us to begin turbine installation ahead of schedule. However, the electric cable terminations that connect much of the ship’s internal communication technology simply took longer to complete than expected. That work has now been complete for several days. I’m disappointed that Corybus will be arriving later than expected.

We don’t take lightly missing our timing guidance on any project of this importance. But being this close to completion of the vessel is exciting and an important step toward project derisking. The broader and more important takeaway is the critical value of having the right equipment for this regulated project. I’ll provide a specific example. By securing access to the Orion, our monopile installation vessel and installing monopiles prior to scour protection, we eliminated the need to transfer monopiles from a barge to the installation vessel.

This resulted in a significantly lower risk installation process, which has now translated into a meaningfully positive impact on our monopile installation schedule. In fact, we’re well ahead of plan, installing monopiles at a pace that exceeds any other U. S. Offshore wind project to date. That underscores why I’m so enthusiastic about Charybdis despite a slight delay in delivery.

It’s purpose built for this work and eliminates the need for barges, which will be instrumental in helping us stay on track with turbine installation. One final note on Charybdis, there’s no change to the project cost of $715,000,000 Turning now to total CVAL project costs. The project’s current unused contingency of $222,000,000 is unchanged from our last update and now represents approximately 7% of remaining project costs. Excluding tariff impacts, costs for the project components have remained in line with the prior update. On Slide 11, we provide an update to our potential tariff exposure across discrete tariff categories and illustrative durations.

Let me touch on just two key takeaways. First, before adjusting for recent public commentary around potential EU and Mexico tariff increases, we estimate that the total impact of tariffs as they exist today through project completion at the 2026 would be $5.00 $6,000,000 This is slightly lower relative to our disclosure last quarter despite a doubling of the steel tariff due to both working with vendors to identify cost mitigation strategies as well as completing our analysis of the final trade regulations and appendices. Second, while the details remain to be confirmed, if the EU and Mexico country tariffs are increased by five percent each as reported, we expect an incremental impact to the overall project of $134,000,000 Please note that this estimate is illustrative as we don’t have final details of a trade framework with either trading partner. And in the case of Mexico, don’t know if tariff rates will increase at all. Please also note that changes to tariff policy could impact these estimates.

This morning, we made our quarterly offshore wind and construction update filing with the Virginia State Corporation Commission in which we increased the total project budget to $10,900,000,000 a quarter over quarter increase of about $70,000,000 consistent with our estimate of actual incurred tariff costs plus projected costs through the end of the third quarter, as you see in the table on Slide 11. As a result, we recorded a modest charge this quarter, about $20,000,000 after tax included on Schedule two, for costs not expected to be recovered from customers in accordance with the cost sharing settlement with Virginia regulators and our 50% cost sharing partnership agreement with Stone Peak. These costs and risk sharing arrangements continue to work as intended to protect customers and shareholders. The updated project cost of $10,900,000,000 is expected to increase residential customer bills by an average of $03 a month over the entire life of the project. And the updated project LCOE of $63 per megawatt hour, inclusive of REX, continues to benchmark very favorably with new generation alternatives, including solar, battery and gas fired generation.

Finally, let me address transmission network upgrade costs, which we expected to receive from PJM in July. PJM indicated last week that the earliest they will complete the final decision point will be late September. We continue to await the finalization of those costs by PJM. But importantly, we still do not expect any change in assigned costs of the magnitude of the update we received in February. We’ll provide further updates once available.

In summary, this project remains consistent with the goal of securing American Energy dominance and is part of our comprehensive all of the above strategy to affordably meet growing energy needs. The project fabrication and installation are going very well, and CVOW continues to be one of the most affordable sources of energy for our customers. Turning now to the regulatory landscape on Slide 13. You see meaningful progress across a variety of fronts. Let me provide updates on just a couple of those efforts.

We continue to work through the regulatory approval process to construct and operate the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a one gigawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The Attorney General’s Office has filed testimony supporting the project. Commission staff testimony is due on August 19, with a hearing scheduled for September 23. The Virginia biennial review proceeding remains on track. We’re currently in the testimony phase, with respondent testimony filed on July 16 and commission staff testimony submitted on July 30.

We’re actively reviewing intervener testimony, including submissions from the Attorney General’s Office and most recently the commission staff, which proposed a 9.8% allowed return on equity. That’s 10 basis points higher than our currently allowed ROE. To date, the positions presented align with expectations for a standard regulatory proceeding. There’s one nuance I want to be sure everyone is aware of as they compare company and intervener positions. About $200,000,000 of the headline difference between the company and the party’s proposed two year revenue requirement is related to capacity expense and is really not a difference at all.

We filed our case before the so called Shapiro settlement was approved and therefore reflected a higher capacity expense for both years. Both AG and staff filed revenue requirements that reasonably used the Shapiro cap implied capacity expense, an adjustment of one, we supplied and agreed with and two, is profit neutral. That adjustment alone accounts for about 40% of the, as I mentioned, headline differences between the company and staff’s position. We look forward to continued engagement with all parties and anticipate a final order in November. Turning to South Carolina.

In May, policymakers in the House and Senate passed legislation that was then signed into law by Governor McMaster that takes meaningful steps to address future generation needs of the state, including authorization for new joint gas resource development with Santee Cooper, permitting reform and regulated investment recovery, including an electric rate stabilization mechanism similar to what already exists for gas utilities in the state. We’re appreciative of the significant time spent by the legislature on this important bill, and we see these efforts as supportive of our stated aim to contribute to the success of South Carolina’s robust and growing economy. Additionally, on June 30, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved Dominion Energy South Carolina’s application to extend the operating license for the VC Summer Nuclear Station for an additional twenty years through 02/1962, ensuring supply of reliable carbon free power for decades in South Carolina. Overall, we continue to achieve constructive outcomes in all of our regulated service areas. Lastly, on the topic of governance.

Consistent with corporate best practice, we’ve maintained a regular cadence of Board refreshment. Effective June 25, Paul DeBarr stepped off our Board upon his confirmation as The U. S. Deputy Secretary of Commerce. Paul was an exemplary Board member with deep insights across many relevant topics for our company, industry and country.

We thank Paul for his service, and we wish him well in his new role. Also effective June 25, our Board elected Jeff Lyash to serve as a new independent director. As former President and CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Jeff brings more than four decades of experience in utility operations, power operations and generation construction and public policy and regulatory matters, particularly in nuclear energy, to the Board of Directors. We welcome Jeff to our Board and look forward to working with him. With that, let me summarize our remarks on Slide 14 with a focus on our three priorities: consistently achieving our financial commitments.

We’re off to a strong start in 2025 Continued on time achievement of major construction milestones for the Coastal Virginia offshore wind project and achieving constructive regulatory outcomes that demonstrate our ability to work cooperatively with regulators and stakeholders to deliver results that benefit both customers and shareholders. I was highly confident in the plan we announced early last year, and I’m even more confident today as we continue to see opportunities for additional investment supporting customer growth across the value chain. We’ll include those opportunities which buys toward the back end of our plan in future updates. We’re committed to delivering reliable, affordable and increasingly clean energy to our customers. And as I’ve said repeatedly, we remain laser focused on consistent execution.

With that, we’re ready to take your questions.

Conference Operator: We’ll take our first question from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Your line is open.

Nicholas Campanella, Analyst, Barclays: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions.

Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominion Energy: Good morning, Nick.

Nicholas Campanella, Analyst, Barclays: So I just morning. Morning. So you you went through a lot of detail on the offshore wind, but I just wanted to kinda confirm September COD for the ship now, monopiles are going better than planned. Can you just maybe talk about and expand on where you have Slack in the timeline, I guess, if the ship does see further hiccups? Just how comfortable are you that you can make up that in the schedule?

And to our understanding, there’s no particular periods around turbine installation, so that could be done twenty four seven. Is that correct? And, just overall confidence level there. Thanks.

Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominion Energy: Yes. Confidence level is very high, Nick. Let me just one modest correction in the question. We don’t expect a ship in September. We expect it in August.

We’ll start sea trials next week. Those take eight to fourteen days. And then once the ship is done sea trials, then it moves to the C Val project immediately. There will be a transit period, about ten days, to get up to Virginia. But fundamentally, we’re highly confident in the schedule.

You are correct. There are no time of year or time of day restrictions on installing turbines the way there have been with monopiles. But as we mentioned in the script, what really gives us confidence is the derisking associated with this kind of installation. It really has made such an extraordinary difference in monopile installation to not have to pick up monopiles onto a barge and then pick them up off the barge onto the installation vessel. So the same thing is going to happen with Charybdis.

And you can see in the photos where we have the equipment, the C fasteners on the deck to take nacelles, the monopiles and the blades. And they’ll be picked up directly from Portsmouth where we already have a supply waiting. Siemens is mobilized there. So we’re in a very strong position to get installation on schedule and remain on track.

Nicholas Campanella, Analyst, Barclays: Okay. Thank you for that. Appreciate that. And then just, I guess, on the financial execution, you’ve had a strong start so far year to date. Just where do you kind of stand within the fiscal twenty twenty five range?

And then are you trending at or above the midpoint at this point? And also just wanted to ask about your view longer term just since the business review, which kind of takes stock of what’s happened outside of offshore wind between Carolina’s legislation, New England prices. I know the RNG was extended as well. Just what’s the offset that kind of keep you more towards the midpoint of your long term EPS range at this point? Thank you.

Stephen Ridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dominion Energy: Good morning, Nick. We’ve had a strong start to the year, as you mentioned. We benefited from some tailwinds, both weather and sales. Typically, if you look at our cadence, we’ll use the third quarter call to narrow our guidance range or bias our guidance range towards a top half for instance. And I think we’re going to stick with that because Q3 is our biggest quarter from a sales perspective.

I would just say that if we continue to benefit from those same tailwinds, we are biased to the top half of the range for the year. But we need to continue to see execution on sales and presumably persistence of the weather we’ve accrued year to date. So we feel really, really good about the year, but don’t want to get ahead of ourselves just yet. I want to make sure we get one more quarter of strong results under our belt and then we’ll be in a position on the quarter call to give more definitive guidance on that. With regard to the longer term, I’m going to let Bob take that and I’ll jump in with any other comments.

Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominion Energy: Yes. Nick, great question. And you did mention some tailwinds that we find valuable. But if you think about where we’ve been, we announced a plan, the new plan in March. And we said then and we said again just a few minutes ago that we believe it’s really important to demonstrate consistent execution against our financial targets.

Our investors tell us and we believe ourselves that that kind of consistent performance over time is what is most important. So we’re going to continue to assess our plan. If we think there are opportunities to improve, when we’re confident, when those opportunities meet our criteria of appropriately conservative assumptions, then we’ll incorporate them. But our focus, and I say it often, I said it on the prepared remarks, I’ll say it again now is consistent execution on the plan we presented and we are highly confident in our ability to do that.

Stephen Ridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dominion Energy: And Nick, you mentioned the extension of the 45z credit, which is, of course, positive. I think we’re likely to hew to the words the approach we’ve taken thus far. We think investors have valued the transparency we’ve provided by putting it outside of our base operating earnings. And that gives them an opportunity to independently value that without us lumping it together. So I think most likely you’ll continue to see us take that approach.

We haven’t made a final decision on that, but I think that’s where we’re biasing at this point.

Conference Operator: Our next question comes from Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.

Carly Davenport, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Hey, good morning. Thanks so

Analyst, Goldman Sachs: much for taking my question. Maybe just to start on cVal, just any color on the reason for the PJM delay in terms of the cost update for network upgrades? And then I think the language on the slides was at the earliest September. Just is there any deadline that we should be thinking about in terms of when they have to provide that update to you? Thanks.

Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominion Energy: Yeah. Thanks, Carly. Look, I don’t think it’s news to anyone listening in that PJM’s got a lot going on these days. So I wouldn’t read anything more into it than that. As we said in our prepared remarks, we don’t expect any change that would be anywhere near the magnitude of what we experienced in February.

And there’s no sort of regulatory or statutory deadline for PJM. They just need to get through the work and do the modeling, and that’s what they’re doing right now.

Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you. And then maybe just shifting to the biennial, I guess, any views, on staff recommendation and any indication of what the issues will which issues will be in focus Dominion as we kind of head into company rebuttals in a couple weeks here?

Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominion Energy: Yeah. Well, as we noted in the prepared remarks, the biggest sort of headline number isn’t a dispute, So that won’t take very long to resolve. That’s the capacity expense that changed after we filed the case. So we presented the impacts of what happens with the Shapiro settlement, which was then approved. So that’s not going to be an issue.

The rest is the normal course of things that you would expect in a regulatory proceeding. What’s appropriate ROE? Are certain O and M costs appropriate or not? We have certainty on some of the capital spend, which we do. So I said before we filed the case that I didn’t think there was gonna be anything exotic.

There isn’t anything exotic. So we’ll have the hearing starting next month after we file our rebuttal testimony later this month, and we’ll move through those issues. But nothing unusual.

Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Great. Very clear. Thanks so much.

Conference Operator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Your line is open.

Carly Davenport, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Hey, good morning. This is actually Diana on for Jeremy.

Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominion Energy: Yeah. I was thinking you didn’t sound exactly like Jeremy. So how are you?

Carly Davenport, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Not quite. Doing well. Thanks. Hope you are too. So I was wondering how you think about impacts from the OBB across Dominion?

And then I’ll have a follow-up maybe.

Stephen Ridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dominion Energy: I’ll take that one. We’re we’re quite pleased with where what we’ve come to refer to as OB three, which is a little bit of a Star Wars sounding name. We’re quite pleased with how o b three landed. If you think about when you think about legislators rewriting the tax code, there’s a lot of things that could potentially move against you. And on the whole, I think it’s been quite positive.

The area that we and I think others are very focused on, of course, is eligibility for tax credits. And we’re confident we can preserve all of the credits that we’ve provided in our forecast to investors either through safe harboring or under long standing rules, I think as some of our peers have described, or because they’re simply not impacted. So, instance, the Coastal Virginia offshore wind project is not impacted. Many of our clean energy solar filings are effectively not impacted. When you look at the total tax credits that we’ve provided in the Q4 disclosures, there’s really only about 20% to 25% that sort of require some active mitigation.

And as I mentioned, we expect to be able to achieve that and have plans to do that. And just keep in mind, these are regulated projects. So we actually have a requirement under Virginia state law to build those projects. We’re so very focused on customer affordability. We’re gonna leave no stone unturned to make sure that we take advantage of everything we possibly can to make sure that that that benefit passes through to our customers.

Carly Davenport, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thank you. And, like, as a regards to those those plans to safe harbor, would you pull forward any projects to potentially do that?

Stephen Ridge, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dominion Energy: We wouldn’t we wouldn’t likely pull forward the in service dates. But as normal course goes with safe harboring, we’re generally actively involved in working and spending capital on many of the projects that are through our our projections of 2029. So it doesn’t much of our mitigation doesn’t require anything particularly out of the ordinary for us, and it wouldn’t necessarily include bringing, CODs up.

Carly Davenport, Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

Bob Blue, Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Dominion Energy: Well, doesn’t appear we have other questions in the queue. So this, thanks everyone for taking the time to join our call today. Enjoy the rest of your day.

Conference Operator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect.

The outlook was already grim for new offshore wind leasing activity following President Donald Trump’s executive order in January that introduced a temporary ban on the practice.
Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking.
But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.
Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction.","Offshore wind leasing is effectively dead in the U.S. following a Trump administration order issued this week.

Large swaths of U.S. waters that had been identified by federal agencies as ideal for offshore wind are no longer eligible for such developments under an Interior Department statement released Wednesday.

In the four-sentence statement, the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said the U.S. government is ​“de-designating over 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of America, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.”

The move comes just a day after Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered his staff to stop ​“preferential treatment for wind projects” and falsely called wind energy ​“unreliable.” Analysts say that offshore wind power can be a reliable form of carbon-free energy, especially in New England, where the region’s grid operator has called it critical to grid stability. It also follows the Trump administration’s monthslong assault on the industry, which has included multiple attacks on in-progress projects.

The outlook was already grim for new offshore wind leasing activity following President Donald Trump’s executive order in January that introduced a temporary ban on the practice. Wednesday’s announcement makes that policy more definitive. Wind power advocates say it will erase several years of work from federal agencies and local communities to determine the best possible areas for wind development.

“My read on this is that there is not going to be any leasing for offshore wind in the near future,” said a career employee at the Interior Department, who Canary Media granted anonymity to speak freely for fear of retribution.

Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official ​“wind energy area.” Smaller lease areas are later carved out of these broader expanses.

Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as ​“Central Atlantic 2,” which started back in 2023 and is now dead in the water.

The draft area — or ​“call area” — started out as a thick belt roughly 40 miles wide and reached from the southernmost tip of New Jersey to the northern border of South Carolina, according to maps on BOEM’s website. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and NASA, then provided input on where that initial area might have been problematic. NASA, for example, maintains a launch site on Virginia’s Wallops Island and in 2024 found that nearby wind turbines could interfere with the agency’s instrumentation and radio frequencies.

The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024, according to BOEM’s website, its staff was hosting in-person public meetings from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to Morehead City, North Carolina, to gather input from fishermen, tourism outfitters, and other stakeholders. Under a wind-friendly administration, a final designation and lease sale notice would have likely been released this year or by 2026, based on a timeline posted to BOEM’s website.

But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.

Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction. Last month, Trump’s ​“big, beautiful bill” sent federal tax credits to an early grave, requiring wind developers who want to use the incentives to either start construction by July 2026 or place turbines in service by the end of 2027. The move is particularly devastating for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.

Wednesday’s order halts all work on Central Atlantic 2 and similar areas, like one near Guam, and also revokes completely finalized wind energy areas with strong state support. One example is in the Gulf of Maine, where Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has been a fierce advocate for the emerging renewable sector.

These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee. Still, in the best case, that means developers will have to wait several more years for new lease areas to become available, further slowing down an industry whose projects already take many years to go through permitting and construction.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Gulf-of-Maine_2025-08-01-154352_ukfl.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=1cda8a7c66ceabf7045d0c3bdd618d77,N,,2025-08-01 14:06:15.116021

Currently, only 7 states have regulations to protect outdoor workers from extreme heat, Ebi noted.","On a blistering July afternoon in Fort Pierce, Florida, Younes Motii, MD, outreach director for Oceana Community Health, came across a group of encamped individuals on a sun-scorched sidewalk. They had cracked lips, reddened skin, and dazed expressions, all signs of heat exhaustion. Motii and his team quickly stepped in, escorting patients to a nearby cooling station set up beside a mobile clinic, where large fans whirred under a shaded tent. There, each person received a hydration kit—complete with a chilled water bottle, electrolyte powder, sunscreen, and a mini umbrella, all small yet potentially lifesaving tools crucial to beat the state’s brutal summer heat.

Part of the Climate Health Equity for Community Clinics Program, Oceana Community Health’s street outreach is an example of how clinicians and researchers are working to address heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and other heat-related conditions.

The program—launched by the nonprofit organization Americares and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Climate, Health, and the Global Environment (otherwise known as Harvard Chan C-CHANGE)—provides heat action plans to free and charitable clinics and local community health centers, so they can better support patients most vulnerable to such heat-based health issues. Currently, these clinics and other federally qualified health centers provide free or low-cost primary care to more than 32 million people.

“We’ve heard great examples of how clinics are using the tool—partnering with coffee shops to set up hydration stations, doing in-person wellness checks during extreme heat, and helping patients access cooling centers,” said Nathaniel Matthews-Trigg, Americares director of climate and disaster resilience for the Americas.

Such a program, he noted, is only getting more necessary as climate change causes more frequent and intense heat waves that lead to increases in heat-related illness and death. Last summer was the hottest on record in the Northern Hemisphere, exceeding the 1951-1980 average by 2.25 °F (1.25 °C), and estimates for this summer have included above-average temperatures across much of the US, with the highest chances of extreme heat affecting parts of the East Coast, southern Plains, and the West.

“The degree to which heat or storm surges following hurricanes or flooding events are exceeding their historical boundaries is increasing, and we need to make sure that the patients we care for are set up to be able to understand those risks, anticipate those risks, and prevent those risks from turning into health harms,” said Caleb Dresser, MD, MPH, an emergency medicine physician who leads health care solutions at Harvard Chan C-CHANGE.

Meeting Patients Where They Are

Exposure to high temperatures, especially when combined with humidity, sun exposure, and poor air quality, can pose serious health risks. US Census Bureau data show that 1 in 4 Americans are susceptible.

“Some groups are more vulnerable due to greater heat exposure, underlying health conditions, or limited access to cooling and care,” said Kristie L. Ebi, PhD, MPH, a professor who leads research on climate variability at University of Washington’s Center for Health and the Global Environment. Outdoor workers, people experiencing homelessness, those with disabilities, incarcerated individuals, and those living in low-income communities often lack the resources needed to cope with extreme heat, she explained. This can also include older adults, young children, and those with chronic illnesses.

Of the 170 clinics across the US that have participated in the program so far, each has used its online assessment tool to create customized heat action plans tailored to their patient communities. The tool guides clinic staff through a series of questions to generate specific strategies for protecting patients’ health during extreme heat events. Plans then recommend evidence-based actions—such as alerting patients when to take precautions, assisting them in accessing air conditioning, or partnering with local organizations to conduct home visits.

Given the key role free clinics play in preventive care, program leaders worked closely with clinic staff to bring these plans to life.

“They had a wide range of really good ideas about how to adapt some of the approaches they've used for dealing with things like access to food or access to energy, and adapt some of those same approaches to working with patients and communities that are experiencing threats from wildfire, smoke, and heat,” Dresser said.

Its pilot phase, which began in September 2023, involved a small cohort of 10 clinics and health centers in states with extreme heat: Arizona, Florida, and Louisiana. According to Matthews-Trigg, the Climate Health Equity for Community Clinics Program selected pilot clinics based on nearby racial and ethnic communities experiencing health disparities or socioeconomic challenges, such as unemployment or limited access to health insurance. After these pilot clinics provided guidance and intervention recommendations, 44 more clinics issued 13 action plans last summer. Now, clinics in 30 states ranging from California and Texas to Pennsylvania are using a plan adapted to their local environment.

These clinics also play a crucial role in equitably distributing resources where they are most needed. By centering the community and deeply understanding the populations they serve, these health centers are uniquely positioned to meet patients where they are, explained Julie Varughese, MD, senior vice president of programs and chief medical officer of Americares. However, they are often confronted with the urgent challenges that their unique communities face—particularly when it comes to accessing lifesaving care. In such moments, clinics must adapt quickly to respond to rapidly evolving needs.

For instance, resources are often planned for individuals with access to transportation or who live within walking distance—leaving behind those who do not.

“Oftentimes, free and charitable clinic staff aren’t just health care providers, they’re also social workers and care coordinators,” said Varughese. “That’s why it’s so important that the work we’re doing goes beyond the clinic walls.”

Building Climate Resilience in Clinics

Heat-related communication is rarely included in routine health discussions during clinic visits. In a 2024 study that examined frontline clinics—primary care centers serving low-income and underserved communities—Matthews-Trigg and his coauthors found that 84% of health care professionals and case workers reported that climate change affects patient health, but only 36% discussed its risks with patients, often due to limited time and more pressing concerns.

Generally, because awareness of heat-related risks is low, Ebi said, how that information is communicated to patients is crucial, especially for construction or farm workers—often the hardest hit during extreme heat waves because their jobs require excess time outdoors. A study conducted in Washington State found that outdoor workers who received heat education and awareness of heat-related risks had improved work exertion levels, leading to decreased heat exposure. Currently, only 7 states have regulations to protect outdoor workers from extreme heat, Ebi noted.

In Florida, Motii and his team of primary care physicians make sure to inform all patients about common signs of dehydration, such as confusion, weakness, and dizziness.

“The last thing you usually think about is heat—but heat stroke can play a very detrimental role in some of these patients,” said Motii, adding that heat risks should be communicated well beyond the summer season.

To address climate change throughout the year, program leaders have designed a Climate Resilience for Frontline Clinics Toolkit that features practical resources to improve patient care during extreme weather events such as heat waves, hurricanes, floods, and wildfires. (In 2024, an estimated 125 million US residents were projected to experience unhealthful air quality due to wildfire smoke.) The toolkit includes more than 40 free online resources, available in both English and Spanish, including materials specifically for clinicians and administrators as well as targeted advice for patients with chronic conditions such as asthma, heart disease, and diabetes.

Challenges for Expansion

The program has already surpassed its goal of partnering with 100 free and charitable clinics by 2025. To date, the toolkit has been downloaded more than 20 000 times, and program leaders have reached out to 1000 clinics with goals of collaboration. Their eventual hope is to grant clinics funding to expand their resource offerings and to create flood-specific plans, similar to its heat action plans, for at-risk communities.

The difficulty in expansion, however, is that this program is not one-size-fits-all. Some interventions are low-cost and don’t require much staff capacity, Matthews-Trigg said, but others are more complicated or expensive, such as distribution of air conditioners or fans. This has required organizations to think creatively. A pilot clinic in Lafayette, Louisiana, had struggled to allocate fans to patients in need, for example, until it discovered that the local fire department already had some available for distribution.

Additionally helpful would be for state and local governments to implement policies that empower these clinics to better support patients by offering essential resources. Oregon is the first state to explicitly use Medicaid funds for climate-related expenses, such as providing air conditioners to vulnerable residents, Ebi said.

Motii hopes to one day connect his patients with stable, long-term solutions—beyond hydration kits—and better housing. For now, he refers them to air-conditioned shelters, but even these are frequently over capacity, especially during the summer.

“There really isn't much of a long-term solution that we provide to them yet, but we're hopeful this will turn around—that we can offer something more to our patients in the future,” Motii said.

Another challenge to expanding the program is the limited high-quality research on its implementation and cost-effectiveness within the health system, Dresser noted. Given the lack of substantive research in the climate-change space, more data are needed to help advance policies to support risk reduction for populations being served and increase investment in such programs. Currently, this program is being funded by Johnson & Johnson.

Until then, Americares will continue to help clinics engage in the interventions they’ve seen work.

“With this program, what we're aiming to do is recognize that while we can’t change the circumstances patients may face, we can help prevent some of the impacts tied to their vulnerabilities—whether related to their work, housing, or health,” Varughese said.",https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jama/0/jmn250048fa_1753974874.95688.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=rzvl0d3p1bLBqVffBNhvVomOt3FPqT4KeDfVxlwQrI1NyaUc2A4Zy9AnlwQGOXjITZPFagm6hwsPs~z~uscavCh3PuAoNT5j67oztKkx40-MV-xqk4YAl4CVAady8s4xgY-~erfHOUhilgi9lcr43LesKngFXFZpXF2mKN6t20F6bsrEsnCHerhLb1ZPSESAONMFUXXFTwN85RsZ~5NsnDgp26e6GHeNEhM66FyqeacPeVrsGBBYt5Ps55mLFfg0W3keLhvXy4SgjXssQ5DSIUoVnlo0gcZ8LBaGsplAa03ukGKMn2bMclR65k4Sgin2e3qxgtCXQHc43NRUZS1xvw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,N,,2025-08-01 13:05:13.777226

It was based on an extensive evaluation of the science and of the contributions that American sources contribute to overall climate change.
Another argument is that the regulations are actually more expensive than the costs that climate change would cause.
They would not need to do that if they successfully go through this process and actually revoke the endangerment finding.
Ann Carlson is a environmental law professor at UCLA and faculty director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change & the Environment.","EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced Tuesday that the agency would move to rescind an Obama-era declaration called the “endangerment finding,” which said that greenhouse gases are warming the planet and threatening public health.

Pennsylvania is one of the top emitters of industrial greenhouse gases in the country. The endangerment finding provided the scientific basis for the government to limit emissions from vehicles, power plants, and other industrial sources.

“How big is the endangerment finding?” Zeldin asked on a conservative podcast called Ruthless. “Well, repealing it will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America. So it’s kind of a big deal.”

Zeldin said the endangerment finding is central to what he called “the left’s environmental agenda.”

“This has been referred to as basically driving a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion,” he said.

It’s not religion, according to environmental groups. It’s science.

“The science was very clear when the finding was released in 2009, and since then, there’s been so much more evidence,” said Diane Pataki, chief scientist at the National Wildlife Federation. She said there’s no question that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to climate change.

“It’s now just clear to the naked eye, everyone can see the impacts on human health and feel the impacts on human health.”

The Allegheny Front’s Julie Grant spoke with UCLA environmental law professor Ann Carlson, who is also the faculty director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change & the Environment.

LISTEN to their conversation

Julie Grant: What is the endangerment finding, and how did it come to be?

Ann Carlson: So a group of environmental organizations sued the Environmental Protection Agency many years ago to get them to determine under a federal statute called the Clean Air Act whether greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare when they’re emitted from cars and trucks. That case [Massachusetts v. EPA] went all the way up to the United States Supreme Court.

The United States Supreme Court determined two things. First, that the Clean Air Act covers greenhouse gases. They’re included in the definition of air pollutants. And second, that the administrator actually has to determine whether greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

Now the Trump Administration is saying, “Well, we don’t need to regulate altogether because it turns out greenhouse gases don’t really harm us.

That determination was made, it was actually made by the George W. Bush Environmental Protection Agency, but [the endangerment finding was] not issued until President Obama came into office in 2009. It was based on an extensive evaluation of the science and of the contributions that American sources contribute to overall climate change.

And then EPA issued a bunch of regulations, and that has continued to the present day. Although the Trump administration came in the first round and rescinded those regulations, and issued weaker versions. And then the Biden administration came in and issued stronger regulations. Now the Trump Administration is saying, “Well, we don’t need to regulate altogether because it turns out greenhouse gases don’t really harm us.”

‘Cartoon villainy’: Former regulators say EPA’s planned rollbacks would reverse 50 years of environmental progress

How does the climate crisis impact health?

Julie Grant: So what happens to the rules that have been promulgated over time because of the endangerment finding? Are they using this to kind of throw those out wholesale?

Ann Carlson: That’s exactly right. So basically what they’re saying is if greenhouse gasses don’t endanger public health and welfare, then all the rules that the Biden administration issued, there’s rules for trucks, there’s two separate rules for cars, there’s a rule for rules for power plants, there’s rule rules for oil and gas facilities that leak methane. All of those just essentially would disappear because there’s no legal basis anymore for issuing those rules.

Julie Grant: And what can we tell about what EPA is saying is the legal basis for getting rid of this rule that underpins all these other rules?

Ann Carlson: In my view, there is no legal basis for that kind of ruling, but here’s what the administration is trying to argue –they’re saying a number of things: One is, it turns out climate change really isn’t that damaging, which is ironic given that we just lost 135 or more people in some of the worst floods in Texas history, clearly made worse because of climate change. We lost 30 people in my own hometown of Los Angeles in two separate fires in January. The estimates are that those are going to cost about $164 billion in property damage. Every day on the ground, we’re seeing evidence of climate change. And yet one argument is: turns out climate change isn’t that expensive. That’s one of their arguments.

This argument is just untenable from a legal perspective and from a moral perspective.

Another argument is that the regulations are actually more expensive than the costs that climate change would cause. That is undermined by countless studies that show as much as six times the benefits from mitigating climate change than the cost of what those regulations cost.

And then finally, they’re saying that, “Well, it turns out that the emissions from things like cars and trucks in the United States are so small that they don’t really affect global climate change.” Here’s the problem with that argument: Imagine that every country in the world, including China, India, Brazil, Indonesia, Europe, Japan, all reasoned that way. We all said, “Well, our contributions don’t really matter.” Well, of course, collectively, all of our contributions are what’s causing climate change and making it worse.

So we need to stop emitting across the globe by really 2050 is the goal, but we need get on a trajectory to do so very quickly now. And this argument is just untenable from a legal perspective and from a moral perspective.

Julie Grant: So now that Administrator Zeldin has announced this, what’s the process that they go through to rescind the findings?

Ann Carlson: It’s a comment period, and then the agency actually has to consider the comments and then go through an obscure agency called OIRA, which is an executive branch agency that evaluates all significant proposals and then issues a final rule. And that typically takes it, probably another year.

Julie Grant: And if EPA does wind up repealing the findings, what happens to the regulations that are based on it?

Ann Carlson: I suspect that they will simply say all of those regulations are moot or invalid once the endangerment finding goes away. So that makes it actually a sort of quicker process to get rid of all those rulemakings. And the big thing that it would allow them to do is not replace the rules. They would not need to do that if they successfully go through this process and actually revoke the endangerment finding.

I suspect that they will simply say all of those [climate] regulations are moot or invalid once the endangerment finding goes away.

Julie Grant: For those who oppose this, what kind of recourse do they have?

Ann Carlson: So, there will be a big legal fight, and we will see undoubtedly legal challenges that will very likely end up in the United States Supreme Court. It may be that the aim here of the Trump administration is to try to get the much more conservative Supreme Court to overturn Massachusetts versus EPA.

Julie Grant: That’s the initial case where the Supreme Court ruled that the Clean Air Act covers greenhouse gases. And what happens if that’s overturned?

Ann Carlson: Then basically I think the argument would be the Clean Air Act doesn’t actually cover greenhouse gases and the administrator doesn’t have to make an endangerment finding. Or alternatively, the administrator was absolutely correct and we’re going to defer to his science and his economics, and he’s right that he doesn’t need to regulate greenhouse gases.

Julie Grant: And if all this does come to pass, what do you think we might see in terms of efforts to regulate pollution that contributes to climate change?

Ann Carlson: If the federal government is saying the Clean Air Act really isn’t useful for regulating greenhouse gases from vehicles, then it might be the case that states can come in and regulate. Right now, California is the leader in regulating, and Congress has told California through a bill that it passed a couple of weeks ago that it cannot regulate. It can’t issue some of the policies that it was about to issue to regulate pollutants from cars and trucks. Maybe they can if the endangerment finding goes away.

Since Pennsylvania is one of the nation’s largest contributors of carbon dioxide emissions, The Allegheny Front reached out to Governor Shapiro’s office to find out what the state would do if the EPA stops regulating industries for climate emissions. There’s been no response so far. The environmental non-profit PennFuture said it would advocate for new state policy and additional DEP funding to fill in the gap, although they are still looking into specifics.

The latest Export Development Guarantee (EDG), arranged by Citi and backed 80% by UK Export Finance (UKEF), marks the third such facility Ford has received since 2020. With this latest round, total UK government-guaranteed support to Ford now approaches £2.4 billion.

The new funding will play a key role in scaling Ford’s EV production, supporting research and development, and boosting UK exports in the rapidly evolving global automotive market.

Ford employs more than 5,500 people across the UK and is central to the company’s global electrification plans. Its state-of-the-art R&D facility in Dunton, Essex—the UK’s largest automotive research centre—continues to drive advances in smart, connected, and electric vehicle technologies.

In recent years, Ford has made substantial investments to electrify its operations. A £380 million capital injection has transformed its Halewood plant in Merseyside into a cutting-edge facility producing electric power units, replacing traditional transmission manufacturing. The plant will supply next-generation models including the all-electric Ford Transit and Puma.

A further £70 million has been allocated to enhance Ford’s testing and development capabilities in Essex, ensuring the company remains at the forefront of automotive innovation.

Lisa Brankin, Chair of Ford Britain, said: “Recent investments in the UK have proved crucial to our European operations and have expanded our export capability. This new UKEF facility will play an important role in supporting our UK exporting footprint, especially amid continued trade uncertainty and the gap between EV targets and consumer demand.”

The £1 billion loan builds on previous funding rounds:

• June 2022: £750 million EDG with a £600 million UKEF guarantee to scale electric power unit production.

• June 2020: £625 million EDG, with £500 million guaranteed, supporting the development of Ford’s global R&D hub in Essex and wider EV technology programmes.

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: “We’re proud of our historic auto sector, and of global companies like Ford that continue to innovate and invest here. I’m delighted that UKEF is backing Ford in supporting the company’s ambitions for growth.”

The government’s support for Ford is part of a wider £2.5 billion commitment to the UK’s green transport transition, including schemes such as the Electric Vehicle Grant, Advanced Manufacturing Plan, and the Modern Industrial Strategy. These initiatives aim to position the UK as a world leader in zero-emission mobility, while creating jobs and delivering long-term growth.

Transport and manufacturing leaders hope the Ford investment will catalyse further private-sector activity and secure the UK’s role in the future of mobility.

Ford UK is also poised to benefit from a landmark UK–US trade deal that reduces export tariffs on vehicles from 27.5% to just 10%. The agreement is forecast to save British car manufacturers hundreds of millions annually and strengthen job security across the automotive supply chain.

With the combined weight of government support, growing global demand for EVs, and improved market access, Ford UK is now in a stronger position than ever to lead Britain’s automotive sector into its next electric chapter.",https://evpowered.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Essex-Engine-Plant.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 19:01:44.733387

Despite the Sept. 30 sunset of the U.S. federal $7,500 tax credit for BEV consumers and an expected slowdown in BEV demand, GM is keeping its foot on the accelerator when it comes to its all-electric plans.

In an Instagram post, GM displays an image of the front fascia and rear brake lights of the next-generation Bolt with the caption: “You asked, we listened. The #ChevyBolt is back and better than ever.”

The current Bolt (pictured below), even without the tax credit, will likely be the least expensive BEV on the market with a range around 300 miles (483 km). The Nissan Leaf is priced roughly the same or slightly lower but has only half the range of the Bolt. The new Nissan Leaf, with a comparable range, is expected to have a starting price of close to $35,000.

GM is keen to conquest brands whose pricing is being adversely affected by tariffs, as well as Tesla, which has been experiencing a sales decline due to boycotts and brand rejection over CEO Elon Musk’s political activity.

For the Cadillac brand, for example, about 80% of its BEV buyers are new to the brand, with 10% coming from Tesla, the company said during a recent brand briefing.

A Better Bolt

Chevy ended the original Bolt with the 2023 model. The 2027 Bolt, which will hit dealerships in the second quarter of 2026, is built on GM’s Ultium platform and will have a native NACS port, making it compatible with Tesla Superchargers without needing an adapter.

The first-gen Bolt model had a 200-hp electric motor, generating 266 lb.-ft. of torque (361 Nm). The 2027 Bolt is expected to improve on the horsepower figure, likely using a motor from the front-wheel-drive Equinox EV. This motor produces 213 hp and 236 lb.-ft of torque (320 Nm). While base models are likely to remain FWD, the next-generation Bolt is expected to also offer all-wheel drive.

The previous Bolt used a 65-kWh battery, providing an EPA-estimated range of 247 miles (398 km). The 2027 Bolt is expected to have an improved battery pack and achieve a driving range of nearly 300 miles. It's also expected to have a significantly faster charging rate than the previous Bolt's 54 kW maximum speed, potentially reaching 150 kW or more to optimize fast-charging stations.

The exterior design of the ’27 model will resemble the Bolt EUV that was a popular variant of the first-gen Bolt.

GM previously told WardsAuto that the Bolt will use its latest battery tech and software similar to what the automaker has deployed on Chevrolet Equinox EV, Blazer EV and Cadillac Lyriq. For the new Bolt, GM is utilizing lower-cost lithium-iron phosphate chemistry cells vs. the first-gen model’s nickel-manganese-cobalt cells.

Pricing hasn't been released. But based on interviews with Chevy executives in recent months, a starting price of below $30,000 is expected. Before the federal tax credit was suspended GM hoped to price it beginning near $20,000. Even at a price around $28,000, though, it is well below the $49,000+ average new-vehicle transaction price prevailing today, according to Cox Automotive.

GM President Mark Reuss told WardsAuto last fall that the new Bolt would be close to the price of the old one, and that the new battery technology allows GM to not lose money on each one sold. “It’s going to be profitable for us,” said Reuss, adding that the automaker is determined to offer affordable vehicles at a profit. The Chevy Trax, Buick Encore and Buick Envista, three of the company’s lowest-priced vehicles, are all profitable, Reuss said. New tariffs on vehicles built in South Korea, however, have probably changed that.

The debate over how to address climate change can be political—but the facts of climate change, and the deliberate dismantling of the systems built to understand and mitigate it, are not.","In a sweeping overhaul of federal environmental policy, the Trump administration has embarked on an unprecedented campaign to dismantle both the scientific and legal infrastructure underpinning U.S. climate action. In back-to-back announcements, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has both shuttered its central scientific research division and proposed repealing the 2009 Endangerment Finding—a foundational determination that enabled the government to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

Critics are calling it the most consequential environmental rollback in modern American history.

The first blow came with the closure of the EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD), long considered the agency’s scientific heart. This division has overseen research on a vast range of public health and environmental threats—forever chemicals, wildfire smoke, pesticides, lead contamination, smog, and more. It also funded independent research across the country and played a key role in translating science into policy.

In place of the ORD, the EPA announced the creation of a new ""Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions,"" though it has offered no clear plan for how it will replicate the depth or rigor of the dissolved office.

“Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA has taken a close look at our operations to ensure the agency is better equipped than ever to deliver on our core mission,” said Administrator Lee Zeldin. “This reduction in force will ensure we can better fulfill that mission while being responsible stewards of your hard-earned tax dollars.”

The downsizing includes a 23% workforce reduction—more than 3,500 positions cut—and slashes nearly $750 million from the agency’s budget.

“This is a travesty,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), ranking member of the House Science Committee. “The Trump Administration is firing hardworking scientists while employing political appointees whose job it is to lie incessantly to Congress and to the American people.”

The second—and arguably more transformative—move came when Zeldin announced that the EPA would rescind the Endangerment Finding, first issued in 2009 under the Obama administration. The finding concluded that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, giving the EPA the legal authority to regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Its repeal would invalidate all federal greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles, including the Biden administration’s electric vehicle mandate.

“Today we propose the largest deregulatory action in U.S. history,” Zeldin declared during an event in Indianapolis. “By ending the unlawful regulatory overreach tied to the Endangerment Finding, we will restore consumer choice, reduce costs, and unleash American innovation.”

According to the EPA, the repeal is projected to save $54 billion annually, mostly through the elimination of emissions compliance costs. Supporters claim it will lower prices on vehicles, shipping, and consumer goods.

Environmental groups and climate experts see these two actions—taken in tandem—as part of a broader strategy: erase the science, then eliminate the rules.

“This isn’t just about policy,” said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “It’s about erasing the scientific basis for regulating pollution. If the science disappears, the regulations can’t stand.”

Already, the administration has removed the website for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which publishes the legally mandated National Climate Assessment—a key public resource used by lawmakers, city planners, researchers, and educators to understand the effects of climate change. The next assessment, due by 2027, is now in limbo after research teams were disbanded and contracts canceled.

The Fifth National Climate Assessment, released in late 2023, warned that “climate change is already affecting every region of the United States,” highlighting threats ranging from megafires and sea-level rise to extreme heat and worsening air quality. But access to that information has now been restricted.

And this comes amid record-setting environmental crises—from wildfires choking entire regions to deadly heatwaves and algal blooms contaminating drinking water. For scientists and public health advocates, the timing of these rollbacks couldn’t be worse.

Beyond climate science, the EPA has also dismantled two internal equity offices: the Office of Environmental Justice and the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. These departments were tasked with addressing disproportionate pollution burdens on low-income and minority communities. Their closure represents another retreat from science-informed policy and a blow to vulnerable populations already facing the brunt of environmental degradation. These departments helped with critical situations, like in Flint.

“This will not only cripple EPA’s ability to do its own research, but also to apply the research of other scientists,” warned Kyla Bennett, science policy director for Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility (PEER). “These short-sighted cuts will ultimately affect every American.”

The Trump administration has long prioritized deregulation, with over 100 environmental rules weakened or repealed in its first term alone. But this new phase—eliminating the institutional, scientific, and legal capacities of the EPA—marks a turning point.

Many warn that the U.S. is not just stepping back from climate leadership, but actively dismantling the ability to govern environmental risk at all.

As Zeldin framed it, “Liberation Day from climate imperialism” has arrived. But for many Americans facing the realities of a warming planet, this ""liberation"" feels more like abandonment.

This Isn’t About Partisan Politics—It’s About Reality

It’s important to understand: this isn’t a story about a “leftist agenda” or political spin.

These are real, measurable developments happening in real time—federal research offices shuttered, public datasets removed, legal frameworks erased, and regulations undone. The consequences affect everyone, regardless of political affiliation. Whether it’s toxic air, unsafe drinking water, or rising insurance premiums due to extreme weather, environmental degradation does not discriminate.

In short, the US does not have an energy security problem.
It has clawed back billions of US dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.
Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined.
Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China.","During the cold war, the US and Soviet Union were locked in a desperate race to develop cutting‑edge technologies like long-range missiles and satellites. Fast forward to today and the frontiers of global technology have pivoted to AI and next‑generation energy.

In one domain, AI, the US has far outpaced any other nation – though China looks to be closing the gap. In the other, energy, it has just tied its shoelaces together. The reason isn’t technology, economics or, despite the government’s official line, even national security. Rather, it is politics.

Since returning to the White House in January, Donald Trump has handed out huge wins to the coal and oil and gas industries. This is no great surprise. Trump has long been supportive of the US fossil fuel industry and, since his reelection, has appointed several former industry lobbyists to top political positions.

According to the Trump administration, national security requires gutting support for renewable energy while performing political CPR on the dying coal industry.

The reality is that, since 2019, the US has produced more oil, gas and coal annually than Americans want to use, with the rest exported and sold overseas. It is currently one of the most prolific exporters of fossil fuels in the world.

In short, the US does not have an energy security problem. It does, however, have an energy cost problem combined with a growing climate change crisis. These issues will only be made worse by Trump’s enthusiasm for fossil fuels.

Over the past six months, the Trump administration has upended half a decade of green industrial policy. It has clawed back billions of US dollars in tax credits and grants that were supercharging American energy innovation.

Meanwhile, China has roared forward. Beijing has doubled down on wind, solar and next‑generation batteries, installing more wind and solar power in 2024 than the rest of the world combined. To China’s delight, the US has simply stopped competing to be the world’s clean energy powerhouse.

Roughly one-in-five lithium‑ion batteries, a key component in clean energy products, are made in China. Many of the newest high‑tech batteries are also being developed and patented there. While Trump repeats the tired mantra of “drill, baby, drill”, China is building factories, cornering the market for critical minerals such as lithium and nickel, and locking in export partners.

At the same time, household energy spending in the US is expected to increase by US$170 (£126) each year between now and 2035 as a result of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The bill, which includes sweeping changes to taxes, social security and more, will raise energy costs mainly because it strips away support for cheap and abundant renewables like wind and solar.

Household energy costs could go up even more as Trump threatens to make large‑scale clean energy development much more onerous by putting up bureaucratic hurdles. The administration recently issued a directive requiring the secretary of the interior to approve even routine activities for wind and solar projects connected to federal lands.

Meanwhile, climate change is hitting American communities harder with each passing year. As recent flooding in Texas and urban fires in California and Hawaii have shown, fewer Americans still have the luxury of ignoring climate change.

As the cost of these disasters mount – US$183 billion in 2024 – the grifting of the oil and gas industry will become an increasingly bitter pill for the nation to swallow.

China’s foresight

China, with its authoritarian government, is less susceptible to the petroleum-obsessed dogma fueling the Republican party. It does not have prominent leaders like US politician Marjorie Taylor Greene, who previously warned that Democrats are trying to “emasculate the way we drive” by advocating for electric vehicles. Rather, China’s leaders are seeing green – not in the environmental sense, but in a monetary one.

It is generally cheaper nowadays to build and operate renewable energy facilities than gas or coal power stations. According to a June 2025 report by Lazard, an asset management company, electricity from new large-scale solar farms costs up to US$78 per megawatt hour – and often much less. The same electricity from a newly built natural gas plants, by comparison, can cost as much as US$107 per megawatt hour.

Across the world, utilities are embracing clean energy, choosing lower costs for their customers while reducing pollution. China saw the writing on the wall decades ago, and its early investments are bearing a rich harvest. It now produces more than half of the world’s electric vehicles and the vast majority of its solar panels.

The US can still compete at the leading edge of the energy sector. American companies are developing innovative new approaches to geothermal, battery recycling and many other energy technologies.

But in the battle to become the world’s 21st-century energy manufacturing powerhouse, the US seems to have walked off the playing field.

In Trump’s telling, the US may have simply exited one race and reentered another. But the fossil fuel industry – financially, environmentally and ethically – is obviously a dead end.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/683533/original/file-20250801-56-we4bga.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C160%2C1920%2C960&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-08-01 12:07:57.883395

I think this moment we’re in – it is a different moment.
All of those challenges absolutely present a different moment and will result in a different response from state leaders.
Five years after we passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act – a big, bold promise of action – we’re not on track.
No, I think we have to be really creative as an industry, and state leaders have to be creative too.","This week’s conversation is with Heather O’Neill, CEO of renewables advocacy group Advanced Energy United. I wanted to chat with O’Neill in light of the recent effective repeal of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean electricity tax credits and the action at the Interior Department clamping down on development. I’m quite glad she was game to talk hot topics, including the future of wind energy and whether we’ll see blue states step into the vacuum left by the federal government.

The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.

During Trump 1.0 we saw blue states really step into the climate role in light of the federal government. Do you see anything similar taking place now?

I think this moment we’re in – it is a different moment.

How are we handling load growth? How are we making sure consumers are not paying for expensive stranded assets? Thinking about energy affordability? All of those challenges absolutely present a different moment and will result in a different response from state leaders.

But that’s where some of the changes our industry has gone through mean we’re able to meet that moment and provide solutions to those challenges. I think we need aggressive action from state leaders and I think we’ll see that from them, because of the challenges in front of them.

What does that look like?

Every state is different. Take Virginia for example. Five years after we passed the Virginia Clean Economy Act – a big, bold promise of action – we’re not on track. So what are the things we need to do to keep the foot on the accelerator there? This last legislative session we passed the virtual power plant legislation that’ll help tremendously in terms of grid flexibility. We made a big push around siting and permitting reform, and we didn’t quite get it over the finish line but that’s the kind of thing where we made a good foundation.

Or Texas. There’s so much advanced energy powering Texas right now. You had catastrophic grid failure in Hurricane Uri and look at what they’ve been able to build out in response to that: wind, solar, and in the last few years, battery storage, and they just passed the energy waste reduction [bill].

We need to build things and make it easier to build – siting and permitting reform – but it’s also states depending on their environment looking at and engaging with their regional transmission organization.

You saw that last week, a robust set of governors across the PJM region called on them to improve their interconnection queue. It’s about pushing and finding reforms at the market level, to get these assets online and get on the grid deployed.

I think the point about forward momentum, I definitely see what you’re saying there about the need for action. Do you see state primacy laws or pre-emption laws? Like what Michigan, New York, and California have done…

I’m not a siting expert, but the reform packages that work the best include engagement from communities in meaningful ways. But they also make sure you’re not having a vocal minority drowning out the benefits and dragging out the process forever. There are timelines and certainty attached to it while still having meaningful local engagement.

Our industry absolutely has to continue to lean into more local engagement and community engagement around the benefits of a project and what they can deliver for a community. I also think there’s a fair amount of making sure the state is creating that pathway, providing that certainty, so we can actually move forward to build out these projects.

From the federal government’s perspective, they’re cracking down on wind and solar projects while changing the tax credits. Do you see states presenting their own incentives for renewables in lieu of federal incentives? I’ve wondered if that’ll happen given inflation and affordability concerns.

No, I think we have to be really creative as an industry, and state leaders have to be creative too. If I’m a governor, affordability concerns were already front and center for me, and now given what just happened, they’re grappling with incredibly tight state budgets that are about to get tighter, including health care. They’re going to see state budgets hit really hard. And there’s energy impacts – we’re cutting off supply, so we’re going to see prices go up.

This is where governors and state leaders can act but I think in this context of tight state budgets I don’t think we can expect to see states replacing incentive packages.

It’ll be: how do we take advantage of all the flexible tools that we have to help shape and reduce demand in meaningful ways that’ll save consumers money, as well as push on building out projects and getting existing juice out of the transmission system we have today.

Is there a future for wind in the United States?

It is an incredibly challenging environment – no question – for all of our technologies, wind included. I don’t want to sugar-coat that at all.

But I look at the whole picture, and I include wind in this: the technologies have improved dramatically in the past couple of decades and the costs have come down. When you look around at what resources are around to deploy, it’s advanced energy. We’re seeing it continue to grow. There’ll be headwinds, and it’ll be more expensive for all of us. But I look at what our industry and our technologies are able to offer and deliver, and I am confident we’ll continue to see growth.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTQxNjQwNy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4MDQyNDM0OH0.GWLsiJ_R0N747YP4307FVuyediXiQ3rJQmluC7QUqLE/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=40%2C0%2C40%2C0,N,,2025-08-01 14:05:56.131646

Here's how that could play out in NC.,"Martha Quillin, Robert Willett",,,,,https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article311542549.html,"Why does the EPA want to drop greenhouse gas rules?
How would deregulation of greenhouse gases affect NC?
Together, DEQ says those two sectors account for more than 97% of greenhouse gases emitted across the state.
It also shows that forestland in the state offset greenhouse gas emissions more than had been expected.
Even if the EPA stops regulating carbon emissions from fossil-fuel powered plants, he said, cleaner sources of energy are a better investment.","If the Environmental Protection Agency rescinds its regulations on greenhouse gas emissions — as the agency proposed this week — North Carolina could expect to see more fossil-fuel burning power plants, a pair of climate experts say.

President Donald Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, announced Wednesday the agency wants to rescind a 2009 declaration that greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and therefore pose a threat to public health and welfare.

The declaration is the basis for the EPA’s carbon-emissions standards under the Clean Air Act.

Why does the EPA want to drop greenhouse gas rules?

The EPA says the regulations and the Biden administration’s push toward electric vehicles have cost more than $1 trillion, though the agency didn’t break down the costs. Removing the regulations, the agency said, would save Americans $54 billion each year, though it didn’t itemize those savings.

The EPA cited a U.S. Department of Energy report issued this month titled, “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,” whose five authors describe themselves as skeptics of mainstream climate-change science. The writers agree that the climate has warmed, but they say it’s not clear that human activity has been the main cause, that the warming is all bad or that it constitutes a dire situation that requires costly remedies.

The team is made up of John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science and director of the Earth System Science Center at the University of Alabama in Huntsville; Roy Spencer, a meteorologist and climate scientist at UA Huntsville; Judith Curry, a climatologist, meteorologist and former chair of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology; Steven Koonin, a theoretical physicist at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution; ; and Ross McKitrick, an economics professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.

The majority of climate scientists believe that warming temperatures across the globe are largely the result of humans’ burning of fossil fuels, which emit gases that accumulate in the atmosphere and trap heat around the planet.

That heat has contributed to sea-level rise and scientists say it helps account for changes in global rainfall patterns and severe weather events such as droughts, which contribute to fires, and hurricanes and tropical storms, which bring flooding. North Carolina has had it share of all those in the past 20 years.

How would deregulation of greenhouse gases affect NC?

The N.C. Department of Environmental Quality says the two largest sources of greenhouse gases in the state are gas- and diesel-burning cars and trucks traveling the highways, and power plants.

Together, DEQ says those two sectors account for more than 97% of greenhouse gases emitted across the state.

DEQ’s most recent inventory of greenhouse gases, released in January 2024, shows the state achieved a larger percentage reduction in gross greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 to 2020 than the U.S. as a whole, dropping 28% compared to a national drop of 19%.

It also shows that forestland in the state offset greenhouse gas emissions more than had been expected.

Drew Shindell, Nicholas Professor of Earth Science at Duke University’s Nicholas School of the Environment, said even if the EPA stops regulating greenhouse gas emissions on cars and trucks, those vehicles emit other pollutants still governed by the Clean Air Act.

The Trump administration is eliminating the federal tax credit of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and $4,000 for used EV’s after Sept. 30, 2025, and is pausing Biden-era funding for EV charging infrastructure. Shindell said those actions would be more likely to discourage North Carolinians from buying electric vehicles than the EPA dropping its regulations.

But dropping the rules could have a significant impact on the state’s efforts to move to cleaner power generation, Shindell said.

“I see us kind of failing to transition as rapidly to renewables,” he said. Solar is the least expensive source of power and has been growing in North Carolina with homeowners investing as a way to cut their Duke Energy bills, Shindell said. But Duke Energy itself remains most interested in building gas-powered and nuclear plants to satisfy North Carolina’s growing energy needs.

If the EPA abandons carbon-emission regulations, Shindell said, the monopoly would have little incentive to switch to solar or onshore wind.

“If we build new fossil-fuel-burning plants now, in the 2020s and 2030s, and the lifespan of those is many decades, we’ll still be running these things 50 years from now.”

Wlll Scott, Southeast Climate & Clean Energy Director for the Environmental Defense Fund, based in Raleigh, said he hopes that at some point the lower cost of solar power, the speed at which solar installations can be built and their cleaner operation will become attractive enough that Duke Energy will switch over.

Even if the EPA stops regulating carbon emissions from fossil-fuel powered plants, he said, cleaner sources of energy are a better investment.

“We just need to let economics, not ideology, dictate what is the best deal for people who pay power bills across the state,” he said.

The EPA is accepting public comment on the rules proposal though its website.

The partnership aims to allow sites to upgrade their EV infrastructure at scale with no upfront costs.

Redaptive recently announced a $650-million credit facility from CDPQ, a global investment group, and Nuveen, the investment manager of TIAA, to expand its EaaS platform and increase its capabilities to fund projects with companies such as IUC, which has a deep inventory of charger deployment contracts that will leverage the funding.

The Kraft campaign did not respond to requests for comment regarding its position on addressing or funding climate issues in response to federal shifts.","During Boston’s last mayoral election four years ago, Michelle Wu was hailed as a climate leader, but she wasn’t the only candidate staking a position on how the city should better serve its residents while building environmental justice initiatives aimed at addressing disparities in access and impact.

All five of the main candidates who ran in the preliminary election had an explanation of their policy positions around climate and environmental justice.

This year? Not so much.

On her campaign website in this year’s race, Wu devotes a paragraph to some of the city´s climate work during her first term but has no webpage dedicated to explaining her position as a candidate.

Domingos DaRosa, a community activist and Dorchester resident running to unseat Wu, mentions “green space and environmental justice” in a list of key priorities.

But otherwise, in official campaign webpages, the topic is generally unmentioned.

For Hessann Farooqi, executive director at the Boston Climate Action Network, that limited conversation leaves gaps that need to be filled for voters looking to inform themselves about the various positions of the candidates.

“I don’t think it’s been covered enough in this campaign so far, except for on the narrow issue of bike lanes, which have been a big source of discussion — which certainly have a climate component to them — but overall, we haven’t seen a tremendous amount of coverage of this,” Farooqi said.

Though Farooqi said he’d like to hear more from candidates about their views and policies on climate and the environment, voters at large may not share that priority. In a July poll from Suffolk University and the Boston Globe, of the 500 respondents, 10 listed climate change and the environment as their top priority in this year’s race.

But, in that arena, Wu may still hold sway. Of those 10 respondents, the bulk of them said they were leaning toward Wu, of the four candidates, as their first choice in the 2025 election.

The Banner reached out to all four mayoral candidates to get a better sense of their climate plans and priorities. The campaign of Bob Cappucci did not respond to a request for comment.

Wu: Building off an existing record

While the topic hasn’t been widely broadcast in this year’s election, Farooqi pointed to the personal histories working in the space from the candidates, especially the two leading ones: Wu and Kraft.

In the Suffolk University and Boston Globe poll, almost 90% of respondents listed Wu or her opponent Josh Kraft as their top choice; about 60% of respondents overall cited Wu as their top choice, with a 30-percentage-point lead over Kraft.

For Farooqi, Wu’s growing track record in the climate space is an important consideration.

In her first term is as mayor, Wu took steps to restructure the city government to better address climate issues: creating an Office of Green Infrastructure and an Office of Climate Resilience, as well as retooling the head of the city’s Environment, Energy and Open Space Cabinet to a “chief climate officer” position, tasked with also setting up a climate cabinet to help steer city government.

The administration has also divested the city from fossil fuels, launched a regional agreement that will train 1,200 Boston residents and place them in green jobs, and expanded the fare-free bus pilot program to include the MBTA’s 23 and 29 routes. The fare-free pilot on the Route 28 bus began in August 2021, before Wu took office.

That list of achievements is one that the Wu campaign has hung its hat on. In July, Wu’s campaign held a press conference highlighting the climate initiatives she has pursued over the past four years; the event also featured an endorsement of her bid for reelection by Sen. Ed Markey, a longtime climate advocate in Congress.

And in response to a Banner request for comment, a spokesperson for the Wu campaign shared a bullet list with nine climate achievements and a list of climate-focused campaign promises from the 2021 election that Wu has taken steps on.

For Farooqi, Wu’s track record is hefty, and one that leaves the field “unbalanced.”

“It’s a bit of an unfair comparison, because one of these people is actually doing a whole lot of things on climate, the other one has done nothing on climate and hasn’t really said much on it either,” Farooqi said.

Kraft: ‘Touching nearly every aspect of policymaking’

While Kraft’s campaign site has no specific material focused on climate and the environment, in a statement to the Banner, the campaign said Kraft “views the fight against climate change and resulting threats to our environment as something that touches nearly every aspect of policymaking.”

A spokesperson also shared a list of policy ideas that the campaign said Kraft is exploring.

That list included siting more electric vehicle charging infrastructure in parking lots through partnerships with commercial businesses, which the campaign said would do better to increase accessibility and availability of charging.

And the campaign said Kraft is exploring steps the city can take to improve coastal resilience, including close coordination with regional partners and academic institutions to “ensure that we are using every lever we can to protect and safeguard our coastal communities.”

The Kraft campaign did not reply to a request for clarification regarding how Kraft’s plan would differ from steps taken by the Wu administration since she assumed office in 2021, or plans assembled by previous mayoral administrations, like the Climate Ready Boston initiative, launched in 2016, which drafted coastal resilience plans for the city’s 47-mile coastline.

And Kraft’s campaign said there is a need for increased and more equitable access to green space across the city, alleging that public parks in a number of the city’s Black and brown communities have not been maintained at the same level as other green spaces across the city.

As an example, he pointed to the city’s plans to renovate White Stadium, which include the removal of 145 mature trees.

“The recent removal of hundreds of trees in Franklin Park near White Stadium is a perfect example of this. Climate resilience must be woven into nearly every aspect of policy decisions, particularly at the local level where small changes can have a big impact,” the campaign said in a statement.

DaRosa: Focus on equity and education

The ongoing battle over White Stadium and the loss of over 100 mature trees was a point with which DaRosa, one of the other candidates, also raised concerns.

“Those trees cannot be replaced in my generation or my kids’ generation,” DaRosa said. “Those trees, some of them go back a couple of 100 years, and that’s a real thing.”

The Wu campaign pointed to city plans that would plant more than 500 trees in the space over the next decade. And the city has said that most of the removed trees are invasive species that were slated to be removed anyway following the guidance of a 2022 Franklin Park Action Plan.

That equity focus is an element that DaRosa said would guide his environmental policy, if elected. If elected, he said that he would lead a citywide audit on Boston’s climate and environmental policies to understand where things stand in the city now and how resources can better be used.

“With anything I do, I’ll always start off with an audit to make sure that we have an idea of what is and what isn’t, to make sure that we’re addressing it, equitably and efficiently with the funding that we do have,” DaRosa said.

That effort would be paired with education through municipal efforts to make sure residents understand what programs exist and how to access them.

And his educational push would extend to efforts in Boston Public Schools as well. DaRosa said he’d like to see forestry and arborist training included at Madison Park Technical Vocational High School.

“That’s something that I would bring in to make sure that we educate our next generation on what it is and why it is important to continue to support Mother Nature,” he said.

The city currently runs its PowerCorpsBOS program, a workforce development program for young people aged 18 through 22 years old that trains in skills around urban forestry, green building operations and urban greening.

DaRosa said that the program, which began in 2022 under the Wu administration, is similar to his vision, but he’d like to see that sort of education available for even younger residents, like those in high school.

Climate leadership in the age of Trump

Despite relatively limited public communication about climate priorities, now may be an increasingly important time for city leadership when it comes to green issues. Since November, as advocates stared down anticipated decreases in federal funding and support for climate efforts under a reelected President Donald Trump, municipal and state efforts are all the more important, they said.

Funding, perhaps, will be one of the large concerns with reduced federal support. Over the past four years, the city has relied on federal grants to support efforts like transitioning part of Boston Public School’s bus fleet from diesel to electric school buses, or to take steps to try to close gaps in the city’s tree canopy.

Its fare-free bus route pilots were funded through COVID-19-era American Rescue Plan Act funds.

“We can’t count on the same kinds of federal investments that we’ve seen in the last federal administration anymore,” Farooqi said. “It is all the more reason that cities and states need to step up their commitments in funding the kinds of climate infrastructure that we really need to see.”

DaRosa said he views reduced federal support as a moment to better balance the books on climate efforts.

“It seems like the more we give, the less is being done,” he said. “We have to do an audit on how we go about using the funding that we do have; we can’t just be spending money because we have it.”

To close potential gaps in funding, DaRosa suggested an additional fee or tax on tourists coming into downtown Boston.

“Folks come in and use city services within that downtown area, and we’re not getting anything compensated to help offset the cost of putting on these, you know, these events,” he said.

The Wu campaign said that it was grateful for the federal funds that have been used to advance various city projects and lay the foundations for their operations. While the Trump administration is forcing tough choices, the campaign said, a second Wu administration would remain committed to preparing Boston to deal with the threats raised by climate change and seek new partners to fund the existing programs.

The Kraft campaign did not respond to requests for comment regarding its position on addressing or funding climate issues in response to federal shifts.

As the race progresses, Farooqi said it will be important for whichever candidate ultimately wins in September’s preliminary election and November’s general election to determine how to address widening gaps in federal climate policy, such as Trump’s so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which made significant cuts to the Inflation Reduction Act and its environmental measures, as well as steps from the EPA to shut down its research arm and overturn a 2009 finding that has allowed it to take action to rein in climate change.

“We have to keep doing as much as we possibly can and then some to make up the gap to the best of our ability that the federal government is creating,” Farooqi said.",https://baystatebanner.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-Banner_web_icon-copy-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-01 14:05:21.523346

Leading the group is state Senator Jerry McNerney of Stockton.

McNerney said details of the proposal are being negotiated, which could include relaxed emissions if prices rise to a certain level or if fuel storage drops too low.

McNerney's emergency plan follows the announced departure and closure of several state refineries, leaving a tight supply and potential for spikes if one of the refineries left, suddenly goes off-line.

Ethan Elkind, director of the UC Berkeley Center for Law, Energy, and the Environment, observes that the legislation is another illustration of how “California's environmental priorities are now taking a backseat to its affordability crisis when it comes to gas.”

""I think it's such a reflection of how much legislators are feeling this pressure to go to their constituents and say, 'Look, we're trying to reduce prices,' "" Elkind said.

PERMITTING REFORM

On July 1, updated National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) procedures were announced by federal agencies, reflecting recent congressional reforms and court rulings that will simplify permitting of a wide range of co-op projects.

To build or upgrade generation, transmission and distribution systems, co-ops are required to obtain permits from federal agencies under NEPA. Reviews under NEPA frequently take years to complete, and lawsuits can further delay approvals.

“The announcements deliver what we’ve been requesting for years – simplified, streamlined agency procedures that will allow us to more quickly get projects reviewed and approved,” National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) CEO Jim Matheson says. “This change will benefit all 900 electric cooperatives and will help streamline many co-op projects from Rural Utilities Service loan applications, building new generation, expanding new distribution infrastructure and more.”

“It’s a step in the right direction,” says Matt Hanson, CEO of McKenzie Electric Cooperative in Watford City.

Hanson says his cooperative builds six months to a year into planning timelines for required federal permitting. Even if the “red tape” burden is reduced, a workforce is still required to move projects through the permitting process, he cautions.

“While this is a way to streamline things, we also have to be aware it takes people, having staff at those agencies, to implement,” Hanson says.

The NEPA changes will take time to play out as agencies work on implementation, but the reforms will help expedite infrastructure development and cut project costs for cooperatives, NRECA says.

EPA RULES

In June, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed repealing the power sector greenhouse gas and mercury emissions rules which threaten grid reliability and affordability for electric cooperatives and their members.

The 2024 greenhouse gas rule required many existing coal-fired plants and new natural gas-fueled plants to either install carbon capture and storage technologies, operate at lower capacity or shut down, forcing the premature retirement of reliable, always-available generation.

The EPA also proposed repealing the Biden administration’s mercury and air rule. NRECA calls the mandate costly, with no appreciable health benefits.

“These rules force power plants into premature retirement and handcuff how often new natural gas plants can run,” Matheson says. “Both are textbook examples of a bad energy policy that compounds today’s reliability challenges.”

“Funding and workforce development opportunities must be accessible for Black workers and Black-led and allied organizations,” the brief states.
“Defunding industrial programs now would reduce opportunities for Black workers to thrive and take part in the industrial sector before these initiatives take root.”","A new 16-page issue brief by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies warns that federal industrial policy investments aimed at advancing economic opportunity for Black communities are under threat, as the Trump administration eliminates key diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) provisions and slows the disbursement of funding.

Authored by policy analyst Dr. Gabrielle Smith Finnie, the report, “Shifting the Narrative on Industrial Policy: Opportunities for Genuine Economic Mobility and Good Jobs for Black Communities,” examines how recent federal investments—through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—offered a historic opportunity to increase Black access to “good jobs” in high-growth industries like manufacturing, clean energy, and technology.

“These investments offer a window to increase Black workers’ access to ‘good jobs’—jobs that offer family-sustaining wages, benefits, wraparound supports, and career advancement opportunities,” Dr. Smith Finnie wrote.

The IIJA, signed into law in 2021, authorized $1.2 trillion to modernize roads, bridges, and broadband infrastructure. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 invested $280 billion to strengthen the semiconductor industry and build a skilled workforce. The IRA, also passed in 2022, used tax credits and grants to support clean energy projects, particularly in low-income areas and communities harmed by pollution.

The report notes that these laws included intentional equity components—such as labor protections, apprenticeship incentives, environmental justice programs, and wraparound workforce services—but many of those components are now being rolled back or underfunded.

“In 2025, the Trump administration eliminated many of the diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in industrial policy legislation,” the report states. “Currently, significant funding is being slowly dispersed, paused, or clawed back, impacting the economic mobility of Black workers.”

According to the Joint Center, the programs have already reached over 99 percent of high-poverty counties. Cities with large Black populations, including Baltimore, Augusta, New Orleans, and Raleigh, were among those set to receive millions to improve infrastructure and launch workforce development hubs through community colleges.

In Detroit, IIJA funding is being used for the I-375 Community Reconnection Project to reconnect two historically Black neighborhoods severed by highway construction. Under the CHIPS Act, the Department of Commerce awarded $184 million to six Recompete Pilot Program finalists, including $20 million to Reinvest Birmingham, which is scaling up workforce development and transportation access to reduce the city’s high Black unemployment rate.

The IRA directed approximately $55 billion to reduce local pollution and support environmental justice efforts. Seventy percent of clean energy investments under the law have been in counties with lower employment rates, 78 percent in areas with below-median household incomes, and 86 percent in regions with below-average college graduation rates.

In Prince George’s County, Maryland, a majority-Black jurisdiction, ten communities will receive $20 million through the Environmental and Climate Justice Program to support climate resilience, reduce energy costs, and grow a clean energy workforce.

Despite these investments, the Joint Center found that many Black-led and Black-allied organizations remain under-informed and under-resourced. A foundational network of eight such organizations participated in the project, with 60 percent engaged in federal policy. Yet most expressed unfamiliarity with the industrial policy agenda and cited barriers, including limited staff, insufficient technical support, and a lack of targeted outreach.

Participants had applied for broadband grants and climate-related funding but struggled to navigate the complex process or receive adequate guidance. To address these gaps, the Joint Center hosted virtual sessions with policy experts from academia and the Biden administration, providing opportunities to learn about funding pathways, federal priorities, and equity initiatives.

The report provides a set of messaging principles for Black-led and Black-allied organizations, including the importance of highlighting Black workers’ economic contributions, addressing historic exclusion from skilled trades, and advocating for place-based investments and better data tracking. “Industrial policy must ensure our communities have clear access to good jobs, high wages, and meaningful training opportunities,” the report states.

It also calls on funders to support Black-led research, researchers to track equity outcomes, employers to implement fair hiring and advancement practices, and training providers to build accessible career pathways in technology and manufacturing.

“Funding and workforce development opportunities must be accessible for Black workers and Black-led and allied organizations,” the brief states. “Defunding industrial programs now would reduce opportunities for Black workers to thrive and take part in the industrial sector before these initiatives take root.”",https://mshale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/US-Dpet-of-Labor-by-AP-News.webp,N,,2025-08-01 12:09:00.797306

American Electric Power expects its utilities will interconnect 24 GW of new load by 2030 — up nearly 15% from its previous estimate — with 18 GW coming from data centers, according to William Fehrman, AEP president and CEO.

The 24 GW is backed by signed customer commitments and consists of 13 GW in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market, 9 GW in the PJM Interconnection and about 2.5 GW in the Southwest Power Pool, Fehrman said Wednesday during an earnings call.

In ERCOT, the pending load includes about 5 GW in cryptocurrency operations and 2 GW in data centers, according to Fehrman. “Texas is clearly becoming the crypto center for us,” he said.

The pending load in PJM includes about 3.7 GW of data centers in Ohio and about 3.1 GW of data centers in Indiana Michigan Power’s service territory, Fehrman said.

AEP’s utilities have inquiries about possible new load totaling 190 GW, Fehrman said — a significant increase for a 37-GW system. “Potential customers are drawn to AEP's footprint because of our advanced transmission network capable of delivering consistent large load power,” he said, adding that the company owns more 765-kV lines than all other utilities combined.

AEP’s weather-normalized peak demand grew 12%, to 37.6 GW, at the end of the second quarter, up from 33.5 GW a year earlier, according to Trevor Mihalik, the company’s CFO. Data centers and other industrial customers coming online in Indiana, Ohio and Texas largely drove the increase, he said, resulting in about $200 million in additional revenue.

AEP, based in Columbus, Ohio, expects weather-normalized retail electricity sales by its utilities will increase 5.7% this year, up from 3% growth in 2024. The company anticipates sales will jump 8.4% next year and 8.9% in 2027, according to an earnings presentation.

In part due to those new load expectations, AEP expects this fall it will increase its five-year capital spending plan by 30%, to about $70 billion, up from $54 billion, Fehrman said.

AEP expects transmission investments will account for half the additional expenditures, followed by generation at 40% and the distribution system at 10%, according to Fehrman. Under the pending capital expenditure plan, AEP Texas could spend about $7 billion on transmission.

Changes to federal clean energy tax credits signed into law July 4 don’t appear to affect AEP’s $9.9 billion plan to build wind and solar projects, according to Fehrman.

A few renewable energy projects potentially could be affected by a July 7 executive order directing the U.S. Treasury Department to issue guidance on determining when a project may be deemed “under construction,” a key issue for qualifying for tax credits, Fehrman said.

In November, AEP agreed to buy 100 MW of fuel cells from Bloom Energy, with an option to buy up to 1 GW in total by the end of this year, the company said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday. AEP’s subsidiaries are offering the fuel cells to data centers and other large customers as an immediate option for addressing their needs while grid infrastructure upgrades are being completed to accommodate their demand. Ohio Power, an AEP utility, has two contracts approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, totaling about 98 MW, for electricity service from fuel cells, according to the SEC report.

Ohio H.B. 15, which takes effect Aug. 14, repealed the statute that permits electric utilities to provide customer-sited renewable generation service such as fuel cells, but the law grandfathered the two PUCO-approved contracts, AEP said.

Texas H.B. 5247, which became law in June, is “incredibly constructive” legislation for AEP Texas, according to Fehrman. The bill allows eligible utilities to use a “unified tracker mechanism” to recover their expenses, reducing regulatory lag, he said.

The cost-recovery mechanism could increase AEP Texas’ return on equity by 0.5% to 1%, according to Mihalik. The utility has an 8.6% earned ROE, he said.

“This is highly supportive of increasing our capital allocation to Texas as we participate in the massive infrastructure build-out needed to drive the economic growth in the state,” Fehrman said.

AEP’s utilities have about 5.6 million customers in Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.

EPA also argues that the 2009 Endangerment Finding inappropriately separated the endangerment and standard-setting proceedings.
As a result, EPA proposes that the endangerment finding and standard setting process must occur together.
EPA originally issued the Endangerment Finding in 2009 during the Obama Administration in response to the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007).
EPA now argues that the 2009 Endangerment Finding misconstrues the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts, which the agency now proposes does not require a finding that GHGs are subject to regulation under the CAA.","On July 30, 2025, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposed rule to reconsider the 2009 Endangerment Finding that has served as the foundation for EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases (GHGs) for mobile sources and repeal all resulting GHG regulations for motor vehicles and engines under the Clean Air Act (CAA). See EPA Proposed Rule, Reconsideration of 2009 Endangerment Finding and Greenhouse Gas Vehicle Standards (July 29, 2025) (pre-publication version). According to the EPA’s press release (see Resources links), the proposal is intended to ‘reinstat[e] consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver”, citing the “significant uncertainties and massive costs” that fell to consumers as a result of the Endangerment Finding.

EPA offers a primary and alternative bases for its proposal, as follows:

EPA’s primary argument is that it does not have authority under CAA section 202(a) to prescribe emission standards based on global climate change concerns and therefore the agency proposes to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding.

EPA proposes to reinterpret the terms “air pollutant” and “air pollution” under CAA section 202(a) to refer to local or regional exposure to dangerous air pollution, rather than a global approach. EPA asserts that the 2009 analysis of six “well-mixed GHGs” and any resulting global climate change concerns involve causal relationships that are too uncertain, remote, and confounded by other factors to meet the “cause” and “contribute” criteria under CAA section 202(a).

Relying on recent Supreme Court precedent from Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024), West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697 (2022), and Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302 (2014) (among others), EPA asserts that the CAA is silent or ambiguous with regard to addressing global climate change and, as a result, EPA lacks the “clear congressional authorization” required under the major questions doctrine.

EPA also argues that the 2009 Endangerment Finding inappropriately separated the endangerment and standard-setting proceedings. As a result, EPA proposes that the endangerment finding and standard setting process must occur together. In doing so, EPA asserts that CAA section 202(a) requires the Administrator to find that an air pollutant must cause, or contribute to, air pollution which endangers public health or welfare, “without relying on emissions from stationary or other sources regulated by distinction CAA provisions.”

As an alternative bases, EPA proposes to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding because its original analysis of the scientific record and data was unreasonable and subsequent legal and scientific developments “cast significant doubt on the reliability of the findings.”

EPA also offered an alternative bases for its proposal to repeal all GHG emission standards (even if the Endangerment Finding were to remain in place) because there is no “requisite technology” for emission control from motor vehicles and engines that can address global climate change concerns.

According to EPA, there is no “requisite technology” because even reducing GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and engines to zero would “not have a scientifically measurable impact on global GHG concentrations and climate trends.”

EPA asserts that any “requisite technology” would, at a minimum, require a full shift from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, which runs contrary to the “generation-shifting” “fuel switching” approach deemed illegal in West Virginia.

EPA also proposes that, on balance, GHG standards harm the public health and welfare by decreasing consumer choice, increasing prices, and keeping older (and less safe/efficient) cars on the road for longer.

The proposal would repeal all GHG emission standards for motor vehicles and engines (both light- and heavy-duty) as well as all related test procedures, reporting requirements, fleet-average emission requirements, and credit average, banking, and trading (ABT) provisions. In short, the proposal would “remove all existing regulations that require new motor vehicles and engines to measure, report, or comply with GHG emission standards.” The proposal would apply to all model years of vehicles and engines, including those manufactured prior to the effective date of any final rule.

EPA originally issued the Endangerment Finding in 2009 during the Obama Administration in response to the Supreme Court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007). The Supreme Court case arose after states petitioned EPA and requested that the agency regulate CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The Endangerment Finding contained two key findings regarding the regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act (CAA: (1) “elevated concentrations of [GHGs] . . . may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health”; and (2) “emissions of the well-mixed [GHGs] from new motor vehicles contribute to the air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare . . . .” See EPA Final Rule, Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases Under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act, 74 Fed. Reg. 66,496), 66,516, 66,537 (Dec. 15, 2009) (emphases added). EPA now argues that the 2009 Endangerment Finding misconstrues the Supreme Court’s decision in Massachusetts, which the agency now proposes does not require a finding that GHGs are subject to regulation under the CAA. EPA now asserts that, consistent with the holding in Massachusetts, regardless of whether individual GHGs are “air pollutants” under the broad, CAA-wide definition, they must also meet the CAA statutory standard for regulation under 202(a) because they “cause” or “contribute” to air pollution that endangers the public health or welfare.

Today’s proposed rule follows President Trump’s Executive Order (EO) 14154 “Unleashing American Energy” which directed EPA to submit joint recommendations to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) “on the legality and continuing applicability of the Administrator’s findings”. 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8357 (Jan. 20, 2025). EPA had previewed the reconsideration of the Endangerment Finding in the March 12, 2025 “Deregulatory Action” announcement. See Press Release, EPA Launches Biggest Deregulatory Action in U.S. History (March 12, 2025).

While the Administration has not set a timeline to finalize the proposed rule, we anticipate EPA will target late 2025, with legal challenges undoubtedly following shortly after. If finalized, the rule will have significant implications for the GHG credit market (including potentially prior and current credit sales) and raise questions within the industry regarding past enforcement and the potential for future/retroactive enforcement. Additionally, EPA asserts that its proposed action does not impact Federal preemption with respect to GHGs, including for motor vehicle and engine emission standards under the CAA or under EPCA and EISA. According to EPA’s proposal, the CAA would continue to preempt any state or local standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles and engines, including GHG emissions. Notably, EPA did not propose to modify regulations for criteria emissions standards, CAFE testing, or fuel economy labeling requirements. EPA indicated that it is reconsidering in separate rulemakings additional endangerment findings and GHG emission standards issued under distinct provisions of the CAA.

The proposal is scheduled for publication in the Federal Register tomorrow (August 1, 2025), with public comments due within 45 days (i.e., September 15, 2025). EPA will also plan to hold virtual public hearings on August 19-20, 2025. EPA has noted specific aspects of the proposal on which it seeks comment; however, the Agency has indicated it will respond to all comments within the scope of the proposal.

SmarterHelp’s focus is to scale training for in-demand technical careers—beginning with the proven EVSE Reliability Technician Training program.

SmarterHelp will be led by Kianna Scott as Chief Executive Officer, with Dr. Jessica Hutcheson serving as Chief Operating Officer. The launch reflects a shared vision between ChargerHelp and SmarterHelp to strengthen the future of clean infrastructure by investing in both systems and people.

“We’ve always believed that technology alone isn’t enough—you need people prepared to maintain and lead the systems of the future,” said Kianna Scott, CEO of SmarterHelp. “With SmarterHelp, we’re taking the equity-centered, industry-aligned training we built inside ChargerHelp and scaling this approach to help communities across the country access the green jobs of tomorrow.”

The spin-out comes as demand for clean energy workers accelerates. More than 6 million clean energy jobs are expected to be created in the U.S. by 2035, yet only 12.3% of global workers possess any green skills. SmarterHelp addresses this gap through a certification-based curriculum model that equips learners—particularly from underserved communities—for high-growth technical careers.

“This has been a natural evolution,” said Kameale Terry, Co-Founder and CEO of ChargerHelp. “As ChargerHelp continues to focus on EV charging reliability through software and technology, it’s clear that the Learning & Development team had a larger mission to fulfill. SmarterHelp allows them to grow independently, and we couldn’t be more excited to see where they go next.”

“It’s the same team, just a bigger dream,” added Evette Ellis, Co-Founder and Chief People Officer at ChargerHelp. “We’re proud of what we built together, and we’re fully behind SmarterHelp as they step into this next chapter.”

SmarterHelp’s inaugural offering, the EVSE Reliability Technician Training program, is already in use by school systems, workforce boards, and training providers. The organization will expand its training portfolio to include pathways in smart grid systems, micro mobility, sustainable infrastructure maintenance, and K-12 and CTE pathways, focusing on hands-on, accessible education towards careers that do not require a 4-year degree.

“Our approach to training is different,” said Scott. “We blend technical instruction with adult learning best practices, strong industry ties, and a deep commitment to access. We’re not just training workers—we’re helping build a just transition for the clean economy.”

SmarterHelp will host a public webinar titled “Why SmarterHelp?” on September 15, 2025, at 10:00 AM PDT, designed for superintendents, workforce leaders, and CTE program managers. The session will outline SmarterHelp’s training model, leadership vision, and roadmap for national impact.

Full transcript - AES Corporation (AES) Q2 2025:

Emily, Call Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the AES Corporation Second Quarter twenty twenty five Financial Review Call. My name is Emily, and I’ll be coordinating your call today. After the presentation, you will have the opportunity to ask any questions, which you can do so by pressing star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. I would now like to turn the call over to Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations. Susan, please go ahead.

Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, AES Corporation: Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter twenty twenty five financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward looking statements. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements, which are disclosed in our most recent 10 ks and 10 Q filed with the SEC.

Reconciliations between GAAP and non GAAP financial measures can be found on our website along with the presentation. Joining me this morning are Andrei Sluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Coughlin, our Chief Financial Officer Ricardo Fallou, our Chief Operating Officer and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andres.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter twenty twenty five financial review call. Today, I’m pleased to reaffirm both our 2025 guidance and our long term growth targets. Our business remains resilient and we continue to execute on our strategy, which I will discuss in more detail. Following my remarks, Steve Coughlin, our CFO will provide additional color on our financial performance and outlook. Before delving into our second quarter results, allow me to share a few thoughts regarding the state of the electricity market in The U.

S. Obviously, the past couple of months have seen major policy announcements, which will have a significant impact on the sector. Not to get distracted by some of the noise surrounding these developments, it’s important to keep in mind key market fundamentals. Demand for energy in The U. S.

Is growing rapidly by historical measures, prices are rising and the bulk of new additions over the next five years will be renewables and energy storage. These are the technologies that can be feasibly built given their shorter time to power, advanced development pipeline, existing supply chains, competitive levelized cost of energy and customer preference. Current government policies aim to increase the amount of future power coming from fossil fuels, nuclear and enhanced geothermal. While measures can be taken to increase generation from existing thermal plants, new additions will take years to materially come online, some more than others. In the meantime, AES has a mature pipeline of renewables and battery storage with a substantial safe harbored backlog of signed PPAs positioning us to meet our clients’ growing energy needs.

As an all of the above energy company, we have the capabilities to deliver those technologies that are most cost competitive and demanded by our customers. We see our business model as supplying not a specific technology, but the electric energy and capacity in the shape, cost and reliability the market demands. Over many years AES has demonstrated its flexibility and innovation time and again. Now turning to our results beginning on slide four. We’re executing well and on track to achieve all of our financial metrics.

Our performance was in line with our expectations with adjusted EBITDA of $681,000,000 and adjusted EPS of $0.51 We are seeing significant growth in our renewables SBU with adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of $240,000,000 representing overall growth of 56% versus Q2 last year. This growth is directly related to the 3.2 gigawatts of new projects that we have added to our portfolio over the last four quarters. We’re also seeing the benefits of more projects with higher returns, which we forecasted earlier last year and are now hitting our results as these projects come online. We’re on track to add a total of 3.2 gigawatts of new projects in operation in 2025. Year to date, we have completed construction of 1.9 gigawatts and we are approximately 80% complete on the remaining 1.3 gigawatts.

I am pleased to report that our progress so far this year includes the completion of the one gigawatt Bellfield one solar plus storage project, which is the first phase in the largest project of its kind in the country. As part of our construction efforts, we utilized our AI robotic solar installation technology, Maximo, which makes construction significantly faster, less labor intensive and more cost effective. Since our last call, we have signed PPAs for an additional 1.6 gigawatts of new projects including six fifty megawatts with MEDA bringing our backlog to 12 gigawatts. The 1.6 gigawatts of new PPAs is entirely with data center customers further solidifying our position as the leading provider of renewables to this customer segment. Now turning to slide five.

Our business is resilient to changes in renewables policy, whether it’s new legislation signed by Congress, the prospect of additional tariffs or changes to IRS guidelines around tax credits. We have significant protections due to the actions we have taken over the last several years, safe harboring, ensuring a U. S. Supply chain and avoiding projects on federal land. Let me also emphasize that for the majority of our business, any of the recent changes in U.

S. Policy are largely inconsequential. This includes our entire operating portfolio, our utilities and our international business. Turning to slide six, we feel very confident in the strength of our backlog of renewables and energy storage projects, which have signed contracts, but are not yet operational. Of this 12 gigawatt backlog, 4.1 gigawatts are international selling primarily to mining companies and data centers with no exposure to U.

S. Policy. Looking at our 7.9 gigawatt U. S. Backlog, we plan to place in service six gigawatts before year end 2027, all of which qualify for existing tax credits under recent legislation.

Of the remaining 1.9 gigawatts coming online after 2027, nearly all is safe harbored under the current treasury guidance. Even looking out to 2028 and beyond, our pipeline includes an additional four gigawatts of projects that are expected to be added to our backlog over the coming year. I should add that 35% of our U. S. Pipeline is energy storage, which will be supported by tax credits from start of construction through 02/1933.

In short, our backlog is well protected and we have a long runway of projects that we expect to bring online with tax incentives. Turning to slide seven, our supply chain strategy also provides us with strong protection from changes in U. S. Policy or potential future tariffs. All of our major equipment is now either on-site or coming from U.

S. Based suppliers with their own supply chains diversified outside of China. We have essentially eliminated any potential impact from previously announced tariffs and our projects comply with the restrictions on foreign entities of concern or FIAC. Now turning to slide eight and our future growth. Even as tax credits expire, we expect strong demand, which will enable us to maintain or improve our existing project returns and continue to rapidly grow our EBITDA.

We are uniquely positioned as the top provider of renewables to data center companies with over 11 gigawatts of agreements signed to date and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our financial objectives for the following three reasons. First, we’re seeing robust demand for electricity driven primarily by the rapid growth of data centers. Meeting this demand in The U. S. Will require over 600 terawatt hours of additional power generated by the end of the decade, which is roughly equivalent to the current ERCOT system.

With this backdrop, as you can see on slide nine, the corporate PPA market for renewables has a long history of adjusting to account for changes in market conditions with average contract prices moving as the underlying cost of building new projects has evolved. It is worth noting that for data centers, electricity represents less than 10% of total lifetime cost on average. Second, turning to Slide 10, renewables offer a competitive levelized cost of energy or LCOE for new generation even without tax credits. Over the past year, the cost of a new gas turbine has more than doubled and lead times have stretched to four years or more. Additionally, new gas pipelines have yet to be approved, permitted and built.

As a result, a surge in new gas plants coming online will likely take time. And third, our strategy remains centered on meeting our customer needs. Today customers are asking for renewables and storage because they can be deployed quickly and at scale. I should add that AES has extensive gas development capabilities and we are focused on delivering those solutions that our large data center customers are requesting. Finally, turning to slide 11 and the robust growth program we’re undertaking at our U.

S. Utilities. We are executing on the largest investment program in the history of both AS Indiana and AS Ohio to improve customer reliability and support economic development. In 2025, across these utilities, we’re on track to invest approximately $1,400,000,000 in areas such as hardening the distribution network, smart grid, new generation and transmission build out for data centers. At AES Indiana, we’re making significant progress on our generation build out.

Earlier this year, we completed the Pike County Energy Storage Project, which includes 200 megawatts of installed capacity and 800 megawatt hours of dispatchable energy, the largest operational battery project in MISO. We’re also on track to bring online the Petersburg Energy Center, a two fifty megawatt solar and 180 megawatt hour energy storage facility by the end of the year. Furthermore, we’re on schedule with repowering two of the Petersburg units from coal to natural gas. We expect this project to be completed in 2026. This quarter, we also filed petition for a regulatory rate review with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

This rate case represents our first using a forward looking test year, which will reduce regulatory lag and enable a more efficient investment program as we work to best serve our customers with cost effective and reliable electricity service. At AES Ohio, our current regulatory rate review with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio is on track for a timely order and we’re optimistic that we will be able to reach a settlement agreement in the third quarter. In addition, with the passage of House Bill 15 this spring, we’re working towards a new regulatory framework that will incorporate three forward looking test years, significantly reducing regulatory lag in Ohio. With our current ESP regulatory structure in place until early twenty twenty seven, we expect to file for new rates later this year, which will include 2027 to 2029 as the test years. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Steve Coughlin.

Steve Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, AES Corporation: Thank you, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I’m very pleased to share that AS had a great second quarter, keeping us well on track toward our full year 2025 guidance targets. First, turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 13. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $681,000,000 versus $658,000,000 a year ago. This was driven by significant growth from new renewables projects and the positive impact from cost reductions we announced on our fourth quarter call.

These were partially offset by several portfolio changes, including the prior year Warrior Run coal PPA monetization, the sale of AES Brazil and the 30% sell down of AES Ohio. Turning to slide 14. Second quarter adjusted EPS increased 34% to $0.51 per share versus $0.38 in the prior year. In addition to the EBITDA growth drivers, EPS also increased as a result of $185,000,000 of higher U. S.

Renewable tax attributes. This strong growth was partially offset by higher parent interest expense and a higher adjusted tax rate. Next, I’ll cover the performance drivers within each of our strategic business units on the next four slides. Beginning with our renewables SBU on slide 15, The 56% increase in EBITDA was as expected and puts us well on our way to achieving our full year guidance of $890,000,000 to $960,000,000 This was primarily driven by 3.2 gigawatts of new capacity brought online since Q2 twenty twenty four as well as the positive impacts from the cost reductions and scaling down of our development spending that we discussed on our fourth quarter call. This year, hydrology has normalized in Colombia, improving results versus the prior year.

The net effect of moving Chile renewables to the renewables SBU this year was offset by the sale of our five gigawatt AES Brazil business. In the utilities SBU, lower adjusted pretax contribution or PTC in the quarter was mostly driven by planned outages and the sell down of AES Ohio that closed in April. These results were fully anticipated in our guidance and we expect significant growth in the Utilities SBU in the year to go driven by new investments in the rate base. Turning to our Energy Infrastructure SBU on slide 17. Lower EBITDA versus Q2 twenty twenty four primarily reflects the prior year recognition of the Warrior Run coal PPA monetization and Chile renewable assets moving to our Renewables segment in 2025, partially offset by our acquisition of the remaining ownership in the Cochrane coal plant.

Excluding these portfolio changes, Energy Infrastructure EBITDA would have increased by $23,000,000 as a result of higher availability across the fleet. Finally, lower EBITDA at our New Energy Technologies SBU primarily reflects AES’ share of the lower results reported by Fluence in their fiscal second quarter. Turning to slide 19. We are reaffirming our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $2,650,000,000 to $2,850,000,000 driven by the robust 51% growth in our renewables business year to date and our strong position heading into the second half of this year. Growth in the year to go will be driven by the 3.7 gigawatts of projects brought online in 2024, the 1.9 gigawatts already brought online year to date and the additional 1.3 gigawatts we will bring online through the end of the year.

Our business has reached a level of scale and maturity that allows us to operate even more effectively and efficiently, which is improving EBITDA margins. As I mentioned, hydrology conditions in Colombia have normalized and we see our hydro plants well positioned to hit their targets through the end of the year. We expect 7% year over year growth at our Utilities SBU, driven by the $1,300,000,000 of rate based investment we’ve made over the last twelve months. We have already locked in the cost savings actions implemented during the first quarter, which will yield at least the $150,000,000 savings target we discussed on our fourth quarter call. To put this year into context, when adjusted to exclude the impacts of asset sales, year over year adjusted EBITDA growth will be approximately 11%.

Looking beyond 2025, asset sales will be less of a driver due to the substantial progress we’ve already made. This means that adjusted EBITDA growth will significantly accelerate in 2026 as the strong growth in our Renewables and Utilities businesses will not be offset by significant asset sales. As a result, we still expect at least low teens EBITDA growth in 2026, putting us well on track to achieve our long term growth rate through 2027. Now looking at our 2025 adjusted earnings per share on slide 20. We are reaffirming our guidance of $2.1 to $2.26 which exceeds the midpoint of the 7% to 9% long term growth rate we introduced back in 2021.

In addition to the drivers of adjusted EBITDA, we expect higher interest expense as a result of new debt for our growth investments and a slightly higher adjusted tax rate. We expect to benefit from higher tax credit monetization in the year to go as we complete an additional 600 megawatts of projects in The U. S. And expect these tax attributes to be weighted approximately equally between the third and fourth quarters. Now let’s turn to our 2025 parent capital allocation plan on slide 21.

Sources reflect approximately $2,700,000,000 of total discretionary cash, including achieving the upper half of our 1,150,000,000.00 to $1,250,000,000 of parent free cash flow target, reflecting double digit year over year growth. Additional sources include the sell down of our global insurance business that closed in the second quarter, and we expect to borrow an additional 500,000,000 at the parent to support our attractive growth investment plan. On the right hand side, you can see our planned use of capital. We will return approximately $500,000,000 to shareholders this year with our $0.70 per share annual dividend, while investing approximately $1,800,000,000 toward new growth, primarily in the Renewables and Utilities businesses. We have also repaid approximately $400,000,000 of subsidiary debt in line with our balance sheet optimization objectives.

Turning to slide 22. We are reaffirming our long term growth rate for adjusted EBITDA of 5% to 7% driven by Renewables growth of 19% to 21% and Utilities growth of 13% to 15%. We are also reaffirming our long term growth rates for adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow. I want to emphasize that the recently passed reconciliation bill does not impact the growth plan included in our long term guidance. As Andres discussed, all projects coming online through year end twenty twenty seven qualify to receive existing tax credits under the recently passed legislation.

Additionally, we have either already taken delivery of key components for our backlog projects or we have secured domestic supply chains which mitigate impacts of new tariffs. These actions give us clear line of sight to achieving our long term guidance. As a reminder, AES’ adjusted EBITDA does not include renewables tax credit. As a result, we do not expect any reduction in adjusted EBITDA from the eventual sunsetting of renewable tax credits. I would also like to share a few thoughts on our balance sheet.

Our parent free cash flow to parent debt metric in the second quarter improved versus a year ago from 19% to 25%, and we remain on track to reach our 12% FFO to debt target with Moody’s by the end of next year. Our plan through 2027 is fully self funded with internally generated cash flow, tax capital, partner capital and incremental debt capacity. As we consider how the business will evolve with the step down of tax credits toward the end of the decade and beyond, we feel confident in the resilience of our business due to our industry leading position with data centers. Data center customers have an incredible need for new power and future expirations of renewables incentives are unlikely to slow this down. Our expectation is that PPA prices will adjust to fully remunerate invested capital at attractive returns.

In other words, while future projects without tax incentives would require additional debt and equity to replace tax value monetization, those projects will also earn higher cash and EBITDA to remunerate that additional capital and achieve our target returns. This also means that we could generate similar EBITDA and cash growth with less megawatts and without increasing capital needs. We will maintain this flexibility to scale our growth investments to be in line with available capital sources within AES and our partners. Looking beyond 2027, our growth will continue to be funded primarily with internally generated cash, partner capital and debt capacity in line with our investment grade credit rating. AES’ future growth rates will be strong as declines we’ve seen in our energy infrastructure SBU related to asset sales and coal retirements will be largely behind us, allowing the high growth rates of renewables and utilities to dominate AES’ overall rate of growth.

In summary, I am very pleased with the progress we’ve made toward our financial objectives for 2025 and beyond as our business strategy and execution continue to prove resilient and successful. With more than half of the year behind us, I am confident we will achieve our 2025 objectives and look forward to providing an update on next quarter’s call. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Andres.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Thank you, Steve. Before opening up the call to questions, I will share some closing thoughts. AES’ business is resilient and we are reaffirming all of our 2025 and longer term financial and business objectives. We’re on track to complete 3.2 gigawatts of construction in full year 2025 and have signed two gigawatts of new PPAs so far this year. Our backlog of 12 gigawatts of signed PPAs is either international or safe harbor and the majority will be completed by 2027.

AES’ Renewables adjusted EBITDA grew by 56% in the quarter as we delivered on our construction projects. At the same time, our balance sheet metrics are on track to meet all requirements to maintain our triple investment grade. Our resilience is the result of years of preparation of creating a domestic supply chain, a safe harbored backlog and pipeline and being the preferred provider of the fastest growing market segment, namely data centers and corporate clients. AES has earned the reputation as the most reliable developer and builder of renewable projects as well as the most innovative company in our sector. We see ourselves as a provider of electric energy and capacity with the cost, shape and carbon intensity that our clients demand.

AES will continue to deliver the solutions our customers need as we always have done in the past. For all of these reasons, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on our financial commitments through our guidance period and continue to show strong growth beyond. With that, I would ask the operator to open up the call for questions.

Emily, Call Operator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question today comes from Nick Campanella with Barclays. Please go ahead, Nick.

Sai, Analyst Representative, Barclays: Hi, good morning team. This is Sai for Nick today and thanks for taking my questions. First, just wanted to touch on financial execution drivers. So on new project construction timeline, so seeing 80% of the projects completed for the remaining 1.3 gigawatts, can you talk about the project online timing for the rest of the year? And how does that affect EPS and EBITDA recognition?

And also looking at longer term guidance into a post OBB world, what are your latest thoughts and potential timing to roll forward into 2028 or even further as part of the multi year guidance? Thanks.

Ricardo Fallou, Chief Operating Officer, AES Corporation: Hi. Good morning, Nick. This is Ricardo. So I’ll take the first part of your question with respect to the timing of the commissioning. Most of it will be I would say third quarter and a small portion in the fourth quarter of this year.

I think it’s important to highlight that 80% progress completion. We have all the equipment that we need on-site, so we can provide full confidence in the remaining 1.3 gigawatt being commissioned by the end of the year.

Steve Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, AES Corporation: Yes. And hey, this is Steve. Just on the second part and I would also add that most of our growth this year is coming from capacity that’s already come online through last year and the first half of this year. And the tax attributes related to what Ricardo mentioned will be roughly split between the third and fourth quarters. In terms of the longer term guidance, we feel very good.

We’re in our planning cycle. But based on what’s come out in the new bill, and as Andres highlighted, we’re very well positioned beyond 2027 given our safe harboring, given our domestic supply chain. So we see ourselves well on track in that period. And so we will give an update and expect to extend guidance in the February 25 call as we normally do. But we feel very good about the company even beyond the 2027 timeframe.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Nick, this is Andres. I would also add that we’ve always hit our construction targets that we’ve given. And other things like we have avoided public lands for our projects and there’s a high component of energy storage on this. Overall we feel very good about hitting our targets.

Sai, Analyst Representative, Barclays: Got it. Thanks very much. That’s very helpful. And I guess maybe switching gears, I understand we’ve all seen the headlines about a potential acquisition of the company. And while I know you can’t really opine directly on that, could you maybe talk about how are you seeing the value of your underlying business currently versus where you traded two, three years ago?

Obviously, the renewables backdrop has changed significantly. But do you see private markets would still value your business higher than where the public market is currently? And if you were to pursue something for the whole company, what can be the regulatory hurdles required? Thanks.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Look, Nick, what I would say is, we have seen over the last couple of years, we feel our company has been undervalued, consistently undervalued. Just looking at today’s call, look at the strength of our backlog, look at our execution, look at the clients that we have, And also look at the flexibility that the company has. We really are an all of above company. I mean, always had a foot in gas as well. And over the last five years, we’ve done about two gigawatts of new gas plants.

And we’re doing a conversion from coal to gas, one gigawatt conversion from coal to gas now. And we have the possibility of doing gas as well. We have other sites, we have other things in development. So what I would say is that if you look at all those factors, we really are a company that’s oriented to serving our customers and we’re not just eight single technology companies. So we’ll combine the technologies with the tax incentives, with the customer preferences that make sense.

But our primary aim is financial to really do the very best, create the most shareholder value that we can from this portfolio. So we’ve been executing and therefore if you look at what the company consists of and our performance, we feel that yes, we’ve been undervalued over the last couple of years.

Sai, Analyst Representative, Barclays: Understood. That’s helpful color. Thanks a lot. I’ll leave it there.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Thank you.

Emily, Call Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Richard.

Richard Sunderland, Analyst, JPMorgan: Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Yes, Richard. Good morning.

Richard Sunderland, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thanks for the time today. Looking at Slide six here and I’m wondering how you think about the risk to safe harboring from the executive order and potential changes to guidelines. Is there anything specific to your safe harbor activities that gives you confidence in that outlook?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: I’ll give a high level answer and then I’ll pass it to Ricardo. But I would say that, look, overall, we’ve been very looking at how to have a robust position. And this is sort of a philosophy we’ve asked when you think about COVID, we’re the only large developer that didn’t postpone, forget even abandon any big projects as a result of COVID. So thinking about what potential changes could come, we have been very careful avoiding any public lands for example. We have been if you think of our pipeline, a high component of that is energy storage or batteries plus energy storage.

So overall, we’re in a pretty robust position going into this. So on the specifics, I’m going to

Ricardo Fallou, Chief Operating Officer, AES Corporation: go ahead and pass it to Ricardo. Good morning, Richard. So let me start by saying that out of the 7.9 gigawatt of U. S. Backlog and I think just to repeat what we have in the slide sixteen, six gigawatt will be placed in service by the end of the 2027.

So by 12/31/2027. So they are not these projects the six gigawatt are not exposed or subject to any modification by the new treasury guidance because by the law they have access to the tax attributes and we can provide full confidence that we can bring and where these projects are in construction and we will bring them online or place them in service before 12/31/2027. For the remaining $1,900,000,000 Andres mentioned, nearly all already have safe harbor protections under the treasury or existing treasury guidance. And in no event, we expect the new treasury guidance to be applied retroactively. With respect to the executive order, there is another element there which relates to Fioc, which applies for project that start construction on or after 01/01/2026.

As all our projects already started construction or nearly all, we have no exposure to these FiOQ potential changes as part of these treasury guidance. And I should also say that as a first mover in terms of securing and supporting domestic or U. S. Manufacturing for solar, wind and storage, we can comply even with the highest requirement or restriction for field even that they will not apply for the projects in our backlog.

Richard Sunderland, Analyst, JPMorgan: Got it. Thanks for the commentary there. And then turning to the utility side, we’ve seen sort of across the space a lot of load updates on the quarter. It seems like pockets of the country and even broadly where there’s a lot of acceleration of activity. Curious given you’ve already picked up some benefits on that side, how you’re seeing overall inbounds and interest into your service territories?

Anything notable either on the quarter or on the horizon here on the load front at the utilities? Thank you.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Look, there’s strong interest and especially in our two utilities. I believe they’re among the fastest growing in the country. We’ve signed about two gigawatts of data center additional data center demand and then we would expect more. So yes, we’re having inbounds and yes, the demand continues to be strong. So again across the board, we have positioned ourselves with that sector that’s most robust and most rapidly growing.

Richard Sunderland, Analyst, JPMorgan: Great. Thanks for the time today.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Thanks Richard.

Emily, Call Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, Michael.

Michael Sullivan, Analyst, Wolfe Research: Hey, good morning.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Good morning,

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: Michael. Hey, maybe I

Michael Sullivan, Analyst, Wolfe Research: missed this, but just any more detail you can give us on the PPAs that you signed in the quarter, whether it be location or resource type?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: The information that we’ve given is that $650,000,000 was with Meta. All of the 1,600,000.0 that we’ve signed is and again, this is since the last call are with data center customers. And we’ll provide more information going into the future. In general, we’re somewhat skewed towards solar plus batteries overall. That’s the technologies we’re strongest

Michael Sullivan, Analyst, Wolfe Research: And then yes, I mean, we’ve talked about this a bit, I think, on some of the calls, but just any further evolution in your thoughts in terms of new gas plant build for data centers? Have conversations progressed there at all? Or is there still mostly a skew towards renewable storage at least for the near term?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: So your question is if there is a conversation about gas build to backup data centers. Look, as I sort of indicated, we will use all the technologies that best meet our customers’ needs. So if our customers would want gas as part of the package, absolutely. And we have the capabilities. As I said, we’ve always been building gas plants.

We have 10 gigawatts under operation today. So we feel very comfortable with that, but we’re going to react to what our customers require.

Michael Sullivan, Analyst, Wolfe Research: Okay, great. And then just a quick one on the utilities. Can you give us a sense of how much lag you’re seeing in Ohio today and then what that can move to in a three year forward test year world?

Steve Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, AES Corporation: Yeah. This is Steve. So look, we’re very happy with the new regulatory framework allowing the three year forward rate cases. So we have an existing rate case under the prior pending, and we’re expecting that settlement in the relative near term, the coming months and new rates to be in place Q1 of next year. But we’re also moving forward with our plans to file under the new three year forward looking rate structure likely later this year and would expect rates in 2027 under the new rate structure.

So this is a really attractive structure for a utility with three year forward looking. It significantly largely eliminates regulatory lag on our investment. And so I think it’s good for utility, good for investing to provide the best service for our customers and to support the rapid load growth that Andres mentioned that is coming and to have very regular and quick return on those investments. So that’s the timing and we’re looking forward to it.

Michael Sullivan, Analyst, Wolfe Research: Okay. Thank you very much.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Thank you.

Emily, Call Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin DUMOULIN Smith SMITH:] with Jefferies. Please go ahead,

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you guys very much for the time.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Good morning, Julien. You guys hear me?

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: Absolutely. Excellent. Hey, so wonderful. Hey, I just wanted to follow-up on these articles in recent weeks. I just can you elaborate a little bit about the situation?

It was a bit ambiguous as as to understand the strategic developments here. What actions has the board taken? Did you all initiate this? Or has there been sort of an inbound formal bid from a third party? Just I get that it might be difficult to speak to specifically at times, but just in terms of what actions has the board taken at this point with regards to reviewing the strategic direction of the company?

And then separately, there’s also been some articles out there about revisiting the stable of unicorns, as you like to call it, Andres. I suppose Uplight specifically here. Can you speak a little bit more to asset sales within the plan? And within that, how that might fit against the broader strategic undertaking at hand too?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Sure. Well, Julian, as you know, regarding the first, AES never comments on rumors in public markets, so I won’t. Regarding the second and Uplight specifically, we also don’t comment about any potential sales that may be in progress. As you know, we’ve had some of the AS NEXT unicorns as part of our portfolio potential asset sales, but we would only do them when we feel the price is right. So we monetize some affluence when we thought the price was right and we will do so with some of the other ones.

I think that some of the current developments make things like Maximo potentially much more valuable, because if there is a, let’s say rush to complete projects by the 2027 end of year guide, if you can build a solar farm in half the time that certainly becomes much more attractive. So that’s, let’s say the one that we have a lot of interest in. We’re very pleased by how it performed in the Bellfield one and now it has a bigger role in Bellfield two. So that’s about all I can say because obviously as you well know, we can’t comment on any potential asset sale until it actually occurs.

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: You can’t confirm necessarily that the board is elected to do anything either?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: As I said, we don’t comment on any public market transactions and we never have.

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: Okay. If I can pivot just quickly back to the other side of this, you’ve made allusion to it. On the EO backdrop, what are your expectations? Get that whatever you can say on this thus far, but how would you set expectations about the EO specifically here? And then related, how are you thinking about the cadence of your development business?

I know you already alluded that you provide specific targets at year end here. But how do you think about the overall trajectory of the business when you think about the back half of the decade and the implications that might come from said EO or otherwise, right?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Yeah. Look, what I can we don’t really speculate too much on sort of what’s going come out of an executive order. But look, what we expect is there’s a number of competing, let’s say desires here. One is the need to power data centers. What can be provided in the timeframes needed to sort of win this competition, international competition for AI dominance?

So I think that’s one. Second, there’s a lot of jobs involved with building renewables. So obviously, they’re indicating that they want to transition, but that transition has to be done in feasible orderly fashion that meets all of the various needs for more energy, for AI dominance, for jobs, for growth, etcetera. So that’s what I would expect is that all these factors are taken into consideration. Regarding the second question was

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: the How does that fit in, right, regardless of this the the timing and cadence? Like, how would you broadly set expectations about the back half of this decade given that sort of whatever the timing is that phase out given that phase out, how would you frame expectations Look,

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: as we indicated, we continue to expect strong growth, because it’s not a question of the technology, it’s the question of the ability to put together and supply clients with what they want. So as you know, we are not going after like megawatt goals. We’re going after financial goals. And so we have the constraint that we’re going to remain triple investment grade and we’re going to continue to pay a dividend. So within those confines, we will grow in an orderly fashion.

And I must also say that if you have a sort of continuous growth and steady growth, it’s much more cost efficient than if you have sort of spurts and valleys. So that’s what we’re going to do. I don’t expect any post when these credits burn off, will continue to grow at strong rates. And I would also add that we’re the only large company, which has international experience. So 30% of our new growth is outside of The U.

S. And we have no tax credits. And quite frankly, we have higher margins. So it will basically be, as we said in the past, our U. S.

Business should look more like our international business. And it’s very likely that it will also add a component of gas as well. And that’s fine with us. We’re capable of doing that. And as Steve also mentioned, the profile of cash etcetera is actually somewhat more favorable than using the tax credits.

But of course you have to use the tax credit because that’s what makes the projects competitive for your clients. But in the absence of them, we’ve shown over the years, we’re perfectly capable of making a very good business without tax credits.

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: Of course, absolutely. But you think you can continue to compound at higher levels than what you’re doing for the time being when you said growth earlier?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Well, we’re not going to give guidance outside of the period. But as we said on the call, we feel very confident that this company is going to continue to grow at strong rates. And that as the circumstances change, we will adapt to them. And I guess, our experience in developing markets gives us an advantage because those markets regulations have tended to be much more volatile than in The States. So for us, again, we feel we’re in a very good position and we have all the technologies we need.

And as new technologies become available, say something like enhanced geothermal, we’ve been dabbling in that and we’ll be ready to provide that for our customers, even SMRs, although I think that’s quite a ways off. I think that’s probably a decade off.

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: Yeah. I would

Steve Coughlin, Chief Financial Officer, AES Corporation: just add that, Julian, our backlog as we showed in slides, is well protected even beyond 2027. And so, you know, we see that growth continuing to be strong. And even then, the demand is so robust. We’ll evolve technology, as Andre said. Pricing will adapt in terms of what the net cost of projects becomes.

And then, as we described, we always maintain flexibility here. We don’t necessarily need to build as many megawatts if the investment is more concentrated without tax attributes in the renewable piece of the business. We also maintain the ability to sell down as we’ve done in the past. So because the EBITDA and cash yield will actually go up on a per megawatt basis, we can generate similar returns with, in fact, less megawatts. So, you know, we’ll adapt, but, we feel very good about how well positioned we are through the very long term.

Emily, Call Operator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead, Ryan.

Ryan Levine, Analyst, Citi: Good morning.

Michael Sullivan, Analyst, Wolfe Research: Good morning, Ryan. How much

Ryan Levine, Analyst, Citi: cash flow is associated with Maximo in the AES plan? And is there any color you can share around the financial metrics or commercial interest you’re seeing with that asset in your portfolio?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Look, at this point, there’s nothing in the plan for Maxima. In terms of commercial industry, we’ve had considerable amount of inbound, but our plan is this right currently we’re going to have about four of these operating and we are, I guess you would call it beta testing. We’re getting more and more efficient. We’re using union crews. Its main advantages is it can go faster with the same amount of people, two to three times faster.

But I think what’s very important is that in desert settings where you have limitations on the hours worked, and again, picking up 65 pound solar panels, it requires very strong people to do that. So with Maximo anybody can do this job. So you can work not six hours, you can work eighteen hours. So it has the advantage of being more efficient, but also getting the projects done faster. So it would have a multiple of the efficiency of getting these things done, which means less working capital, but very important with the current guidelines where you have a deadline that the project has to be in service could be very advantageous.

So we should go to four to a couple dozen next year and we will use those internally. And so in terms of selling them to third parties, that’s probably 2027 or beyond when we have that. So to give you sort of a timeframe, which is similar to what we did with batteries. For several years, we put them on our own fleet and only after that did we start to commercialize them. And there was a lot of learning, but we’ll get a much better price once this product is perfected.

Ryan Levine, Analyst, Citi: Thanks. And then in the prepared remarks, the company’s gas generation build out capability was highlighted. Just to clarify, is the effort that you were speaking to more around backup generation for data center build out? Or was that a more broad effort that the company is pursuing?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Okay. We are converting a coal plant right now to gas. That’s about 1.1 gigawatts. That’s in Indiana. We just completed six seventy megawatt combined cycle plant in Panama.

And in 2020, we brought online Southland, which was 1.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plants. So we’ve always been continually building gas plants. What I did mention is that if data centers request them, we’re capable of building them and we have the capability of expanding sites, for example, to do it very quickly. So the point is we don’t count it as part of our pipeline. We don’t count for example, the 1.1 conversion as part of our pipeline.

We’ve basically centered that on renewables, but we have the capabilities of doing more gas. For example, in other places as well, even The Dominican Republic, there’s possibilities of doing more gas. So we have that in our arsenal. It’s a question of what our clients demand.

Ryan Levine, Analyst, Citi: Okay. And then just in terms of the renewable industry, from a higher level, do you see consolidation given the policy uncertainty at The U. S. Federal level? And does that create opportunity for your stand alone business to acquire some assets or high grade of your portfolio?

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Sure. I mean, obviously, I think it will be more difficult for the smaller, less capitalized developers in this environment. So I certainly think that there will be opportunities. We’ve been doing this. If you think of over the past five years, we’ve been rolling up smaller developers into AES.

So I think there’ll be continued opportunities like that. We’ll also have the opportunity to buy advanced stage development projects and we’ll have to weigh whether it’s more profitable to develop a particular project we have in our pipeline or acquire it and then finish it. So Bellfield is a good example of that. It’s one of our best projects and it was two gigawatts, which was a, let’s say medium stage acquisition.

Julien Dumoulin Smith, Analyst, Jefferies: Appreciate the color.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Thank you, Ryan.

Emily, Call Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, David.

Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, AES Corporation0: Hey, thanks so much. Good morning. I was wondering what has the bookings trajectory been in July post the OBB? I’m just wondering if there’s any evidence of a pickup in activity now that the level of clarity has improved for the industry? So

Ricardo Fallou, Chief Operating Officer, AES Corporation: this is Ricardo. Thanks David for the question. So what we are seeing is as Andres and Steve mentioned the demand is extremely strong. We see our customers of course trying to lock in PPAs as fast as they can possibly do it. Why is that?

Because of course there is an intent of still getting some benefits from the tax incentives. We do have four gigawatt of projects in our pipeline. So not yet contracted that of course are very attractive for our customers. But also as Andres mentioned, we’re very, very focused on the Big Tech customer segment, large and profitable PPAs. So we’re of course balancing between of course the desire of our customers to move these projects along and sign PPAs fast to make sure that we are disciplined in terms of having all the permits, all the equipment and also ensuring that we can, I would say capitalize on the great work that we have done safe harbor in these projects and the fact that they are very unique in a market that will adjust for the removal of the tax incentives going forward?

So we are seeing strong demand. They are trying to lock PPAs prices as soon as possible. So I think we feel very confident in our ability to sign more PPAs in the year to go. So stay tuned and we will be sharing more as we sign those contracts.

Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, AES Corporation0: Great. Yes, thank you for that. And it was solid bookings obviously from data center customers. Great to see that acceleration. I was wondering if there’s any inflection in those data center in that data center renewables demand, anything that might have kind of sparked the industry recently?

Is that an inflection that you saw in the quarter specifically with that customer set?

Ricardo Fallou, Chief Operating Officer, AES Corporation: No at all. I think what Andres mentioned is very, very important. Renewables offer the faster time to power, price certainty because even though of course it will adjust for the removal of the tax incentive this is a fixed price for twenty years so that our customers of course appreciate. They don’t have the volatility of any fuel associated to that generation. And third renewables on a megawatt hour basis is still more competitive even without tax incentives than any other source of electricity.

So there is no we don’t see any drop in demand or the interest of our customers, quite the opposite.

Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, AES Corporation0: Excellent. Thank you so much.

Andres Sluski, President and Chief Executive Officer, AES Corporation: Thank you, David.

Emily, Call Operator: Thank you. At this time, we have no further questions. And so I’ll turn the call back over to Susan Harcourt for closing comments.

Susan Harcourt, Vice President of Investor Relations, AES Corporation: We thank everybody for joining us on today’s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day. Thank

Emily, Call Operator: you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.

PPL Electric Utilities has advanced-stage agreements to interconnect about 14 GW of data centers in its Pennsylvania service territory, up 32% from three months ago, Vincent Sorgi, president and CEO of PPL Corp., said Thursday during an earnings conference call.

Under signed agreements, PPL Electric Utilities’ data center load could grow from 800 MW in 2026 to 14.4 GW in 2034, according to a second-quarter earnings presentation. PPL Electric Utilities has a 60-GW data center interconnection queue, according to Sorgi.

PPL’s data center strategy includes an unregulated joint venture with Blackstone Infrastructure to build power plants in Pennsylvania to directly serve data centers. “The joint venture is actively engaged with hyperscalers, landowners, natural gas pipeline companies and turbine manufacturers and has secured multiple land parcels to enable this new generation buildout,” Sorgi said.

Dive Insight:

However, discussions on potential electricity service agreements aren’t far enough along for the joint venture to commit to buying turbines and it is unclear when it would be able to announce any news, according to Sorgi.

“We’ve made no material financial commitments to date as it relates to the joint venture,” he said.

PPL intends to make sure that the joint venture’s deals don’t change the company’s credit risk profile, Sorgi said.

PPL supports pending legislation in Pennsylvania — H.B. 1272 and S.B. 897 — that would allow regulated utilities like PPL Electric Utilities to build and own generation to address a resource adequacy need, Sorgi said.

The bills would also encourage utilities to enter into agreements with independent power producers to help “derisk” their new generation investments, according to Sorgi.

“We are primed to act quickly once this proposed legislation becomes law,” he said.

PPL Electric Utilities estimates it will need about 7.5 GW of new generation in the next five to seven years, according to Sorgi.

“Given both federal and state support for new natural gas plants, natural gas pipeline expansion and streamlined siting and permitting, we are optimistic this generation can get built,” he said.

PPL estimates that it costs about $2.2 million to $2.5 million per MW to build a gas-fired combined cycle power plant, according to Sorgi.

The PJM Interconnection’s last two capacity auctions will increase customer bills by about $20 a month, without bringing new generation onto the grid, according to Sorgi.

“That was simply a transfer of wealth from utility customers to IPPs and to their shareholders,” Sorgi said. “What we’re seeing in the market today is contracting long-term deals with hyperscalers for nuclear capacity. I would expect that to continue.”

IPPs are reluctant to build new generation because it would cannibalize the value of their existing fleets by lowering capacity prices, according to Sorgi.

“So it’s not a surprise to us that the competitive markets are not delivering on this much needed generation,” he said.

Also, PJM’s interconnection queue has about 10 GW of new generation in Pennsylvania, with about 1.2 GW of dispatchable gas and nuclear generation, with the rest comprised of solar and batteries, according to Sorgi.

“We see real issues with the solar developers being able to get their projects completed,” he said. “So we’re clearly staring at a near-term supply and demand issue that we believe needs to be addressed ASAP.”

PPL expects its utilities in Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island will spend $20 billion in infrastructure improvements from 2025 to 2028, resulting in average annual rate base growth of 9.8%, according to Sorgi.

While PPL expects strong customer growth in Kentucky and Pennsylvania, weather-normalized sales at the company’s utilities in the states grew 0.5% in the second quarter and were essentially flat over the previous 12 months, according to the presentation.

In the second quarter, residential sales dipped 0.5% in Pennsylvania. Industrial sales fell 2.4% in Pennsylvania and 2.1% in Kentucky.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/_0xELEDrkWeciPEVzC4ffh6jtiWfycDG-f_E_qzkyZU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9QUExfRWxlY3RyaWNfVXRpbGl0aWVzXy1fU3RvbmVfQ2F1c2V3YXlfQ29uc3RydWN0aW9uX1Bob3RvXy1fUGF5bG9hZGVyX2FuZF9DYXVzZXdheS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-08-01 14:05:11.025328

The Power Bill Reduction Act eliminates the state’s 70% emissions-reduction target and grants Duke Energy the ability to charge customers upfront for new natural gas and nuclear power plants.
Proponents of the law, including House Republicans, Duke Energy, and the North Carolina Chamber, say it will provide more reliable energy and help avoid future price spikes.
“Duke Energy has had some issues that they’ve had to clean up, and that costs money,” McLucas said.
As implementation begins, state officials and energy providers will determine how the law’s changes affect customers, infrastructure planning, and North Carolina’s broader climate goals.","Washington D.C. — A controversial energy bill is now law in North Carolina after state lawmakers voted this week to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto.

The Power Bill Reduction Act eliminates the state’s 70% emissions-reduction target and grants Duke Energy the ability to charge customers upfront for new natural gas and nuclear power plants. It also allows changes to how customers are billed during peak energy usage hours.

Stein vetoed the bill earlier this month, citing concerns about rising costs and environmental impacts. Republican leaders in the General Assembly secured support from a few Democratic lawmakers to overturn the veto, enabling the bill to move forward.

Proponents of the law, including House Republicans, Duke Energy, and the North Carolina Chamber, say it will provide more reliable energy and help avoid future price spikes.

Garret Poorman, lead communications manager for Duke Energy, said in a statement, “We appreciate bipartisan efforts to keep costs as low as possible for customers and enable the always-on energy resources like carbon-free nuclear power that our communities need.”

Jeff Merrifield, a former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told The News & Observer that the legislation has the potential to drive investment in modern infrastructure.

He said, “Senate Bill 266 would allow utilities to invest in nuclear energy in a way that limits customer costs and prevents sudden rate increases when new facilities are brought online.”

Environmental advocates and energy policy experts argue the bill will lead to higher electricity bills and further reliance on fossil fuels.

Matt Abele, executive director of the North Carolina Sustainable Energy Association, said the legislation will result in “significant rate increases for customers all across the state of North Carolina.”

Jennifer McLucas, director of the Asheville-based nonprofit Green Built Alliance, said the burden of new construction and cleanup costs is being shifted to residential ratepayers.

“Duke Energy has had some issues that they’ve had to clean up, and that costs money,” McLucas said. “Why are those costs being put onto the shoulders of consumers who are already paying ridiculously high utility rates as it is?”

McLucas also noted that many households in western North Carolina are seeing double-digit rate increases, while Duke Energy’s executive team receives tens of millions of dollars in bonuses.

The law is expected to reshape North Carolina’s utility system for years to come. Supporters argue it lays the foundation for stable, long-term investment in nuclear and natural gas infrastructure. Critics warn it prioritizes corporate profit over affordability and climate action.

WEAs were originally established to identify offshore locations deemed most suitable for wind energy development.
NYPS started that process in 2023, determining a need for a coordinated transmission project to deliver between 4.77 and 8 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy into New York City.
Federal decisions to halt the permitting and construction of offshore wind generation platforms make achieving New York’s offshore wind goal impossible in the near term and undermine the central purpose of its transmission solicitation.
Trump’s Fight Against Clean Energy The Trump administration has tried everything to stop offshore wind development, including trying to get Equinor to stop work on the fully permitted Empire Wind.","The U.S. offshore wind industry has been treading deep water for quite some time now. This week, the Bureau of Ocean Management held its head under and finished the deed.

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) announced it is rescinding all designated Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). The action follows through on a pair of decrees from the Trump administration, Secretary’s Order (SO) 3437 (titled Ending Preferential Treatment for Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources in Department Decision-Making), and a Presidential Memorandum issued January 20, 2025, the wordy but apt Temporary Withdrawal of All Areas on the OCS from Offshore Wind Leasing and Review of the Federal Government’s Leasing and Permitting Practices for Wind Projects.

WEAs were originally established to identify offshore locations deemed most suitable for wind energy development. By rescinding them, BOEM is ending the federal practice of designating large areas of the OCS for wind development, and is de-designating more than 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.

Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, announced four policy measures “ending special treatment for unreliable energy sources, such as wind.” They included:

Stopping Preferential Treatment for Wind Projects: SO 3437 calls for identifying policies biased in favor of wind and solar energy and halting support for energy supply chains “controlled by foreign rivals.” In line with the January 20, 2025, Presidential Memorandum on Wind Energy, the department will review its policies to identify and remove “favoritism toward unreliable energy,” with a report of recommended reforms to be submitted under Section 5 of Executive Order 14315.

Restoring Congress’s Mandate to Consider All Uses of Our Public Lands and Waters Equally: Interior will consider withdrawing areas onshore with high potential for wind energy development to ensure compliance with legal requirements for multiple use and sustained yield of public lands. This means balancing energy development with other uses, such as recreation and grazing, and protecting BLM-managed lands, as envisioned by Congress. By terminating WEAs, the department says it is “safeguarding our coastal environments and local economies from unchecked development, while ensuring our power grids are not underpinned by unreliable, subsidized energy sources.”

Enhancing Stakeholder Engagement for Offshore Wind Development: Interior will strengthen its guidance to ensure more meaningful consultation regarding offshore wind development, especially with tribes, the fishing industry, and coastal towns. The construction and operation of offshore wind turbines have disproportionate impacts on these stakeholders, from disrupting commercial fishing to driving away tourism, the department argues, and by addressing current gaps this updated guidance is intended to “support greater collaboration, transparency, and respect for community and regional priorities.”

Reviewing the Consequences of Developing Wind Turbines on Migratory Birds: Interior will conduct a careful review of avian mortality rates associated with the development of wind energy projects located in migratory flight paths and determine whether such impacts qualify as “incidental” takings of birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and related laws. The department will also conduct a review of the applicable regulations to determine the appropriate approach to permitting these activities, identifying violations of the applicable statutes, and related penalties.

“These policy changes represent a commonsense approach to energy that puts Americans’ interests first,” stated Secretary Burgum. “Leveling the playing field in permitting supports energy development that’s reliable, affordable, and built to last. We’re also making sure tribes and local communities have a real seat at the table. This move is about responsible energy growth that works for every American.”

The Writing on the Wall

In late July, New York State pulled the plug on planning the massive transmission projects needed to bring offshore wind energy to shore, a harbinger of BOEM’s decision. The New York State Public Service Commission (NYPS) said canceling transmission plans would protect ratepayers from shouldering the burden of paying for a potential bridge to nowhere, citing “significant federal uncertainty” in the announcement of its strategic termination of its Public Policy Transmission Need (PPTN) process. NYPS started that process in 2023, determining a need for a coordinated transmission project to deliver between 4.77 and 8 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy into New York City.

Federal decisions to halt the permitting and construction of offshore wind generation platforms make achieving New York’s offshore wind goal impossible in the near term and undermine the central purpose of its transmission solicitation.

Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump instituted a sweeping moratorium on offshore wind development, likening turbines to “garbage in a field” that “litters” the country, assuring “no new windmills” would be built during his second term in office. The recently passed budget reconciliation bill championed by Trump disincentivizes both onshore and offshore development by shortening the window for developers to capitalize on tax credit incentives for wind projects. As one might expect, a growing list of well-intentioned developers has either paused work or pulled out of the U.S. market entirely.

In June, a federal judge in Massachusetts announced intent to deny a motion by the Trump administration to dismiss a lawsuit over its blocking of wind energy projects, siding with a coalition of state attorneys general. Led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., are suing in federal court to challenge Trump’s day one executive order halting leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.

Trump’s Fight Against Clean Energy

The Trump administration has tried everything to stop offshore wind development, including trying to get Equinor to stop work on the fully permitted Empire Wind. President Trumps oil lobby favoritism flies in the face of his “energy dominance” and “all-of-the-above” lip service, and his particular bloodlust against offshore wind development has already killed tens of thousands of jobs, jeopardized tens of billions of dollars in investments, and has ensured gigawatts of clean capacity will never reach the shores of power-constrained parts of the country during an “all-in” AI race (which, if you’re paying attention, we’ve already lost because China isn’t disconnecting power projects).

In the meantime, the very recently broadly respected U.S. Department of Energy has transformed itself into a disinformation mechanism that shills for coal we haven’t mined in eight decades and spreads outright lies about clean energy.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ChatGPT-Image-Aug-1-2025-09_52_57-AM.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 12:08:08.151101

As an explorer of lower-impact critical metals from seafloor polymetallic nodules, TMC has a dual mission: (1) supply metals for energy, defense, manufacturing, and infrastructure with net positive impacts compared to conventional production routes, and (2) trace, recover, and recycle the metals that they supply to help create a metal commons that can be used in perpetuity.

The company has conducted more than a decade of research into the environmental and social impacts of offshore nodule collection and onshore processing.

In May, TMC announced a $37 million registered direct offering through a securities purchase agreement with Michael Hess and his associated private investment vehicles. The financing will be used to advance the company’s deep-sea commercial development plans for critical metals essential to various industries and for general corporate purposes.

This financing comprises a Registered Direct Offering at $3 per share and warrants exercisable at $4.50 per share, with mandatory exercise if shares trade above $7 per share for 20 consecutive days. Proceeds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations through the potential issuance of a commercial recovery permit.

The investor group also brings decades of experience in large-scale resource development and deep global relationships across industry, government, and capital markets.

TMC’s Chairman and CEO, Gerard Barron, commented: “In recent weeks, both our company and the industry have made major strides. On April 24th, President Trump issued an Executive Order to accelerate seabed mining through expedited permitting, evaluation of offtake rights, and potential federal investment. Just days later, TMC submitted the world’s first commercial recovery application for nodules in international waters — more than two months ahead of schedule. We’re thrilled to welcome Michael Hess as a strategic partner. He brings over 15 years of exploration and production experience, as both an investor and operator, along with deep relationships across the US.”

Michael Hess also commented: “It is exciting to support the emergence of an entirely new resource category of ocean minerals and to help accelerate its development in service of the national interest.”

Funding prioritizes nuclear energy, critical minerals, and water infrastructure while slashing clean energy accounts.
The bill would eliminate the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) and cut the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) by nearly 50%, with an additional $20 million cut approved by amendment.
Several offices would see slight increases in their funding under the proposal, including the Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Energy, Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, and Office of the Inspector General.","July was a big month for federal energy and sustainability policy. A series of major actions out of Congress and the executive branch signaled significant shifts in direction — on everything from spending and permitting to trade, technology, and agency leadership. With competing FY26 spending bills advancing in the House and Senate, the divide over clean energy funding and climate priorities is becoming even more pronounced.

At the center of the action was President Trump’s signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill (H.R. 1) on July 4, which rewrites major portions of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and launches a new Energy Dominance Loan Program focused on boosting energy output and grid reliability. The administration also released a national AI and data center strategy aimed at accelerating infrastructure buildout, loosening permitting rules, and ramping up workforce development. At the same time, the Department of Defense announced a landmark $1 billion partnership to onshore the rare earth magnet supply chain, and the White House rolled out new tariffs targeting Chinese graphite.

Key personnel changes are also underway, with new nominations at FERC, DOE, and EPA pointing to a broader realignment of federal energy priorities. As we head into the fall, the pace of change is likely to pick up even more — especially with the FY26 budget deadline and potentially a required debt ceiling extension approaching in September.

The One Big Beautiful Bill

As noted in an article we put out earlier this month, President Donald Trump signed H.R. 1 — the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) — into law on July 4, 2025, making significant changes to energy tax provisions enacted under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The bill also establishes the Energy Dominance Loan Program, expanding Section 1706 loan authority to support projects that increase energy output or improve grid reliability, without requiring emissions reductions or technical innovation. Backed by a $1 billion credit subsidy through 2028, the program could enable up to $15 billion in loans across the energy and critical minerals supply chain, though nuclear projects may rapidly absorb this capacity.

FY26 Appropriations Update

On July 24, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $38.6 billion package to fund EPA, the Interior Department, and related agencies — $600 million above the House GOP’s version. EPA would receive $8.6 billion, a 6% cut from FY25 but much less severe than the 23% cut proposed by House Republicans. Meanwhile, EPA is undergoing internal restructuring, merging its Office of the Chief Financial Officer with Mission Support and continuing layoffs and buyout offers. The Department of the Interior would receive $15.1 billion, a 2% reduction, aligned with House levels but significantly above the $10.5 billion White House request.

On July 17, the House Appropriations Committee passed a $57.3 billion energy and water spending bill, including $48.8 billion for the Department of Energy — $1.4 billion below FY25 levels. Funding prioritizes nuclear energy, critical minerals, and water infrastructure while slashing clean energy accounts. The bill would eliminate the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) and cut the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) by nearly 50%, with an additional $20 million cut approved by amendment. The Office of Fossil Energy would also see a major decrease in funding under the bill, though Republicans said the office would be refocused on “reliable, efficient, and cost effective” fossil fuel generation and critical minerals.

Several offices would see slight increases in their funding under the proposal, including the Office of Science, Office of Nuclear Energy, Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs, and Office of the Inspector General. Republicans said the increase for the Office of Science would allow DOE to accelerate research into quantum computing, AI, and fusion energy. The Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response would be kept flat. The bill largely maintains funding for the Loan Programs Office (LPO), with a $150 million boost in the credit subsidy for the nuclear energy projects under the Title 17 Innovative Technology Loan Guarantee Program.

The bill would also rescind $5.1 billion in unobligated balances from Bipartisan Infrastructure Law programs, including for clean hydrogen hubs, direct air capture hubs, and carbon dioxide transportation infrastructure. The $5.1 billion would be redirected to the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program.

DOE has continued to emphasize nuclear, and recently announced the start of a new pilot program to accelerate the development of advanced nuclear reactors and strengthen domestic supply chains for nuclear fuel. DOE issued a Request for Application (RFA) and is seeking qualified US companies to build and operate nuclear fuel production lines using the DOE authorization process. Initial applications are due by August 15, 2025, with subsequent applications allowed on a rolling basis.

The Senate is expected to strip many of the House’s cuts and policy riders, and a continuing resolution may be needed if Congress doesn’t pass appropriations bills by the September 30 deadline.

New Permitting Landscape

The Department of the Interior announced that all wind and solar projects now need Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s personal sign-off to receive permits, including leases, rights-of-way, construction and operation plans, grants, consultations, and biological opinions. Interior also eliminated longstanding right-of-way and capacity fee discounts for existing and future wind and solar projects, and said it will be reviewing all regulations within 45 days to identify any preferential treatment for renewables over dispatchable energy sources.

DOE’s Loan Programs Office also terminated a pending $4.9 billion loan guarantee for the Grain Belt Express project, a fully permitted transmission line intended to carry mostly wind-generated power across Kansas and Missouri. DOE is conducting a review of every applicant and borrower “to ensure every single taxpayer dollar is being used to advance the best interest of the American people.”

Simultaneously, multiple agencies — including Interior, Energy, Defense, and Agriculture — are revising NEPA procedures via interim final rules, bypassing typical notice-and-comment periods. Key changes include eliminating draft environmental impact statements and narrowing the scope of environmental impacts that must be considered.

Congressional Republican leadership has also stated that the GOP will prioritize advancing bipartisan permitting legislation this fall. On July 25, House Natural Resources Committee Chair Bruce Westerman (R-AK) and Rep. Jared Golden (D-ME) introduced the Standardizing Permitting and Expediting Economic Development Act or SPEED Act. The bill would target NEPA by simplifying the scope of review by removing requirements to consider or conduct new scientific or technical research. The text would mandate that federal agencies are not permitted to delay the issuance of an environmental review document or decision on the basis of waiting for new scientific research to be released, and would limit reviews to only considering environmental impacts that “share a reasonably close causal relationship to and are proximately caused by” the immediate project or action undergoing the permitting process. Representative Westerman attempted to push through similar permitting reforms during the last Congress, working alongside Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and then-Sen. Joe Manchin (I-WV).

White House AI and Data Center Action Plan

On July 23, the White House released a sweeping AI Action Plan designed to cement US leadership in artificial intelligence through deregulation, infrastructure expansion, and global tech diplomacy. The AI Action Plan calls for expedited permitting for data centers and chip fabs, and national workforce initiatives to fill high-demand roles like electricians and HVAC technicians. The blueprint recommends establishing new categorical exclusions under NEPA to cover data center–related actions that normally do not have a significant effect on the environment. It also recommends speeding environmental permitting by streamlining or reducing regulations set forth by laws including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. The plan further suggests directing agencies with significant land portfolios to make federal lands available for data center and power generation infrastructure construction. Subsequently, DOE announced the selection of four sites — Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge Reservation, Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, and Savannah River Site — for AI data center and energy infrastructure development. More detail can be read in our article here.

New Tariffs on Chinese Graphite

The Trump administration announced preliminary tariffs on Chinese imports of graphite active anode material, following a Commerce Department finding that Chinese firms are dumping the product in the US at unfairly low prices. This determination, prompted by a coalition of North American producers, led to a 93.5% antidumping duty — lower than the 900% sought but still a significant win for domestic companies, who argue China’s market manipulation is undermining US industry. The effective tariff rate now totals about 160% when combined with earlier duties and tariffs, and further increases may result from the administration’s ongoing Section 232 investigation into critical mineral imports.

DoD Commits Over $1 Billion to Build US Rare Earth Magnet Supply Chain

The Department of Defense (DoD) announced a landmark public-private partnership with MP Materials, committing over $900 million in funding and financing to expand domestic rare earth magnet production and reduce dependence on China. The deal includes $400 million in equity investment, a potential $350 million in additional equity, and a $150 million loan to expand heavy rare earth processing — specifically samarium — at MP’s Mountain Pass facility. It also establishes a second US-based magnet manufacturing site (“10X Facility”), a 10-year price floor for neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr), and a long-term offtake agreement for all magnet output. In exchange, the DoD secured equity rights of up to 15% of MP’s shares and placed strict national security controls on future foreign transactions, including ending ties with Chinese-linked Shenghe Resources by 2026.

This agreement, one of the largest Defense Production Act investments to date, is expected to catalyze more than $1 billion in private capital, including $600 million from MP and $1 billion in committed debt financing. The partnership aims to close the strategic gap in rare earth magnet manufacturing — an area where China holds over 90% of global capacity — by creating a vertically integrated US supply chain. While the deal provides a major boost to US critical minerals resilience, it also ties MP’s future closely to federal procurement and funding stability, signaling a new model for national security–driven industrial policy.

FERC and Other Nominations

President Trump nominated David LaCerte to serve on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shifting FERC to a Republican majority. LaCerte currently works as the principal White House liaison and senior adviser to the Office of Personnel Management’s director and was a contributor for Project 2025. Prior to joining OPM, LaCerte was a special counsel at Baker Botts, where he was involved in some energy litigation, and he served as senior adviser and executive counsel at the US Chemical Safety Board. However, some FERC officials point out that this isn’t the typical background for commissioners at FERC.

The Senate also confirmed Wells Griffith as DOE Under Secretary for Energy and Aaron Szabo as Assistant Administrator for EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation, which has responsibility for the Energy Star program.

The document released July 29 outlines the Trump administration's rationale for revoking a foundational scientific ruling that underpins the government's authority to combat climate change.

The paper was written by a working group including John Christy and Judith Curry, who have both in the past been linked to The Heartland Institute, an advocacy group that frequently pushes back against the scientific consensus on climate change.

It ""completely misrepresents my work,"" Benjamin Santer, atmospheric scientist and honorary professor in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia in Britain, told AFP.

Santer said a section of the report on ""stratospheric cooling"" contradicted his findings while citing his research on climate ""fingerprinting,"" a scientific method that seeks to separate human and natural climate change, as evidence for its analysis.

AFP and other media, including NOTUS, a US digital news website affiliated with the nonprofit Allbritton Journalism Institute, found inaccurate citations, flawed analysis and editorial errors across the document.

This is the third time since January, when Donald Trump took office, that scientists have told AFP a government agency has misrepresented academic work to defend their policies.

Previous instances included made up citations in the government's ""Make America Healthy Again"" report, which the administration then rushed to edit.

""I am concerned that a government agency has published a report, which is intended to inform the public and guide policy, without undergoing a rigorous peer-review process, while misinterpreting many studies that have been peer-reviewed,"" Bor-Ting Jong, an assistant professor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam in the Netherlands, told AFP.

Jong said the paper made false statements about the climate model her team examined and used different terminology that led to a flawed analysis of her findings.

On Bluesky, the budding social media platform favored by academics, other researchers in atmospheric and extreme weather fields also deplored that the DoE document cherry-picked data and omitted or plainly distorted their academic findings.

James Rae, a climate researcher at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, who said his work is also misrepresented in the report, told AFP the shift in how the department uses scientific research ""is really chilling.""

""DoE was at the forefront of science for decades. Whereas this report reads like an undergraduate exercise in misrepresenting climate science,"" he said.

Contacted by AFP, a DoE spokesperson said the report was reviewed internally by a group of scientific researchers and policy experts from the Office of Science and National Labs.

The public will now have the opportunity to comment on the document before it is finalized for the Federal Register.

""The Climate Working Group and the Energy Department look forward to engaging with substantive comments following the conclusion of the 30-day comment period,"" the department added.

Kamloops, British Columbia, is a radiant place, receiving over 3,100 hours of sunshine a year. So it’s no wonder that in 2016, Thompson Rivers University (TRU) decided to harness all that luminescence and convert it to electricity.

If the university’s solar array had been installed on a roof or mounted above ground in a corner of a soccer field, that probably would have been the end of the story. Instead, TRU didn’t follow trends — it set one: It became the first place in Canada to embed solar panels into the ground. By 2017, a 12-meter walkway with 16 solar modules near the campus daycare, together with a compass (sunburst) design of 62 modules in front of the arts and education building, were producing power. By its second summer of operation, the compass produced enough electricity to power an entire classroom of computers at TRU’s arts and education building for the day.

For Amie Schellenberg, an electrical instructor at TRU and part of the team that spearheaded the sidewalks, ground-mounted solar arrays just make sense.

“Why wouldn’t we use the space we already have?” she asks. “We don’t need to create new space, or repurpose anything. We don’t need to plow fields or redo rooftops — the ground is there.” Historically, solar panels have been mounted above ground, typically on roofs or in gigantic solar parks. But wide-open spaces and sunlit rooftops aren’t always an option in cities.

“It’s hard to integrate traditional rooftop solar into urban centers,” says Gilbert Michaud, chair of the American Solar Energy Society’s policy division. “Buildings shade each other and condo buildings may have restricted HOA policies. It makes it really hard for people in urban environments to install solar, even though population centers have a demand for cool energy and want to see it.”

This is where in-ground solar shines. In 2021, the city of Barcelona installed Spain’s first photovoltaic (PV) pavement as part of the city’s goal to become climate neutral by 2030. In the Netherlands, an embedded 400-meter solar sidewalk in front of Groningen Town Hall is powering the building as part of that city’s ambition of becoming CO2 neutral by 2035. The project is part of the European Union’s Making City project, which aims to develop positive energy districts (PEDs) that demonstrate innovative solutions to tackle climate-neutral goals. The 400-square-meter installation is projected to offset approximately 18 tons of CO2 annually. “It is an example of how to use space in the city in a smart and sustainable way,” Philip Broeksma, councilor of energy from the Municipality of Groningen said when the sidewalks were revealed in 2023.

With places around the world looking to produce more solar energy, the question is: Can in-ground solar be scaled to meet demand?

Most solar installs are fixed tilts at a 45-degree angle, Michaud explains. “Larger installations [such as solar farms] move with the sun to capture as much light as possible. A horizontal sidewalk is much less efficient,” he says.

Not everyone agrees. Pavegen, a U.K.-based company, has combined the concept of in-ground solar tiles with the kinetic energy generated by people’s footsteps. When someone walks across the tile, a mechanism underneath it triggers an electric current that generates power.

“An example of kinetic [foot power] alone in Yosemite National Park has exceeded 35 million joules of energy. That’s equivalent to around 9,000 kilometers on an e-bike, or 10,000 hours of talk-time on a standard smartphone,” says Paul Price, head of marketing and communications for Pavegen. “When the tiles capture solar energy, they generate 30 times more.”

Pavegen’s Solar+ system, which uses the combined power of solar energy and kinetic energy, is poised for large-scale distribution this fall. Suited for integration into school campuses and city promenades, it will be able to power everything from LED streetlights to digital devices.

But how durable is the surface of a solar panel? The solar paths at TRU were covered with an epoxy and finished with a gritty, anti-slip surface that felt spongy to walk on, but this still wasn’t enough to protect the array from a Canadian winter.

“We do get snow every winter,” Schellenberg says. “And to be honest, every year, something new happened, whether it was a piece of rail that lifted off, or a couple of fasteners, or there was some water seepage underneath.”

Since the installation of TRU’s sidewalks, technology has advanced, and according to Price, companies such as Pavegen now design installations with integrated drainage channels beneath the sub-frame, ensuring water flows away efficiently and doesn’t compromise performance or safety. But despite this, installing inground solar tiles is no easy feat.

At TRU, troughs had to be cut into the concrete for wires that connect the array to the university’s electrical grid. Solar panels generate DC (direct current) electricity, so an inverter cabinet, to convert the current to usable AC (alternating current), was installed inside the arts and education building. These infrastructure changes aren’t cheap. A sustainability grant of $35,000 Canadian from the university covered the cost, not including the panels, which were donated. Schellenberg says the power generated from the sidewalks has offset this cost and it all has broken even financially. Still, she and Michaud concur that, as things stand now, in-ground solar in North America can be expensive and may lack electrical efficiency. The good news is that they both see change on the horizon.

“As the technology gets better, costs go down, and as policies are adopted, including tax credits, it becomes much more feasible,” Michaud says. Schellenberg imagines unlimited possibilities for the technology, both big and small. “An unused corner of a Walmart parking lot could become a solar-generating hub,” she muses.

In fact, this is an idea that has already reaped dividends in Moult, France. The Lidl supermarket has installed 50 square meters of in-ground solar panels in a back corner of its parking lot to reduce its energy bill. In one year, the panels produced the equivalent of 7,000 hours of use for five cash registers.

As fossil fuel-powered vehicles become antiquated and EVs increase in popularity, Schellenberg sees wireless in-ground solar EV charging stations becoming commonplace. “This could be the boost that those EVs need to make it the next 100 kilometers,” she notes.

In Amsterdam and Paris, this is already proving successful. Select bus stops and terminals are embedded with solar panels that collect energy and store it in batteries below the surface. As an electric bus pulls into the stop to pick up passengers, it’s able to draw power from the embedded system and top up its charge without needing to return to the central depot. A single charging point can produce 15 to 20 kilowatt-hours per day, enough to power a bus for several kilometers.

At TRU, the in-ground solar arrays were a prototype and never meant to produce a lot of power. In the six years they were operational (2016 to 2022), they generated just enough electricity to power a single home for half a year. To put this into perspective, Topaz Solar Farm in San Luis Obispo County, California, is the largest in the U.S., spanning 4,700 acres. Over nine million above-ground mounted solar panels supply power to approximately 180,000 homes.

By 2023, the sidewalks had stopped producing power and couldn’t be maintained, but they weren’t removed. Schellenberg hopes that when people see them, they are inspired to think outside the box. She’s proud of the project and doesn’t measure its success in kilowatt hours but rather in what’s possible when it comes to renewable energy solutions. “It is another extension of finding ways to solve problems,” she says.",https://www.planetizen.com/files/images/RTBC-Solar-Pavegen-Footsteps-photo-credit-Pavegen-scaled-e1753723827541-1110x500.jpeg,N,,2025-08-01 13:05:07.660272

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”) limits future opportunities for some of the clean energy tax credits previously enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”). During the election campaign President Trump expressed a strong interest for a complete repeal of the IRA credit provisions. Many pundits expressed their belief that any changes to the IRA would be more reflective of a scalpel than a sledgehammer. The final legislation lands somewhere in between, but with a preference for those technologies that can provide continuous power (e.g., nuclear and geothermal) over the intermittent power technologies (e.g., wind and solar).

Below are some of the key changes applicable to renewable energy investors and developers made in the OBBBA:

Wind and Solar

Wind and solar projects under Code Sections 45Y and 48E were particularly impacted by the OBBBA. Such projects must be placed in service by December 31, 2027, in order to remain eligible for the production or investment tax credits. A safe harbor is available for wind and solar projects that “begin construction” on or before July 4, 2026, however.

Notably, an Executive Order was issued on July 7, 2025, directing the Department of the Treasury to, within 45 days following the enactment of the OBBBA, “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” Such action includes issuing guidance relating to the “beginning of construction” standard to limit the existing safe harbors with respect to the beginning of construction. Such guidance may not be in line with previously issued notices and may make the requirements for the beginning of construction much stricter.

Other Technology Neutral Clean Energy Credits

The technology neutral credits received a slightly shortened timeline for new clean energy projects, with the credit eligibility phaseout beginning after 2032 (other than for wind and solar).

Certain domestic content requirements for clean energy facilities were introduced in the OBBBA, raising the domestic content minimums from 40% to 45% for projects beginning construction after June 12, 2025, and incrementally thereafter up to 55% starting in 2027.

Carbon Sequestration

The credit for the sequestration of carbon oxides received a surprising benefit in bringing long sought after parity within the 45Q credit. As a result of the OBBBA, the $85 per metric ton credit ($180 for direct air capture) previously only available for carbon oxides permanently sequestered, and not used in enhanced oil or natural gas recovery projects, will also apply to projects placed in service after July 4, 2025, that (i) use the permanently sequestered carbon oxides in EOR projects or (ii) utilize carbon oxides in other permitted forms. This represents an increase from the prior $60 per ton credit for such uses.

Clean Transportation Fuel Production

Code Sections 45Z and 40A (relating to small agri-biodiesel producers) received a much-needed extension, permitting such fuel producers to receive credits for sales taking place on or prior to December 31, 2026, in the case of small agri-biodiesel producers and December 31, 2029, for transportation fuel producers. The credit is limited, however, to fuels produced from feedstocks derived in the US, Canada, and Mexico.

Limitation of Covered Nation Influence

The OBBBA takes a strong stance against the ownership, control, and influence of clean energy projects by North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran. Specifically, tax credits will be prohibited for “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities,” such as entities owned or controlled by foreign entities of concern, terroristic organizations, and entities controlled by governments, agencies, or citizens of North Korea, China, Russia, or Iran. The application of these limitations are phased in differently among the credits.

The production tax credit and investment tax credit are saddled with a limitation on components used to construct facilities and equipment in addition to the domestic content rules. Such facilities will be subject to increasing limitations with respect to materials acquired from specified foreign entities, with more stringent limits applied to energy storage. This “material assistance” limitation provides for a safe harbor for facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2026.

Additionally, no longer will transfers of tax credits to specified foreign entities be permitted under Code Section 6418.

The Executive Order issued on July 7, 2025, also directed the Department of the Treasury to, within 45 days following the enactment of the OBBBA, “take prompt action” to implement the “Foreign Entity of Concern” restrictions in the OBBBA.

Other Reduced Credits Include:

The credit for alternative fuel vehicle refueling property (e.g., biofuel refueling property as well as charging stations for electric vehicles) will now only be available for property placed in service by June 30, 2026.

The deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings will now only be available for property for which construction has begun by June 30, 2026.

The clean hydrogen production credit will now only be available for any facility that begins construction before January 2, 2028.

A new 16-page issue brief by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies warns that federal industrial policy investments aimed at advancing economic opportunity for Black communities are under threat, as the Trump administration eliminates key diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) provisions and slows the disbursement of funding.

Authored by policy analyst Dr. Gabrielle Smith Finnie, the report, “Shifting the Narrative on Industrial Policy: Opportunities for Genuine Economic Mobility and Good Jobs for Black Communities,” examines how recent federal investments—through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—offered a historic opportunity to increase Black access to “good jobs” in high-growth industries like manufacturing, clean energy, and technology. “These investments offer a window to increase Black workers’ access to ‘good jobs’—jobs that offer family-sustaining wages, benefits, wraparound supports, and career advancement opportunities,” Dr. Smith Finnie wrote.

The IIJA, signed into law in 2021, authorized $1.2 trillion to modernize roads, bridges, and broadband infrastructure. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 invested $280 billion to strengthen the semiconductor industry and build a skilled workforce. The IRA, also passed in 2022, used tax credits and grants to support clean energy projects, particularly in low-income areas and communities harmed by pollution. The report notes that these laws included intentional equity components—such as labor protections, apprenticeship incentives, environmental justice programs, and wraparound workforce services—but many of those components are now being rolled back or underfunded.

“In 2025, the Trump administration eliminated many of the diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in industrial policy legislation,” the report states. “Currently, significant funding is being slowly dispersed, paused, or clawed back, impacting the economic mobility of Black workers.” According to the Joint Center, the programs have already reached over 99 percent of high-poverty counties. Cities with large Black populations, including Baltimore, Augusta, New Orleans, and Raleigh, were among those set to receive millions to improve infrastructure and launch workforce development hubs through community colleges.

In Detroit, IIJA funding is being used for the I-375 Community Reconnection Project to reconnect two historically Black neighborhoods severed by highway construction. Under the CHIPS Act, the Department of Commerce awarded $184 million to six Recompete Pilot Program finalists, including $20 million to Reinvest Birmingham, which is scaling up workforce development and transportation access to reduce the city’s high Black unemployment rate. The IRA directed approximately $55 billion to reduce local pollution and support environmental justice efforts. Seventy percent of clean energy investments under the law have been in counties with lower employment rates, 78 percent in areas with below-median household incomes, and 86 percent in regions with below-average college graduation rates.

In Prince George’s County, Maryland, a majority-Black jurisdiction, ten communities will receive $20 million through the Environmental and Climate Justice Program to support climate resilience, reduce energy costs, and grow a clean energy workforce. Despite these investments, the Joint Center found that many Black-led and Black-allied organizations remain under-informed and under-resourced. A foundational network of eight such organizations participated in the project, with 60 percent engaged in federal policy. Yet most expressed unfamiliarity with the industrial policy agenda and cited barriers, including limited staff, insufficient technical support, and a lack of targeted outreach.

Participants had applied for broadband grants and climate-related funding but struggled to navigate the complex process or receive adequate guidance. To address these gaps, the Joint Center hosted virtual sessions with policy experts from academia and the Biden administration, providing opportunities to learn about funding pathways, federal priorities, and equity initiatives. The report provides a set of messaging principles for Black-led and Black-allied organizations, including the importance of highlighting Black workers’ economic contributions, addressing historic exclusion from skilled trades, and advocating for place-based investments and better data tracking. “Industrial policy must ensure our communities have clear access to good jobs, high wages, and meaningful training opportunities,” the report states.

It also calls on funders to support Black-led research, researchers to track equity outcomes, employers to implement fair hiring and advancement practices, and training providers to build accessible career pathways in technology and manufacturing. “Funding and workforce development opportunities must be accessible for Black workers and Black-led and allied organizations,” the brief states. “Defunding industrial programs now would reduce opportunities for Black workers to thrive and take part in the industrial sector before these initiatives take root.”

The U.S. economy added just 73,000 jobs in July, continuing a three-month trend of sluggish growth, according to the latest data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The national unemployment rate held steady at 4.2 percent, with little movement across key sectors.

While health care and social assistance industries posted modest gains, federal government employment continued its decline, shedding 12,000 jobs in July and bringing total losses in the sector to 84,000 since January. The overall number of unemployed individuals stood at 7.2 million in July. Black workers continued to face a disproportionately high unemployment rate at 7.2 percent—nearly double the rate for white workers, which remained at 3.7 percent. Hispanic workers saw a jobless rate of 5.0 percent, while Asian workers had a jobless rate of 3.9 percent.

Teenagers experienced the highest unemployment rate of any group at 15.2 percent, while adult men and women reported 4.0 percent and 3.7 percent unemployment, respectively. The labor force participation rate remained at 62.2 percent, continuing a yearlong decline of 0.5 percentage points. The employment-population ratio also changed little, standing at 59.6 percent, down 0.4 percentage points over the past year.

The number of people unemployed for 27 weeks or longer rose to 1.8 million in July, an increase of 179,000, and now accounts for nearly one-quarter of all unemployed individuals. Meanwhile, the number of new entrants to the labor market—those looking for their first job—rose by 275,000 to 985,000. Wage growth continued modestly. Average hourly earnings for all private-sector non-farm employees increased by 12 cents to $36.44, marking a 3.9 percent increase over the past 12 months. Production and nonsupervisory workers saw average hourly wages rise by 8 cents to $31.34.

Job gains were most notable in the health care sector, which added 55,000 positions, including 34,000 in ambulatory services and 16,000 in hospitals. Social assistance added 18,000 jobs, primarily driven by a 21,000 increase in individual and family services. But nearly all other major industries—including manufacturing, construction, retail, professional services, and transportation—saw little to no job growth.

The average workweek for all employees edged up slightly to 34.3 hours. For production and nonsupervisory workers, the workweek increased to 33.7 hours. Revisions to previous reports revealed a much weaker job market than initially reported. The May payroll number was revised down by 125,000 to 19,000 jobs, and June’s total was lowered by 133,000 to just 14,000. Combined, these adjustments wiped out 258,000 jobs from prior estimates. The BLS noted that employees on paid leave or receiving ongoing severance are still counted as employed in their surveys.

The following employment report, covering August 2025, is scheduled for release on Friday, September 5.

Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries flew to Austin, Texas, today to address Texas redistricting. Republicans who control the legislature and the Governor’s Mansion in Texas are working to redraw the congressional district lines after President Trump stated that he thought that five more congressional seats could be created. “Donald Trump ordered Governor Greg Abbott and Texas Republicans to race back to Austin for a special legislative session,” Leader Jeffries said, standing in front of a group of congressional and Texas elected officials.

“Our message to the people of Texas and to this great country is simple: You deserve better,” he added. The Democratic Leader spoke on how the special session called to focus on redrawing congressional maps to make it harder for Democrats to win should be focused on how people will be impacted by changes to their health care because of the passage of the Trump tax plan. The bill was signed into law on July 4. “This session should be about fixing Texas’ broken health care system,” Leader Jeffries, in part, stated.

Texas Republicans gerrymandered a map that revealed a new map that made many congressional maps. Before Texas redistricting, the breakdown on the Congressional map was 25 GOP seats and 13 Dem seats. After the proposed maps, the breakdown would be 30 GOP-leaning seats and 8 Dem-leaning seats. “It is time we all fight hard… If the Republicans say they’re going to gain five seats in Texas, I say we gain 30 seats in New York, California, and Virginia… in Colorado,” said attorney Marc Elias on MSNBC on July 30. Elians has worked on voting rights law at the pro-democracy organization Democracy Docket.

The fight over the maps in Texas will likely reverberate in other states. California Governor Gavin Newsom is signaling that he is considering a mid-decade round of redistricting. The Texas Tribune reported yesterday that Gov. Newsom “has told aides he will move forward with a plan to redraw his state’s congressional lines to install more Democrats if Texas Republicans pass their own updated map.”

The redistricting issues could cause other political dominos to fall in other states, such as Illinois.

A new Harris Poll report reveals that while Americans overwhelmingly view skilled trades as essential to society, they also believe the field is undervalued, overlooked in schools, and facing a generational perception gap that could deepen the labor shortage crisis already gripping the nation.

According to the poll, conducted June 20–22, 2025, among 2,203 adults nationwide, 91% agree that skilled trade jobs are just as important as white-collar jobs, with 63% strongly agreeing. Still, 86% say skilled trade careers are overlooked in today’s educational system, and 90% believe most people don’t realize how lucrative these careers can be. “Skilled trades offer real career potential, but they’re not being talked about enough in schools or by society at large,” said Wendy Salomon, one of the report’s authors at Harris Poll’s Corporate Strategy & Reputation Practice. Despite their crucial role in the economy—from electricians and HVAC technicians to mechanics and welders—skilled trades struggle with image and awareness issues. Younger Americans appear less confident in the opportunities that trades provide. Only 38% of Gen Z respondents said skilled trades offer the best job prospects today, compared to 59% of Baby Boomers. Just 36% of Gen Z strongly agree that skilled trades offer a faster and more affordable path to a good career. The data shows a steep generational divide. While older Americans tend to view trade jobs as viable, even preferable career paths, many younger Americans are deterred by factors such as societal prestige, college pressure, and uncertainty about pay. Gen Z respondents also pointed to concerns about automation, job security, and inflexible work structures.

Black Americans were significantly more likely to cite a lack of visible role models as a significant barrier to entering the trades, suggesting that diversity and representation remain challenges in an industry that is still perceived by some as exclusionary. Even with these barriers, the report found a sharp contrast between perception and reality. Career paths in technology and healthcare dominated perceptions of opportunity, but skilled trades were still among the top five across all generations. Among Boomers, they ranked second only to tech. And even Gen Z ranked skilled trades above careers in law, teaching, and finance. One striking finding: a majority of Americans now say they would advise high school graduates to pursue a vocational or trade school path over a traditional four-year college. Only 36% of Gen Z would recommend college over trades. That figure rises steadily with age, with 41% of Boomers backing trade school routes for graduating seniors.

Corporate America is also being called to act. Nine in ten Americans said they have a more favorable opinion of companies that support skilled trades. That sentiment is strong across age groups, political identities, and racial demographics. Respondents said companies should offer hands-on school programs, paid internships, scholarships, and mentorship opportunities. “Skilled labor shortages are not theoretical—they’re disrupting industries today,” the report stated. “Corporate America has a clear mandate. Support the trades not just as a philanthropic gesture, but as a strategic investment.” The poll suggests that employers who step in to fund scholarships, partner with schools, or provide training and apprenticeships can not only build brand loyalty but also ensure a more stable future workforce. “There’s a myth that the trades are for people who couldn’t succeed elsewhere,” said Salomon. “That myth needs to die. These are skilled, in-demand careers that require intelligence, adaptability, and resilience.”

A new report from the Prison Policy Initiative reveals how President Donald Trump’s administration is driving mass deportation by secretly using local jails—even in places with sanctuary policies—to detain immigrants. The report, Hiding in Plain Sight: How Local Jails Obscure and Facilitate Mass Deportation Under Trump, details how these local facilities, through contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service, have become a critical infrastructure in Trump’s deportation strategy.

Building on the organization’s previous work explaining how county jails enable state and federal incarceration, this latest analysis breaks down the overlap between local criminal justice systems and federal immigration enforcement. The report also provides extensive data tables showing the level of involvement in every state and in over 600 specific jails. “The Trump administration is circumventing city and county sanctuary policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities,” the report said. “It accomplishes this through a longstanding loophole: ICE and other federal agencies can refer people for federal prosecution on immigration-related ‘crimes’ and thus use local jails’ contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service in sanctuary cities, counties, and states.” This strategy, according to the report, turns civil immigration matters into criminal cases, thereby allowing the federal government to detain people in local jails even where sanctuary laws are on the books. As a result, local communities are unknowingly participating in federal deportation efforts.

The report also makes clear that ICE’s official numbers don’t reflect the full scale of immigrant detention in the United States. While ICE reported an average daily population of 57,200 in June 2025, the actual count—including people facing immigration-related criminal charges, those held on ICE detainers, and individuals confined in state-run facilities or overnight hold rooms—reaches approximately 83,400, a 45 percent increase over ICE’s published figures. “Many cities and states have tried to offer sanctuary for immigrants by refusing to rent jail space to ICE and opting out of the 287(g) program, but it is not enough,” said Jacob Kang-Brown, author of the report. “The Trump administration is leveraging jails at a new scale, using local contracts with the U.S. Marshals Service and existing policing practices in order to expand detention.”

Since Trump’s return to office in January, 45 percent of all ICE arrests have occurred in jails. The report explains how ICE capitalizes on local arrests, often for minor offenses that wouldn’t result in jail time for U.S. citizens, such as driving without a license, to target immigrants. These arrests, the report notes, create a misleading appearance that ICE is focused on serious criminal activity, when in fact most detainees have little or no criminal history. The report offers reporters and advocates access to detailed data that shows how many people are held for ICE and the U.S. Marshals in hundreds of facilities, including the change in these populations over time. It includes the share of detained immigrants in each state held by local jails, the rates of ICE arrests occurring in jails compared to other locations, and the growing number of immigrants arrested by the U.S. Marshals on charges related to immigration status. The report also includes information on per-diem payments made by the U.S. Marshals to local jails in exchange for housing federal detainees.

It concludes by urging counties to end all collaboration with federal immigration enforcement agencies, including the U.S. Marshals Service, which holds contracts with nearly 1,000 local jails nationwide. “Via their jails, local governments are—intentionally or not—providing the infrastructure for a massive attack on immigrants,” the report said. “But by resisting cooperation with President Trump’s racist deportation machine, counties and states also have the power to contain it.”

Fifty cities from 33 countries have been named global finalists in the ongoing Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge, with each municipality receiving $50,000 to prototype bold, resident-centered ideas aimed at tackling critical urban challenges. In January 2026, 25 of the finalist cities will be selected to receive $1 million each and additional support to bring their solutions to life.

Now in its sixth cycle, the Mayors Challenge remains a cornerstone of Bloomberg Philanthropies’ mission to accelerate innovation in local government. More than 630 cities applied to this round, representing over 80 million residents. Finalist proposals focus on expanding green space, improving youth safety, reducing energy costs, and using artificial intelligence to enhance city services. “Local government is where people meet policy—and where government improves lives and builds trust,” said James Anderson, who leads the Government Innovation program at Bloomberg Philanthropies. “That’s why municipal innovation isn’t about grand gestures—it’s about solving hard problems under pressure, often with imperfect tools and finite resources. These Mayors Challenge finalists stand out because they’re not just thinking creatively—they’re designing solutions that reckon with the complexity of implementation and the urgency of their residents’ needs. Their proposals reflect a new standard for public sector achievement: ambitious, yes, but also grounded, disciplined, and ripe for real impact.” Each finalist will participate in Bloomberg Philanthropies’ Ideas Camp in July, where city leaders will test and refine their ideas with guidance from experts and peers.

“Bloomberg Philanthropies has provided invaluable support for cities to develop and implement innovative solutions that improve the lives of residents in ways they can feel,” said Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit. Detroit is honored to be among the 50 municipalities selected from over 630 applications for the organization’s Mayors Challenge. As a finalist, we will work with renowned experts and peers to advance our proposal to create a powerful, single entry that connects currently scattered information – such as inspection dates, taxes, and utilities – on all 400,000 Detroit properties to revolutionize how owners can access this vital information, as well as how our city plans and provides its most essential services.” “Thank you to Bloomberg Philanthropies for seeing our vision to improve the quality of life for seniors across our city,” said Mayor Mike Spano of Yonkers, New York. “We are honored to be among 50 finalists selected for the prestigious global Mayors Challenge competition. As a finalist, we will look to create a fully sustainable model for community engagement – marshaling public and private partners as well as residents and students – coupled with innovative technology and tools to enable many more to age safely and gracefully in place.”

“Seoul is honored to be selected as one of the 50 finalists for the Bloomberg Philanthropies Mayors Challenge competition,” said Mayor Oh Se-hoon of Seoul, South Korea. “As a finalist, we will further our proposal to launch powerful educational campaigns and new support systems that will protect youth safety and prevent online child exploitation through the development of an AI-based mobile app that detects risks and alerts parents, while working alongside other cities to set a new standard for the future of urban policy.” “Local government and mayors’ offices are the beating heart of innovation and change in our urban environments,” said Professor Lesley Lokko OBE, founder and chair of the African Futures Institute and a 2025 Mayors Challenge advisory committee member. “It has been an honour to join Bloomberg Philanthropies’ advisory committee for the organization’s sixth Mayors Challenge, an initiative dedicated to empowering and supporting city makers around the world. I look forward to working with these 50 finalists as they advance in this extraordinary competition—strengthening their ideas, which each represent the inventiveness citizens everywhere should expect from their governments—and the future of what municipal delivery has the power and potential to be.” “For more than a decade, Bloomberg Philanthropies has provided unprecedented support to drive local government innovation in cities across the country and around the world,” said Admiral Michael G. Mullen, president and CEO of MGM Consulting and a member of the 2025 advisory committee. “The organization’s sixth Mayors Challenge will invest in the future of urban delivery from the ground floor of communities—and I am thrilled to join its advisory committee and work with these finalist cities on accelerating their ideas – from safeguarding water supply to carving out community spaces to integrating AI to improve student routes, and more.”

Since its inception, the Mayor’s Challenge has awarded 38 cities with funding and technical assistance to implement innovative ideas. Many of those ideas have since been replicated in over 330 cities around the world, impacting more than 100 million people. The Challenge is one of many initiatives supported by Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg L.P. and Bloomberg Philanthropies, and former three-term mayor of New York City. His data-driven approach to governance transformed city operations and continues to shape global urban policy. In 2024, President Joe Biden awarded Bloomberg the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Bloomberg’s philanthropic commitment includes the Greenwood Initiative, which aims to accelerate Black wealth creation, and ongoing support for historically Black medical schools. During his 2020 presidential run, Bloomberg partnered with the Black Press of America to help engage Black voters and elevate underrepresented voices—a relationship that continues to inform the philanthropy’s equity-driven programs.

Sean “Diddy” Combs is once again asking to be released from federal custody ahead of his October 3 sentencing—this time arguing that his nearly yearlong incarceration is unjust, the law was misapplied, and the judge should set aside earlier concerns about his past violent behavior. The motion, filed July 29 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, comes after Judge Arun Subramanian denied Combs’ prior requests for bail following the jury’s split verdict. While Combs was acquitted of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and a host of other charges, he was convicted of violating the Mann Act. The judge had previously cited Combs’ own admissions of violence, particularly in his relationship with Cassie Ventura, and an alleged 2024 assault against another woman known as “Jane,” as key reasons for continued detention.

Now, Combs’ attorneys argue that keeping him behind bars amounts to an unprecedented and inappropriate application of a 114-year-old law originally designed to combat human trafficking and forced prostitution. They say Combs is being punished not for coercion or profiteering but for engaging in consensual sexual activity within a swinger’s lifestyle. “There has literally never been a case like this one,” the motion states, arguing that Combs is the only person in jail for paying adult male escorts to engage with his long-term girlfriends—activity the defense claims was consensual and initiated by the women themselves.

The legal team also points to Combs’ 11-month detention at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, calling it a dangerous and violent environment that federal courts have already condemned as unfit. They argue the facility’s conditions alone justify his release. “The requirement of outside law enforcement agencies to ensure safety within the MDC is an admission that serious violence, mayhem and chaos is occurring,” the motion says. Combs is offering a $50 million bond secured by his Miami home, travel restrictions, electronic monitoring, and any conditions the court may impose to prove he is neither a danger nor a flight risk. “This jury gave him his life back, and he will not squander his second chance at life,” his attorneys wrote.",https://blackpressusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/0801-Worker-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 14:05:26.560918

Their joint focus is on scaling production of E-bricks—electrically conductive firebricks capable of storing and delivering heat up to 1,800°C.

This heat storage tech is central to Electrified Thermal’s Joule Hive Thermal Battery system, which stores renewable electricity as thermal energy. That’s hot enough to power cement kilns, steel and metals production, or chemical processing plants—industries that currently rely on fossil fuels because existing electric solutions fall short at these temperature levels.

Daniel Stack, Co-Founder and CEO of Electrified Thermal Solutions shared that ""Industrial heat represents one of the most challenging frontiers in the world's effort to address climate change. The majority of energy used annually for industrial heating worldwide comes from burning fossil fuels. To make a meaningful impact at global scale, we needed a solution that could be produced rapidly through existing supply chains. Our partnership with HWI transforms what could have been a manufacturing bottleneck into a powerful scaling advantage, allowing us to meet the multi-gigawatt demand we're seeing from industrial customers worldwide.""

While high-temp electrification has been technically feasible, scaling up manufacturing has remained a challenge. HWI brings over a century of experience in advanced refractory production, along with established infrastructure across the Americas. That supply chain access could prove pivotal in delivering thermal batteries at commercial volumes and costs that align with industrial benchmarks like natural gas.

Scalable Manufacturing, Faster Deployment

HWI’s manufacturing network and North America’s largest refractory R&D facility give the partnership immediate capacity to meet the multi-gigawatt demand projected from emissions-heavy sectors. This includes not just cement and steel, but also mining, food processing, power generation, and chemicals—all industries facing rising pressure to decarbonize without sacrificing performance.

The first commercial-scale deployment of the Joule Hive system is expected in 2025, with Electrified Thermal targeting 2 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2030. These systems store heat in E-Bricks and release it on demand, allowing industrial customers to tap into renewable energy while maintaining consistent, high-temperature output.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250730-085225-607-Electrified_Thermal_Solutions_HWI_Vandalia.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 12:07:37.655393

The project will bring together the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Ameresco, and Branch Technology to retrofit the 1940-era building using robot-printed insulation panels.

Specifically, the project will target Building 25 of the Arsenal, which is around 16,250 square feet and currently suffers from outdated insulation and inefficient thermal performance. The U.S Army stated in a press release that by adding new 3D printed exterior panels, they will be able to reduce the building’s heating and cooling load by nearly 65%. The project will also be a cost-saving measure by reducing the load on the current HVAC system.

Unlike other traditional retrofit methods, which often have extensive interior modifications or demolition, Branch Technology announced that it will utilize off-site fabrication and on-site installation. The company plans to use precision laser scans to ensure each panel is tailored to the building’s surface. Afterwards, the company will print each panel using their C-Fab system, a large-scale robotic extrusion process that will create fiber-reinforced polymer lattice structures. These eight-inch panels will then be filled with cellulose foam and installed as a new high-performance envelope on the building.

What is unique about this project is how non-invasive and cost-effective it will be for the U.S Army. This is appealing for federal buildings that require minimal interruption or heavy-duty renovation. The insulated panels will bring the structure to an estimated R-value of 50, a level well above the current standard construction rate and rarely achieved through retrofitting. Jason Vass, Vice President of Clean Technology at Ameresco, stated, “This project highlights the role additive manufacturing can play in enhancing energy performance without major disruption. It’s a model for how we might approach hundreds of similar upgrades across the military and beyond.”

The project is to be funded by the Department of Defense’s Environmental Security Technology Certification Program (ESTCP), and may serve as an example for future applications across other federal buildings. A test installation is already underway at the NREL in Colorado, with the finalized project at Detroit Arsenal to be completed by 2027. Given recent budget constraints, public agencies continue to seek out scalable low-carbon solutions for their aging infrastructure. The fabricated panels at Detroit Arsenal could become a key part of the national strategy, ultimately combining efficiency, speed, and innovation through 3D printing.

When designed around these priorities, transportation both promotes economic opportunity and protects against economic and environmental shocks.
This report assesses those three foundational aspects of transportation resilience in metropolitan New Orleans, using original statistical analysis and reviews of official plans and strategies.","Today, the metropolitan region confronts a new set of transportation demands. The regional population is now slightly below 1 million residents, meaning nearly 200,000 less people are moving around each day than before Hurricane Katrina and the failure of the federal levees in 2005.2 Continued suburbanization has stretched the distances between homes, offices, schools, and other activity centers. Worsening climate conditions pose an ever-growing threat to infrastructure operations and human security.

These shifting demands require residents, businesses, and government officials to reconsider whether the transportation networks of the New Orleans metro area are set up to deliver the connectivity they expect. The region is now overly built for the automobile, pushing households to shoulder the private burden of owning one or more vehicles, each of which can easily cost $6,000 a year just in operating costs.3 Transit operators continue to rebuild their services, but also are contending with fewer residents and businesses to carry the burden of increased operations or capital investments. Specific neighborhoods need extra protection from the kind of flooding that could physically isolate them, while every neighborhood needs ways to protect the travelers most exposed to extreme heat.4

Yet, there also are reasons for optimism. Planners at local transportation and land use agencies are aware of these constraints and have been conducting invaluable work to focus development along multimodal corridors, and upgrade neighborhood infrastructure to better manage storms and high-heat days. The business community and elected officials publicly back many of the same priorities.

The common theme across all these activities is a focus on resilience—delivering transportation networks that offer efficiency, affordability, and reliability for all users. When designed around these priorities, transportation both promotes economic opportunity and protects against economic and environmental shocks.

This report assesses those three foundational aspects of transportation resilience in metropolitan New Orleans, using original statistical analysis and reviews of official plans and strategies. It details where current networks are failing to uplift the region’s needs and identifies opportunities for improvement, including:

Use direct public funding and tax incentives to prioritize transit service, right-of-way redesigns, and private real estate investments along higher- density corridors flagged within existing long-term plans

Urge officials and business leaders to ask state legislators to direct more transportation funding to the New Orleans metropolitan area

Coordinate stormwater upgrades and extreme heat features such as tree canopies to align with both priority investment corridors and those neighborhoods with the highest rate of non- vehicle ownership

Overall, the report finds that key parties share a vision of what a more resilient transportation system looks like, but the region needs to adopt new public policies and secure significantly more financial capital to convert those ideas into reality.",https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2108721020-e1753959617870.jpg?quality=75,N,,2025-08-01 11:05:25.627387

This dichotomy underscores a broader industry reckoning with the interplay of high tariffs, inflation, and shifting consumer preferences. For investors, Ford's strategic recalibration offers a critical lens into the auto sector's path toward sustainable profitability in a volatile macroeconomic landscape.

Hybrid Dominance: A Bridge to Electrification

Ford's hybrid segment, led by the F-150 Hybrid and Maverick Hybrid, delivered a 27% year-over-year sales increase in Q2 2025, contributing over 117,000 units to its electrified vehicle total. These models now account for 13.5% of Ford's total sales, driven by their cost-effectiveness and reduced reliance on charging infrastructure. By contrast, EV sales for the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit plummeted by 20%, 26%, and 88%, respectively, with the E-Transit's 418-unit Q2 tally reflecting a 34% year-to-date decline.

The hybrid boom aligns with industry trends: hybrids and plug-in hybrids now constitute 14% of U.S. new car sales, outpacing pure EVs. Ford's pivot reflects a pragmatic response to consumer hesitancy around EVs—high upfront costs, limited charging networks, and range anxiety—while still advancing its electrification goals. Hybrids serve as a transitional product, enabling Ford to capture market share in a high-tariff environment where EVs face additional headwinds.

Tariffs and Inflation: A Double-Edged Sword

The 2025 U.S. auto tariffs—25% on imported vehicles and 25% on parts—have reshaped industry dynamics. Ford's 80% domestic production rate provides a buffer, but its EV segment, reliant on global supply chains, faces a projected $3 billion hit in 2025. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and rare earth materials from China further inflate production costs, squeezing margins. Ford's Model e division, which includes EVs, posted a $1.3 billion loss in Q2 2025, attributed to tariffs, battery production investments, and inventory constraints.

Yet Ford's operational efficiency metrics tell a more nuanced story. Its inventory turnover ratio improved to 10.6 in Q2 2025, reflecting streamlined inventory management. The company also leveraged a Trump administration reprieve, which credits up to 15% of the value of domestically assembled vehicles, offsetting some tariff costs. By rerouting vehicle transportation from Mexico to Canada using bond carriers, Ford reduced $1 billion in tariff exposure. These strategies highlight Ford's agility in navigating a complex regulatory environment.

Strategic Rebalancing: A Barometer for the Industry

Ford's product mix adjustments mirror broader industry trends. Automakers like General Motors and Toyota are similarly prioritizing hybrids and domestically produced models to mitigate tariff risks. The shift underscores a sector-wide recognition that electrification cannot be decoupled from operational realities. Ford's emphasis on hybrids as a bridge to full electrification is not unique but is emblematic of a pragmatic, phased approach.

For example, the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) EV tax credits have created a temporary tailwind for EV sales, but their expiration by year-end 2025 could accelerate a return to hybrid dominance. Ford's Q2 2025 earnings report hints at this: while hybrids drive revenue, the company remains committed to its EV roadmap, citing long-term cost efficiencies and infrastructure improvements as catalysts for adoption.

Operational Efficiency and Investor Implications

Ford's ability to balance hybrid growth with EV challenges hinges on its operational efficiency. The company's working capital turnover ratio rose to 14.83 by mid-2025, up from 5.9 in 2020, indicating improved capital utilization. However, its debt-to-equity ratio of 3.54 and an Altman Z-Score of 1.06 (placing it in the “distress zone”) raise concerns about financial leverage and liquidity risks.

Investors must weigh these metrics against Ford's strategic initiatives. The company's focus on domestic production, regulatory advocacy, and cost-cutting measures positions it to weather the current tariff-driven turbulence. However, its EV segment's struggles—exacerbated by production bottlenecks and a lack of compelling models—pose a long-term threat. The key question is whether Ford can sustain hybrid profitability while accelerating EV innovation without overextending its financial resources.

Conclusion: A Cautious Bull Case

Ford's hybrid momentum and operational efficiency improvements make it a compelling barometer for the auto industry's transition to sustainable profits. While EVs remain a strategic imperative, the current landscape favors automakers that can adapt to high-tariff, high-inflation conditions without sacrificing short-term profitability.

For investors, Ford presents a nuanced opportunity. Its hybrid-driven revenue growth and domestic production advantages offer near-term stability, but its EV challenges and elevated debt levels warrant caution. A “Hold” recommendation is prudent, with a focus on monitoring the company's ability to innovate in the EV space and navigate regulatory shifts.

What’s more, the administration relies on cherry-picked economic data in claiming that regulating climate pollution from tailpipes increases vehicle costs.
First, the justices might rule that the EPA’s proposal violates the Clean Air Act and decades of Congressional support for EPA climate-related regulations.
This would mean that, unless Congress writes a new law or amends the Clean Air Act to even more explicitly grant the EPA the authority to regulate climate pollution, the EPA could no longer issue climate regulations.
The Trump administration had always planned to undo as many climate regulations as possible, as it did during his first term.","In a stark juxtaposition, while nearly half of all Americans sweltered under a life-threatening extreme heat wave made several times more likely by climate change, the Environmental Protection Agency declared this week that it will roll back the agency’s 2009 determination that climate pollution endangers public health and welfare.

Known as the “endangerment finding,” this determination has been the basis of the EPA’s efforts over the past 15 years to regulate climate pollutants from vehicles, power plants, and other major sources.

“Today is the greatest day of deregulation our nation has seen,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the head of the agency whose mission is to protect human health and the environment, using regulations as a primary tool. “We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

It’s an audacious move that the EPA did not pursue in President Donald Trump’s first term, despite being led for several years by former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler. But the new Trump administration appears emboldened by Supreme Court decisions in the intervening years that may enable opponents of climate regulations to successfully roll back their legal basis.

This action is the latest in the Trump administration’s six-month onslaught against the climate that has included efforts to gut federal climate science research, bury federal climate reports, withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, claw back federal funding for clean energy, and repeal dozens of regulations designed to keep pollution out of Americans’ air and water.

“Trump’s EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution,” former EPA administrator and White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said in a statement. “Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs.”

What is the endangerment finding?

The endangerment finding came into being after a coalition of environmental groups and states led by the Massachusetts attorney general’s office sued the EPA under then-President George W. Bush.

The plaintiffs argued that the agency was legally obligated to regulate climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions as air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which in 2007 ruled in a slim 5-4 decision that “the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a ‘judgment’ that such emissions contribute to climate change.”

Notably, Chief Justice John Roberts dissented at the time, arguing that there was no traceable causal connection between the EPA’s refusal to enforce pollution standards and specific climate harms and that other countries like China are responsible for most climate pollution. (Meanwhile, China is crushing the U.S. in the race to adopt clean, climate-friendly technology.)

After President Barack Obama came into office, the EPA examined the body of scientific evidence and concluded in December 2009 that climate pollutants “threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations.” The agency then finalized its first regulations on climate pollution from vehicles in 2010.

In the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, Congress further codified EPA’s mandate by explicitly defining climate-warming greenhouse gases as air pollutants and amending the Clean Air Act to enable the EPA to further regulate climate pollution.

In the 15 years since the endangerment finding, the scientific evidence has only grown that climate pollution endangers public health and welfare in every corner of the country, as seas rise and wildfires, heat waves, droughts, and floods grow more frequent and extreme.

“The science of human-caused climate change has not only become increasingly solid over the past decade and a half, but the impacts have become visceral and pervasive,” said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann via email. “It takes a special sort of cognitive dissonance to deny, as the current administration is doing, that fossil fuel burning endangers us at a time when this is plain as day to the person on the street.”

But on Day One of his second term in office, Trump issued an executive order that directed EPA Administrator Zeldin to investigate the endangerment finding’s “legality and continuing applicability.”

Zeldin delivered the proposed rollback six months later.

The Trump EPA’s arguments for rolling back the basis of climate regulations

In order to justify a decision that seems to fly in the face of legal precedent and overwhelming scientific evidence, the EPA relies primarily on a two-part argument. First, it notes that historically, the EPA only applied the Clean Air Act to direct health impacts from local and regional pollution, whereas climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions have an indirect impact on public health and welfare. The new proposed rollback then reinterprets the law as only applying to these direct local and regional health impacts. In this way, it argues that the law does not permit the EPA to regulate climate-warming pollution.

Second, the administration points out that after the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA Supreme Court decision, and after Trump appointed several conservative, regulation-hostile justices, the Supreme Court invented and began applying the “major questions doctrine.” Under this new doctrine, Congress must clearly and explicitly delegate to federal agencies the authority to address an issue of major political or economic significance. So the Trump EPA is now arguing that because Congress did not explicitly delegate to EPA the authority to regulate pollutants based on their indirect global impacts on public health, the agency cannot do so.

University of Oregon Environmental and Energy Law Professor Gred Dotson did not find these arguments persuasive.

“This local and regional language is not something you find in the Clean Air Act and conflicts with the Act’s purpose of protecting the public’s health and welfare,” Dotson said in an interview. “Additionally, it runs counter to numerous Supreme Court cases over the last 20 years.”

He has published research on Congress’s long history of supporting EPA climate-related regulations, including very recently in the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA.

“The IRA really showed that Congress understood how the Clean Air Act was being used to address climate change and supported that approach, and they asked the EPA to do more. And if you look at this history dating back to the 1990s, you see a lot of Congressional engagement,” Dotson explained.

Read: Our elected officials have known about climate change for decades

But Dotson said the administration is hoping the Supreme Court will look favorably on its arguments.

“They’re trying to capitalize on the fact that the composition of the Supreme Court has changed,” he said.

Disputing consensus science

In a secondary justification for undermining the endangerment finding, the Trump EPA questions the accuracy of consensus climate science. The agency relies in part on a new draft ‘critical review’ report commissioned by the Department of Energy and written by five fringe scientists. It has not been peer-reviewed.

As Texas A&M climate scientist Andrew Dessler noted, “The authors of this report are widely recognized contrarians who don’t represent the mainstream scientific consensus. If almost any other group of scientists had been chosen, the report would have been dramatically different. The only way to get this report was to pick these authors.”

The administration did cite one mainstream climate science paper. But that paper’s lead author, Zeke Hausfather, a former Yale Climate Connections contributor, immediately said that the EPA had gotten his findings “completely backwards.”

“This is a general theme in the report,” Hausfather told E&E News, which fact checked some of the report’s many faulty scientific claims. “They cherry-pick data points that suit their narrative and exclude the vast majority of the scientific literature that does not.”

“Both the scientific certainty around climate change and evidence of the dangers it is causing have grown stronger since 2009,” he said in an email to Yale Climate Connections.

What’s more, the administration relies on cherry-picked economic data in claiming that regulating climate pollution from tailpipes increases vehicle costs. This argument neglects the cost savings from reduced vehicle fueling bills and lessened climate damage. The Biden EPA estimated that its 2023 vehicle tailpipe rules would have generated about $1 trillion in net benefits over the next three decades.

What happens next?

The EPA’s proposed rollback of the endangerment finding is open to public comments until September 15, and the agency will hold virtual public hearings on August 19 and 20. After responding to the public comments, the EPA will finalize the rule.

Assuming the EPA moves ahead with the rollback, lawsuits will soon follow, and the case will gradually be appealed up to the Supreme Court. This whole process is expected to take several years. In the meantime, Trump’s EPA will likely proceed with unwinding dozens of federal regulations related to climate pollution that were supported by the endangerment finding.

There are three broad potential outcomes from an eventual Supreme Court decision.

First, the justices might rule that the EPA’s proposal violates the Clean Air Act and decades of Congressional support for EPA climate-related regulations. Such a decision would require the EPA to reissue a broad swath of climate pollutant regulations in the ensuing years.

Alternatively, the court could issue a relatively narrow decision in the EPA’s favor, ruling that one of its secondary justifications for questioning the endangerment finding is valid. This could mean that the EPA would have the discretion to decide whether to regulate climate pollutants – a decision that could potentially change with each new presidential election, creating long-term uncertainty for the regulated industries.

Or a majority of the court could decide that the EPA is correct in its interpretation that it does not have the authority to regulate climate pollutants under the Clean Air Act. This would mean that, unless Congress writes a new law or amends the Clean Air Act to even more explicitly grant the EPA the authority to regulate climate pollution, the EPA could no longer issue climate regulations. This would leave American climate policy almost exclusively in the hands of Congress.

The Trump administration had always planned to undo as many climate regulations as possible, as it did during his first term. Now the long-term fate of those rules likely hinges on a Supreme Court decision that may not come until near the end of Trump’s second term.",https://yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250801-what-is-the-endangerment-finding-trump-climate-change.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 12:08:39.360103

The Endangerment Finding has served as the foundation for more than $1 trillion in emissions-related regulations. This includes the Biden-Harris Administration’s electric vehicle (EV) mandate.

Aiming to Reverse GHG Emissions Regulations

The proposed rescission targets greenhouse gas (GHG) emission regulations for motor vehicles and engines. If finalized, the rule would eliminate all federal GHG standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the proposal during a press event at an auto dealership in Indiana. He was joined by U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, Indiana Governor Mike Braun, and other officials.

The agency said the move is intended to relieve the public and the auto industry from costly regulatory burdens. According to EPA estimates, repealing the regulations would save Americans approximately $54 billion per year.

ATA Backs Proposed Repeal

Additionally, the American Trucking Associations (ATA) issued a statement that showed support for President Trump and the EPA on this decision. Here’s a segment of the full ATA statement:

“This electric-truck mandate put the trucking industry on a path to economic ruin and would have crippled our supply chain, disrupted deliveries, and raised prices for American families and businesses,” said ATA President & CEO Chris Spear. “Moreover, it kicked innovation to the curb by discarding available technologies that can further drive down emissions at a fraction of the cost.”

According to the ATA, modern trucks produce 99% fewer nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter emissions than those on the road decades ago, and new trucks cut carbon emissions by over 40 percent compared to trucks manufactured in 2010. The statement also said that 60 of today’s trucks emit what just one truck did in 1988.

EPA Points to New Science Behind the Rollback

The EPA cited updated scientific data that it says undermines the assumptions behind the 2009 Endangerment Finding. That finding, issued during the Obama administration, concluded that carbon dioxide and other GHGs threaten public health and welfare—a determination that enabled regulation of vehicle emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Stakeholders critical of the current and previous Democratic administrations claim the regulations imposed hidden costs on families and businesses. They argue the original finding relied on legal and scientific interpretations that are no longer valid.

Public Comment Period Forthcoming

A formal comment period will allow the public and industry groups to weigh in on the proposal. The EPA plans to publish full details in the Federal Register and on its official website.

Broader Energy Policy Context

The proposed repeal aligns with the Trump administration’s broader energy and environmental policy goals. Officials say they aim to promote secure, affordable energy and reduce regulatory barriers for consumers and manufacturers.

If finalized, the change would represent a major shift in federal climate policy, removing a key legal basis for regulating vehicle emissions.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/stock-white-house-1400.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 12:06:37.194936

Congress should fully fund NOAA research and all other parts of this essential agency, or risk endangering American lives, property and infrastructure.","A national discussion is underway on the role of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Weather Service in forecasting the deadly July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas. The record shows that the hard-working meteorologists and other staff at the National Weather Service were successful in providing Texas Hill Country with timely, accurate forecasts.

It is critical to reflect on government role’s in the short term and build a minute-by-minute chronology of the disaster. But it is equally important to highlight the long-term investments America needs for climate and weather resilience. This means talking about the NOAA labs and other research centers dedicated to basic science. These institutions are essential to innovation in precipitation forecasting and warnings that save lives, yet they are on the chopping block in the president’s latest Fiscal Year 2026 budget proposal.

President Trump’s budget proposal called for closing all NOAA labs and cooperative institutes with universities. It also calls for closing its Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which funds and coordinates with the labs and cooperative institutes. Congress is debating funding levels for NOAA research now as it begins the appropriations process.

A final budget aligned with the president’s proposal would devastate NOAA research, including precipitation research, rendering the agency unable to update and innovate the weather and climate models that support the military, businesses, individuals and community institutions like Camp Mystic in Texas.

Consider the significance of NOAA’s National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Oklahoma. The lab, working with the University of Oklahoma and the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies, developed the Flooded Locations and Simulated Hydrographs Project (FLASH), which improves the accuracy, timing and specificity of flash-flood warnings. FLASH doubled accuracy for the National Weather Service, improved spatial resolution by 500 percent, provided up to six hours of forecast lead time and improved forecasters’ ability to identify rare, severe flash floods.

Consider also the role of labs and cooperative institutes in developing NOAA’s newest hurricane model, the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System. The model attests to NOAA’s commitment to continually improving its forecasts for potentially catastrophic natural disasters.

In 2024 alone, there were five tropical cyclones causing losses exceeding $1 billion in the U.S., and NOAA predicts an above-normal 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, with three to five major hurricanes. Hurricane forecasting is especially difficult in today’s era of “rapid intensification,” which refers to an increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots in a 24-hour period. The magnitude of rapid intensification in the central and eastern Atlantic Ocean has been increasing over the past 30 years.

The Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System has made critical improvements in predicting the path and intensity of hurricanes. The model, operational since June 2023, has saved lives, property and infrastructure. In 2024, it successfullypredicted the rapid intensifications of hurricanes Helene and Milton. At its peak, Milton reached Category 5 intensity and became one of the strongest hurricanes on record in the Atlantic basin. Helene landed in Florida as a Category 4 storm and became the deadliest hurricane in the contiguous U.S. since Katrina.

The Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System’s success was no accident. Its design came to fruition after careful investment. It took five years of research and development from three NOAA centers of excellence: the National Weather Service Environmental Modeling Center, the Atlantic Oceanographic & Meteorological Laboratory, and the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies.

Trump and his allies in Congress seem to think that Americans can enjoy NOAA’s finished products, such as high-quality hurricane forecasts, without spending a dime on basic research.

Eighty years of federally sponsored scientific research tell us otherwise. “Basic research leads to new knowledge,” wrote American inventor and engineer Vannevar Bush in a landmark report on science to President Harry S. Truman. “It provides scientific capital. It creates the fund from which the practical applications of knowledge must be drawn. New products and new processes do not appear full-grown. They are founded on new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly developed by research in the purest realms of science.”

We cannot uproot the tree of science and expect it to still bear fruit.

Congress should fully fund NOAA research and all other parts of this essential agency, or risk endangering American lives, property and infrastructure.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/AP25202831712407-e1754006254894.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-01 12:09:34.914120

The pending load in PJM includes about 3.7 GW of data centers in Ohio and about 3.1 GW of data centers in Indiana Michigan Power’s service territory, Fehrman said.
AEP’s utilities have inquiries about possible new load totaling 190 GW, Fehrman said — a significant increase for a 37-GW system.

The 24 GW is backed by signed customer commitments and consists of 13 GW in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market, 9 GW in the PJM Interconnection and about 2.5 GW in the Southwest Power Pool, Fehrman said Wednesday during an earnings call.

In ERCOT, the pending load includes about 5 GW in cryptocurrency operations and 2 GW in data centers, according to Fehrman. “Texas is clearly becoming the crypto center for us,” he said.

The pending load in PJM includes about 3.7 GW of data centers in Ohio and about 3.1 GW of data centers in Indiana Michigan Power’s service territory, Fehrman said.

AEP’s utilities have inquiries about possible new load totaling 190 GW, Fehrman said — a significant increase for a 37-GW system. “Potential customers are drawn to AEP’s footprint because of our advanced transmission network capable of delivering consistent large load power,” he said, adding that the company owns more 765-kV lines than all other utilities combined.

AEP’s weather-normalized peak demand grew 12%, to 37.6 GW, at the end of the second quarter, up from 33.5 GW a year earlier, according to Trevor Mihalik, the company’s CFO. Data centers and other industrial customers coming online in Indiana, Ohio and Texas largely drove the increase, he said, resulting in about $200 million in additional revenue.

AEP, based in Columbus, Ohio, expects weather-normalized retail electricity sales by its utilities will increase 5.7% this year, up from 3% growth in 2024. The company anticipates sales will jump 8.4% next year and 8.9% in 2027, according to an earnings presentation.

In part due to those new load expectations, AEP expects this fall it will increase its five-year capital spending plan by 30%, to about $70 billion, up from $54 billion, Fehrman said.

AEP expects transmission investments will account for half the additional expenditures, followed by generation at 40% and the distribution system at 10%, according to Fehrman. Under the pending capital expenditure plan, AEP Texas could spend about $7 billion on transmission.

Changes to federal clean energy tax credits signed into law July 4 don’t appear to affect AEP’s $9.9 billion plan to build wind and solar projects, according to Fehrman.

A few renewable energy projects potentially could be affected by a July 7 executive order directing the U.S. Treasury Department to issue guidance on determining when a project may be deemed “under construction,” a key issue for qualifying for tax credits, Fehrman said.

In November, AEP agreed to buy 100 MW of fuel cells from Bloom Energy, with an option to buy up to 1 GW in total by the end of this year, the company said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Wednesday. AEP’s subsidiaries are offering the fuel cells to data centers and other large customers as an immediate option for addressing their needs while grid infrastructure upgrades are being completed to accommodate their demand. Ohio Power, an AEP utility, has two contracts approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, totaling about 98 MW, for electricity service from fuel cells, according to the SEC report.

Ohio H.B. 15, which takes effect Aug. 14, repealed the statute that permits electric utilities to provide customer-sited renewable generation service such as fuel cells, but the law grandfathered the two PUCO-approved contracts, AEP said.

Texas H.B. 5247, which became law in June, is “incredibly constructive” legislation for AEP Texas, according to Fehrman. The bill allows eligible utilities to use a “unified tracker mechanism” to recover their expenses, reducing regulatory lag, he said.

The cost-recovery mechanism could increase AEP Texas’ return on equity by 0.5% to 1%, according to Mihalik. The utility has an 8.6% earned ROE, he said.

“This is highly supportive of increasing our capital allocation to Texas as we participate in the massive infrastructure build-out needed to drive the economic growth in the state,” Fehrman said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/PW6w9rgY67UmSaa9MfixItdWw5UldgA5JSEOp0bUHL4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTYxMzk0MjE0LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-08-01 12:08:16.324936

But the truth is that any forward-thinking company, investor or even car-shopper realizes that even if this transition may slow down, it's not going anywhere.

Lately, it seems like those in the EV charging space seem to get it. Despite industry and regulatory headwinds, uneven sales and an end to the EV tax credits next month, the infrastructure arena is only growing up, growing out and getting better.

The ""Charging 2.0"" era is the topic of discussion on this week's Plugged-In Podcast. My co-host Tim Levin and I have several bits of good news in the American EV charging space, including overall growth, quality improvements and—wait for it, wait for it, wait for it—more restrooms when you stop to charge up. Imagine that!

We discuss some of the biggest upgrades we're seeing on this week's episode.

But it's not all great news in the electric and sustainability space. This week, the (alleged) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that it will target the Obama-era scientific finding that carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles contribute to climate change. (The agency even calls that ""mental leaps."") By going after that concept, it could kneecap pollution regulation for generations to come, including when it comes to cars.

So what does that mean for EVs, or your next vehicle? As Tim and I discuss here, I am not convinced this will mean some huge, long-term comeback for gas-guzzling V8 engines. (Sorry, Stellantis.) These companies have to compete globally and they face tougher emissions everywhere else, and even if EV demand in America is wavering, hybrid demand is through the roof. You might even call it the market speaking: electrification will happen over time, regardless of what this EPA does.

And speaking of demand, we have a lot to say about why drivers increasingly want hands-free highway assistance systems. It turns out that's the most in-demand new-car feature. So who's doing it best? We'll analyze from our recent car-testing.

In September 2022, FRV Australia received support for a large BESS project in Victoria - the Terang project - with a capacity 100MW.
Christopher Curtain, OMERS Infrastructure Senior Managing Director for Asia-Pacific said: ""Dalby's connection into the grid is another great milestone for FRV Australia.","Fotowatio Renewable Ventures (FRV), part of Jameel Energy, has announced its selection of Envision Energy (“Envision’) as its strategic partner in a green ammonia project in Brazil. Envision has been selected for its leadership and proven expertise across a total renewable energy system, from renewables to green hydrogen – all orchestrated by AI technology.

This agreement will see Envision bring its expertise in integrated renewable energy solutions to H2 Cumbuco, a landmark green ammonia project located in Brazil’s Pecém Port, and will build on its pioneering scalable clean energy models that are modular and replicable across the world.

The partnership brings together FRV’s extensive experience in clean energy solutions – backed by 3GW of operational renewable and storage assets – and Envision’s AI-integrated total renewable energy system to build an electrolysis facility of up to 500MW and an integrated ammonia plant, which is expected to be operational by 2030, targeting key markets in Brazil, Europe, and Asia.

“This collaboration is more than a step towards decarbonization; it is a blueprint for how global energy transition can be operationalized. Together with FRV, we are reshaping the entire renewable energy system and advancing Brazil’s green energy infrastructure.” said Henry Peng, Senior Vice President and President of Latin America and the European Region.

Envision recently delivered the world’s largest off-grid AI-enabled green hydrogen and ammonia plant and its first green marine ammonia bunkering operation in Dalian, China – proof of its capability to orchestrate complex and total renewable solutions at scale.

FRV is a leading developer of sustainable energy solutions with a deep commitment to accelerating the energy transition. With a strong presence across key international markets, including Europe, Australia, Middle East, and Latin America, FRV continues to drive innovation and sustainability in the renewable energy sector.

Aligned with this commitment, FRV has also been actively engaged for several years in the development of renewable hydrogen projects. In Spain, the company has secured public funding for two green hydrogen-related initiatives.

In line with this strategy and leveraging on FRV’s long presence and commitment in Brazil, FRV has been developing the H2 Cumbuco project in Brazil since 2023. The project is in advanced development in areas such as engineering and environmental permitting, and has secured key resources, including land and water rights.

“At FRV, we firmly believe that the development of renewable hydrogen and its derivatives is a fundamental pillar in advancing global decarbonization. We see Brazil as a country with the potential to become a global leader in this sector, thanks to its strategic geographic position, strong commitment to the energy transition, and broad public support. We are excited about the potential that this alliance with Envision can bring to the H2 Cumbuco project, in order to provide clean, competitive, and sustainable energy solutions while supporting Brazil’s economic and environmental development,” stated Felipe Hernández, Chief Innovation Officer of FRV.

This partnership comes as Brazil, host of COP30 this year, develops a competitive low carbon economy with a focus on green hydrogen and green ammonia production not just for its domestic market, but for export to other parts of the world.

Located in Queensland, the Dalby project is one of Australia’s first hybrid photovoltaic (PV) and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) projects in operation.

This facility consists of a 2.45 MWdc solar photovoltaic (PV) and a 2.54 MW/5 MWh battery energy storage system (BESS).

Occupying a total area of 30 hectares, The Dalby project is one of the first developments in the country to combine photovoltaic power generation with a battery system, sharing the same point of connection to the national grid. The combination of solar PV and battery storage helps improve energy efficiency and grid resilience, while allowing for significant reductions in CO2 emissions.

The project will generate enough electricity to supply more than 1,680 households, contributing to cutting and avoiding 3,553 tonnes of CO2 emissions annually. The engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) Contractor for the Project was Gransolar.

Throughout the construction phase, over 40 jobs were provided to local contractors and suppliers supporting a positive diversification of the local economy and a source of investment for the region. It also provided indirect economic opportunities for local businesses, such as restaurants, small stores, hospitality and transportation services, material and equipment supply companies, and many other sectors. Dalby will also impact positively on the power distribution network, allowing the integration of more stable renewable energy generation to it.

Dalby is FRV Australia's first hybrid and BESS project to start operations. FRV Australia is progressing the development of several other hybrid and BESS projects across the National Electricity Market (NEM). In September 2022, FRV Australia received support for a large BESS project in Victoria - the Terang project - with a capacity 100MW. The project received a USD $4.5 million (AUD $7 million) investment under Round 2 of the Victorian Government's Energy Innovation Fund (EIF). Later in 2022, FRV Australia was awarded a conditional funding from ARENA to support the construction of the Gnarwarre 250MW BESS project also in Victoria. Both Terang and Gnarwarre are at RTB (Ready to Build) stage of development and the construction will commence in the second half of 2024.

FRV Australia's CEO, Carlo Frigerio, said:

""Dalby is a small but strategic project for us. It is in line with the pioneering spirit of FRV Australia, being always at the forefront of the energy transition and technology to create a better future for all of us”.

Christopher Curtain, OMERS Infrastructure Senior Managing Director for Asia-Pacific said:

""Dalby's connection into the grid is another great milestone for FRV Australia. As our first Australian hybrid project, we look forward to leveraging the learnings to continue to grow our Australian portfolio and continue to support the transition of the Australian energy system.""

Almar Water Solutions, a leading company in the development of water infrastructure and part of Abdul Latif Jameel Energy, through Osmoflo SpA, has been awarded a new operation and maintenance contract for a major industrial client in northern Chile.

Mantos Copper, a well-respected mining company engaged in the extraction and commercialization of copper with two projects in the area: Mantos Blancos and Mantoverde. Almar Water Solutions will operate the water treatment plant for Mantos Blancos.

This new contract, with a duration of three years, will include 24/7 service provided by qualified experienced professionals who will transfer to the client's facilities in the Antofagasta region, thereby promoting local job creation. Almar Water Solutions will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of a reverse-osmosis process-water plant, which will produce quality water for use in the mining activity at Mantos Blancos.

The Mantos Blancos project is a mining complex located in Region II, 45 kilometers northeast of the city of Antofagasta and at an elevation of 800 meters above sea level. As well as the primary mine, it also comprising crushing plants and installations for processing oxidized and sulfide ores.

Gonzalo Gómez-Rodulfo, services manager of Almar Water Solutions, after the signing of the contract, said that

""this new project strengthens the services area of Almar Water Solutions and will help Mantos Blancos to guarantee the operational excellence of its water infrastructure, enabling it to optimize costs and increase its annual copper production"".

After the acquisition of Osmoflo SpA in 2019, Almar Water Solutions has become a new ally in the operation and maintenance of water treatment plants, offering optimum and efficient performance of the assets, using state-of-the-art management systems and computerized models. With this new project, Almar Water Solutions now has a portfolio with multiple operation and maintenance projects, especially in the Latin American region, which presents special conditions and challenges in terms of its geography, topology and the distribution of water resources.

In 2009, the United Nations General Assembly announced 22 April as ‘International Mother Earth Day’, acknowledging humanity’s common interest in the protection of the planet and its environment, and the importance of achieving harmony with nature.

Without finding a way to work together with the Earth and its vital ecosystems, the economic, social and environmental needs of the present generation may not be met – and a sustainable planet for future generations may sadly be out of the question.

Now, some eleven years on from putting the protection of our ecosystems at the top of the environmental agenda, are we upholding our end of the deal?

The conclusion of the warmest decade ever recorded brought with it widespread and devastating wildfires across the Amazon, parts of Indonesia and the United States, Australia and even the Arctic Circle.

In Australia alone earlier this year, bushfires scorched more than 15 million acres of land, destroyed more than 2,000 homes, claimed the lives of tens of people and billions of animals. Experts further estimate that smoke from the intense fires, which traveled as far as Argentina, was responsible for a further 417 deaths[i].

As East Africa battles a second wave of one of its worst locust swarm events in memory, placing millions of vulnerable people at risk and threatening livelihoods, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) calling it “an unprecedented threat” to food security[ii].

These increasingly frequent and severe incidences are a stark warning from Mother Nature herself that our efforts to responsibly manage what are finite resources are insufficient and ineffective in the face of exploding human population growth, and that we are placing too many pressures on the natural world. It is now, surely, the time to re-balance this relationship.

Coinciding with 2020 being a ‘super year’ for biodiversity’[iii], the focus of this year’s International Mother Earth Day centers around the same theme, and the importance of protecting and preserving the ecosystems that are vital to keeping the planet in balance.

According to the United Nations:

“Specific linkages between health and biodiversity include impact in nutrition, health research or traditional medicine, new infectious diseases and influencing shifts in the distribution of plants, pathogens, animals, and even human settlements, most of them affected by climate change[iv].”

In 2016, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) noted a worldwide increase in zoonotic epidemics as an issue of concern. Specifically, it pointed out that 75 per cent of all emerging infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic and that these zoonotic diseases are closely interlinked with the health of ecosystems. Today, the world is battling the latest of these, and the most severe pandemic in decades. According to Inger Andersen, Executive Director, UNEP, we can expect to see increasing epidemics in future unless we take urgent action to protect our planet:

“We are intimately interconnected with nature, whether we like it or not. If we don’t take care of nature, we can’t take care of ourselves.”

Yet, despite the critical importance of protecting our environment being understood and acknowledged by governments around the world – and with biodiversity directly linked to 9 out of the 17 agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – biodiversity loss is accelerating in all regions of the world.

Through the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), research programs are underway, dedicated to tackling climate change and striving for sustainability. These projects are exploring innovative new solutions and technologies to build resilience in the face of the climate crisis and environmental impact.

Joining the battle, the Abdul Latif Jameel Institute for Disease and Emergency Analytics (J-IDEA) at the Imperial College London is at the forefront of the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Co-founded by Imperial College London and Community Jameel in 2019, J-IDEA has a mission to combat threats from disease worldwide.

In an uncertain world, there is at least one indisputable certainty: the time is now for the world to take action, and to stop biting the hand that feeds it.

In a sort of circular moment, Trump was back in Scotland earlier this week to fulminate once again about wind energy.
But Trump’s distress at wind turbines now holds global, rather than merely golfing, implications.
As president he has banned renewable energy projects from federal lands and signed a spending bill that kills off tax credits that were fostering a boom in new, clean energy supply.
Even as renewables advance, they must do so far faster if the world has a chance of fending off spiralling climate disasters.","The inner workings of Donald Trump’s mind have long provoked bemusement and speculation, with his often erratic opinions driven seemingly by grievance and anecdote rather than evidence.

But on one topic Trump has remained resolutely consistent: he hates wind turbines – and, more latterly, renewable energy in general. This enmity burst into view in 2011 – four years before he descended his golden escalator to announce he was running for US president – when Trump waged an unsuccessful battle to halt “ugly” offshore turbines visible from his Scottish golf course.

In a sort of circular moment, Trump was back in Scotland earlier this week to fulminate once again about wind energy.

“Wind is a disaster,” the US president said in a press conference at his Turnberry golf course in Scotland, beside a doleful-looking Keir Starmer. “You are paying massive subsidies to have these ugly monsters all over the place.”

Starmer, for his part, said that “we believe in a mix” that includes wind but did not mention the pressing reason for clean energy – a climate crisis that is unleashing its fury in increasing bursts in the UK, US and elsewhere. Instead the British prime minister embraced the more Trump-friendly theme of energy security.

But Trump’s distress at wind turbines now holds global, rather than merely golfing, implications. As president he has banned renewable energy projects from federal lands and signed a spending bill that kills off tax credits that were fostering a boom in new, clean energy supply.

The amount of new clean energy additions is now expected to be half of what it would have been over the next decade as a result, with the added loss of several hundred thousand jobs and billions of dollars of investment that was set to gush into rural and exurban America. “It’s an expensive energy, it’s an ugly energy and we won’t allow it in the United States,” Trump boasted at his Scottish summit with Starmer.

As the world’s second-largest carbon emitter, the US’s decision to bring the hammer down on renewables has major implications for a rapidly warming planet. Around 7bn tonnes of extra greenhouse gases are set to be added to the atmosphere in just the next five years – more than double India’s annual emissions – as American utilities turn to gas and coal rather than cleaner sources of energy.

Clean energy still remains remarkably attractive – wind and solar have plummeted in cost over the past decade and are now almost always cheaper than fossil fuels even without subsidies, as the United Nations pointed out last week. Almost all new electricity capacity in the US is set to come from renewables this year – after all, it’s not only cheaper but far quicker to start up a windfarm than a gas plant.

But the climate crisis has always been a timed challenge. Even as renewables advance, they must do so far faster if the world has a chance of fending off spiralling climate disasters. The fixation of one man in the White House is stamping on the brakes at the very moment when scientists are urging accelerated cuts in emissions.

The backtracking on renewables also poses geopolitical, as well as environmental, questions. China, which Trump often disparages as a rival, is already streaking ahead of the world in erecting wind and solar facilities and envisions a future run on clean energy that it will then sell to other countries – a Chinese EV in the garage overlooked by a Chinese-made windfarm in the hills.

The US is making a very different bet: that the world will continue to run, as it has for more than a century, on the burning of fossil fuels and it will look to America’s vast supply of oil and gas for sustenance. “This is the most pro-combustion administration since Nero,” as one environmental group put it this week as Trump unveiled plans to eliminate a foundational finding that greenhouse gases harm human health and set about demolishing pollution limits for cars and oil and gas drilling sites.

The pathway that the world chooses will not only shape our shared climate but also, potentially, the fortunes of the world’s two superpowers in the decades ahead. “This marks a new chapter in the global climate story, it will significantly reposition these two major powers,” as Li Shuo, an expert in China’s climate policies, told me. “The last chance for the US to jump on the green bandwagon has left the station.”

Small, Affordable Electric Vehicle From Ford Farley said during the July 30 earnings call that Ford now believes the EV market is most suited for small electric vehicles designed for urban commuting.
The bad news is that CATL is a Chinese company and Chinese companies are personae non grata in the US of A at the moment.
I think we’re very well positioned for the reality of the EV market with the customers today,” Farley said.
Until August 11, the jury is still out on whether he can deliver on the promises he is making.","During a second quarter earnings call on July 30, Ford CEO Jim Farley named August 11, 2025 as the date when the company would take the wraps off its latest plan to become a leader of the EV revolution. CleanTechnica readers will recall that last year, Farley announced he had been driving a Xiaomi SU7 for 6 months and the car was so good, he didn’t want to give it up.

According to the Detroit Free Press, Farley and an executive leadership team from Ford went to China earlier this year to study how Chinese auto companies operate. The lessons learned from that experience are now being applied throughout the company as it adjusts its marketing plans for the US and other countries.

“On August 11, that will be a big day for all of us at Ford,” Farley said on the July 30 call. “We will be in Kentucky to share more about our plans to design and build a breakthrough electric vehicle and a platform in the US. This is a Model-T moment for us at Ford. A chance to bring a new family of vehicles to the world that offer incredible technology, efficiency, space, and features.”

The key to the new marketing plan is to make manufacturing and selling electric vehicles profitable. Until now, Ford has been losing money every quarter in its EV division, known officially as Model e. In the second quarter of this year, the company posted a loss for the Model e division of $1.3 billion, which was slightly more than it lost in the same quarter last year.

Ford was fast out of the gate with its F-150 Lightning battery-electric pickup truck, electric Mustang Mach-E, and the E-Transit cargo van in the US, but has not brought any new EVs to market in North America lately. Crosstown rival, General Motors, has brought the Cadillac Lyric, Otiq, Vistique, and Escalade IQ to market since then and Chevrolet is now selling the Blazer EV, Equinox EV, and Silverado EV. GMC also has the over the top Hummer EV as well.

Small, Affordable Electric Vehicle From Ford

Farley said during the July 30 earnings call that Ford now believes the EV market is most suited for small electric vehicles designed for urban commuting. During the past three years, while sales of its existing EVs have floundered, a team of engineers at the company’s so-called Skunkworks in California has been busy developing a new architecture that will allow Ford to produce affordable small EVs that will actually be profitable.

According to TechCrunch, that team is lead by former Tesla executive Alan Clark and includes other talented individuals recruited from Tesla, Rivian, Apple, and Lucid Motors. Until now, Ford has been vague about what sort of vehicles the team is designing, but TechCrunch reports the first vehicle to use the new platform will be a midsize electric pickup truck, which is scheduled to be in showrooms in 2027.

In an echo of the marketing strategy at the now defunct Canoo, Farley suggests the new platform may support a number of “top hats” — vehicle bodies that could included sedans, SUVs, or crossovers that all share the same underpinnings. We have been hearing about this strategy since the early days of Faraday Future. Perhaps the idea will soon be ready for prime time? The company has suggested the new vehicles, whatever they are, will feature “personalized digital experiences.”

“We really see, not the global (automakers) as our competitive set for our next generation of EVs, we see the Chinese. Companies like Geely, BYD,” Farley said. “That’s how we built our vehicle. How we’ve engineered what kind of supply chain we’ve used and the kind of low content in our manufacturing.”

The big announcement on August 11 will take place at the Ford assembly plant in Louisville, Kentucky. During contract negotiations with the UAW in 2023, both sides said they had struck a deal that would put that factory “truly at the center of the universe for EV production and EV innovation,” the Courier Journal reported at the time. Ford agreed to invest $1.2 billion in that factory so it would be able to produce an “all-new EV product.”

Ford Bets On LFP Batteries

Farley told investors last week that its new battery factory in Marshall, Michigan, is key to its EV plans. “It’s a big advantage for the company. We’re the first one to build LFP batteries at scale. It also has a production tax credit and we’re thankful that Congress upheld that. That’s a key part of our profitability road map to transition to these lower-cost batteries. Can’t wait to show you the product and the platform, so stay tuned,” he said.

What he didn’t say is that the Marshall, Michigan, battery factory will use technology provided by CATL, the largest battery manufacturer in the world. That’s the good news. The bad news is that CATL is a Chinese company and Chinese companies are personae non grata in the US of A at the moment.

Just this week, Tesla announced it was transitioning away from using LFP batteries supplied by CATL to batteries manufactured by LG Energy Solution, partly to avoid the wrath of the MAGAlomaniacs currently running the show in Washington, DC. Ford has every reason to downplay its association with CATL as dangerous political crosscurrents roil more industries in the US today.

Managing Market Turmoil

Farley said that market turmoil caused by shifting consumer demands and government regulations over the past three years — the Inflation Reduction Act only came into existence three years ago this month — have led the company to rethink its overall marketing plans during that time period. As part of its new EV strategy, Ford will offer only a few “top hats” and adjust its timing to be in market segments “where we can actually make money on EVs.”

But the company is taking an “all of the above” approach, which means it will offer a number of powertrain choices, including extended range electric vehicles, partial zero emissions vehicles, and a full range of hybrids across its entire lineup. “We think that’s a much better move than a $60,000 to $70,000 all-electric crossover,” Farley said. “We think it is really what customers are going to want long term and we’re investing a lot in more durable internal combustion engine powertrains.”

“We’ve definitely moved out launches, we’ve canceled some products, we’ve made the right choices in terms of battery chemistry change, like our LFP in Michigan. I think we’re very well positioned for the reality of the EV market with the customers today,” Farley said. The new strategy is expected to give Ford flexibility to adapt to the market forces without having to commit to multi-year product cycles on a full line of EVs.

Radical Re-Engineering

“Ours EVs are coming out in the next year or two,” Farley said. “So you’re going to see a lot of news out from Ford on our EVs. Our strategy’s very simple: We believe the only way to really compete effectively with the Chinese, over the globe on EVs, is to go and really push ourselves to radically re-engineer and transform our engineering, supply chain, and manufacturing process.”

That’s interesting. US and European automakers taught the Chinese how to manufacture automobiles, then the Chinese figured out how to beat them at their own game. Now the Chinese are returning the favor by teaching the US and Europeans how to build cars in the 21st century, which means electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. The traditional companies thought they were the shizznit but they got caught napping when the Chinese changed the game from internal combustion to battery electric powertrains.

“You should expect from Ford in these other regions, where electrification is very important, to partner where we need to,” Farley said. “We have a good strategy. I’m very thankful that we moved fast because we learned about the market changing maybe before our competitors and we can reload our capital and have the right planning for this new reality of EVs.”

Prayers & Promises

Those are very encouraging words, but will Ford get its sums right going forward? A “Model T moment” is a bold prediction. Now to see if Farley and Ford can deliver on that claim. Will we be amazed on August 11? Among the cognoscenti at CleanTechnica global headquarters, the mood is hopeful, but tinged with a dollop of doubt as to whether Ford can actually beat the Chinese at their own game.

It’s one thing to succeed when the opposition is excluded by tariffs and trade barriers; it’s quite another to do so on a level playing field. Farley is pretty good at being the public face of a major US automaker, but now he is promising a big step forward for the company. Until August 11, the jury is still out on whether he can deliver on the promises he is making.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ford-Marshall-battery-factory.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 12:08:50.588432

We will not stay silent.” Earlier this month, the EPA issued a final rule delaying air pollution protections for communities near steel mills, according to the Federal Register.
Current rules have required steel mills to reduce emissions since last April, but the agency’s new action delays compliance until April 2027, allowing pollution to continue at current levels.
“Communities living near steel mills in states such as Indiana and Pennsylvania deserve better,” she said.
“Northwest Indiana is already home to some of the worst air pollution in this country,” a previous JTNWI statement said.","Two Northwest Indiana community groups have joined EarthJustice to challenge the Environmental Protection Agency’s actions to delay air pollution compliance in steel mills.

“The 2024 air standards — hard-won safeguards for fenceline communities — are being stripped away, as the agency grants emissions exemptions to steel mills and eliminates public input,” Lisa Vallee, organizing director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana, said in a Wednesday news release. “This is environmental injustice: they are sacrificing our communities, gutting our social safety nets, and taking away our future. We will not stay silent.”

Earlier this month, the EPA issued a final rule delaying air pollution protections for communities near steel mills, according to the Federal Register.

Current rules have required steel mills to reduce emissions since last April, but the agency’s new action delays compliance until April 2027, allowing pollution to continue at current levels.

According to EarthJustice, the EPA published the final rule without notice, which did not allow the public to object to the extension before it went into effect.

EarthJustice is a San Francisco-based nonprofit public interest environmental law organization that works with community groups nationwide.

EarthJustice Senior Attorney Adrienne Lee said in a Wednesday news release that it’s alarming for the EPA to delay protections without first accepting public input. The action is also inconsistent with the agency’s responsibility to human health and the environment, Lee said.

“Communities living near steel mills in states such as Indiana and Pennsylvania deserve better,” she said. “Each year, steel mills expose these communities to hundreds of tons of toxic air pollution which places them at increased risk of developing cancer and a variety of chronic health conditions.”

An October report from Industrious Labs found that most residents in Gary are in the top 10% nationally for being most at-risk for developing asthma and at-risk of low life expectancy. In 2020, Indiana had a lung cancer rate of 72.5 per 100,000 people, with Lake County as one of the state’s counties with the highest cancer mortality rates, according to the American Lung Association.

A 2016 JAMA Network report also found Gary as one of the top five U.S. cities with the lowest life expectancy at one point.

The EPA declined to comment on the legal action, saying in an email that it’s longstanding practice not to comment on current or pending litigation.

Dorreen Carey, president of Gary Advocates for Responsible Development, said in the news release that EPA’s actions fail to protect Gary and surrounding Northwest Indiana communities’ residents. Carey called out U.S. Steel’s Gary Works facility specifically, saying pollutants have led to increased health issues in the city.

“The current outmoded and insufficient methods of hazardous air emission monitoring and control at Gary Works are not protective of human health and the environment,” Carey said. “Residents must have a voice in EPA decisions and rulemaking and EPA must do its job to protect the residents and the natural resources of Gary…”

A U.S. Steel spokesperson responded to the action in a statement Thursday.

“Environmental stewardship is a core value at U.S. Steel, and we remain committed to the safety of our communities as do our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees,” the statement said.

JTNWI and GARD have previously expressed concerns with U.S. Steel’s application for two-year exemptions from hazardous air pollutant rules for integrated iron and steel, coke and taconite iron ore process, according to Post-Tribune archives.

U.S. Steel previously told the Post-Tribune in a statement that it challenged all three rules because they were not supported by science or law and would impose significant costs while setting technically unachievable standards. Seeking these exemptions doesn’t mean U.S. Steel isn’t “supportive of revisions to regulations that are within (the EPA’s) statutory authority, based on sound science and are technically feasible,” according to Post-Tribune archives.

In March, the EPA announced corporations could apply for presidential exemptions to sections of the Clean Air Act. Exemption applications were due March 31, and if approved, can be extended for up to two additional years.

“Northwest Indiana is already home to some of the worst air pollution in this country,” a previous JTNWI statement said. “In this region, we suffer from a cumulative, generational impact of exposure to industrial toxins in communities like Lake County, Indiana. These exemptions are a free pass for these polluters at the continued cost of our health and safety. We’re adamantly opposed to this astonishing reversal of environmental law in no uncertain terms. Our communities and region are not expendable sacrifice zones for this administration or corporations.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CTC-L-US-Steel-Gary-18a-02.jpg?w=1024&h=767,N,,2025-08-01 12:10:39.275503

SEG Solar invested $60 million in the Houston module plant and the U.S. operations and hopes to produce 2 GW of solar capacity per year.
Construction of the Tower Solar project is expected to employ about 200 workers over the building phase.","A Connecticut-based energy services company owned by a Spanish utility multinational is assembling 200,000 solar power modules manufactured in the heart of Texas oil and gas country.

To extend the geographical connection even further, those modules are being deployed in Oregon through this year and 2026. Iberdrola-owned Avangrid contracted the modules from SEG Solar for the 166-MW Tower Solar project under construction in Morrow County.

Tower Solar will generate carbon-free electricity into the Portland General Electric power grid in line with contributing to energizing tech giant Meta’s data center operations in the region.

“Domestic partnerships are critical to meeting rising demand, and by leveraging U.S. manufacturing, Avangrid has an opportunity to support local jobs and economic opportunity in states like Texas, while advancing a reliable energy future powered by American-made products,” said Avangrid CEO Jose Antonio Miranda in a statement. “Our work with SEG Solar demonstrates not only our commitment to building out the domestic supply chain, but the benefits of investing in American energy infrastructure. We are proud to see our Tower Solar project move forward with the delivery of these modules.”

Tower Solar is the third collaboration between Avangrid, which traditionally focuses on grid infrastructure and delivery in the eastern U.S., and SEG Solar. The latter is based in Houston and opened its facility to manufacture modules last year.

""This 166-MW project marks the third successful collaboration between Avangrid and SEG Solar, underscoring the strong relationship between the companies,” said Logan Fang, SEG Solar vice president of key accounts. “SEG Solar looks forward to seeing its premium 630-watt high-efficiency Yukon N Series Solar modules installed and operational in the Pacific Northwest.""

SEG Solar invested $60 million in the Houston module plant and the U.S. operations and hopes to produce 2 GW of solar capacity per year. The company’s decision to build the manufacturing site in Houston was aided with incentives from the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act.

With the new budget legislation passed by the Trump Administration and Republican Congress ending many of those renewable energy production tax credits, it was not known how the future output of the SEG Solar might be impacted.

Avangrid hopes to complete construction of the Tower Solar farm by 2026. The interconnection into the Portland General Electric grid will be supported by PGE’s Green Future Impact voluntary support from commercial, industrial and municipal customers.

Subscribers to PGE’s GFI program enroll in a bundled renewable energy product and receive the Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) associated with the energy generated from the new facility. PGE’s subscription pricing is designed to avoid cost shifting to non-participating customers.

Michelle Ferguson, Director, CBI Scotland, said: Scotland’s energy and defence sectors are vital to our economy, driving investment and supporting thousands of skilled jobs.
Increased defence spending will further boost Scotland’s skilled workforce and create growth opportunities across key supply-chain.
Katy Heidenreich, Offshore Energies UK Supply Chain and People Director said: We share the Chancellor’s commitment to Scotland’s energy future.
Our industry plays a vital role in delivering jobs, growth, and energy security through the production of homegrown energy.","The UK Government is investing in defence and clean energy to protect existing jobs and create thousands more, while keep the UK secure. Increasing defence spending to 2.6%, could lead to around 0.3% higher GDP in the long run, equivalent to around £11 billion of GDP in today’s money, according to government estimates.

RAF Lossiemouth shows how investment in defence delivers for ordinary families. The Moray base has undergone a huge transformation in recent years and military personnel and civilian workers now work together keep our fighter jets and sub-hunting aircraft in the air. The addition of three new E-7 Wedgetail aircraft to the RAF’s fleet will see even more jobs created by Boeing at the base, where the Chancellor will meet with some of the over 200 Boeing teammates who work alongside RAF personnel.

Chancellor, Rachel Reeves said:

We’re seizing the huge potential and opportunities that Scotland has on offer. Whether it’s in defence to keep the UK safe, or clean energy to power all corners of the country, this government is backing Scotland with billions of pounds of investment to grow the economy and create jobs.

Scottish Secretary, Ian Murray said:

The UK Government is investing in defence to ensure Britain’s security and deter our adversaries and drive economic growth.

This investment is a massive jobs opportunity for Scotland - this ‘defence dividend’ is good news for Scotland, where it will help create skilled jobs, drive economic growth and help tackle the critical skills gaps facing the country in sectors such as nuclear, construction, maritime and project management.

The Spending Review also saw investments that will make Scotland the home of the UK’s clean energy revolution. While Acorn is still subject to final investment decision, this £200 million is just the beginning to this government’s commitment to investing in Scotland and has the potential to safeguard 18,000 North Sea jobs whilst creating 15,000 new ones in Scotland’s clean energy transformation.

Great British Energy will also be headquartered in Aberdeen, to drive clean power generation across the UK. Boosting homegrown energy will also make the UK more secure.

The Chancellor’s visit comes as defence spending rises to 2.6% of GDP and figures from 23/24 reveal that MOD spend maintains 26,100 skilled jobs across Scotland. The Spending Review also committed £250 million to secure the future of HMNB Clyde – the first stage of a multi-decade, multi-billion renewal project and all three Clyde shipyards are currently fulfilling contracts for the Royal Navy.

Further information:

The Spending Review delivered a record settlement for Scottish public services, with the Scottish Government’s largest settlement, in real terms, since devolution in 1998. Scottish Government’s settlement is growing in real terms between 2024-25 and 2028-29. This translates into an average of £50.9 billion per year between 2026-27 and 2028-29.

Maria Laine, President United Kingdom, Ireland & Nordic region, Boeing, said:

Boeing has a long-standing presence in Scotland including at RAF Lossiemouth, the home to the UK’s P-8 Poseidon fleet and where the E-7 Wedgetail will be based when it enters service. As a key partner of the UK Armed Forces, Boeing welcomes the defence spending increase and has seen first-hand how defence infrastructure investments, such as the £100 million Atlantic Building and new E-7 facilities at RAF Lossiemouth, can deliver for local jobs, suppliers and UK national security.

Michelle Ferguson, Director, CBI Scotland, said:

Scotland’s energy and defence sectors are vital to our economy, driving investment and supporting thousands of skilled jobs. The Chancellor’s announcement of £200 million for the Acorn energy project is very encouraging, but businesses are eager for final approval to unlock its full potential and secure North Sea jobs. Increased defence spending will further boost Scotland’s skilled workforce and create growth opportunities across key supply-chain. Close collaboration between the Scottish and UK governments will be essential to fully realise these benefits, driving forward national security and Scotland’s transition to a resilient, low-carbon economy.

Mark Sommerfeld, UK Director of the Carbon Capture and Storage Association, said:

The Chancellor’s visit to Acorn further highlights the importance of CCUS in securing the future of our foundational industries and delivering a secure low carbon power system - both in Scotland and across the UK. The Government’s commitment to CCUS means that thousands of skilled jobs will be protected, with thousands more created across our industrial heartlands - delivering economic growth and clean power.

To maintain global leadership in CCUS and realise the full benefits for our industrial communities, we need to see clear deployment pathways for both Acorn and Viking CCS, as well as other projects developing at pace across the UK. By doing so, the Government can deliver on its economic growth mission and climate goals.

Katy Heidenreich, Offshore Energies UK Supply Chain and People Director said:

We share the Chancellor’s commitment to Scotland’s energy future. Our industry plays a vital role in delivering jobs, growth, and energy security through the production of homegrown energy.

Government support for projects like Acorn is crucial. The UK Government has committed £200 million in development funding to Acorn — Scotland’s flagship carbon capture and storage initiative — marking a major milestone in advancing the country’s decarbonisation strategy.

Based in California, the company is set to launch a new facility in San Antonio, Texas, which will utilize approximately 500 recycled EV battery packs. This innovative approach aims to tackle two pressing challenges: the growing demand for renewable energy storage and the environmental burden of discarded batteries. With the promise of storing up to 24 megawatt-hours of electricity, this project is poised to make a significant impact on the local energy landscape.

Repurposing Old EV Batteries for Energy Storage

The B2U initiative offers a novel solution by giving a “second life” to EV batteries that are no longer efficient for powering vehicles. Despite their reduced capacity, these batteries retain up to 70–80 percent of their original charge potential. This residual capacity makes them ideal candidates for conversion into energy storage units. By adopting this approach, B2U not only diverts batteries from landfills but also addresses the energy storage needs of the electric grid.

Utilizing its patented EV Pack Storage (EPS) system, B2U has developed a modular solution that can house multiple battery packs in easily deployable EPS cabinets. This system is designed for flexibility, allowing a mix of battery brands and models to be used together. Remarkably, B2U’s approach foregoes the need for expensive and energy-intensive refurbishment processes. Instead, the company offers a “plug-and-play” system that is ready to integrate directly with the grid.

Furthermore, the system uses artificial intelligence to optimize energy management. It can automatically determine the best times to store or sell electricity, based on real-time grid demand and pricing. This level of sophistication not only makes the system cost-effective but also enhances the reliability of the power grid.

Why Texas Is the Ideal Location

Texas presents a unique opportunity for B2U’s innovative storage solution. The state’s power grid is known for its vulnerabilities, including its isolation from the national grid and increasing electricity demands. Coupled with a growing mix of solar and wind energy sources, Texas faces challenges in maintaining grid stability when renewable sources are not generating power.

B2U’s choice to establish its facility in Texas is strategic. The state’s energy market is ripe for backup solutions like those offered by B2U, which can provide critical energy storage when renewable sources fall short. The facility’s capacity to store and release energy on demand will help mitigate power fluctuations and enhance grid resilience.

As Texas continues to expand its renewable energy portfolio, the importance of reliable storage systems cannot be overstated. B2U’s entry into the Texas market marks a significant step forward in solving these issues without the need for new battery production, thereby reducing both costs and environmental impact.

Future Plans for B2U Storage Solutions

The San Antonio facility is just the beginning for B2U in Texas. The company has ambitious plans to expand its presence in the state with three additional projects, aiming for a combined total of 100 megawatt-hours of battery storage. By mid-2026, B2U expects to have 150 megawatt-hours of grid-connected used EV batteries in operation across its facilities.

These initiatives underscore the increasing importance of finding sustainable ways to manage the lifecycle of EV batteries. As electric vehicles become more prevalent, the need to address the disposal and reuse of batteries becomes critical. B2U’s projects not only offer a viable recycling solution but also contribute to the scalability of energy storage systems.

The company’s approach aligns with broader trends in the energy sector, where clean energy and storage solutions are being integrated to improve overall grid reliability. By leveraging existing resources, B2U is setting a precedent for sustainable energy practices that other companies may follow.

Background on the Proposed Endangerment Finding Repeal

We’ve also published a deeper look into this announcement from the EPA, including a response from the ATA. Here’s a summary, in case you missed it:

The EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding serves as the legal foundation for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, including those related to federal electric vehicle mandates.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the proposal during a press event in Indiana, estimating the repeal could save Americans $54 billion per year by reducing regulatory costs. The agency said new scientific data challenges the assumptions used in the original determination that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.

If finalized, the proposal would eliminate all federal GHG standards for light-, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles. Critics of the 2009 finding argue that it relied on flawed legal and scientific interpretations and placed hidden costs on consumers and businesses. A public comment period will follow, with final details published in the Federal Register.

The repeal aligns with the Trump administration’s broader energy strategy, which prioritizes deregulation and lower costs for energy producers and users.

Why now is a good time,Kala Hunter,,,,,https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/news/environment/article311524616.html,"Vinson only paid $130 because of the federal tax credit that gives back 30% of the cost of an energy audit.
“I thought I knew my house, but they found spots in the house where there was no insulation,” Vinson said.
Insulation is also on the list of IRA energy efficiency tax credits, so Vinson paid $5,130 instead of $6,700.
“I would start with an energy audit.
“A lot of homes in Columbus were built in the 1900’s… the majority need to have an energy audit.” Energy Savers does not provide BPI certified energy audits.","In late July, air conditioning units hum throughout the Chattahoochee Valley and across Georgia, cooling homes, providing indoor respite from blistering triple-digit heat.

On Wednesday, the heat index at the Columbus airport reached 107 degrees around 4 p.m. Scientists say that day’s temperature was three times more likely because of climate change.

As summers – and even spring days – heat up outside, the pressure to keep homes and businesses more comfortable is mounting. Central air conditioning units are working overtime, and Georgia Power electric bills are higher than ever before. Some Columbus residents are settling for 80, or in some cases, 90-degree temperatures inside their home in an effort to save money.

New air conditioning units are not cheap; they are often referred to as one of the costliest purchases one will ever make, running anywhere from $7,500 to $13,000.

But there are two simple solutions that can combat costs and discomfort that experts say could be just as effective and efficient as getting a new air conditioning unit: an energy audit, and if necessary, insulating the home.

And, for the next five months there are huge savings to be made from the Inflation Reduction Act home improvement tax credits by the federal government. The credits were created as an effort to incentivize electrifying the home and transition away from fossil fuels to help combat climate change, but many are set to expire soon because the “Big Beautiful Bill” repealed them.

An energy audit is a two-to-three hour inspection where a professional building analyst diagnoses a home, finding leaks that are quickly pushing expensive and comfortable air out of the home. Auditors conduct a “blower door and combustion safety testing,” said Nick Stevens, senior software engineer from Rewiring America. “They can pressurize your house and look with a thermal imaging gun to find leaks.”

These professional audits cost $400, according to Shane Matteson, an auditor and operations Manager of Energy Consulting Services based in Atlanta. He audited Sara Vinson’s home in Covington – not far from Atlanta – a few years ago.

Vinson only paid $130 because of the federal tax credit that gives back 30% of the cost of an energy audit. In her case it was $270. Additionally, ECS is a Georgia Power partner contractor, which means Vinson could apply for a $150 rebate through Georgia Power for the audit.

“I thought I knew my house, but they found spots in the house where there was no insulation,” Vinson said. ”I thought, surely they’re going to tell us to replace these sliding glass doors or insulate them somehow. But, it turns out the cold air (in the winter) was coming from our attic like right beside our kitchen cabinets, that there was a lot of insulation missing.”

Vinson got a packet of suggested changes and took ECS’ recommendations, starting with a spray foam insulation. Industry experts say it is the most significant in energy savings compared to wool, cellulose or fiberglass.

“Spray foam is one of the most efficient forms of insulation that you can get for your home,” Stevens said. “Even though there is a climate cost for it, you can make up for that cost in the savings that you’ll have from a really well sealed and insulated (home).”

The foam does come at a cost for the environment, as hydrofluorocarbons are emitted from the spray, and they contribute to global warming. Insulation is also on the list of IRA energy efficiency tax credits, so Vinson paid $5,130 instead of $6,700.

“Attic insulation is probably the cheapest thing, but the most impactful,” said Mike Gunter, general manager of Energy Savers, an HVAC company in Columbus.

Vinson gives presentations to share what she’s learned to her community groups in Newton County and said of the 50 attendees, zero knew about the Inflation Reduction Act tax credits, or the benefits of auditing a home and adding insulation, least of all replacing an air conditioningfor a heat pump.

While its name doesn’t imply it provides cool air, a heat pump is an all-in-one system that heats and cools using electricity instead of a furnace or boiler. They’ve become popular, growing from 7 million to over 18 million installations across the U.S. in the last 10 years.

“They tend to be way more efficient than either a gas boiler or a furnace or even an AC,” Stevens said. “It’s kind of like a two way AC, it tends to be more comfortable too (and) you’re able to get rid of all those meter fees that come along with gas, so you can really save a lot of money (switching).”

Is a new heat pump on the tax credit list? Yes, like the insulation credit, those who want to install one can get a 30% credit of the project cost.

Vinson replaced her HVAC with an Energy Star heat pump, which would have cost $10,000 but instead cost $7,000 with the tax credit.

“Our house is tremendously more comfortable than it was before the improvements,” she said in an email to the Ledger-Enquirer. “To this day, my husband and I can’t get over how little our HVAC runs and how well our house retains heat in the winter and cool air in the summer. It’s a remarkable improvement.”

Vinson said her accountant was familiar with the tax credits and it wasn’t complicated or difficult when tax season came around.

Incentives will be gone soon

When the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law on July 4, it drastically shortened the amount of time people had to take advantage of these credits. The timeline changed from 2032 to Dec. 31, 2025.

“Because of the expiration of the incentives at the end of the year, now’s the time to jump into this,” Stevens said. “I would start with an energy audit. And those are pretty quick processes. You can get one of those in two to three hours … then deliver a report to you, typically within a week, that you can then take to go and do all these other improvements.”

Rewiring America offers a planner, which Stevens helped develop, and an opportunity to find certified building professionals by putting in a zip code. But there aren’t any within two hours of Columbus, according to their tool. They do have a link that has a DIY test and suggest going through BPI-Contractors, but there aren’t any in the Columbus area.

Georgia Power does not offer employees to come in and audit homes, and their provided map does not show any partner contracts in the area.

However, marketing and PR spokesperson Alicia Brown said customers could contact Green Home Solutions, based in Cedartown, or Be Smart Home Solutions, servicing Georgia, South Carolina, parts of Florida, and Virginia.

Brown said if contractors are interested in being a participating contractor, they should contact Georgia Power for more details.

Matteson said he gets calls from the Columbus area, but said it doesn’t make business sense for him to make a 3.5-hour trek round trip.

“The small-medium markets are totally underserved,” he said. “We’re a niche industry and we’re booked a month out.”

Columbus is in an audit deficit, despite desperately needing it.

“If I had to guess, eight out of 10 houses in Columbus need to replace equipment, or have duct modification,” Gunter said. “A lot of homes in Columbus were built in the 1900’s… the majority need to have an energy audit.”

Energy Savers does not provide BPI certified energy audits. Gunter said they would like to, but don’t have the manpower.

He said they do focus on duct work more than their competitors who might just try to sell a new unit instead of getting to efficiency.

Duct systems are the passageways that carry the air from the unit throughout the house. Gunter thinks those leaks are huge problems, especially because a lot of homes in Columbus were built in the 1900s, he said.

Energy Savers do provide insulation but instead of foam spray they spray fiberglass insulation.

Another reason to act now on an audit, insulation or heat pump is because the costs of units have risen dramatically over the last five years, and according to Gunter, they won’t get any cheaper. He suspects it is from a variety of factors such as inflation, supply chain issues or new tariffs.

“In January of 2020 we might have installed a system for $7,500 and now a similar system, maybe similar size. I mean, it’s not uncommon that it’s close to $12,000,” Gunter said.

Brown said Georgia Power will begin offering in-person energy audits in 2026, but it will be in a preliminary phase.",https://www.ledger-enquirer.com/public/latest-news/rshzmi/picture311524319/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Energy%20Savers,N,,2025-08-01 11:04:19.697796

Clean Energy Tax Credit Phase-Outs and Modifications Under the One Big Beautiful Bill

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed in July 2025, represents a significant shift in federal energy policy, implementing substantial changes to clean energy tax incentives. The legislation phases out or modifies numerous clean energy tax credits that were originally established under the Inflation Reduction Act, with specific expiration dates and restrictions that taxpayers must carefully navigate.

Individual Clean Energy Credits Being Terminated

Clean Vehicle Credits

The Clean Vehicle credit, which provided up to $7,500 for a new electric vehicle and $4,000 for a used one, is terminated for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. This represents a dramatic acceleration of the phase-out timeline, as these credits were originally scheduled to continue through the early 2030s. The clean vehicle credit now expires for vehicles purchased after September 30, 2025, and eligible taxpayers who were considering purchasing a qualifying vehicle should consider making this purchase before the deadline.

The termination of these credits affects both individual consumers and businesses that were planning to transition their fleets to electric vehicles. The shortened timeline creates urgency for taxpayers who had been considering electric vehicle purchases as part of their long-term financial planning.

Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit

The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, which provided up to $1,000 for electric vehicle charging equipment installed at a taxpayer’s personal residence, is terminated for property placed in service after June 30, 2026. This credit was particularly valuable for homeowners installing Level 2 charging stations and other EV infrastructure.

Residential Energy Credits

The OBBBA implements significant changes to residential energy incentives through two major modifications:

Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit: Section 25C(h) is amended by striking “placed in service” and all that follows through “December 31, 2032” and inserting “placed in service after December 31, 2025” One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Sec. 70505. Termination of energy efficient home improvement credit . This credit, which provided up to $1,200 toward the cost of energy-efficiency improvements such as windows, doors, insulation, or heating and cooling equipment, and home energy audits, is terminated for property placed in service after December 31, 2025.

Residential Clean Energy Credit: Section 25D(h) is amended by striking “to property placed in service after December 31, 2034” and inserting “with respect to any expenditures made after December 31, 2025” One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Sec. 70506. Termination of residential clean energy credit . This credit, which provided up to 30% of the cost of purchasing or installing solar panels, wind power, geothermal heat pumps, or fuel cell equipment, is terminated for expenditures made after December 31, 2025, regardless of when the property is placed in service.

Business and Commercial Clean Energy Credits

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit Modifications

The OBBBA introduces Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions for several credits, including the advanced manufacturing production credit (45X), and alters phaseouts and eligibility for this credit Tax Foundation . The legislation implements more stringent requirements for businesses seeking to claim these credits, particularly focusing on supply chain security and domestic content requirements.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit Phase-Out

The clean hydrogen production credit (45V) is repealed after 2027 Tax Foundation . This represents a significant acceleration of the phase-out timeline for what was considered a key component of the clean energy transition strategy. The credit was originally designed to incentivize the development of clean hydrogen production facilities, but the OBBBA’s changes reflect a shift in federal energy priorities.

Clean Fuel Production Credit Extension with Modifications

Contrary to the general trend of credit eliminations, the clean fuel production credit (45Z) is extended until 2030 and eligibility is expanded Tax Foundation . Section 45Z(g) is amended by striking “December 31, 2027” and inserting “December 31, 2029” One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Sec. 70521. Extension and modification of clean fuel production credit . This extension provides some continuity for biofuel producers and other clean fuel manufacturers, though it comes with additional compliance requirements and restrictions.

Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction

The deduction for energy-efficient commercial buildings (179D) is repealed after one year of the law’s enactment Tax Foundation . This affects commercial property owners and developers who had been relying on this deduction to offset the costs of energy-efficient building improvements.

Production Tax Credits and Investment Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production and Investment Credits

The OBBBA implements phase-out mechanisms for several electricity-related credits. The clean electricity investment credit under section 48E includes a phase-out where the credit amount is reduced based on when construction begins, with phase-out percentages of 100 percent, 75 percent, 50 percent, and ultimately 0 percent for facilities beginning construction in successive calendar years following the applicable year .

Nuclear Production Credit Restrictions

The nuclear production credit (45U) now includes FEOC restrictions Tax Foundation , which may limit the ability of certain entities to claim these credits based on foreign ownership or control considerations.

Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credits

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit Expansion

While many credits are being phased out, the law expands the carbon oxide sequestration credit Tax Foundation . The carbon oxide sequestration credit (45Q) includes FEOC restrictions and altered phaseouts and eligibility requirements Tax Foundation . This represents one of the few areas where the OBBBA actually enhances clean energy incentives, reflecting the administration’s focus on carbon capture technology as a bridge solution.

Implementation Timeline and Compliance Challenges

Regulatory Guidance Requirements

The administration is now working through regulatory guidance and interpretation for businesses planning to take the expiring credits over the next two years, which will require close monitoring by taxpayers who desire to comply with the tax law while also claiming residual credits prior to their expiration Tax Foundation . This creates significant compliance challenges for taxpayers who must navigate the transition period while ensuring they meet all requirements for credits claimed before the expiration dates.

Foreign Entity of Concern Restrictions

A significant aspect of the OBBBA’s modifications involves the implementation of Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions across multiple credit categories. The legislation introduces FEOC content thresholds for wind and solar projects and includes FEOC restrictions for several other credits, including the nuclear production credit (45U), the clean fuel production credit (45Z), the carbon oxide sequestration credit (45Q), and the advanced manufacturing production credit (45X) Tax Foundation Tax Foundation .

Revenue Impact and Policy Implications

Fiscal Impact

One of the largest areas of reform in OBBBA is the repeal or early phaseout of many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s green energy tax credits, with these changes raising about $500 billion over a decade, reducing the cost of the green energy credits by about half Tax Foundation . This substantial revenue generation reflects the significant fiscal impact of the credit eliminations and modifications.

Strategic Policy Shift

Several IRA credits—like those for electric vehicles (EVs) and residential energy products—are repealed so they no longer apply beyond this year, while most others are restricted or phased out on an accelerated schedule over the next few years Tax Foundation . This represents a fundamental shift in federal energy policy away from the broad-based clean energy incentive approach that characterized the Inflation Reduction Act.

The OBBBA’s approach to clean energy credits reflects a more targeted and restrictive policy framework that prioritizes certain technologies while eliminating support for others. Taxpayers and businesses must carefully review their clean energy investment plans and ensure compliance with the new timelines and restrictions to maximize available benefits before the various expiration dates take effect.

Evergy Missouri West will own 100% of a 440-megawatt natural gas facility in Nodaway County, Missouri, with a price tag of $835 million.
Evergy Kansas Central will own 100% of a 75-megawatt solar farm, Sunflower Sky Solar Project, in Wilson County, Kansas, estimated to cost $128.8 million.
“Current construction schedules should allow the solar plants to benefit from federal tax credits, and those benefits will be passed to customers served by the plants,” she said.
Some aspects of the new generation projects are already under contract.”","TOPEKA — Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved Evergy’s request to build three natural gas plants and two solar farms, freeing the company to move forward with infrastructure projects that will cost more than $2.75 billion.

The four-member Missouri Public Service Commission board approved the facilities after hearing presentations about the facilities two weeks ago and despite worries about investing in solar energy.

“Personally, the solar case is concerning,” said MPSC chairwoman Kayla Hahn. “I recognize that we need more generation, and in particular, Evergy West needs more generation. However, intermittent resources such as solar as standalone projects seem to make little sense and may not be the best choice in terms of resource planning and the best use of ratepayer dollars.”

Hahn said her concerns were pertinent in light of federal changes to green energy tax credits, among other issues. The state faces conflicting issues with the need to build replacement and additional generation and the need to keep rates affordable, she said.

“It’s increasingly important that a critical view is taken of any request for new generation,” Hahn said. “Because we are in a situation where the need for additional generation for Evergy West, who has been and continues to be short on its own generation, is so great, I’m not going to stand in the way of allowing more generation resources to be added.”

Evergy announced last year its intent to build the gas plants — two in Kansas and one in Missouri — and the solar plants, one in each state. The company sought pre-approval for the projects through Kansas and Missouri regulators.

They received approval from the Kansas Corporation Commission in early July.

Evergy Missouri West, the Evergy subsidiary serving Missouri customers, and Evergy Kansas Central, which serves Kansas customers, will own 50% each of the two Kansas gas plants. The two 710-megawatt facilities, located in Sumner and Reno counties, are expected to cost $788.75 million and $800.52 million, respectively.

Evergy Missouri West will own 100% of a 440-megawatt natural gas facility in Nodaway County, Missouri, with a price tag of $835 million. It will also own Foxtrot Solar Energy, a 107 megawatt solar farm in Jasper County, Missouri, estimated to cost $213.8 million.

Evergy Kansas Central will own 100% of a 75-megawatt solar farm, Sunflower Sky Solar Project, in Wilson County, Kansas, estimated to cost $128.8 million.

Darrin Ives, Evergy vice president of regulatory affairs, told MPSC commissioners Thursday there had been “a lot of movement” about tax credits and tariffs at the federal level.

“At this stage, we still need some information from the Treasury,” he said. “But by and large, with the budget reconciliation bill, they’ve set up a path and a plan that, while it’s scaled back significantly the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) subsidies around carbon-free generation, it has left a pathway for these projects.

Ives said there’s also a pathway to complete the project by the end of 2027 and still qualify for tax credits. Ives said the issues were part of settlement discussions, and Evergy will be required to give updates on any changes with tax credit availability, among other reporting requirements.

In a press release after the MPSC decision Thursday, the Sierra Club said it opposed Evergy’s proposal. The nonprofit intervened in the MPSC case.

“No party, except Evergy, argued that the gas plant proposals are economically feasible, a critical factor in the MIssouri approval process,” the release said.

““If Evergy’s application is approved as submitted, Missouri ratepayers will be on the hook for gas plants that are likely to be unprofitable, operate less than expected and incur high maintenance costs or even premature failure due to excessive generator starts and cycling,” testified Michael Goggin, a Sierra Club expert witness, before MPSC.

Billy Davies, Sierra Club’s Missouri chapter organizer based in Kansas City, said in the press release that Evergy shareholders, rather than ratepayers, should shoulder the costs of generation expansion.

“Sadly, the PSC is enabling utilities and multi-billion dollar tech companies to use average Missouri families as piggy banks to power new data centers,” Davies said. “The last hope for the commission to protect Missouri families from utility bill shock is to have a strong large user fee that ensures multi-billion dollar tech companies pay their fair share of these new power plants being built in the name of their data centers.”

Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said the company was pleased the MPSC approved the plants.

“Current construction schedules should allow the solar plants to benefit from federal tax credits, and those benefits will be passed to customers served by the plants,” she said.

Tariff levels are changing frequently, so it is difficult to quantify their effect on the projects, she said.

“If they stay in place over a long term, the cost of capital projects like new generation would increase,” Penzig said. “As we negotiate contracts with suppliers, we are always focused on keeping our costs low because that impacts our customers’ rates. Some aspects of the new generation projects are already under contract.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-84/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/p1090642-1024x5761754054922.jpg?h=c12e0b96&itok=rfjq3YvP,N,,2025-08-01 11:04:24.278558

Every day, science is being undermined. The latest blow to independent research is the dismantling of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development (ORD). Since March, the administration has been denying ORD was on the chopping block. But by mid-July, after the Supreme Court decided the Trump administration could drastically reduce the federal workforce and dismantle agencies, ORD was slated to be gutted.

“I am pretty displeased with the federal government and political leadership at EPA,” says Chris Frey, who served at EPA under President Biden, including as head of ORD. He left in September 2024, to return to North Carolina State University, where he’s currently the Associate Dean for Research and Infrastructure of the College of Engineering.

Tell Congress: Defend EPA’s Ability to Protect Human Health and the Environment

What’s ORD?

ORD, by unique design, is a science organization within EPA—an independent agency producing research that’s used to inform decisions, including policies and regulations. ORD scientists support the needs of EPA stakeholders but remain separate from the political fray. This creates an important “firewall,” says Dr. Frey, between scientists and political leadership and administrators. ORD connects with policy officers at four offices—informally known as Air, Water, Land, and Chemicals—on what science is needed, but critically, scientists are not told what outcomes need to be.

“EPA staff really care about the mission of the agency and also care about getting policy done. Sometimes the mindset of doing policy doesn’t align with the mindset of doing science,” he notes. The structure of ORD being distinct from the rest of EPA “enables scientists to do world-class peer-reviewed science independent of those pressures, responsive to the information needs of decision makers, and that stand ups to scrutiny.”

ORD’s research portfolio is wide ranging and covers everything from risks of hazardous chemicals, impacts of wildfire smoke on the environment and public health, contamination of drinking water by chemicals from fracking to PFAS, soot pollution, responses to environmental emergencies and exposure to chemicals, and much more. Dr. Frey’s own research includes measurement and modeling of human exposure to air pollution and vehicle emissions. The head of the union that represents EPA workers has described ORD as “the heart and brain of the EPA.”

ORD also conducts “anticipatory research,” collaborating on and figuring out future scientific needs unrelated to current policy making. “One example is that ORD has long invested in computational toxicology and developing new approach methods aimed at trying to move away from very expensive and time-consuming tests,” says Dr. Frey, adding, “What’s being torn apart is designed to support the best and relevant science done in a credible way. That’s pretty much out the window at this point.”

What dismantling ORD looks like

When Dr. Frey was in charge, ORD had an annual budget of over $500 million, more than 1,500 federal full-time employees, and 12 locations across the U.S. This isn’t all gone—yet. The situation is in flux. According to Dr. Frey’s former colleagues on the inside, some people have taken early retirement or been placed on leave, others have been told to apply for ill-defined internal job openings—not research positions—for scientists in one of EPA’s policy program offices, and still others have been summarily reassigned to new jobs with no option to decline and still remain employed.

“I have talked to a few people that got notice that they’ve been moved into one of the program offices. They don’t know what they’re going to do, and the management in those offices don’t know what they’re going to do with those people. We don’t really know if it’s getting totally shut down. It’s a big mess. The political leadership is not forthcoming,” says Dr. Frey, who writes a blog meant to be a one-stop shop related to the proposed elimination of EPA’s ORD.

There were also a thousand other folks, not federal employees, working with Dr. Frey at ORD—“essentially contractors”—supporting the work of different labs across the country. Most of these were young scientists, “ORISE” fellows through Oak Ridge Institute. “These are bachelor, master, PhDs, and post-doc research associates on the leading edge of science. They bring in new ideas, excitement, and energy,” he says. That EPA has not renewed their contracts is “a huge loss.”

Quantifying what’s being lost

The public health of every person in the U.S. as well as the environment is touched by ORD’s work. “Decisions informed by ORD scientists have avoided hundreds of thousands of premature deaths, millions of incidents of illnesses, and protection of air, water, and soil quality, plus a better understanding of the toxicity of chemicals in commerce that leads to evidence-based rule making,” explains Dr. Frey. Without ORD to measure what’s in the environment, we’ll be in the dark about what’s there and how to prevent or control releases plus how to mitigate or clean up. The loss is staggering.

Why dismantle ORD?

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, a well-established friend to industry, just bucked all scientific consensus when this week he announced a proposal to revoke the Endangerment Finding, the legal foundation of EPA’s ability to protect us from the health effects of climate change. ORD’s research has, in the past, often been the basis for stricter environmental rules. Industry, including the American Chemistry Council, in particular has wanted to see ORD’s Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), a program for evaluating toxic chemicals, dismantled. But eliminating the entire office goes beyond what was even recommended in Project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint that has inspired many of this administration’s efforts, notes Dr. Frey. “What they’re doing is puzzling. It’s the worst combination of an administration that seems very hostile to science and appointees that don’t understand the role of science. It’s like a perfect storm.”

Can ORD be put back together in the future?

Dr. Frey believes ORD will live again with commitment plus the right resources and leadership, though he allows it would take considerable time to recover from this “huge insult and injury.” He sees a glimmer of hope in the fact that the Senate Appropriations Committee recently approved a budget bill that would require EPA to maintain ORD in a clear 26 to 2 vote.

“The bill includes language about restoring ORD to 2021 structure and levels. This is the first signal that I’ve noticed coming out of either body of Congress of a genuine level of awareness and support. We’re going to get through this, and something will come back,” he says.

In the long term, ERCOT has estimated that data center energy demand across its coverage area could rise to 78GW by 2031. Notable developments in the Lone Star state include Crusoe’s 200MW+ Abilene data center campus, which is currently under construction, QTS’s planned data center campus in Dallas, and Microsoft's latest data center development in San Antonio.
In the PJM grid, the projected growth comes as concerns arise over the impact of data center developments on ratepayers’ electricity bills.
The operator recently closed its annual capacity auction, which saw the cost of wholesale electricity grow by 22 percent compared to last year.
PJM supplies the world's biggest data center markets, including Virginia and Ohio.","According to the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, demand in the ERCOT region is forecast to grow at an average rate of 11 percent in 2025 and 2026, with PJM growing by 4 percent. In comparison, nationwide US electricity sales are projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, which remains much higher than the average growth of 0.8 percent between 2020 and 2024.

According to GridStrategies, data center demand could grow from as little as 10GW to as much as 65GW through 2029. Much of the new growth will be concentrated in the PJM and ERCOT markets. In a 2025 update by ERCOT, peak demand is expected to increase by 46.8GW through 2029, and in PJM, it's forecast to increase by 24.8GW.

The electricity sales spike in the near term within the ERCOT region is expected to be driven by new large data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities coming online. In the long term, ERCOT has estimated that data center energy demand across its coverage area could rise to 78GW by 2031.

Notable developments in the Lone Star state include Crusoe’s 200MW+ Abilene data center campus, which is currently under construction, QTS’s planned data center campus in Dallas, and Microsoft's latest data center development in San Antonio.

However, there are concerns that the growth could put undue strain on the ERCOT grid infrastructure. ERCOT has said that it will likely require thousands of miles of new long-distance transmission lines, which could cost more than $30 billion.

In the PJM grid, the projected growth comes as concerns arise over the impact of data center developments on ratepayers’ electricity bills. The operator recently closed its annual capacity auction, which saw the cost of wholesale electricity grow by 22 percent compared to last year.

PJM supplies the world's biggest data center markets, including Virginia and Ohio. As a result of the growth, bills for electricity have begun to soar, with Columbus, Ohio, seeing average residential bills increase by $27 a month.

Despite this, there seems to be no let-up in the growth, with Dominion Energy, the main utility supplier to the Virginian market, reporting that it had approximately 40GW in various stages of contracting as of December 2024.

Extreme weather is here. Over the past month, the U.S. has experienced dangerous and deadly flash flooding and extreme heat. Projections for the 2025 wildfire season in the Western U.S. indicate significantly increased fire potential driven by drought expansion and above-average temperatures. Meanwhile, the 2025 U.S. tornado season is on track to be above the 30-year historical average, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts a 60% chance of an above-average hurricane season.

Besides the devastating loss of life and the damage inflicted by these types of events, they have something else in common: they often leave communities without power to meet critical needs. Despite the inevitable occurrence of these events, there is good news for people in the paths of these natural disasters.

The power sector is not waiting around to reactively address damage from the next severe weather event. Hurricanes or extreme heat may be seasonal, but preparation is not.

A coalition of more than 40 energy providers and system operators — along with 100 academics, policymakers, non-profits, government agencies and others — have worked together to develop a data-driven, science-based framework to improve the resilience and reliability of the power system.

The public Climate READi framework, issued and developed by independent, non-profit energy R&D institute EPRI, guides energy companies in assessing risk and vulnerability in the energy system across a wide variety of weather and climate conditions. In addition, utilities, regulators and other stakeholders can use this set of guidance, references and tools to evaluate local hazards, prioritize investments and adapt the evolving electric system to the climate of the future.

The framework, developed over the past three years, highlights how factoring climate risk into investment decisions is a cost-effective means of increasing energy systems’ resilience to climate hazards. Knowing the exposure of assets and systems to current and future climate hazards and pinpointing system vulnerabilities at the asset and company level is key for determining which adaptation strategies to consider for any region. It’s important to note there isn’t a one-size-fits-all answer, as a West Coast utility may need to prepare against wildfires versus an East Coast utility, which may more frequently deal with ice storms. Having different options for what best suits individual utilities will be key to proactive planning for these events.

So how do companies conduct climate-informed planning and analysis?

First, the framework recommends having a dedicated team with clear ownership and responsibility. Once in place, the framework recommends the team begin with in-depth and iterative scoping, setting expectations among internal and external stakeholders to define the bounds and objectives of the assessment, while also integrating information from previous impacts of weather and climate events on asset or system performance. This involves the selection of climate data and vulnerability information that characterizes baseline conditions and captures the range of expected future conditions.

Second, the framework recommends conducting model-based evaluations across an integrated modeling platform, where data and assumptions are used consistently throughout. The company may also want to review its existing integrated resource plans, regulatory filings, or other planning documents to identify plausible future configurations of its portfolio.

Third, it is important to ensure the load data used for planning and evaluation reflects the weather dependency for the selected conditions and technologies being evaluated.

Lastly, the framework recommends comparing baseline model results to results with the various adaptations in place to determine the anticipated benefits and cost effectiveness of options under consideration. This comparison can be used to justify and prioritize adaptation investments.

Work has and will continue to be underway to proactively plan for the weather of the future. For example, last year, researchers from EPRI and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory mapped how future hurricanes could affect power outage risk. Working with PNNL, we combined synthetic hurricane tracks in a future climate with a predictive power outage model, developed using power outage data from 23 historical hurricanes that affected the continental United States and Puerto Rico between 2016 and 2023. This allowed us to assess changes in outage risk in the 2066-2100 timeframe compared to today’s climate. According to the models, the average person in the metropolitan areas of Houston, New Orleans and Boston could see expected outage events increase by more than 70% per decade, while Miami residents may see a 119% increase.

New Rules for Electric Vehicle and EV Charging Station Credits Under the One Big Beautiful Bill

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) represents a dramatic shift in federal electric vehicle policy, implementing comprehensive terminations and restrictions on EV-related tax credits that fundamentally alter the landscape for electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure development. The legislation accelerates the phase-out of virtually all EV-related incentives, creating urgent deadlines for taxpayers who wish to claim these benefits before they expire.

Complete Termination of Clean Vehicle Credits

New Clean Vehicle Credit Elimination

The previously-owned clean vehicle credit under Section 25E is terminated for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Sec. 70501. Termination of previously-owned clean vehicle credit , representing a dramatic acceleration from the original expiration date of December 31, 2032. This credit previously provided up to $4,000 for qualifying used electric vehicles, making electric vehicle ownership more accessible to middle and lower-income households.

The Clean Vehicle credit, which provided up to $7,500 for a new electric vehicle and $4,000 for a used one, is terminated for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025. This represents one of the most significant changes in the OBBBA’s approach to clean energy policy, as these credits were originally designed to accelerate electric vehicle adoption through substantial purchase incentives.

The termination affects both individual consumers and commercial purchasers who had been relying on these credits to offset the higher upfront costs of electric vehicles. The shortened timeline creates particular urgency for taxpayers who had been considering electric vehicle purchases as part of their long-term transportation planning, as they now have only until September 30, 2025, to complete qualifying purchases.

Historical Context and Phase-Out Mechanisms

Under the previous framework, taxpayers who bought a new, qualified plug-in electric vehicle (EV) in 2022 or prior were eligible for a clean vehicle tax credit up to $7,500, with the credit calculated as $2,917 for a vehicle with a battery capacity of at least 5 kilowatt hours (kWh) plus $417 for each kWh of capacity over 5 kWh IRS IRM 21.7.4 Income Taxes/Information Returns IRS IRM 21.7.4 Income Taxes/Information Returns . The credit system included manufacturer-specific phase-outs, where the credit was subject to reduction once a vehicle manufacturer sold 200,000 qualifying vehicles, with the phaseout beginning in the second calendar quarter after reaching this threshold, allowing 50% of the full credit for 2 quarters, 25% of the full credit for 2 additional quarters, and no credit thereafter IRS IRM 21.7.4 Income Taxes/Information Returns .

The OBBBA’s approach eliminates this gradual phase-out mechanism entirely, instead implementing a hard termination date that applies to all manufacturers regardless of their sales volumes. This creates a uniform deadline that affects all potential EV purchasers equally, removing the complexity of manufacturer-specific phase-out schedules.

EV Charging Station Credit Termination

Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit Elimination

The Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit, which provided up to $1,000 for electric vehicle charging equipment installed at a taxpayer’s personal residence, is terminated for property placed in service after June 30, 2026. This credit was particularly valuable for homeowners installing Level 2 charging stations and other EV infrastructure at their residences.

The termination of the charging station credit creates a significant gap in the federal incentive structure for EV infrastructure development. Under the current framework, the credit equals 30% of the cost of qualifying property, including the charging equipment itself and associated property directly attributable to the charging installation, such as pedestals, wall mounts, electrical panels, and conduit/wiring IRS – Publication 6027: Individuals, Electric Vehicle Chargers, and the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit .

Commercial and Public Charging Infrastructure Impact

The elimination of charging station credits extends beyond residential installations to affect commercial and public charging infrastructure development. The EV Charger/Refueling Property Credit (30C) applied to property that recharges electric vehicles or stores or dispenses clean-burning fuel, with property required to be installed in qualifying low-income or non-urban census tracts, and was designed to appeal to the growing number of electric vehicle and plug-in electric vehicle drivers IRS – Publication 5886-B: Clean Energy Efficiency Incentives and Residential Real Estate Properties .

The credit structure included specific provisions for different types of charging equipment, with the charging port serving as the primary item for credit calculation purposes, while associated equipment such as chargers, connectors, wall mounts, electrical panels, and conduit/wiring qualified as directly attributable associated property, with the tentative credit calculated as 30% of the total qualifying costs, subject to applicable limits .

Compliance and Transition Challenges

Regulatory Guidance and Implementation Timeline

The administration is working through regulatory guidance and interpretation for businesses planning to take the expiring credits over the next two years, which will require close monitoring by taxpayers who desire to comply with the tax law while also claiming residual credits prior to their expiration Tax Foundation . This creates significant compliance challenges for taxpayers who must navigate the transition period while ensuring they meet all requirements for credits claimed before the expiration dates.

The compressed timeline for claiming these credits requires careful coordination between taxpayers, dealers, and charging equipment installers to ensure that all necessary documentation and installations are completed before the respective deadlines. For vehicle purchases, this includes ensuring that all delivery and title transfer requirements are met by September 30, 2025, while charging station installations must be placed in service by June 30, 2026.

Documentation and Reporting Requirements

Under the existing framework, EV credit claims require substantial documentation and reporting. Qualifying vehicles must have a battery capacity of not less than 7 kilowatt hours and be capable of being recharged from an external source of electricity, with final assembly occurring within North America, and sellers must furnish reports containing the taxpayer’s identification information, vehicle identification number, battery capacity, verification of original use, maximum allowable credit amount, and any transfer election information IRC § 30D(d) .

The termination of these credits eliminates the need for this complex reporting structure after the expiration dates, but taxpayers claiming credits before termination must ensure full compliance with all existing documentation requirements to avoid potential challenges or recapture provisions.

Strategic Policy Implications

Energy Policy Reorientation

The OBBBA signals a notable shift in federal energy policy, beginning to phase out numerous clean energy tax incentives that were established under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, including specific timelines for the expiration or reduction of credits related to wind, solar, electric vehicles, and EV charging infrastructure. This policy reorientation reflects a fundamental change in federal priorities regarding transportation electrification and clean energy infrastructure development.

The repeal or early phaseout of many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s green energy tax credits raises about $500 billion over a decade, reducing the cost of the green energy credits by about half, with several IRA credits—like those for electric vehicles (EVs) and residential energy products—repealed so they no longer apply beyond this year Tax Foundation . This substantial revenue generation reflects the significant fiscal impact of the credit eliminations and the scale of the policy shift.

Market Impact and Consumer Behavior

The elimination of EV credits is expected to have substantial impacts on electric vehicle adoption rates and market dynamics. The credits had been designed to offset the higher upfront costs of electric vehicles compared to conventional vehicles, making them more accessible to a broader range of consumers. Without these incentives, the total cost of ownership calculations for electric vehicles become less favorable, particularly for consumers who do not have access to home charging or who drive fewer miles annually.

The termination of charging infrastructure credits may also slow the development of public charging networks, as the economics of charging station installations become less attractive without federal tax incentives. This could create a feedback effect where reduced charging infrastructure availability further dampens consumer interest in electric vehicle adoption.

Commercial Vehicle Credit Considerations

Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credits

While the OBBBA terminates individual EV credits, certain commercial vehicle credits remain available under different provisions. Tax-exempt entities described in section 168(h)(2)(A)(i), (ii), or (iv) of the Code may be eligible for the credit for qualified commercial vehicles determined under section 45W of the Code Treasury Reg. Treasury Regulation 1.6417-1 , though these credits are subject to their own restrictions and requirements.

The regulations define various types of commercial electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) that use batteries rechargeable from external electricity sources and another fuel to power propulsion systems, plug-in hybrid fuel cell electric vehicles (PHFCEVs) that use both batteries and hydrogen fuel sources, and qualified commercial clean vehicles that meet specific requirements under section 45W(c) .

Planning Recommendations and Deadlines

Immediate Action Items for Taxpayers

Taxpayers considering electric vehicle purchases or charging station installations must act quickly to take advantage of the remaining credit availability. For vehicle purchases, all transactions must be completed by September 30, 2025, including delivery, title transfer, and any required dealer reporting. For charging station installations, the equipment must be placed in service by June 30, 2026.

To the extent that clients have plans to buy an electric vehicle or undertake any of the above home energy improvements, it will be important to make sure the purchases or work are complete by the new deadlines to remain eligible for the credits. This requires careful coordination with dealers, installers, and tax professionals to ensure all requirements are met within the compressed timeframes.

Long-Term Transportation Planning

The elimination of EV credits requires a fundamental reassessment of long-term transportation planning strategies. Without federal tax incentives, the economic case for electric vehicle adoption must rely more heavily on factors such as fuel cost savings, maintenance cost reductions, state and local incentives, and environmental considerations.

Taxpayers should consider the total cost of ownership over the expected life of the vehicle, including electricity costs, maintenance savings, potential resale value differences, and any remaining state or local incentives. The availability and cost of charging infrastructure, both at home and for longer trips, becomes a more critical factor in the decision-making process without federal purchase incentives.

The OBBBA’s termination of EV and charging station credits represents one of the most significant policy reversals in federal transportation and energy policy in recent years. The compressed timeline for claiming remaining benefits creates urgency for taxpayers, while the long-term elimination of these incentives fundamentally alters the economics of electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure development. Taxpayers must carefully evaluate their transportation needs and act quickly to capture any remaining federal tax benefits before the respective termination dates take effect.

A Biden-era program to ensure 40% of new federal climate, housing, clean energy and clean water funding went to projects and programs in historically underserved communities led to major investments in rural Oregon and to tribes, a new study revealed.

But many of those investments are now being cut or scaled back in the federal tax and spending cut megabill Republicans passed in July.

Researchers at Portland State University and the nonprofit Seattle-based Northwest Environmental Justice Center analyzed federal spending patterns between 2010 and 2024 on 468 energy, environment and infrastructure programs across the country. Overall, federal agencies sent about $2.24 trillion to state and local governments, tribes and private companies, nonprofits, individuals and higher education institutions across the country for energy and environmental infrastructure programs from 2010 to 2024.

The share of that money benefiting rural counties and economically distressed counties nationwide more than tripled in the last decade, the researchers found, and accelerated dramatically after former President Joe Biden issued an executive order creating the Justice40 Initiative to direct 40% of new federal climate and clean energy spending to underserved communities.

Historic investments in clean energy, infrastructure and environmental protection projects followed under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that passed in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022.

“I would say that if you look at the change of proportional investment in rural communities and tribes over time, in particular the last couple years, what the federal programs were doing was working,” said Bobby Cochran, a senior project manager at Portland State University’s Hatfield School of Government and one of the co-authors of the report.

But in March, President Donald Trump terminated the Justice40 Initiative. And Lee Zeldin, head of the federal Environmental Protection Agency, cancelled more than a billion worth of grants related to environmental justice.

Of the more than 400 federal grant programs that researchers analyzed, Republicans cut or scaled back 30 of them that provided about half of all federal energy and environment money to Oregon in 2024.

Investments in rural Oregon, tribes

In Oregon, investments in rural counties and economically distressed counties doubled between 2010 and 2024, Cochran and his team found. Tribes in Oregon received 20 times the amount in 2024 that they received in 2010.

Funding for Oregon’s nine federally recognized tribes increased from about $14.45 million in 2010 to more than $324 million by 2024.

Of the more than $30 billion from the federal government that flowed to Oregon energy and environment programs during between 2010 and 2024, about 20% — more than $6 billion — went to rural or economically distressed counties in Oregon.

Sherman, Gilliam, Wallowa, Benton and Baker counties received the most per capita federal energy and environmental protection funding through the Biden-era energy and investment programs.

Researchers also looked at how money flowed in each of the state’s congressional districts.

Northwest Oregon’s 1st Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, a Democrat, received the most federal funding for energy environment projects in 2024. Her district got nearly $700 million.

The 2nd Congressional District, repped by the state’s lone Republican congressman, Cliff Bentz, received the second highest proportion of federal funding for energy and environmental protection projects — more than $470 million. Bentz voted against the Inflation Reduction and Infrastructure, Investment and Jobs acts, and voted to pass the recent Republican tax bill that rolls back funding spurred by those acts.

Nationally, slightly more money went to Democratic-led Congressional districts than Republican-led ones, but it was mostly even over the 10 years analyzed, Cochran said.

In 2024, about 57% of energy and environmental infrastructure investment was distributed to Democrat-held districts and 43% to Republican-held districts.

“It doesn’t appear that there’s anything political going on,” he said.

Among the cuts

Among the EPA grants cut by Zeldin was the one providing the funding for Cochran and his collaborators’ work, which also includes providing technical assistance to people, groups and governments applying for federal energy, infrastructure and environment grants in Oregon.

The five-year grant they received in 2023 was terminated by the EPA in May, and with it, $8 million in funding. The reason? The work was “inconsistent with federal administration priorities,” Cochran said.

He said in one year, they had provided technical assistance statewide that helped bring in about $50 million to groups and local governments.

The study of where federal money is and has flowed, he said, was supposed to help them understand where people are succeeding in getting more federal dollars, and where they could use help from people like him.

“That’s why we started this,” he said. “To say, ‘Hey, is anybody getting left behind?’”",https://oregoncapitalinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/08/solar-sheep.jpeg,N,,2025-08-01 11:02:43.191341

However, for those active in the UK space, investing in solar remains attractive because of the autonomy it offers.
This includes the acquisition of 45 acres of new land to form a new Industrial Park, with space for rooftop solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) facilities.
When asked about storage in particular, and if the presence of co-located storage projects could make a solar project in the UK a more attractive investment destination, Hutchinson said that “I think so”, in comments available in full above.
While the trend is encouraging – the LCOE of batteries has fallen 93% since 2010 – the fact remains that introducing more batteries to the UK energy mix could raise capex costs in the short-term.","However, with solar accounting for 22.1% of Europe’s generation in June – just a shade higher than the 21.8% covered by nuclear – there is still a way to go to meet the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive targets. Adopted in 2023, this obligates renewables to account for 42.5% of EU countries’ energy mix by the end of the decade.

While no longer a part of the EU, the UK remains an important part of Europe’s clean energy transition, particularly with regard to the solar industry. Renewable power accounted for more than half of the country’s domestic electricity generation in 2024, while the country’s operational solar capacity had increased by 5.9% year-on-year as of the end of April 2025.

At this year’s Clean Power 2030 Summits, held in the days after the government’s launch of its long-awaited Solar Roadmap, industry experts said that strong market economics behind solar could drive a “high-quality” energy transition in the UK, to help meet both the country and the continent’s energy transition goals, provided the UK remains an attractive investment space for solar investors.

An attractive investment space

Ensuring renewable power can stand on its own two feet as an investment decision, and not be overly reliant on support schemes such as government subsidies, has been a challenge for every renewable energy sector in every part of the world. Even in more mature markets, such as the European solar space, experts have recently highlighted the need to build more “creative” financing solutions amid a macroeconomic environment that has urged more cautious use of capital across all components of the solar supply chain.

However, for those active in the UK space, investing in solar remains attractive because of the autonomy it offers. Tom Hutchinson, CEO of the Montrose Port Authority in Scotland, Europe’s largest chain and anchor port that has secured Eco Port status for its clean energy commitments, said that the port is “unfortunately” a buyer of clean power, and that building more robust electricity generation facilities would help the port achieve a degree of energy independence.

“It’s good that it’s a guaranteed green source from the grid, but going forward, in the future, it only makes sense if we manage to be a bit more autonomous, if you like, and start generating our own energy,” Hutchinson told PV Tech Premium at the Clean Power 2030 Summits. “That’s what we’re trying to do.”

“If we can get away from the grid it would give us more margin to expand the shore power facilities in Montrose – we’d be taking more of the profit, if you like – but obviously it’s got to make financial sense,” he added, highlighting the importance of growing in a financially responsible manner to achieve this level of autonomy.

The port is already involved in a number of renewable energy projects – including providing operations and maintenance services for the 1GW Seagreen offshore wind project, the largest off the Scottish coast – but Hutchinson highlighted that the port would like to do more to expand its own electricity generation facilities. This includes the acquisition of 45 acres of new land to form a new Industrial Park, with space for rooftop solar and battery energy storage system (BESS) facilities.

When asked about storage in particular, and if the presence of co-located storage projects could make a solar project in the UK a more attractive investment destination, Hutchinson said that “I think so”, in comments available in full above.

“I think battery storage is going to be key to a traditional port like Montrose because we’re taking a lot of power off the grid, but if we can start making a lot of solar and the grid don’t want it during the day, for example, we can put that back into the battery storage within the port, we can fill a warehouse with batteries and be utilising that going forward,” he added.

These comments reflect those made by the others in the European clean energy industry – that storage has all but become a “necessity” to improve the bankability of solar projects – and it is an encouraging development that the UK’s commercial and industrial (C&I) sector is looking to the technology.

What can the government do to support private investment?

Goverment mechanisms, such as the Contracts for Difference (CfD) scheme, have been essential in building a resilient market framework for the UK, and the role of the government in ensuring a favourable investment landscape was a key topic of conversation at the Solar Media event.

Much of the discussion centered around the government’s Solar Roadmap, which was launched just prior to the event, and includes a number of eye-catching targets, such as the installation of 47GW of solar capacity by 2030, and the deployment of residential solar systems on nine million homes by the end of the decade.

But according to Jason Kirrage, senior technical marketing manager at SolarEdge, reforms to the grid permitting process could be among the most impactful made by the government.

“Over the last five years, grid applications have increased tenfold,” Kirrage told PV Tech Premium. “[The roadmap] has said that we’re not going to wait for the bottleneck of all the waiting connections; we’re going to do, rather than ‘first come, first served,’ ‘first ready, first connected’.

“That’s going to speed up the process, which again will help investors because they know they’ll get a quicker return on their money, and will stop these legacy products that are soaking up the gigawatts, waiting for approval, to see whether it’s worth doing or not,” he explained. “Now we seem to be moving forward and that’s thanks to the government really.”

Kirrage’s comments come following the publication of research by think tank Ember that European grids in 19 countries will lack over 200GW of capacity for planned solar projects by 2030, as the process of building a solar project has proven to be faster than the process of securing a grid connection in many European markets. Overcoming this obstacle, at the very least from an investors’ confidence angle, will be key if the UK is to attract the kind of private investment necessary to meet its 2030 climate targets.

“It’s encouraging to see that solar is being supported by the government, not only because it’s a great source of power and it’s a sustainable source of power for the country, but for our business,” David Mack, CEO of module cleaning and land management provider EverBlue told PV Tech Premium, in comments available in full above.

“For us, it means that we can grow, and if we continue to do a good job and have a good reputation there’s opportunities for us to grow with the industry in the UK,” he continued, suggesting that work in the UK solar sector could be a launchpad for investment into other sectors, such as other markets.

Working in a ‘young market’

Hutchinson described the UK green hydrogen space as a “young market”, with not many potential buyers for domestically-produced clean hydrogen. The same is true of the UK’s solar sector, where a shift towards more domestic production of clean power, particularly with the roadmap targeting an expansion of the residential and C&I sectors, could create a market in which investors are hesitant to commit large quantities of capital.

“You wouldn’t want to spend a lot of money and then realise there’s no market for it at the end of the day,” said Hutchinson. “It’ll be interesting to see how we can do it, and if we can make it, and push the demand ourselves and say to people: ‘We’ve got this option, we can do it for you’.”

He went on to echo the sentiment that the UK needs to remain an attractive investment space for solar projects, particularly if batteries are to be integrated into renewable power generation facilities. Solar power has long posted one of the lowest levelised costs of electricity (LCOE) in the world, reaching US$0.043/kWh in 2024 according to a report from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), but the LCOE of batteries remains much higher, at US$192/kWh.

While the trend is encouraging – the LCOE of batteries has fallen 93% since 2010 – the fact remains that introducing more batteries to the UK energy mix could raise capex costs in the short-term.

“For my harbour board, for any battery storage there’s a cost to all that,” explained Hutchinson. “For us to become more self-sufficient energy-wise, it seems to be the obvious route to take.

However, working in such a young market means there is more potential to set new precedents, and Kirrage pointed to the advancement of the 373MW Cleve Hill solar-plus-storage project – the largest in the UK – as an important precedent for the UK renewable energy sector as a whole. Quinbrook powered the project in the days prior to the Clean Power summits, and Kirrage said that the work is an important milestone, one that demonstrates both the efficacy of utility-scale solar-plus-storage in the UK and the viability of the Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIP) process.

“It’s a huge investment and people are seeing that both storage and PV work incredibly well together,” said Kirrage, whose comments are available in full above. “This is going to set the precedent, and trend for what’s going to happen in the UK.”

Actors in the UK can also learn from other industries that have deployed technologies such as solar and storage on a larger scale, including the US, which Mack described as “a great untapped industry for us”.

“There’s a huge amount of solar already built there [and] a huge amount of solar being constructed at the moment and planned for the future – regardless of what the government is planning or doing at the moment – it’s happening,” Mack said, suggesting that, despite political uncertainty in many regions, the strong market fundamentals of solar means it will have a place in the energy mix of the future.

“All of those solar farms need certain services, including solar module cleaning, and we’re bringing expertise that we’ve developed over there, and at the moment it seems to be well-received, that we can come in and say: ‘This is how you do it,’” Mack said. “That’s being welcomed.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/54641807005_5a6ffc97e6_k.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 11:04:42.553563

Plenty of startups have popped up to help homeowners tackle electrification projects, including installing solar panels and replacing gas furnaces with heat pumps. But they still struggle with the cost question: acquiring customers is often more than half the battle.

Pearl Edison thinks the answer is utilities.

“As much as anything, we are leveraging their brand equity and trust,” Evan Anderson, co-founder and CEO of Pearl Edison, told TechCrunch.

Investors have bought into the idea. The Detroit-based startup has raised a $3.3 million seed round from New System Ventures and Commonweal Ventures, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Lightbank and Newlab participated.

Pearl Edison works with utilities to identify customers who are most likely to benefit from energy retrofit projects, including heat pumps and additional insulation. It builds a white-labeled website for the utility, and it helps the larger organization run campaigns to sign people up for energy efficiency upgrades.

The company uses a range of data sources to design a job and generate a price, which it guarantees for the customer. After its software produces a first draft of the plans, it sends workers out to verify everything in the field before finalizing the design.

It then sends the jobs to vetted contractors, who complete the installation. Pearl Edison makes money on the installs itself, estimating that the majority of those jobs will cost less than it quotes. Homeowners should save money, too, Anderson said, because Pearl Edison can contract the job for less since the installers don’t have to waste time acquiring customers.

Already, the company has programs set up with two utilities, DT Energy in Michigan and Duquesne Light in the Pittsburgh area, and one government, the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Anderson said the company will add two more utilities this year.

With a vertically integrated approach to solar, battery energy storage systems (BESS), combined heat and power (CHP), and transmission & distribution (T&D) upgrades, Energy America is aligning its mission with Africa’s growing demand for clean, reliable, and decentralized energy.

Delivering Power Where It Matters Most

Africa’s industrialization and urbanization trajectory calls for a new generation of energy infrastructure. Energy America’s projects are engineered to deliver 24-hour energy access using a hybrid model that blends:

Utility-Scale Solar Farms

Advanced BESS Systems

CHP Stations for Industrial and Data Center Loads

Smart Microgrid Integration

Transmission and Distribution Modernization

“We are building the next chapter of Africa’s energy story — one that merges clean generation with reliability, storage, and grid resilience,” said Zoheb Khan, Vice President of Global Strategy at Energy America. “Our approach isn’t just solar farms — it’s holistic energy ecosystems.”

Public-Private Partnership as the Core Model

Energy America works directly with ministries of energy, national utilities, and infrastructure investors across sub-Saharan and North Africa. Through PPP structures and Independent Power Producer (IPP) frameworks, EA enables bankable, long-term infrastructure backed by:

U.S. EXIM Bank and DFC Financing

In-country Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs)

Government-Guaranteed Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)

Multilateral Co-funding Mechanisms

This model has already been successfully deployed in Liberia, Uganda, Tanzania, and Rwanda, with additional pipeline development underway in Kenya, Zambia, Nigeria, and Ghana.

Technology-Driven Energy Solutions

At the heart of Energy America’s value proposition is technology leadership. The company’s in-house R&D division, Centauri, designs climate-resilient solar modules and BESS platforms tailored for African grid conditions — including:

High-temperature, dust-resistant PV modules (400–750W)

Selenium and graphene-enhanced BESS for rural electrification

Real-time monitoring systems for grid and storage performance

Additionally, Energy America’s EPC arm, Ganymede Utilities, deploys full design–build–operate solutions, integrating:

Modular solar farms up to 500MW+

Urban and rural grid reinforcement packages

Remote microgrid systems with diesel or gas peaker replacements

African-Led, Globally Financed

Energy America’s African strategy is deeply collaborative, investing in local capacity building, joint ventures with regional firms, and job creation throughout the energy value chain.

“We believe African energy should be built with African hands and global capital. That’s why we structure every project to embed local contractors, engineers, and long-term knowledge transfer,” added Khan.

Looking Ahead: A 10GW Africa Vision

With over 10GW of projects in its global development pipeline, Energy America has earmarked 2.5GW of capacity specifically for African markets between 2025 and 2030. These include:

100MW Hybrid Power Plant in Liberia (Solar + BESS + T&D)

250MW Solar Farm + Grid Upgrade in Uganda

300MW Gas-Solar CHP Complex in Tanzania

National Grid Digitalization Pilot with Smart Metering in Rwanda

50MW Rural Electrification with Microgrids in Nigeria

For example, achieving 70% clean energy by adding solar, tidal, and wind power would require $7.7 billion, and achieving 88% clean energy by adding those resources would require $11.8 billion.
Utilities serving Alaska’s Railbelt region, including the Chugach Electric Association, the Golden Valley Electric Association, and the Matanuska Electric Association, have taken action to join the clean energy transition.
It is not the CEA’s first foray into clean energy.
In 2023, MEA’s Board of Directors also adopted a resolution aiming for 50% clean energy by 2050.","Utilities are turning to clean energy to address the rising cost of fossil fuels across Alaska, particularly in the Railbelt, where the majority of the state’s population resides. A 2024 report by the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Alaska Center for Energy and Power (ACEP) found that the Railbelt could transition to renewables through various pathways, but each would require substantial capital investment. For example, achieving 70% clean energy by adding solar, tidal, and wind power would require $7.7 billion, and achieving 88% clean energy by adding those resources would require $11.8 billion. Meanwhile, achieving 96% zero-carbon generation using solar, wind, and small modular nuclear reactors would require $10.1 billion.

However, as ACEP research professor Steve Colt explained to Alaska’s Senate Resources Committee, “If we were able to make that kind of investment, we would have to pay a lot of money for capital, but we would potentially save three-quarters of a billion dollars of fuel costs every year. So to me, that helps put in perspective the daunting challenge of investing maybe $10 billion, that you could save something approaching $1 billion every year for as long as the equipment operates.”

A 2024 report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) found that the least-cost pathway for the Railbelt to achieve an 80% Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) by 2040 would result in net savings of over $100 million per year by the beginning of the next decade. While the lab attributed part of these savings to investment tax credits for solar and wind that were recently repealed, a significant portion stems from the cost advantages of renewables over importing liquefied natural gas. In a scenario where the cost of renewables drops by 10%, savings could increase further by approximately $20 million per year, totalling $220 million cumulatively from 2024 through 2040, according to NREL.

Utilities serving Alaska’s Railbelt region, including the Chugach Electric Association, the Golden Valley Electric Association, and the Matanuska Electric Association, have taken action to join the clean energy transition.

This summer, the Chugach Electric Association (CEA) launched the state’s first community solar project, spanning four acres and featuring 1,560 bifacial solar panels. Any residential, retail, or general service member could subscribe to have the energy produced from between one to twenty panels credited to their electric bill, and the program is currently fully subscribed. “Members have been asking for years for the opportunity to use solar, [but] they don’t want to put panels on their home or their business. This gives you an opportunity to experiment with solar,” CEA senior corporate communications manager Julie Hasquet told Alaska’s KTUU.

It is not the CEA’s first foray into clean energy. The utility has also installed small solar projects on its natural gas power plants. Last year, the CEA and the Matanuska Electric Association jointly invested $65 million in a battery energy storage system, which has a 40-megawatt (MW) capacity, sufficient to charge 1,000 electric vehicles. Andrew Laughlin, CEA chief operating officer, added that the project will help stabilize the grid during power outages: “And what this does is, if there is a trip to a generator, the battery takes over instead of traditional turbine generators. So it responds faster, and it can also not just deliver power, but absorb power.” Also last year, the utility’s board passed a resolution in support of establishing an RPS, making it the first Railblet utility to do so. Sam Cason, chair of the board, explained, “It’s a matter of it being time for the transition. And that’s what we’re looking at, is a transition here.”

Over the years, the Golden Valley Electric Association (GVEA) has also expanded its focus to include clean energy. Its initiatives include a battery energy storage system installed in 2003, the 25 MW Eva Creek Wind Farm, which went online in 2013; the utility took over operations and maintenance in 2020. Additionally, there is a 563-kilowatt (kW) solar photovoltaic system, whose 12 turbines were fully operational in 2018. The utility also purchases wind power from Alaska Environmental Power. In 2019, the GVEA adopted a carbon reduction goal, aiming for a 26% reduction compared to 2012 levels.

Last June, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) awarded a $100 million loan to the GVEA through its Powering Affordable Clean Energy (PACE) program, with $60 million in loan forgiveness. The GVEA aimed to use the funding to install a 46 MW battery energy storage system in Fairbanks, to upgrade the Nenana Substation, and to install a distribution circuit connecting the Nenana Solar Farm to that substation. In September, the USDA also awarded the utility $206 million in zero-interest loans through its Empowering Rural America (New ERA) program. The GVEA intended to use the funding for the construction of another 46 MW battery energy storage system in Fairbanks, with the remainder earmarked for building 64 miles of transmission lines, adding two new substations, upgrading the North Pole Industrial Substation, and retiring the coal-powered Healy Unit 2. The additions would enable it to enter a 150 MW wind power purchase agreement.

To avoid losing the awards, GVEA scrapped plans for upgrades to the Nenana solar farm earlier this year, due to the company behind it dissolving, as well as the retirement of the coal-fired power plant in Healy. “Unfortunately, if those were kept in, the funding would very likely be in jeopardy,” GVEA director of external affairs and public relations Ashley Bradish told KUAC.

In 2023, Renewable IPP’s 8.5 MW Houston Solar Farm became the state’s biggest solar site, from which the Matanuska Electric Association (MEA) contracted to purchase the generated power, enough for 1,400 residences. “MEA’s members have been clear – in significant numbers they have told us they are ready for innovation and a path to clean energy as long as it doesn’t impact cost or reliability,” MEA CEO Tony Izzo noted in a press release. “It’s time to chart a new path towards energy diversification and energy security for the future.” Projects like this have contributed to MEA’s 28% reduction in carbon emissions since 2012, enabling it to meet its 2030 goal ahead of schedule. In 2023, MEA’s Board of Directors also adopted a resolution aiming for 50% clean energy by 2050.

The utility has also experimented with a variety of other technologies. Through its Level 2 Charger Pilot Program, MEA customers received a free electric vehicle charger in exchange for providing related data, including the time of day they charged, the duration of their charge, their energy consumption, and their load profile. MEA is currently working on an RF (Radio Frequency) Meter Pilot Program. By installing meters equipped with radio transmitters and antennas that transmit data on power consumption and voltage health back to the utility, MEA will be able to optimize grid operations more efficiently and resolve outages more effectively.

Technologies once considered fringe or cost-prohibitive have become everyday tools in the clean energy toolkit. And if current trends continue, we will be saying the same thing about advanced nuclear energy – and soon. While traditional nuclear has long existed alongside renewables on a separate track, recent developments suggest it’s time for those of us in the clean energy world to take a closer look, not as a replacement for wind, solar or storage, but as a complementary and increasingly indispensable part of the path to net zero. So, if you’re still clutching your pearls at the mere mention of “nuclear,” we invite you to read on.

The Reality: Climate Targets Are Tight. Nuclear Helps Close the Gap.

Whether you’re looking at reports from the International Energy Agency (IEA), Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Paris Agreement or the net zero strategies of other developed countries, the message is resoundingly the same: we are unlikely to reach climate goals anywhere near on time without rapid deployment of nuclear energy. Nuclear energy, specifically modernized Light Water Reactors (LWRs) and next-generation Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), is being included in more integrated clean energy planning. These technologies are carbon-free, firm and dispatchable, often sited closer to demand, and increasingly backed by private capital and government support.

The First Wave: Safer, More Efficient LWRs

What’s coming online first isn’t a dramatic shift from the past, but a smarter, safer, more streamlined version of it. Modern LWRs (like the one being restarted at Palisades in Michigan) benefit from modern safety enhancements, digital monitoring systems and stricter oversight, making them safer and more resilient than older plants. This isn’t theoretical—it’s happening now, with public and private funding support. Repowering closed plants, expanding existing plants with modular advanced nuclear systems, and converting coal plants into nuclear are the lowest-hanging fruit (given existing infrastructure, interconnection and permitting) and these will be the among the first projects to get done with federal and other public funds.

The Second Wave: SMRs, Microreactors, and Behind-the-Meter Opportunities

Beyond LWRs, SMRs and microreactors offer a more flexible nuclear option for a variety of use cases such as industrial co-location, remote communities, data centers and microgrids. There’s growing interest in nuclear for behind-the-meter applications—offering round-the-clock, emissions-free baseload power to facilities with high resilience or ESG demands. Notably, large technology and manufacturing companies have publicly expressed interest in developing or purchasing clean nuclear power for these purposes.

SMRs are widely expected to enter commercial operation in the early 2030s. For instance, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has applied for a construction permit for a BWRX-300 at the Clinch River site – this is targeting COD by 2033. Similarly, Google-backed projects involving Kairos Power aim to have demonstration reactors operational by 2030, supporting major AI data centers. Meanwhile, microreactors, which are designed to be very small, transportable, and remotely operated, are beginning experimental deployment even sooner. DOE’s DOME test bed at Idaho National Laboratory is slated to host the first fueled microreactor experiments starting in spring 2026, with fully operational microreactors like the DOE-supported MARVEL, which is expected to be online by 2027. These timelines reflect a broader strategy to see commercial microreactor deployment around 2030 once regulatory, licensing and supply chain hurdles are resolved.

Ultimate Goal: Fusion

While advanced nuclear fission is powering the near-term nuclear revival, nuclear fusion remains the holy grail of clean power. Fusion replicates the process that powers the sun, offering limitless, carbon-free energy with no risk of meltdown and virtually no long-lived waste. Though commercial deployment is still on the horizon, timelines are accelerating. Several fusion projects are currently underway – one with Helion Energy (backed by Sam Altman and partnered with Microsoft) has started construction in Malaga, Washington and is aiming to start powering Microsoft data centers in 2028. The massive international ITER project in France (the world’s largest fusion experiment) expects to achieve first plasma by 2035. Google recently signed one of the world’s first-ever PPAs for fusion energy with Commonwealth Fusion Systems, covering 200MW from CFS’s future ARC fusion plant in Chesterfield County, Virginia, which is expected to achieve COD in the early 2030’s. Further, DOE’s Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program is already funding eight U.S.-based fusion companies, accelerating prototype and pilot-stage progress toward commercialization between 2030-2035. If successful, fusion will be a game-changing, limitless source of clean energy – any getting there starts with saying yes to smart nuclear now.

Moving Forward

For developers, investors, utilities, and advisors already working in renewables, this moment presents an opportunity—not a competition. Many of the skills, networks, and tools used to build solar and wind portfolios translate well to advanced nuclear, such as: siting and permitting experience, grid interconnection strategy, tax credit structuring, and infrastructure and community engagement. In short, although we are a number of years away from commercial financing of nuclear projects, clean energy professionals already have the playbook and advanced nuclear will soon become another page in it.

The finding said these gases endanger public health and welfare, allowing the EPA to set rules to limit them.

If approved, the EPA’s proposal would rescind the 2009 decision that set forth a legal basis to regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants. Known as the “endangerment finding,” it allowed the EPA to limit emissions from vehicles, power plants, and oil and gas companies under the Clean Air Act.

The new proposal argues that Congress didn’t give the EPA permission in the Clean Air Act to regulate these emissions and that the agency essentially overstepped its power.

“If finalized, today’s announcement would amount to the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said, as reported by The Washington Post.

The EPA issued the endangerment finding in 2009 after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are air pollutants.

The finding said these gases endanger public health and welfare, allowing the EPA to set rules to limit them. These rules have led to stricter standards for car emissions and limits on pollution from power plants.

Former EPA adviser Zealan Hoover told The Post that the new proposal was “not just an attack on science but on common sense.”

“The National Climate Assessment provides over 2,000 pages of detailed evidence that climate change harms our health and welfare, but you can also ask the millions of Americans who have lost their homes and livelihoods to extreme fires, floods and storms that are only getting worse,” Hoover explained.

A spokesman for Ford said the automaker supports clearer rules and hopes for “a single, stable standard” that helps reduce emissions while protecting manufacturing jobs.

Zeldin said the agency still supports clean air and water but wants to balance environmental protection with economic growth, The Post reported.

Others predicted the EPA’s legal arguments won’t hold up in court.

“They think this is a holy grail to get rid of the whole thing in one fell swoop as opposed to having to weaken regulations one by one,” Richard Revesz, a law professor at New York University, told The Post.

He said he was surprised by the EPA’s arguments, which he characterized as “haphazardly thrown together.”

“They just kind of pile it on, maybe hoping that one of them will stick,” he told The Post.

Others pointed out that the EPA’s proposal challenges widely accepted science. For example, it disputes reports by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which many scientists view as the global standard.

Rachel Cleetus, a climate expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said, “They are fringe arguments. They do not have credibility, and they go against the established science.”

The EPA’s move dovetails with a separate report from the U.S. Department of Energy. That report claimed that “CO2-induced warming appears to be less damaging economically than commonly believed” and “U.S. policy actions are expected to have undetectably small direct impacts on the global climate.”

But critics say the costs of climate-related disasters and health issues far outweigh the savings from cutting regulations.

Under former President Joe Biden, the EPA estimated emissions rules would save $1 trillion through 2055, in part by reducing hospital visits and early deaths.

If the proposed rule is finalized and survives court challenges, it could limit how future presidents respond to fossil fuel emissions.

David Doniger is a legal expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

“The law unambiguously includes greenhouse gases as air pollutants, and the law unambiguously makes it clear that the endangerment and contribution findings limit that to public health and science issues, not to broad economic and policy issues,” he told The Post.

“You’re asking the American people who are living through wildfires, floods, hurricanes, heat domes and so on, not to believe what they’re going through, not to believe their own eyes,” Doniger continued. “At some point what they’re claiming is going to appear to people to be mind-bogglingly false and out of touch.”

According to our latest survey, investors and financiers have identified three main sector-specific risk factors: regulatory risks, political risks, and bankability concerns.","Global energy-related investment grew to over USD 3 trillion in 2024, but only around 25% of this was directed towards emerging markets and developing economies other than China, a fall in real terms over the last decade. One of the principal factors holding back investment is the high cost of capital, driven by on a range of perceived and real risks facing investors in EMDEs. For clean energy investments, which are typically characterised by high upfront costs with minimal ongoing expenditures, project viability is highly sensitive to the cost of capital, but data on the actual terms facing project developers is scarce, out of date and geographically limited. In 2022, in recognition of the importance of accessing empirical data on the cost of capital for energy projects in EMDEs, the IEA launched its Cost of Capital Observatory.

This year marks the third update to the Observatory. Once again, the scope of the Observatory was extended both in terms of technology and geographic scope, with data derived from firms that have collectively financed or developed over 1700 projects. For the first time, we gathered insights on the cost of capital for hydroelectric power projects (the largest source of renewable electricity globally) and expanded coverage of Southeast Asia, a region expected to account for 25% of global energy demand growth over the next decade. We also gathered perspectives from financiers, project developers and institutional investors on how they expect the cost of capital to change over the coming year, alongside results for 2023 and 2024.

Our findings confirm that the cost of capital for renewable power projects and batteries in EMDEs is at least double the amounts seen in advanced economies, with substantial variations across the surveyed countries. The survey results show that the cost of capital has generally increased in all major markets compared to the previous update in 2023, with some divergence at a country and technology-level due to changes in local market interest rates and regulatory environments.

In addition, in many markets, the weighted average cost of capital for utility-scale battery projects is similar to standalone solar power projects, with batteries typically co-located with wind or solar generation. This finding was based on taking the median of responses from institutions that answered this year’s survey and covers projects reaching final investment decisions (FIDs) over four years: 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. Battery prices have declined more than two-thirds over the last decade, driven by R&D and economies of scale in manufacturing, and now represent one of the fastest growing clean energy technologies. Deploying batteries on site with renewables can provide dispatchable clean power, reducing variability in renewable output and allowing projects to provide grid balancing and ancillary services. Our engagement with developers and financiers through interviews has shown that it is becoming increasingly common to pair solar with batteries, enabling low-cost solar electricity to meet evening demand peaks where storage capacity is sufficient.

Investments in EMDEs face a range of both perceived and real risks. These risks drive the cost of capital for energy projects to be at least two to three times higher than in advanced economies or China. According to our latest survey, investors and financiers have identified three main sector-specific risk factors: regulatory risks, political risks, and bankability concerns. Regulatory risks in particular was highlighted as the number one risk in the majority of markets covered by the survey, showing the importance of reforming the regulatory environment to boost investor confidence and thereby lowering the cost of capital. In addition to these sector risks, respondents also pointed to political and currency risks, which affect projects well beyond the energy sector.

Other risks mentioned by respondents to our survey related to permitting, transmission, and the risk of public off-takers defaulting on agreed payment schedules. Key risks also varied substantially across EMDE markets, with political risks the largest driver in Southeast Asian markets but not considered a principal risk in India and Brazil. Strong and sustained policy support have enabled the latter two to take advantage of low-cost renewable power, with rising investment trends over recent years standing out amongst other EMDE.",https://iea.org/assets/front/images/iea_open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 12:07:42.268980

1. President Trump delivers remarks at an event on the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Source: White House[/caption] The OBBBA significantly rolls back many of the core tax incentives that clean energy projects have relied on since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. Some tax credits for low-carbon energy are being phased out faster, restricted in availability, or simply abolished. Estimates suggest the total value of the credits to the industry will be about $500 billion less over the next 10 years. This will clearly affect the viability of some projects and timelines for execution, as some incentives are eliminated after 2027.

Wind and Solar Projects Take a Hit

“Wind and solar power are hit particularly hard by the changes,” Ed Crooks, vice chair for the Americas with Wood Mackenzie, wrote in a July 11 blog post. According to Crooks, Wood Mackenzie expects investment in wind and solar power to fall well short of what it would have been if the IRA incentives had remained in place. “It will not collapse completely,” Crooks wrote. “But over 2025–2030, wind and solar installations will be about 100 gigawatts lower than if the IRA incentives had remained in place,” he noted. That would lead to total installed wind and solar capacity growing by about 25% over that period, instead of a projected 55% growth under the IRA framework, according to Wood Mackenzie’s estimates. “For solar, we expect a surge in installations in 2025–2026, as developers rush to remain eligible for tax credits. But on a 10-year view, we expect installations to be 17% lower than in our previous base case forecast,” Crooks explained. Meanwhile, Wood Mackenzie expects onshore wind installation activity to remain robust through 2030, as developers work to put grandfathered projects in service to meet the tax credit deadlines. Still, the firm expects onshore wind installations to decline significantly in the longer term. “The most substantial impact will be in offshore wind, where industry economics depend heavily on tax credits,” Crooks remarked. “Projects that have not already started construction or taken a final investment decision (FID) are unlikely to go ahead.”

Other Technologies Fare Much Better

The nuclear and geothermal sectors both retained primary IRA incentives in the final OBBBA. In fact, nuclear received additional support through revamped small modular reactor (SMR) funding, while geothermal benefited from mandated annual lease sales replacing the previous biennial schedule. “Notably, the legislation cements nuclear energy as a foundational element in the nation’s future energy mix,” Landon Derentz, vice president for Energy and Infrastructure, senior director, and Morningstar Chair for Global Energy Security at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, wrote in an OBBBA analyses. “Years of incremental, bipartisan support have matured into formal policy momentum. By positioning nuclear as a central pillar, the United States joins a growing global consensus on its strategic value, particularly as energy systems become more complex,” he added. Meanwhile, Wood Mackenzie said carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) projects will get a boost. “Carbon capture developers benefit from expanded 45Q credits, with enhanced oil recovery (EOR) now receiving the same value as geological sequestration, making EOR more attractive as an end destination for captured CO2. This particularly benefits operators with existing CCUS-EOR infrastructure,” the firm noted in a press release.

Foreign Entity of Concern Stipulations

Perhaps the most impactful changes are the “prohibited foreign entity” limitations, which are littered throughout the OBBBA. Foreign influence in supply chains has existed for years, but the formal legal term “Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC)” was first introduced in 2022. An FEOC is defined, in part, as an entity that is “owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a government of a foreign country that is a covered nation.” Covered nations are currently defined as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The OBBBA imposes important new restrictions limiting the ability of projects to generate tax credits if certain FEOCs are involved. Notably, the clean electricity credit under 48E could be completely recaptured if a taxpayer makes an “applicable payment” to one of these entities within 10 years after originally claiming the credit. This essentially creates a 10-year period of recapture risk for the technology-neutral investment tax credit (ITC). “These limitations have almost an immediate impact—generally, being effective January 1, 2026, for calendar year taxpayers—and will impose a significant risk, compliance, and diligence burden on taxpayers,” an insight report issued by Vinson & Elkins LLP says. For energy storage projects, the OBBBA maintains ITC eligibility through 2030. However, Wood Mackenzie said the FEOC restrictions likely preclude the purchase of Chinese cells, which presents a challenge. “The risks and costs of supply chain shifts will put downward pressure on storage growth, despite being one of the few resources that can be added quickly to support growing demand,” the firm said. “Congress is essentially ceding the future of wind, solar, hydrogen, and battery investment to China,” David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, and chairman of the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center’s Energy Advisory Group, and Andrea Clabough, an associate at Goldwyn Global Strategies, and a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council Global Energy Center, wrote in an OBBBA analyses. “This legislation represents a stunning acquiescence to globally concentrated development and supply chain systems for these technologies in the hands of a U.S. competitor,” they said.

Also at the event were two representatives of Paraguay’s National Climate Change Commission, the deliberative body that must approve the country’s climate change policies.
The changes promoted to methane metrics are not the only way in which agribusiness seeks to free itself from its responsibility for climate change.","This story was originally published on Consenso.

If you only have a few minutes:

New research reveals a coordinated plan by agribusiness to influence climate policies in Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Argentina. The goal: to change how the impact of livestock farming is calculated.

Through a new way of measuring methane impact, called GWP*, large livestock companies could increase their pollution while claiming to contribute to mitigating climate change.

One of the main drivers of this change, Frank Mitloehner, received nearly $3 million through his research center from a foundation linked to JBS, Cargill, and Tyson Foods, among others. The goal: to “rethink methane.”

He also received $9,500 in public funds from Uruguay to advise the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture during the Lacalle Pou administration. There, he recommended modifying how the impact of livestock farming is calculated.

Mitloehner also traveled to Paraguay, where he gave a talk in favor of adopting this new metric, with the support of the main livestock association of the country, who then managed to include it in the country’s official policy.

Exclusive documents, photos and videos show how since 2022 Frank Mitloehner, a researcher at the Clarity and Leadership for Environmental Awareness and Research (CLEAR) Center, funded by IFEEDER, an organization linked to JBS, Cargill and Tyson Foods, traveled through Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil with the goal of pushing for a new way to measure methane – the main greenhouse gas related to livestock farming.

With the exception of Brazil, in the remaining three countries it was confirmed that Mitloehner’s participation was supported by livestock unions related to the so-called Global Roundtable for Sustainable Meat, a global organization that includes IFEEDER contributors, business representatives from the world’s largest meat producers and multinationals such as ADM, McDonald’s and Burger King.

By means of an “accounting trick”, this new metric, called GWP*, would allow the livestock industry to have a free pass. Several scientists warn that, if this new way of calculating methane is adopted, countries and multinationals will be able to dodge their undeniable responsibility for climate change.

In the most extreme case, this new metric would also allow them to claim that they are offsetting emissions from other sectors, such as fossil fuels, and receive benefits in the form of carbon credits as a result.

All without changing their unsustainable production model and while they continue to warm the planet, jeopardizing the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

That is why the GWP* metric has already been rejected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the body that guides the science for climate policy.

In Uruguay, contracts accessed exclusively show that Mitloehner received $9,500 dollars of public money to advise the Lacalle Pou government on climate policies related to agriculture and the adoption of this new metric, including meetings with his ministers of environment and agriculture at government headquarters.

And in Paraguay, exclusive internal documents show that following his visit, representatives of the Paraguay Rural Association successfully pushed for the country to consider the use of GWP* in its official climate policy.

In addition, Mitloehner confirmed that he traveled at the expense of Argentina’s Rural Society in order to spread what he calls “the real methane story” at events in that country. In Brazil he did the same at a forum promoted by JBS, the world’s largest meat company. Also in Brazil, Myles Allen, one of the creators of this measurement, promoted at an event that agribusiness representatives lobby their governments to adopt this new way of calculating methane at the next COP30 in Bélem.

Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil will jointly negotiate agricultural issues at the climate conference.

An analysis conducted for this research shows that the adoption of GWP* would allow livestock farming in the four countries to reduce their ambition or even increase their methane emissions while claiming to be in line with their governments’ climate commitments.

Mitloehner’s influence in South America is in addition to similar work he has been doing for years in support of livestock in countries such as the United States, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The livestock unions of these countries and those of South America are linked through the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and the International Beef Alliance.

Fast and Furious

Every time a cow eats something, it ruminates it in its stomach where microbes ferment that food. This process serves to absorb nutrients, but also produces a gas, methane. Like any living being satisfied with its food, the cow burps, releasing methane through its mouth.

Nearly 300 million cows belch millions of tons of methane between Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. To accommodate the vast number of cows destined for European, Chinese, or North American consumption, millions of hectares of two key ecosystems in South America had to be burned and deforested: the Amazon and the Chaco.

But while efforts are being made to curb deforestation through ever-tightening regulations from governments and markets, methane belching is the real Achilles heel of the South American and global livestock industry. In fact, agriculture and livestock are the world’s largest producers of the methane that causes climate change.

Methane is fast and furious. It lasts about 12 years in the atmosphere, where it traps heat on the planet about 80 times more effectively than carbon dioxide.

We do not see it or smell it, but it collaborates in modifying rainfall and temperature patterns in the medium and long term. It is the same climate change that is making floods such as the one in Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil in 2024, or extended heat waves such as those experienced in Argentina and Paraguay in 2023, worse and more likely.

According to the IPCC, even by reducing all fossil fuel burning, if we do not change the way we produce and consume food we will cross the temperature increase threshold stated in the Paris Agreement.

That is why the IPCC concludes that rapid methane reductions are indispensable not only to meet the agreement’s commitments, but to avoid breaching planetary boundaries and the loss of up to 15% of smallholder crops.

Proposed solutions to the methane problem vary. There are special feeds to improve cow digestion, projects to optimize productivity per hectare and calls for – especially in developed countries – diversifying their diets and consuming less meat.

The livestock industry is opposed to this.

That’s where a man named Frank Mitloehner comes in. A recurrent speaker at forums, meetings with ministers, specialized media and statements in parliaments. In conjunction with the organization he leads, the CLEAR Center at the University of Davis in California, he proposes that in the face of the methane dilemma, what we must do is simple: change how it is calculated.

To that end, he is promoting a new metric called the Global Warming Potential Star (GWP*), which he claims better reflects the relationship of methane from livestock to climate change.

Behind what may appear to be an obscure technical dispute lies a major political influence campaign, financed with nearly $3 million dollars from Big Ag through multinational corporations such as Cargill, Tyson Foods and JBS.

💵Big Ag’s millions in funding behind a “guru”.

In 2019, a group of scientists attempted to answer a critical question:

How do we feed 10 billion people in a healthy way, while respecting the limits of the planet?

The answer was the EAT-Lancet report. Its conclusion: it is possible.

But we must transform our eating habits. More vegetables and grains, less sugar and, especially in countries like the United States, eating less meat.

The report, which sought to guide food policies for the next decade, found instead “a digital countermovement” in favor of livestock.

It was not spontaneous opposition, but a coordinated effort that included Frank Mitloehner, a self-described “greenhouse gas emissions guru” through his newly created CLEAR Center within the University of California at Davis, US.

An investigation by Unearthed revealed CLEAR Center reports to its agribusiness donor, crediting Mitloehner for initiating “a massive campaign” that “was successful in convincing audiences to turn away from the EAT-Lancet report.”

The donor to whom the CLEAR Center reported this success was IFEEDER, the “educational” organization of the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA), which represents 650 companies directly or indirectly related to the livestock industry. Among those companies are major international agribusiness producers such as Cargill, Tyson Foods and Pilgrim’s, which is owned by Brazilian giant JBS.

Other international agribusiness donors to IFEEDER include Alltech, ADM and Bayer.

According to a memo obtained by Unearthed, the CLEAR Center was created following an agreement between Mitloehner, UC Davis and IFEEDER at meetings in 2018.

For agribusiness, funding Mitloehner through the CLEAR Center aligned with the goal of “sharing the message of animal agriculture’s role as a solution provider in efforts to deal with climate change issues.”

According to a memo from the American Feed Industry Association, the content produced by the CLEAR Center was useful in influencing “public policy discussions happening internationally and nationally, changing the future of the industry.”

Above all, the support was because “Mitloehner provides a neutral, credible, non-industry voice for journalists and stakeholders at conferences and other important government activities.”

According to Unearthed, the CLEAR Center also received funding from Burger King following a similar lobbying campaign on advertising by the fast food chain.

As stated in estimates with available documents, Mitloehner and the CLEAR Center received between 2018 and 2023 nearly $3 million dollars in direct funding from the international livestock industry.

In his entire career, including public funds related to agriculture, Desmog estimated that Mitloehner received more than $12 million dollars.

In exchange for the generous funding, agribusiness representatives such as Cargill, AFIA and the North American Meat Institute (NAMI) became part of CLEAR’s “recommendations committee.” Much of the money from IFEEDER to Mitloehner and the CLEAR Center was given under a specific project: a campaign to “rethink methane”.

Backed by money from the livestock industry, the campaign to “rethink methane” soon became the banner for influencing governments around the world. The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA), which represents more than 175,000 U.S. cattle producers admitted after COP26 its lobbying efforts in Congress for the adoption of GWP*. NCBA’s executive board includes McDonald’s, Cargill, Tyson Foods and JBS.

It is also a member of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Meat and the International Beef Alliance, which brings together the main livestock lobbies, including those of Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. Also those from South America, such as Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil. Mitloehner was invited to speak on behalf of GWP* in each of those countries, often funded by agribusiness itself. Or in the case of Uruguay, with public money.

🌍How a discussion about maths puts us in danger or worsened heat waves and floods

On June 2, 2022, in an event hall of the Sheraton Hotel in Asunción, Paraguay’s capital, Mitloehner took the stage with an audience of just under 200 people. Among the participants were leaders of the country’s main livestock associations and government representatives.

For almost the entire 45 minutes of what was billed as “a keynote talk” on livestock “as part of the solution to climate change,” Mitloehner focused on the need to “reclaim the methane narrative.”

He argued that methane is “the Achilles heel of animal agriculture today” because “all the people who don’t like you very much, the people who don’t like animal agriculture, always focus on the topic because they see it as the biggest vulnerability.”

Mitloehner explained that under the current way that all countries use to calculate the impact they produce, methane is considered “carbon dioxide on steroids.”

“This does not capture the true nature of methane,” he asserted.

To that end, he introduced attendees to a new way of calculating the impact of livestock: the GWP* metric.

The current way of calculating methane has limitations. It does not accurately take into account the fact that methane is very warming but short-lived. So, it overestimates its long-term impact on the planet. It also underestimates the short-term impact – something Mitloehner notably omitted in his presentation or when asked about it for this story.

The so-called Global Warming Potential* (GWP star) came in theory to solve the problem. This metric was not created by Mitloehner, who is not a climate scientist, but by a team led by Dr. Michelle Cain and Professor Myles Allen of Oxford University.

This new method for calculating the effect of methane on climate change estimates its contribution to global warming based on how emissions are changing according to a base year.

According to its creators, the new method better reflects the short lifetime of methane in the atmosphere.

But there are several scientists who warn about the danger of adopting GWP*, its potential for greenwashing, the incentives to favor livestock farming and even the possible derailment of the objectives of limiting the temperature increase set by the Paris Agreement.

This happens because, instead of looking at the total amount of methane being sent into the atmosphere, the metric focuses on seeing that it is not “additional warming,” which would allow governments and companies to continue steadily emitting large amounts of methane, rather than reducing it.

An accounting trick that, as the Changing Markets’ “Seeing Stars” report explains, considers that past emissions are not relevant because they are “constantly being recycled”.

It is the refined version of another old narrative used by agribusiness when questioned about its impact on climate change. One that describes a perfect world in which methane belched by cows is recycled by pastures through photosynthesis.

What this narrative ignores is that even during its short lifespan in the atmosphere, methane is warming the planet and damaging air quality. And that even when it dissipates into the sky, the warming it causes lasts longer, as the heat penetrates the ocean, which can take decades or centuries to warm or cool, contributing to sea level rise and putting the planet at risk of flooding, more frequent hurricanes and profound damage to biodiversity.

It also assumes that in the time period of this cycle there will be neither alterations in the number of livestock, nor frosts or fires that affect pastures and soil.

“Methane is not perfectly recycled,” says Nicholas Carter, a food systems and disinformation researcher and one of the authors of “Seeing Stars”. “What happens is that the complexity of the issue is functional to the livestock industry, because much of the scientific communication on climate has focused on carbon dioxide and not how methane works,” he points out.

In the words of the IPCC, the GWP* “does not capture the contribution to warming that each methane emission makes”. That is why the international body rejected its adoption as a metric in its latest scientific report.

Under this new metric, a country like New Zealand can continue to have millions of cows belching out thousands of tons of methane. As long as that number of cows is stable, the GWP* will consider that it is not “additional warming” since under the calculation, it is methane that will be destroyed at the same rate as it is emitted.

One of the scientists who created the metric, Dr. Cain, wrote that under her new way of calculating methane in New Zealand all other sectors would get “a free pass (…), courtesy of the farmers.”

A free pass that the New Zealand government is considering. In 2025, climate scientists warned in a letter to New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon that the adoption of GWP* aligned targets “ignore the scientific evidence” of methane’s impact.

In a presentation in May 2025 in Australia, Mitloehner considered the New Zealand government’s intention as “a smart move”. Something he defended again when consulted for this research.

When asked about his concerns surrounding the metrics, Matthew Hayek, assistant professor in the Department of Environmental Studies at New York University and one of the signatories of the letter to the New Zealand government, stated that “different language and metrics are being used by a number of countries to delay progress in reducing methane.”

For Hayek, “this includes countries considering adopting GWP*, which can incorrectly make it appear that a country is cooling the atmosphere even as global methane emissions continue to grow and warm the planet.”

For the expert, one of the risks is that “some of these countries are seeking to use this supposed cooling to offset their contributions (to climate change) in other sectors. But just reducing a country’s methane emissions cannot “compensate” for fossil fuel emissions; this is impossible.

An illustrative analogy was given to the Financial Times by Paul Behrens, professor of environmental change at Oxford University: “It’s like saying if I’m dumping 100 barrels of pollution into this river, it’s killing life. And then I dump only 90 barrels, then I should be rewarded for it.”

This idea was advocated by Mitloehner himself in an interview in 2023, where he argued that “the (livestock) industry could offset all the global warming contributions of our sector, some of the historical emissions and some of the carbon dioxide from the fossil fuel industry”. Also by authors of the metric in a 2019 report.

Asked about the IPCC’s position via email, Mitloehner admitted that “they had a point” and that “even if we manage to keep methane emissions stable, something known as climate neutrality, these emissions will continue to drive historical warming.”.

However, he stated that “climate neutrality in agriculture would be an achievement, as it would be the result of a significant reduction in methane emissions”. Mitloehner’s full response can be found here.

But the data show otherwise.

An analysis of Changing Markets for this research shows that by applying GWP* the livestock sector in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay could continue to increase their methane emissions while claiming to be in line with their countries’ climate commitments.

Under current metrics, meeting the same commitment requires the sector to rapidly and decisively reduce the contribution of livestock production in these countries for climate change.

In the case of Brazil, applying the GWP* metric will require the livestock sector to continue to reduce methane from its cows but at a much less ambitious pace than the new commitment the country made in 2024.

For Caitlin Smith, senior specialist at Changing Markets, the objective is clear: “Promoting the use of GWP* at a regional or sectoral level is another tactic by agribusiness to distract us from their significant methane emissions and avoid action to reduce them”.

“It is a new scientific trick to claim that their production does not increase global warming. And that with small reductions they can claim carbon neutrality”, says Alma Castrejón-Davila, a researcher at the same organization.

This analysis sheds light on why agribusiness in the four countries is interested in Mitloehner’s work. An interest that, in the case of Paraguay and Uruguay, has already translated into influence on official climate policies.

Mitloehner’s links to agribusiness in Paraguay, Uruguay, Argentina and Brazil

Frank Mitloehner confirmed that his presence in Paraguay was because of the invitation of the local chapter of the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Meat, which includes everything from the Ministry of Agriculture of that country to McDonalds. The North American researcher confirmed that the trip was paid for by the Mesa de Carne Sostenible.

The objective of the Mesa in Paraguay is to “promote the sustainability of the Paraguayan beef value chain”. But its president in 2022 was Alfred Fast, a representative of the Paraguayan Chaco cattle cooperatives and a skeptic of the impact of human activities on climate change.

Also at the event were two representatives of Paraguay’s National Climate Change Commission, the deliberative body that must approve the country’s climate change policies. One was an old friend of Mitloehner’s, Albrecht Glatzle.

The two have known each other for more than 30 years, when Mitloehner was just a student visiting the Paraguayan Chaco and Glatzle was his supervisor. Now, Glatzle was in charge of defending the interests of the powerful Paraguayan Rural Association, the country’s main livestock association, in the Climate Change Commission. Glatzle is a known climate change denier, something Mitloehner, in his defense, says he does not share.

Glatzle is a contributor to CLINTEL, a European denialist organization founded by a former Shell employee. Another CLINTEL member, Irishman Jim O’Brien, was the one who had proposed to the IPCC to adopt GWP* as a metric for calculating methane from livestock.

The other member of the National Climate Change Commission present was Norman Breuer (+), an agricultural engineer and livestock project consultant. Breuer was already familiar with Mitloehner’s work and shared his drive to change how livestock methane was calculated.

In September 2022, after the event with Mitloehner and with the support of the Rural Association of Paraguay, Breuer managed to get mentions of GWP* included in the update of its climate policy that the country submitted to the United Nations in 2023. This is evidenced by exclusive internal documents from meetings of Paraguay’s National Climate Change Commission.

Breuer’s recommendation was not innocuous.

This was after technicians from the Ministry of the Environment informed representatives of the Commission that, after recalculating Paraguay’s emissions, agriculture and livestock emitted almost twice as much greenhouse gas as previously reported. This was largely due to methane from cow belching.

The full internal documents here.

In December of the same year, during the climate negotiations in Dubai, the government of Paraguay made an open defense of the livestock industry by officially protesting against the inclusion of methane reduction targets in the final COP28 agreement.

When asked for comment for this report, the Paraguayan Ministry of Environment stated in a written response that it was “aware” of the concerns raised about the metric, but reaffirmed that Paraguay “has the option of using other measurement systems” to report its emissions “additionally.” The full response can be found here.

Mitloehner not only influenced Paraguayan climate policy. He exerted similar influence in Uruguay.

Contracts accessed through public information requests show that between 2021 and 2022, Mitloehner received $9,500 dollars from the Uruguayan state through the National Meat Institute (INAC), the public body that aims to promote the country’s livestock.

The payments included visits to various places in Uruguay, including the annual event of the Rural Society, the country’s most powerful cattle-raising union. It also included a meeting at the Executive Tower – headquarters of the Uruguayan government – with the Ministers of Environment and Agriculture of Luis Lacalle Pou’s government: Adrián Peña and Fernando Mattos. There he used the same presentation used in Paraguay.

Mitloehner also received public money in reimbursement for travel costs and for drafting a guidance report for Uruguay’s foreign climate policy in the framework of the COP27 negotiations in Egypt.

Although the full report submitted to the Uruguayan government was classified as partially confidential, INAC did share a summary of Mitloehner’s main recommendations: “Perform livestock emissions calculations using GWP*”.

The Uruguayan government has been consulted on the scope of the implementation of the Mitloehner report recommendations since then, with no response so far.

However, in 2024 the National Institute for Agricultural Research, another public entity formed by the Ministry of Agriculture with participation from the livestock sector, made a presentation promoting the use of GWP* to recalculate the impact of Uruguayan livestock farming at an international congress event organized by INAC in Punta del Este, Uruguay.

In the event where the Uruguayan entity promoted the use of GWP*, the Minister of Primary Industries of New Zealand, Petter Ettema, was also a speaker.

Also participating in the congress were the then Minister of Agriculture of Uruguay, Fernando Mattos, the Minister of Agriculture of Paraguay, Carlos Giménez, the Minister of Agriculture of Brazil, Carlos Fávaro, and the Secretary of Agriculture of Argentina, Sergio Araeta.

The Rural Society of that country invited Mitloehner to be a speaker at an event which was also attended by the now Minister of Security of Javier Milei, Patricia Bullrich, and the head of government in the city of Buenos Aires, Jorge Macri. When asked about this, Mitloehner confirmed that his trip to Argentina was financed by the cattle union.

But his most far-reaching presence was at the Methane in Agriculture Forum in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in May 2022. There he and Eduardo Assad, a former researcher at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), a Brazilian government agency, discussed the need to adopt GWP*.

In 2023, researchers from Brazil’s EMBRAPA signed, along with researchers from Uruguay’s Ministry of Livestock and Argentina’s Meat Institute, Frank Mitloehner and Michelle MCain, one of the creators of the metric, an FAO report presented in Italy that analyzed GWP* as one of the possible metrics for measuring methane. In 2024, the agency was also present at the event where the Uruguayan government presented its recalculations using the metric.

In April 2025, EMBRAPA’s Beef Intelligence Center launched a social media campaign in favor of adopting GWP*, in order to “demystify” the impact of the cattle sector.

In 2024, during a forum organized by the state government of Sao Paulo in Brazil, Myles Allen, the Oxford scientist who created the metric, asked attendees to “convince their governments” to have the GWP* adopted at the COP30 climate negotiations in Bethlehem as the new way to measure methane.

There is no evidence so far that, unlike Paraguay and Uruguay, the governments of Argentina or Brazil are considering adopting the use of GWP*,

Nevertheless, the signs of adoption of GWP* in Uruguay and Paraguay generate a risk of a domino effect in the agriculture negotiating group of which Argentina and Brazil will be part at COP30 in Belem in November 2025.

The interest in promoting GWP* is not only from governments. Mitloehner was a speaker at an event organized by none other than the largest meat company in the world: JBS. When asked about it, Mitloehner denied that his presence in Brazil had been paid for by JBS, arguing that his trip was “for personal reasons”.

According to a 2024 report by the European organization FoodRise, GWP* “would be a free pass or actively benefit a multinational livestock company like JBS, which is estimated to pollute at the same level as Spain”.

On the contrary, the report notes, adoption of the metric “would severely punish small livestock producers in the Global South”.

This is admitted by a study signed by Mitloehner himself, which shows that using the new methane calculations, Brazilian livestock farming would be in a place of greater historical responsibility for climate change than it is today.

JBS was consulted about its ties with Mitloehner and its position on the adoption of the GWP* metric, with no response so far.

Although Mitloehner denied that JBS directly funded him, its North American subsidiary, Pilgrim’s, is part of the American Feed Industry Association (AFIA), which according to documents provided Mitloehner and his research center with millions of dollars in its campaign to “rethink methane.”

“To achieve effective climate action, it is essential that methane receives the attention it deserves. Given that one of its main sources is the livestock sector, any change in the way its emissions are measured must be carefully evaluated,” says Camila Mercure, public policy specialist on climate change at the Environment and Natural Resources Foundation (FARN – Argentina).

For Professor Hayek of New York University, «multiple scientific articles have already concluded that GWP* is not a safeguard or a way to justify the unjustifiable. Some of the countries that are considering it are already among the largest emitters of methane in the world».

The changes promoted to methane metrics are not the only way in which agribusiness seeks to free itself from its responsibility for climate change.

Riding on strong demand for domestic products, progress at its Louisiana and Alabama plants, and favorable policy tailwinds supporting domestic manufacturing, the management has nudged its full-year guidance upward.

An increase in the volume of modules shipped pushed up its net sales to $1.1 billion, while gross profit increased by 4.8% to 45.6% in Q2. Operating income also increased by $141 million in the previous quarter to $362 million, while net income of $342 million improved over $210 million in Q1 2025, but declined by $7 million on an annual basis.

The company sold 3.6 GW of solar module capacity during the reporting quarter, including 2.3 GW from its US manufacturing facilities. It produced 4.2 GW, including 2.4 GW in the US and 1.8 GW internationally.

At the end of July 2025, the manufacturer also entered into a new tax credit transfer agreement to sell up to $391 million of Section 45X tax credits to an unidentified buyer. It says this has generated up to $373 million in proceeds to be realized in 3 installments by the end of this year.

Section 45X of the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (AMPC), under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), incentivizes solar manufacturers to produce various components locally. They are also at liberty to sell these clean energy tax credits to a 3rd party.

Bookings

First Solar booked 900 MW of new gross bookings in H1 2025, followed by 2.1 GW of new orders in July following the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) on July 4, 2025. However, it also recorded 1.1 GW of contract terminations, including 900 MW produced at the company’s Malaysia and Vietnam factories due to policy uncertainty and increased tariff pressure. This volume was later re-contracted at $33 cents/W. It received $63 million in cancellation payments. Earlier this year, First Solar announced plans to lower Series 6 solar module production from its Malaysia and Vietnam fabs by 1 GW in 2025 (see First Solar To Cut Series 6 Production From SE Asia Factories).

At the end of June 30, 2025, First Solar had 61.9 GW of total contracted backlog worth $18.5 billion, which increased to 64 GW as of July 31, 2025. Out of this, close to 11 GW relates to the international Series 6 panels. Its total pipeline stands at 83.3 GW, and mid-to-late stage booking opportunities at 20.1 GW. This does not include bookings for its India-made panels as it has not received full security against the offtake.

Guidance

First Solar has revised its 2025 outlook to account for newly imposed US tariffs on imports from the Southeast nations of Malaysia and Vietnam, and anticipated AD/CVD tariffs against exports from India. It admitted that while these raise international sales costs and logistics challenges, adding to customer uncertainty, the company’s management sees these as temporary. In the long term, it expects to benefit from a more level playing field that these tariffs and investigations will create.

According to the manufacturer, existing tax credits for projects started by the end of 2024 and finished by 2028 remain unchanged, which supports its current US contracts. The new tax credit rules of the Trump administration are likely to drive fresh demand as projects that commence construction by July 4, 2026, will be eligible for tax credits under the changed rules. As tighter rules on foreign materials begin, First Solar expects to secure orders and may even look at the business case to establish one or more lines in the US, shared the management.

“In our view, the recent policy and trade developments have, on balance, strengthened First Solar’s relative position in the solar manufacturing industry,” said First Solar CEO Mark Widmar. “In addition, we believe that on a fundamental basis, with its cost-competitive energy and faster time to power profile, the case for utility-scale solar generation is compelling regardless of the policy environment, which places First Solar, a utility-scale leader, in a position of strength.”

Citing strong demand from the domestic market and $63 million in contract terminations received during Q2, it has raised net sales guidance for the year to $4.9 billion to $.57 billion for 16.7 GW to 19.3 GW of volume sold, including 5.0 GW to 6.0 GW in Q3. This compares to its previous guidance of $4.5 billion to $5.5 billion and 15.5 GW to 19.3 GW.

Analysts at Roth see an upside for First Solar going ahead as the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) goes for ‘greater enforcement or re-enforcement' of the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act (UFLPA). While this re-enforcement may be 6–12 months, it could boost First Solar's prospects in terms of higher priced modules.

Additionally, First Solar provided an update to the patent infringement lawsuit for TOPCon technology, which it launched in July 2024. During the reporting quarter, the company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Canadian Solar and its related entities, following the initiation of a similar move against China’s JinkoSolar and its related entities in February 2025.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-08-01%2F4h7fy3df%2FQ2-2025-First-Solar-Results.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-08-01 12:09:24.733707

As a haze of Canadian wildfire smoke blanketed the metro area, no other major city in the world had air pollution worse than Chicago midday Thursday, according to a ranking by IQ Air, a Swiss air-technology company.

“The air quality is officially dangerous in Chicago,” said Brian Urbaszewski, director of environmental health programs at the Chicago-based Respiratory Health Association.

“It’s going to send people to the emergency room. Some people may die because of what they’re breathing,” he said.

Earlier in the day, Minneapolis ranked third and Detroit seventh. Both U.S. cities were also covered in the haze of Canadian wildfire smoke.

Chicago has mostly avoided ranking at the top of the most polluted list since then. The city rose to the top three most-polluted city once this summer, Urbaszewski said. In early June, Chicago ranked among the worst air-polluted cities in the world, also due to Canadian wildfire smoke.

Thursday’s unhealthy air is a reminder that Canadian wildfire smoke can be felt acutely across half the continent.

“We’re over a thousands miles away, and we’re breathing all this smoke. It’s just off the charts,” Urbaszewski said.

Experts have predicted that the climate-driven fires may be the new normal. Many health officials agree.

People should limit time outdoors as much as possible, Urbaszewski said. Wearing an N-95 mask can help filter out some of the smoke’s dangerous particulate matter.

The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.
Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.
The fines that are going away Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.
The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn’t be issued from the model year 2022 onward.","DETROIT (AP) — The Environmental Protection Agency’s plan this week to relax rules aimed at cleaning up auto tailpipe emissions is the latest Trump administration move to undo incentives for automakers to go electric.

As part of a larger effort to undo climate-based governmental regulations, the EPA on Tuesday said it wants to revoke the 2009 finding that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. That would cripple the legal basis for limiting emissions from things like power plants and motor vehicles.

President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending law already targets EV incentives, including the imminent removal of a credit that saves buyers up to $7,500 on a new electric car.

The tax law approved in early July also includes another provision that will hit Tesla and other EV makers in the pocketbook — repealing fines for automakers that don’t meet federal fuel economy standards.

Automakers can buy credits under a trading program if they don’t meet the mileage standards. EV makers like Tesla, which don’t rely on gasoline, earn credits that they can sell to other carmakers. The arrangement has resulted in billions of dollars in revenue for Tesla and millions for other EV makers like Rivian.

That is all set to go away under the new law.

Trump has also challenged federal EV charging infrastructure money and blocked California’s ban of new gas-powered vehicle sales.

It adds up to less pressure on automakers to continue evolving their production away from gas-burning vehicles. And that's significant because transportation — which also includes ships, trains and planes — is the sector that contributes the most to planet-warming emissions in the U.S.

Push and pull on tailpipe and mileage rules

Stringent tailpipe emissions and mileage rules were part of the Biden administration's pledge to clean up the nation’s vehicles and reduce use of fossil fuels by incentivizing growth in EVs. EVs do not use gasoline or emit greenhouse gases.

The Trump administration and the auto industry have said both rules were unreasonable for manufacturers.

Automakers could meet EPA tailpipe limits with about 56% of new vehicle sales being electric by 2032 — they're currently at about 8% — along with at least 13% plug-in hybrids or other partially electric cars, and more efficient gasoline-powered cars that get more miles to the gallon.

The latest mileage targets set under the Biden administration required automakers to get to an average of about 50 miles (81 kilometers) per gallon for light-duty vehicles by model year 2031, and about 35 miles per gallon for pickups and vans by model year 2035.

But Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy pressured the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration earlier this year to reverse the rules, and has recently said Biden’s inclusion of EVs in calculating them was illegal. NHTSA will likely reset or significantly weaken them.

The fines that are going away

Then there are the fines that automakers will no longer face for falling short on the fuel economy rules.

“With the signing of the One Big Beautiful Bill, new penalties for automakers not complying with an illegal fuel economy standard designed to push EVs will be zero,” NHTSA spokesman Sean Rushton said in a statement.

Some legacy automakers have paid hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties for not meeting them. Just last year, Jeep-maker Stellantis paid $190.7 million for model years 2019 and 2020, and General Motors paid $128.2 million for the 2016 and 2017 model years.

Automakers that didn’t meet the standards could also instead buy credits from carmakers that did — or even surpassed them — such as Tesla. That provision earned Tesla $2.8 billion in 2024 — revenue it will no longer see.

Elon Musk sharply criticized the big tax-and-spending bill in June, saying it “gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the law's effect on those credits.

The agency wrote to carmakers earlier this month informing them the penalties wouldn’t be issued from the model year 2022 onward. Some automakers confirmed receiving the letter but declined to comment further.

Experts say without them, the law “invites automakers to cheat on government fuel economy rules by setting fines to $0, ensuring consumers will buy more gas guzzlers, pay more at the pump and enrich Big Oil,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign.

Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former acting NHTSA administrator under Biden, called it a “stunning decision” for NHTSA to essentially forgive the fines from 2022 onward. She said it amounted to a windfall for companies that chose to pay penalties rather than produce more efficient cars.

Carlson said backing away from future fines also “poses a dilemma for auto manufacturers who may feel bound to comply with the law, even if there is not a financial consequence for failing to do so.”

Where auto manufacturers go from here

It takes a while for carmakers to shift their product lines, and experts say automakers might be locked into their technology and manufacturing decisions for the next few model years. But changes could come for model year 2027 and beyond, they said.

EVs aren't as profitable as gas-engine cars, so automakers may make fewer of them if they no longer have to offset emissions from their gasoline models. Already, some automakers have pulled back on their ambitions to go all-electric with a slower pace of EV sales growth.

“Automakers also know every presidential administration eventually comes to an end, so they won’t abandon their EV development efforts,"" said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com. ""But they will reduce their near-term efforts in this area.”

The Texas oil driller still topped Wall Street profit expectations Friday and shares rose slightly before the opening bell, even with global markets falling on the erratic trade polices of the U.S.

The price for a barrel of U.S. benchmark crude has remained below $70 for most of the year and in May, it was well below $60.

Exxon earned $7.08 billion, or $1.64 per share, for the period ended June 30. A year earlier it earned $9.24 billion, or $2.14 per share.

That was better than Wall Street expected, but Exxon does not adjust its reported results based on one-time events such as asset sales. Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research were calling for earnings of $1.49 per share.

“We achieved our highest second-quarter Upstream production since the merger of Exxon and Mobil more than 25 years ago,” Chairman and CEO Darren Woods said, referring to the companys exploration and production operations.

Exxon offset lower prices by ramping up production as well. Second-quarter net production was 4.6 million oil-equivalent barrels per day. That was an increase of 79,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day when compared with the first quarter.

Revenue fell to $81.51 billion from $93.06 billion, missing the $82.82 billion that Wall Street was looking for.

Chevron Corp. reported a second-quarter profit of $2.49 billion, or $1.45 per share. Removing one-time costs, earnings were $1.77 per share.

That was also a four-year low for the second quarter, but it too beat Wall Street profit expectations and missed revenue expectations by industry analysts.

Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research expected Chevron per-share earnings of $1.70.

Chevron’s quarterly revenue was $44.82 billion.

In July eight members of the OPEC+ alliance of oil exporting countries said that they will boost production by 548,000 barrels per day in August in a decision that could further reduce gas prices this year. They cited a “steady global economic outlook” and low oil inventories.

The cost of installing solar is on average around $30,000.
Since 2017, the group has helped more than 800 homeowners install rooftop solar systems.
That’s why Forthal’s group is on a mission to help as many homeowners install solar before the credit expires, as well as take advantage of other local financial clean energy incentives.
“The bottom line is that people have to make the investment by December 2025 to be able to take advantage of the solar tax credit,” Forthal said.","If you want to cut the costs of installing solar panels and a battery on your home, you’d better install now.

On July 4, President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law. Among other things, the law ended many of the clean energy incentives established by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, including eliminating the 30% residential solar tax credit by Dec. 31, 2025.

The cost of installing solar is on average around $30,000. That credit helps reduce the cost of necessary roof repairs, the solar panels and battery themselves, and electrical panel upgrades.

But now, that credit expires at the end of this year, instead of in 2032, plus a two-year phaseout.

“Losing that tax incentive is just a huge, huge loss and a disservice to the community and energy independence,” said Senait Forthal, founder and executive director of Irvine-based nonprofit OC Goes Solar. Since 2017, the group has helped more than 800 homeowners install rooftop solar systems.

Forthal worries that progress will stall significantly with the end of the tax credit.

“ The federal government has quickly changed that solar incentive that really made solar accessible and affordable for so many people,” Forthal said.

That’s why Forthal’s group is on a mission to help as many homeowners install solar before the credit expires, as well as take advantage of other local financial clean energy incentives.

“The bottom line is that people have to make the investment by December 2025 to be able to take advantage of the solar tax credit,” Forthal said.

Forthal and fellow neighbors in faculty housing at UC Irvine organized OC Goes Solar in 2017 after realizing a lot of people wanted to install a solar system but couldn’t navigate the process. Forthal has a background in clean energy consulting, so she took the lead. That first year, 74 of their neighbors installed solar.

In 2019, the group became a nonprofit, and in 2022 it partnered with the city of Irvine to help facilitate the city’s solar incentive effort, Solarize Irvine.

The group walks homeowners through the application and financial incentives processes. They also vet local contractors and negotiate group rates and warranties to drive down costs — Forthal said they usually cut 10% to 20% of the cost that way — and host educational workshops about installing solar that are free to the public.

Forthal said interested homeowners should start the process as soon as possible because there will likely be a bottleneck of demand closer to when the credit ends.

“Solar takes between eight to 10 weeks to complete,” Forthal said. “ Once you apply for permit, you have to wait for that. If you have an HOA, you have to get approval from the HOA. All these things take time.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/37c1c8a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F85%2Fb9%2F4bd9beb44ac78bd674ccc14c9c76%2Fsolar-pic-for-uhills-neighborhood.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 09:01:47.427051

Is it wise to make Alabama’s energy grid dependent on Chinese tech?
Protecting Alabama’s energy security must remain top priority.","A recent U.S. Senate hearing—“Enter the Dragon”—raised alarms about the Chinese government using U.S. nonprofits to shape American energy policy. Experts warned the strategy could weaken the reliability of our power grid. These concerns aren’t just national—they hit home right here in Alabama.

Daniel Tait leads Energy Alabama and works for the Energy & Policy Institute. He’s frequently quoted in Alabama news stories about energy, often treated as a trust advocate for green policies. But trust requires openness, and the groups he speaks for offer very little of it.

Mr. Tait’s so-called “Institute” operates without transparency. It does not disclose a physical address or donor list. It isn’t registered as a non-profit in any state. There have been questions regarding who funds this organization that remain unanswered.

Reporting by the Campaign for Accountability has linked Mr. Tait’s “Institute” to Tigercomm, a public relations firm in one of the newly wealthy suburbs of Washington, D.C. Tigercomm represents major solar companies, including Trina Solar—one of China’s largest and most influential solar-panel manufacturers. Taken together, these ties suggest the Energy & Policy Institute may be advancing Chinese interests at the expense of the American public.

Mr. Tait’s dual role matters because the Energy & Policy Institute and Energy Alabama regularly seek to influence state energy policy. They advocate against American-made natural gas projects and promote the rapid adoption of solar and other green-energy technologies.

Mr. Tait is on record saying, “Solar plus battery storage is the workhorse of the future.” Of course he’d say that—nearly 80 percent of solar cells and lithium-ion battery materials come from China. Is it wise to make Alabama’s energy grid dependent on Chinese tech? No doubt that would be great for Beijing. But is it good for Birmingham, Blountsville or Bayou La Batre?

None of this is to say Alabama shouldn’t pursue clean energy. But decisions that shape our energy future should be based on facts and Alabama’s needs—not pressure from groups with hidden funding and possible foreign ties.

Protecting Alabama’s energy security must remain top priority. The Senate hearing was a national warning. Here at home, we should take it seriously.

If there’s nothing to hide, there’s nothing to fear. It’s time for Mr. Tait and the Energy & Policy Institute to be transparent about who funds their work—because until they are, Alabamians have every reason to ask whose side they’re really on.",https://www.alreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/AdobeStock_304496813-scaled-e1639056333679-1024x576.jpeg,N,,2025-08-01 10:06:06.396244

CEO Jim Farley described the upcoming reveal as a “Model T moment,” referencing the company’s historical role in transforming mobility. The move also follows news that Ford took an $800 million hit in Q2 from the Trump administration’s tariffs.

Here’s why it matters:

This announcement marks a pivotal point in Ford’s evolving electrification strategy as it navigates shifting consumer demand and policy changes. As the EV market cools due to expiring tax credits and regulatory rollbacks, Ford is pivoting toward more cost-effective models and regional production. The August 11 reveal may offer a blueprint for how legacy automakers can remain competitive through innovation, vertical integration, and domestic manufacturing. The potential for a new, affordable EV line could mean access to more broadly appealing inventory that better aligns with today’s market dynamics.

The main beneficiaries are energy technologies that are the easiest to build and most cost effective, including solar, batteries, and gas.
“There are so many things that are interesting to me about solar power.
But the impetus toward renewable energy is now too strong to stop, even with a a putative dicktator in charge.
For renewable energy, the train has left the station and is picking up speed.","Bill McKibben this week posted a conversation he had with Emily Atkin of HEATED on his Substack page entitled “Where Does The Climate Movement Go From Here?” The question is pertinent because the US Department of Energy has now changed its website to say that more carbon dioxide is good for the planet and the Environmental Protection Agency is hell bent on overturning the so-called “endangerment finding,” which is the foundation for virtually all federal climate regulations promulgated since 2009.

McKibben says, “It must be kind of disorienting to realize that the fossil fuel industry is, for the moment, in charge of a lot of things. But here’s the interesting thing about it — they’re clearly very scared too. They’ve spent more money than they ever have on politics before. They’re doubling down in every possible way — state, local, federal. They understand that they face an unprecedented threat.”

“The threat they faced for 30 years was a bunch of activists causing them some trouble. We shut down some pipelines, we divested a lot of money. But now, thanks to some combination of activism and engineering, they’ve got a deeper problem on their hands for the first time. They don’t have the cheapest power on Earth. [Emphasis added.] We live on a planet where, all of a sudden, the cheapest way to make energy is to point a sheet of glass at the sun.”

The fossil fuel game is to scream as loudly as possible that renewable energy is not reliable because the sun doesn’t always shine and the wind doesn’t always blow. But they omit the piece of the puzzle that makes renewables not only the cheapest form of energy but also the most reliable — storage. It is no longer necessary — or economical — to keep boilers heated by methane or coal fired up 24 hours a day. Energy storage has changed the game and tilted the playing field dramatically in favor of renewables.

Just this week, Energy Dome announced a major new contract to use its compressed carbon dioxide technology to help power Google data centers not just in the US but around the world. Batteries come in many sizes and flavors. In Finland, Polar Night is using sand batteries to provide reliable electricity during winter nights in the Arctic.

“Here’s a number that’s probably the most encouraging number I’ve heard in all the years,” McKibben said. “California is, almost every day, producing a hundred percent of its electricity for long stretches from renewable sources. Which means that at night, when the sun goes down, the biggest source of supply to the grid is batteries — often that have been soaking up extra sunshine all afternoon.

“But the bottom line is, California, the fourth largest economy on planet Earth, is this summer using 40 percent less natural gas than it did two years ago to generate electricity.[Emphasis added.] “If you want to know why the fossil fuel industry is freaking out and sponsoring every bad politician on Earth, that’s why.”

That pretty much sums it up. The fossil fuel industry has bought and paid for the entire US government and many state governments as well, all in a brazen attempt to make America a wholly owned subsidiary of Big Oil. Project 2025 is the product of the Heritage Foundation, an organization begun decades ago with funding from Charles and David Koch. The Federalist Society that grooms ultra right wing judges like Clarence Thomas, John Roberts, Sam Alito, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Any Comey Barrett also began as an instrumentality of the Koch Brothers.

“Where I live in Vermont, the biggest power plant is not a power plant at all,” McKibben says. “It’s the four or five thousand [residential] batteries that they’ve helped Vermonters to buy and put in their basements. When we have a hot day they can take the power out of those batteries for a few hours at the peak. It’s quite remarkable.”

Emily Atkin chimed in with this interesting bit of information. “I don’t think a lot of people realize this, but in other countries, you don’t have to own your house to install solar. You can go buy a solar panel from the Best Buy-equivalent store and then just put it on your balcony and start generating your own clean power to reduce your own electric bill. We don’t have that here, and we don’t have that here for a very specific reason: Because of fossil fuel controlled utility companies and lobbying and regulations that don’t allow us to go do that.”

But we do have that here, albeit in small pockets of the country — for now. Utah this spring passed a bill smoothing the path to so-called balcony solar systems (they can also go in the backyard or on the roof of a garden shed). The bill was got unanimous bipartisan support in the Utah legislature and was signed into law by that state’s Republican governor.

Recently, McKibben drew a line under this concept in a piece he wrote for Mother Jones. “You have a right to the sunshine that falls on your home, whether you’re a renter with a balcony or a homeowner. We’re used to thinking of roofs as protection from rain, but the sun can provide you a shower of dollars and cents. And some bureaucrats shouldn’t force you to stay at the mercy of Big Utility. Why should the Chinese and the Australians and the Germans get access to the sun while you’re denied it? I mean, what the hell? We’re bathed in free energy every daylight hour and we need a bunch of permits to use it? What’s American about that?” So many excellent questions; so few answers.

Federal Policy Can’t Stop Renewable Energy

Dan Gearino of Inside Climate News pointed out in a recent article that energy policy is like a large ship. Slowing it down or changing its course is a hard thing to do, even with all the aggressive policy shenanigans of the failed administration.

“The United States added 22,332 megawatts of power plant capacity in the first half of this year, and the vast majority of it was utility-scale solar, batteries and onshore wind,” he wrote. “[Methane] was next, and there was zero new coal or nuclear, according to the Energy Information Administration. Through 2030, the US energy landscape looks a lot like these last six months in terms of the mix of new power plants, with solar and batteries leading the way, according to the EIA’s list of planned power plants.”

David Victor, a professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California San Diego, told Gearino, “There’s a lot of inertia in the system, which means that when you’re trying to build new clean stuff, it takes a long time to get going in that direction, but when you’re trying to stop building clean stuff and build dirty stuff, which seems to be the Trump policy, it takes a long time for that signal to be felt in the system.”

Victor added that the OBBB passed by quislings in congress (that word used to be capitalized but no longer deserves that honoric) is more of a slowdown than a reversal of momentum, partly because the demand for electricity continues to rise to serve data centers and other large power users. The main beneficiaries are energy technologies that are the easiest to build and most cost effective, including solar, batteries, and gas.

Looking ahead to 2030, Gearino wrote the US “has 254,126 megawatts of planned power plants, according to EIA. (To appear on this list, a project must meet three of four benchmarks: land acquisition, permits obtained, financing received and a contract completed for selling electricity.) Solar is the leader with 120,269 megawatts, followed by batteries, with 65,051 megawatts, and natural gas, with 35,081 megawatts.”

Fittingly, McKibben has the last word on this topic. “There are so many things that are interesting to me about solar power. In the largest sense, it’s really beautiful to imagine relying on a power source that you can’t hoard. I mean, that’s the architecture of the fossil fuel industry. That’s how they got rich. They have concentrated deposits of a resource that you could monopolize and hoard.”

“[Solar] is exactly the opposite. Every place on earth gets sun and wind every day, and nobody can really figure out how to stash it away. In fact, I’d wager that it’s going to be hard, even for human beings, to figure out a way to fight wars over solar power.”

The cry from MAGAlomaniacs that renewables are not reliable is being exposed for the lie it is every day. These people are trying to get us to go back to using mimeo machines and typewriters with carbon paper to satisfy their small minded view of the world. But the impetus toward renewable energy is now too strong to stop, even with a a putative dicktator in charge. Meanwhile, the US will continue to be a laughing stock among the other nations of the world, who see the future and are not pulling every lever they can find to prevent it from arriving.

For renewable energy, the train has left the station and is picking up speed. Those who stand in its way will get mauled, and deservedly so.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/518967158_1086004080386065_6980747783976307447_n.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 12:08:27.516981

New Mexico climate groups struck a defiant tone in the wake of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s plan to dismantle federal authority to reduce one of the drivers of climate change: greenhouse gases.

On Tuesday, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in Indianapolis that the agency would scrap what’s called the “endangerment finding” established in 2009 under the Obama Administration. In that finding, the agency determined climate change was a threat to human health, which allowed the EPA the power to regulate greenhouse gases.

After the proposal is published, the EPA will solicit public comment over the next 45 days and finalize the rule, most likely within the next year.

The 2009 finding formed the basis for a number of ensuing EPA regulations, including a 2024 rule requiring increasingly strict tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks. In his announcement this week, Zeldin contended the framework established in 2009 hurt the wider economy.

“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” Zeldin said in a written statement, claiming that under the Obama and Joe Biden administrations, the EPA “twisted the law, ignored precedent, and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year.”

New Mexico’s top environmental official said the Trump administration’s proposal “ignores decades of established climate science,” and threatens New Mexicans’ health and economy.

“Clean energy means good jobs — thousands of them already here in New Mexico, with more on the way,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in a statement provided to Source NM. “We’ll continue working with lawmakers to ensure New Mexico has the tools we need to keep reducing emissions and growing our clean energy economy, regardless of what happens in Washington. New Mexico will continue standing behind the science and leading on climate action because it protects our families, our economy, and our future.”

In recent years, New Mexico has adopted laws and rules to lower state emissions, including the 2019 Energy Transition Act requiring more renewable energy for electricity generation, and a 2022 law requiring oil and gas producers to lower methane emissions.

New Mexico adopted rules from California to phase-out gas-powered cars and ramp up sales of electric vehicles available for purchase starting in 2026. President Donald Trump blocked the rule in June, prompting a lawsuit from New Mexico and 10 other states that enforce California’s emissions rules.The state is also moving forward in September with rule-making to reduce pollution over time from “cleaner fuels,” following the adoption of the law in 2024.

Currently, the state government is acting under Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s 2019 executive order setting reduced emission goals through 2050. Several lawmakers have introduced measures to enshrine these goals into state law, which have thus far stalled out at the Roundhouse.

‘We’re going to need to see action’

New Mexico conservation and environmental groups said the decision, which is not yet final, will roll back progress on clean energy and worsen risk from disasters linked to climate change, and said local governments have to work to fill the gaps.

“The idea that we are turning back 16 years of progress and turning our backs on the detrimental effects of climate change on human existence is heartbreaking,” Carlos Matutes, executive director of GreenLatinos, told Source NM. “We know full well that climate change is impacting the lives of New Mexicans, look no further than the Rio Grande running dry while we have floods in the Southeastern part of the state.”

While New Mexico’s regulations can still continue, the federal government’s move will have a “ripple effect” throughout climate policy, said Kyle Tisdel, an attorney and the Climate & Energy program director at the Western Environmental Law Center.

“This is an abandonment of EPA’s fundamental duty to put the U.S. in the lead in terms of our emissions and our economy going forward, but also to put people first before the oil and gas industry and before the coal industry,” Tisdel told Source NM. “It’s this abdication of the federal government’s fundamental role to do what’s in the best interests of the public.”

The policy will likely be challenged in the courts, said Conservation Voters New Mexico Climate and Energy Advocate Justin Garoutte.

“The Trump EPA’s plan makes blatant climate denial official U.S. policy,” Garoutte said in a statement. “Let’s be clear: eliminating the endangerment finding and methane regulation is a Polluters’ First agenda, allowing the industries responsible for more than 50% of climate pollution in the country to evade regulation.”

The EPA decision to scrap endangerment is “a direct attack” on the health and futures for young people, said Zoey Craft Communications Manager Youth United for Climate Crisis Action.

“The endangerment finding is really one of the few protections that at the federal level acknowledges how harmful these emissions actually are to our health and our futures,” Craft told Source NM. “Rolling it back doesn’t just weaken policy, it ultimately is giving polluters more power, and our communities simultaneously less protection.”

Craft said focus will have to include local responses to extreme-weather disasters.

“When our government won’t step up to protect us, we’re going to have to continue to step up to keep protecting each other,” Craft said.

New Mexicans can participate in local rulemaking hearings and upcoming legislative sessions to put more urgency into reducing emissions, said Nini Gu, the Environmental Defense Fund’s western regulatory and legislative manager.

“New Mexicans should tell their policy makers very clearly how they have been impacted by climate pollution, oil and gas emission and that they are really looking to their governor and state regulators to step in and fill that void left by the federal government,” Gu told Source NM. “The state does not, and should not, wait for a mandate from the federal government in order to step in and protect New Mexicans.”

The decision should spur further action in the governor’s last 30-day session in 2026, said Camilla Feibelman, the director of the Rio Grande Chapter of Sierra Club.

“We are going to need to see action in this coming legislative session, this last 30-day session with this governor, real action, because we’re being left so exposed by the federal government,” Feibelman told Source NM.

Feibelman noted that New Mexico has worked to implement its own methane rules and car emission even as the second-largest producer of oil and gas and that New Mexico has to “be a leader on climate.”

“People need to remember that we have the power to change things,” she said. “We have the power to change things at home by picking better products and by picking better candidates, who are willing to act on climate.”

Former NM congresswoman Yvette Herrell appointed to Trump administration post - Dan Boyd, Albuquerque Journal

Former New Mexico congresswoman Yvette Herrell has been appointed to a Trump administration post and is not planning to run next year for the southern New Mexico-based seat she represented for a single term after winning the 2020 election.

A Herrell campaign spokesman confirmed her plan to not run in 2026 for the 2nd Congressional District seat, which is currently held by U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, a Democrat.

The seat has been one of the nation’s most hotly contested districts in recent years, but became more favorable to Democrats under a new congressional map that took effect in 2022. Vasquez defeated Herrell in last year’s general election, getting about 52% of the votes cast in the race.

The vote spread between the two candidates was larger than it was in 2022, when Vasquez ousted Herrell by a razor-thin margin.

Herrell, a former state legislator, was appointed by the president in June to be an assistant secretary for congressional relations in the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

She has not yet been confirmed by the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, where her nomination was sent. U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M., is a member of that committee.

Herrell has worked as a real estate broker in Alamogordo since leaving Congress. She also owns an ice and water vending machine company and would transfer ownership of the company to a family business if confirmed, according to a public financial disclosure report obtained by the Journal.

As assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Herrell would hold a key post in a federal agency that employs nearly 100,000 people and oversees the U.S. Forest Service and other departments. If confirmed, she would replace Adrienne Wojciechowski, who stepped down in January after Trump took office.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is currently led by Brooke Rollins, who announced during a June meeting of the Western Governors Association in Santa Fe that her agency intends to repeal a rule that prohibits road construction and logging on 91,000 square miles of Forest Service land.

Rollins also recently announced plans to restructure the USDA by transferring most of the agency’s employees in Washington, D.C., to offices in five cities around the nation: Salt Lake City, Indianapolis, Fort Collins, Colorado, Kansas City, Missouri, and Raleigh, North Carolina.

Meanwhile, Herrell’s appointment could lead to other Republicans entering next year’s CD2 race.

Eddy Aragon, a radio talk show host and former Albuquerque mayoral candidate, announced his candidacy in May and is currently the only GOP candidate in the race, according to federal election filings.

Vasquez is seeking reelection in the district, which now includes all of southern New Mexico and stretches north into Albuquerque’s South Valley.

Gallup Indian Medical Center limits care because of Trump executive order on contract review - Santa Fe New Mexican

Members of New Mexico’s Congressional delegation are calling on the federal government to act in response to reports that the Gallup Indian Medical Center has reduced and suspended some medical services.

U.S. Senators Ben Ray Lujan, and Martin Heinrich along with U.S. Representatives Teresa Leger Fernandez and Melanie Stansbury authored a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Indian Health Service Acting Director Benjamin Smith.

The letter says that the Gallup Indian Medical Center has reduced and suspended some services due to recently implemented bureaucratic red tape.

Since then, the result of the policy has been what the lawmakers called “wasted resources, staffing shortages, and preventable delays in care.”

The Santa Fe New Mexican reports the Gallup Indian Medical Center has restricted birth services in its Women’s Health Unit.

An internal email obtained by the New Mexican says scheduled c-sections are “limited,” while births involving induction or attempted vaginal delivery following a C-section are referred to other facilities.

The center has the only maternity ward in Gallup.

The email also said surgeries are being limited only to people arriving in the emergency room who need immediate intervention.

Sen. Heinrich said he’s “appalled” at what he called the “dismal state” of Gallup Indian Medical Center and called the new federal policies “a blatant and unacceptable violation of treaty obligations.”

WNMU regents ax Joseph Shepard’s severance and teaching contract - Joshua Bowling, Searchlight New Mexico

Unanimously, the newly appointed regents at Western New Mexico University have approved a plan to strike down former President Joseph Shepard’s previously awarded $1.9 million severance payment and five-year teaching contract, on the grounds that they were awarded in violation of the state’s Open Meetings Act.

Regents at the July 31 meeting acknowledged that they aren’t sure if or how their move can pull back the nearly $2 million that the Silver City school already paid to Shepard following his December resignation — regent chair Steven Neville said the votes leave the agreement “unapproved and basically in limbo at this point.” But it appears likely that the board’s decision will influence the ongoing lawsuit from Attorney General Raúl Torrez that seeks to recover the severance money and void Shepard’s teaching contract.

Meanwhile, Thursday’s decision does not affect another court challenge Shepard is facing. In June, the New Mexico State Ethics Commission filed a lawsuit alleging that, while president, Shepard misdirected funds meant for an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant project toward an outdoor patio that he used for his daughter’s wedding.

“I know there’s going to be a lot of questions after these votes,” regent John V. Wertheim said at the meeting. “Shepard’s separation agreement and faculty appointment are no longer in existence … The best resolution for everyone is to get this in front of a retired judge or justice of the New Mexico Supreme Court to hammer out a fair, negotiated settlement. That’s certainly my goal in making the motion I made.”

Shepard and the New Mexico Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment.

In an unprecedented occurrence for WNMU’s regents, Friday’s meeting, which was held in person and on Zoom for virtual attendees, was derailed by hackers. Shortly after people initially logged on to the meeting’s virtual component, several hackers joined and displayed pornographic videos, racial slurs and swastikas on their video feeds. Attendees in the room appeared not to notice the chaos — regents were unfazed as they continued to discuss routine government business — but even presentations shared by the host of the meeting were quickly replaced by the explicit pornographic videos.

Several of the hackers’ video feeds featured text that read: “hacked by nuenze.” The same group seems to have carried out a similar operation in Mississippi earlier this week. After WNMU administrators ejected bad actors from the meeting, everyone in remote attendance had their cameras turned off. Earlier this year, in April, Russian cyberattackers appeared to infiltrate WNMU employee computers.

Thursday’s vote was the latest step in what has been a busy year for Shepard and WNMU. Concerns over his conduct as president were first widely raised in late 2023, after Searchlight New Mexico broke the story of how he; his wife, former CIA agent Valerie Plame; and several other university officials used taxpayer dollars to pay for lavish lifestyles in an otherwise impoverished town. Searchlight found Shepard had adorned his on-campus house with nearly $28,000 worth of exotic furniture from Seret and Sons, a Santa Fe business known for imported pieces and steep prices.

Within weeks, state lawmakers grilled Shepard at the Capitol over Searchlight’s reporting. The Higher Education Department and the Office of the State Auditor both announced they were looking into WNMU’s finances and sent the university scathing letters questioning many of Shepard’s purchases. Employees at the university and its sister foundation told Searchlight that the foundation had been reduced to being “the presidential piggybank.”

After that, though, things were relatively quiet for most of 2024. The Amazon Prime streaming show “The College Tour” released an episode set at WNMU; Shepard appeared in it to laud how the school serves students in unique circumstances, such as first-generation college students. “We’re that small place that gives that big experience,” he said.

By fall of 2024, developments picked up. In November, the state auditor released a blistering report detailing the highlights of his office’s investigation. It alleged $363,525.99 in “wasteful” and “improper” spending, including a trip to the Ritz-Carlton, Rancho Mirage in Palm Springs, California.

A month after the auditor’s findings were made public, Shepard resigned from his post as university president. At a Dec. 20, 2024, regents meeting, Shepard was awarded $1.9 million in severance and a five-year teaching contract in the university’s business school for $200,000 per year. He had been in his job for more than 13 years.

Since then, Shepard has been the target of multiple lawsuits relating to the terms of his departure and his conduct as president. In January, the New Mexico Department of Justice filed suit against Shepard and the regents to nullify his severance and teaching contract and to recoup the nearly $2 million “golden parachute.”

Thursday’s unanimous decision from the new Board of Regents has the potential to affect the NMDOJ’s lawsuit over Shepard’s severance and employment contract. But it does not appear poised to affect a lawsuit filed in June by the State Ethics Commission, which accused Shepard of violating the state Governmental Conduct Act, which regulates how employees at all levels of New Mexico government comport themselves.

“As WNMU President, Shepard had a practice of authorizing university expenditures from which he benefited that were only loosely connected to university purposes,” the 106-page lawsuit alleges. “While a university president has wide latitude to authorize university expenditures for university purposes, the Governmental Conduct Act places a limit on the expenditure of public funds for a private purpose.

Factory construction doubled, foreign firms opened production in dozens of states, and federal policy spurred over $150 billion in manufacturing plans.

But a swirl of conflicting policies — from chaotic tariff threats to complex foreign sourcing rules — is freezing planned investments, spooking some manufacturers, and prompting some firms to halt growth plans.

Core incentives like the 45X manufacturing tax credit remain intact. But new sourcing regulations are complicating those incentives.

In this episode of Open Circuit, MJ Shiao, VP of supply chain and manufacturing at the American Clean Power Association, breaks down the recalibration now underway for companies making equipment in the U.S.

We explore the rise and stall of the manufacturing boom, dig into ACP’s latest data on where facilities are being built, and unpack the cascading uncertainty created by new FEOC rules and tariffs.

We also ask whether the U.S. can rebalance its industrial strategy to move beyond final assembly and build a more resilient, upstream supply chain.

Transcript

Stephen Lacey: MJ, what would be your dream factory job?

MJ Shiao: This is kind of esoteric, but when you pull silicon ingots, you have to load polysilicon into these crucibles and there’s apparently a way to load them that makes it more efficient. And when you pull them and operate the machines, the way that it’s explained to me feels very artisanal and almost like craft work. And again, not to romanticize things, but I think about if I had to work in a factory, I would want to be the best ingot puller this side of the Pacific.

Stephen Lacey: I would want to work in testing. Have you ever seen them shoot those solar panels with hail guns and flamethrowers? I want to do that.

Jigar Shah: I don’t think testing the failure modes of solar panels is actually working in a factory.

Stephen Lacey: You work in a field outside the factory.

Katherine Hamilton: I would love to do quality control, but I would be very nervous that I would do something that would actually do the opposite of quality control.

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. For more than a decade, the U.S. had a clear strategy in clean energy. Invent technologies, let others make them cheaply at scale, and then deploy them back here. It made a certain kind of sense when the goal was to just drive down costs as quickly as possible. But then came a string of wake-up calls. China’s dominance of critical supply chains, COVID-era shocks, and a growing political movement on both the left and the right to bring industrial capacity back home. That resulted in a string of Biden-era policies that put advanced energy manufacturing at the center.

And in the last two years, factory construction has doubled, but today in the face of confusing tariffs, new sourcing rules, shifting tax guidance, the policies have never been more confusing or contradictory, even if the politics of reshoring have never been stronger. This week, the state of America’s clean energy manufacturing, what is stalling, what’s still moving forward and what is at stake? Welcome to the show. I’m Stephen Lacey. I’m the executive editor at Latitude Media and one of your three co-hosts. My other two co-hosts are Jigar Shah and Katherine Hamilton. Jigar is the co-founder of Multiplier. He’s the former director of DOE’s Loan Programs office, and he is joining us at 6:00 A.M. Australia time, 14 hours ahead. Thanks for being here. What’s got you in Australia?

Jigar Shah: Well, I mean I think as you know, when the IRA passed, I mean it really inspired people around the world to figure out whether this was really a new approach to diversifying supply chains and on-shoring and reshoring capacity. So they have a big program here in Australia around made in Australia and figuring out how we actually get a lot of the supply chain to be manufactured here. And so just going through best practices with them around what worked and what hasn’t worked. So I’ve been swimming in these types of conversations the last couple of days.

Stephen Lacey: So is it fair to say in the coming months or years we’ll see more American companies popping up in Australia making things there?

Jigar Shah: Well, there’s certainly a tremendous number of venture-backed companies who I think feel less love right now in the United States around their first-of-a-kind deployments. And so I think they’re all fierce competitors and they’re going to try to find another way to bring their technology to market.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine Hamilton is the co-founder and chair of 38 North Solutions. She is in a cabin in the woods in the Adirondacks. How are you?

Katherine Hamilton: I’m fine. It’s a little steamy right now. I’m in the place with no AC. People have asked me about this before. “Are you in the place with AC or without AC?” There’s no AC here. So we have fans going everywhere, which means all my papers are fluttering.

Stephen Lacey: That means we’re going to have to put some good mixing on this episode when we hear the whir behind you.

Katherine Hamilton: That’s right.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. That’s why we don’t do a YouTube show because I’m in here with no AC too and you’re going to start to see the sweat drip down my face and down my shirt and so yeah, better to keep it audio.

Jigar Shah: They love it authentic. They love it authentic.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, that’s right.

Jigar Shah: You’re working hard for us, Stephen.

Stephen Lacey: So before we get rolling, a quick note that we’re going to be off for a few weeks after this episode. We’re going to have some summer break content for you rolling into the feed, so stay tuned for that. And then we’re going to be back at the end of the month. And joining us this week, that voice you heard was MJ Shiao. He is vice president of supply chain and manufacturing at the American Clean Power Association. MJ, how’s it going?

MJ Shiao: It’s great. Happy to be back on this.

Stephen Lacey: I realized it’s almost been 10 years since you and I recorded an episode together on April 1st, convincing listeners that Amazon had developed a solar drone installation service. Do you remember that?

MJ Shiao: That was one of my favorite podcasts we ever did.

Stephen Lacey: That was good. We convinced people. Peak of my podcasting career.

MJ Shiao: We convinced a moderator at one of our conferences that he thought it was a real thing.

Stephen Lacey: People were a little upset, but I think generally it was well received. So I want to start this conversation with two numbers: 33 billion and 30 billion. The 33 billion is how much annual spending clean energy manufacturers contribute across the U.S. Economy annually. That’s according to a new analysis from MJ’s team at ACP. The second, 33 billion, is the amount of investment canceled by producers along the EV supply chain since Trump took office, according to researchers at Wellesley College. After inheriting a genuine boom where factory expansion doubled in a couple of years and foreign companies were relocating more production in the country, we’ve seen a surge in cancellations and freezes.

With ACP now out with this report on the state of the market, it offers the perfect opportunity to dig in to what is working, the status of the market and where some of the risks are today. So MJ, let’s start with just overall framing. Your report offers a pretty optimistic picture of the manufacturing landscape in the U.S. Right now. Two other reports that came out in the last week offer a bleaker view, cataloging tens of billions of lost investment in recent months. Reconcile those two perspectives for me.

MJ Shiao: Absolutely. So first, just a little bit of housekeeping in the sense that those other reports, as you mentioned, cover the electric vehicle space, which I know some people like to categorize clean power with electrical vehicles as all one umbrella, but there are very different demand drivers for both of those. And the other, and I think even more critical part of this is that this report we put together was released in May and it shows you just how much has changed within the policy environment in just two months. And when we put this together in May, we were pretty clear that the optimism around manufacturing was predicated on a number of different policy priorities and actually quite reasonable policy priorities in terms of, one, just preserving the tax credits as they existed, not just for manufacturers in the form of 45X, but also deployment tax credits and domestic content bonus credits that were helping to drive that demand for domestic manufacturing.

And the second was that there would be a more certain trade environments so that there would be more visibility into tariffs and costs and what folks needed to price in for their inputs for manufacturing. Of course, now that it’s towards the end of July, neither of those things have emerged and we’ve actually seen a reversal. And so certainly we’ve seen a lot of the manufacturers that were about to open their doors anyway, they’ll continue along that path but also have been hearing a lot about investments freezing and pausing as they try to wrap around their heads around what’s changed in terms of the statute that was recently passed and also the continuing complexity of the tariff environment.

Stephen Lacey: Before we walk through the specific findings and dig into specific sectors, I want to rewind a little bit and talk about how we got to where we are. I hinted at this in my opening narrative. There’s been this long debate in the industry about whether America should even try to compete in making clean technologies. There was a general attitude for a while that we should just make the tech where it’s cheapest, deploy the hell out of it here in the country. And then that really started to shift in the last, certainly it has evolved over the decade, but in the last five years it really came into focus. Katherine, when did this focus on domestic manufacturing start to shift? How would you frame out how this conversation changed?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, so before 2020, you would say manufacturing had modest growth. There was a lot of offshoring because of cost, and there were also a bunch of strategic vulnerabilities because of our reliance on countries like China. And I would just say for solar, less than 10% of solar manufacturing was done in the U.S. China absolutely dominated 95% of wafers, 75% of cells, 70% of modules. Batteries, there was basically no battery manufacturing under 10%. 70% of the capacity was in China. Certainly the Tesla Gigafactory was one of the outliers, but again, they relied on Panasonic cells. So that was an unusual situation. For wind, it was better because we did have tower blade, nacelle assembly, GE, Siemens, Gomez and Vestas were all here building, but the gearboxes, the electronics, those were all imported. And certainly for the grid there really was limited capacity for transformers, smart meters, sensors, heat pumps, all of those pieces.

Once we had the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act, all of that shifted and it has made an enormous difference in the way we are moving forward on manufacturing, the way we think about manufacturing and what that has done for jobs and economic growth in this country.

Stephen Lacey: Now, Jigar, if you had asked Stephen Lacey in, I don’t know, 2010, 2011, do you think that it really matters that we produce a lot of this stuff here? I would’ve said, “I don’t care where you produce it, just produce it at the lowest cost possible and deploy the heck out of it as I basically set up in my narrative.” And that really started to shift dramatically in recent years. So what’s your perspective on how the conversation abruptly turned?

Jigar Shah: Well, remember we did have this conversation in 2012 around the Obama tariffs on Chinese solar modules, and Obama never had a plan that I could tell of actually on-shoring manufacturing capacity. It was sort of like, we’re going to tax Chinese solar module manufacturing, but we’re not going to help people build magic manufacturing here in the United States. And so at the time, it was just viewed as a tax on the industry. It was like, well, what gives? Right? We’re not even getting any module manufacturing for it. And then remember we doubled down on it in 2015 and put even more tariffs on Chinese modules. So I think that what occurred over time was a recognition that our technology and the technology of Martin Green at University of New South Wales just kept going to China. I remember talking to the solar energy technologies office and they would say, “Yeah, we have another breakthrough out of Boston,” but there’s no place for them to sell their breakthrough except for China.

So they had to license their technology in China to be able to get any revenue for all this work that they did. And so it really was the Inflation Reduction Act and the domestic content requirements and all that stuff that really got people moving. But even then, I would say the Biden administration failed pretty miserably. When you think about just how reticent the industry was to sign off-tick agreements, they just weren’t having it. So you had over 30 new module manufacturing and sell in wafer manufacturing facilities that were proposed in the United States. And when they went to the big members of ACP and others, they were like, “I don’t know. I think we’re going to cheap out on this and see if we can just do it through modules. We don’t really want to sign a long-term contract.”

And as a result, all of those projects failed. The only one that moved forward was Qcells Hanwha’s facility in Dalton, Georgia, and then of course all the sort of cheap module manufacturing facilities that Trina or JA or others are doing. But the vast majority of deals that would onshore sell in wafer manufacturing are still waiting for off-tick agreements from the industry.

MJ Shiao: I think what’s tough to judge is we’re looking at two years in the grand scheme of supply chains that take a decade or longer to evolve. If we think about trying to build upstream manufacturing in the form of even polysilicon or wafers for solar electroactive materials for batteries, these are multi-year construction timelines. And then you have a decade or longer investment. And I agree with Jigar, right? The economic signals were never clear enough to give downstream customers the sort of signal that federal policy that this country is going to want and encourage and support that through the timelines that would be needed to make these investments and to also assign those anchor off-ticks. There’s obviously a lot of commercial complexity with that, but if you just look at the whiplash of federal policy through multiple administrations, not even just the past two, I think it’s hard for folks to really have that clarity to say, “Yes, we’re willing to make these decade-long bets.”

And so that’s the challenge. I think if we want to continue to build upstream and build the supply chain so that it is more robust so that we are capturing wafer manufacturing and cathode-active materials, anode-active materials, we do have to have a more focused long-term federal policy that is strategic in that direction and is also permanent in some sense.

Stephen Lacey: Well, something’s working. We got a 45% increase in the development of primary manufacturing plants. So we saw a pretty extraordinary growth in the last couple of years. What is working and where did we see that plant expansion?

MJ Shiao: So I think Katherine and Jigar have hit the nail on the head in the sense that you have the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, all with different components that started to build that trust with the industry and the manufacturers that the support was going to be there and that there was the economic incentive that did bridge the cost difference between building the U.S. versus building outside of the U.S. So as typically happens when you’re building out any kind of new supply chain, you start with the end product.

So we have primarily seen solar module manufacturers, we have seen battery module manufacturers, wind cells, and then as those facilities get established, and I think this is where basically we hit the big pause is you start to see that build out of further steps upstream. So we saw the first two crystalline silicon solar cell manufacturers set up online late last year. We’re starting to see battery cell manufacturers for grid storage ramp up as well. But if we want to continue that, right, of course the federal policy environment has to support that. And that’s both in terms of what our trade policy looks like and certainly what the tax policy looks like as well.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I would just note that those bills did incentivize 380 manufacturing facilities were announced and half of them were operational by this march. So there was a lot that was done. The 48 C bought down by 30%, the CapEx on manufacturing there was a 45X that remains in place like a production tax credit for manufacturing facilities. And then there are all these bonus credits for domestic content, for energy communities, for wage and apprenticeship and focused on underserved communities as well. And then with the infrastructure law, you had all these grip grants and other grants that’s like 1.2 trillion over 10 years. And what that did was really forced utilities, it didn’t force them, but it incentivized utilities to come to the table and deploy really innovative technologies that would make the grid better and more resilient, stronger, more cost-effective, and help communities that they wouldn’t have done before. So that was a huge investment, $1.2 trillion.

Not all of it was deployed, but a bunch of it was. And then CHIPS and Science Act is 52.7 billion for R&D and D and manufacturing. That’s made a huge difference, as MJ said, in CHIPS as well. So I think all of those have been super important and the crucial issue of course is are they staying in place? To what end? And then how many of these manufacturers and these plants that have been announced will actually come to fruition.

Economic impact and manufacturing success stories

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I agree with that. I mean frankly, we’ve just had a huge manufacturing renaissance. I think the amount of capital that has gone into manufacturing is at least twice the average investment from the last 30 years. And so it’s really been an enormous success. The reason I couch it the way I do is, to Stephen’s point, I do think that the mind share between all of the players and the marketplace continues to be elusive. I do think that there are some people who just say, “We’re never going to manufacture solar panels. We should just buy them from China,” or some of these other sort of areas. And I do think that as we move to a world where 80% of all new capacity in the entire world is coming from solar and battery storage, the robustness of our supply chains and making sure that there’s a diversification out of China is going to be critical.

And I think if you ask the average CEO who is a member of ACP or any other trade association, they do not have consensus around how they want to deal with this problem over the next 20 years, right? I mean, do you just want a friend shore with Mexico and India? Do you want to make sure that the manufacturing is here in the United States? Do you want the component parts that can be done profitably here? Because as MJ is suggesting, if we want to be successful in the long term, it’s a 10 to 20 year project. These things are not things that happen quickly. And so what signals are we sending American innovators and entrepreneurs who’ve gone through the R and D phase, gone through all these other phases and are now ready to scale up their technology? Are we going to back them for 10 to 20 years to be able to get through that period of learning so that we can be a world-class manufacturer of these products again? And the jury’s out, I think.

MJ Shiao: So I absolutely agree with Jigar there, and I do think that that is a very active conversation, certainly within the ACP membership, but just more broadly in the industry. And I think there are kind of broad points of alignment that we need an increasingly secure, and part of that is being a much more domestic supply chain to ensure that we have a secure supply chain that comports with national security priorities, and that also just is more robust and resilient to just the day-to-day logistics instructions of dealing with a global economy. I think the challenge then is where does that balance and how do you actually do that? What is within the realm of possibility for the industry to take on and where do we need help from various policymakers? And I think that’s an really active and complex discussion, but I do think one of the things that we have learned, especially over the past few years, is that we have the ability to build manufacturing here and to do it successfully.

And I think when I hear folks that are saying, “Well, why are we building here? China’s already won on the technology, we should just let them do it and buy from there,” I just feel a lot like that is so defeatist and it’s a little bit like when I watch football with my nine-year-old and in the first quarter the opposing team kicks a field goal and he is like, “Turn it off, the game’s over, we’re going to lose,” which we watch a lot of Browns and commanders, so it’s not an unfair feeling that he has in that sense, but I still think we’re still very much in the early part of this game.

We’re going to build, as Jigar said, 80% of new capacity is clean globally. We’re going to build terawatts of this stuff. There is so much technology evolution that we haven’t even thought about that is still folks that are in diapers that are going to dream up that if we give up now, yes, we are absolutely going to lose the race because we are not even going to show up. And that, I think, is a big missed opportunity.

Katherine Hamilton: I also think the headlines are very much about the bad stuff that’s happening, and there was the Big Green Machine, which is out of Wellesley College, it’s Professor Jay Turner who does environmental studies there. He and some students have been tracking manufacturing projects on clean energy in the U.S., and the big headline was 34 projects have been paused, canceled, or reduced in size since Trump came into office. That’s 31 billion of investment, 28,000 expected to lose their jobs. But on the other hand, what has progressed since that time? 68 projects, that’s double what’s been slowed, 24 billion of investment and 34,000 jobs expected. And then there are a bunch of projects, 489 projects that have no change at all, and that’s like 240 billion of investment and upwards of 350,000 jobs. So there are the headlines show that there’s some bad news and there are of course for every job that’s lost, that’s bad news, but there’s also so much that’s still going on that we need to look toward.

Stephen Lacey: So we talked about the national security value of on-shoring or reshoring. What is the economic value? MJ, can you walk us through the numbers of how this expansion in factories is starting to impact regions around the country?

MJ Shiao: Yeah, absolutely. So as you’ve already laid out, one of the things that we set out to do with our latest manufacturing report is to really capture the economic impact of clean energy manufacturing besides just the CapEx for setting up the facility or just the number of jobs inside the factory walls. I think one of the exciting things and the massive opportunity with manufacturing is just how permanent it becomes in the community. Of course, clean energy deployment is incredibly important. It drives a lot of local community investment in the form of taxes and payments to landowners, but kind of living in a rural community myself, some of that is invisible, right? You don’t really see that transaction day-to-day, whereas where you have these large manufacturing facilities that serve sort of like an anchor of some of these communities and you have friends and family that work out of there or work for service providers, suppliers to that facility, you have hotels, restaurants that sprout out because of that, it becomes this force multiplier.

And so what we’ve found is these 200 plus primary clean energy manufacturing facilities across the country are spurring about $33 billion in annual domestic economic spending. And that for every one job that is sited within the actual manufacturing facility, it’s creating four jobs around the country as well. And in some cases, like land-based wind manufacturing, 5X multipliers on the job front. So as a result, just even today, the active existing facilities are supporting nearly 122,000 jobs across the country. And then finally, those jobs are really good paying jobs too. On average, our industries are paying in terms of wages and benefits $42,000 more than the average American job. Then when you add on to the fact that, one, these are jobs in rural communities which tend to have lower salaries on average, that’s an even bigger impact.

And then secondarily, again, thinking about this living in the rural community that I’m in is how do you keep bright young folks interested in staying and reinvesting in the community that they grew up with? You do that by bringing them economic opportunity. I think there’s a lot that’s always said about manufacturing is so automated, how many jobs are you actually bringing? There’s kind of a fair discussion around that. But when we think about automation, that is also technology jobs, that’s also these pathways to careers for, again, young folks in the community that they may not have without these manufacturing facilities in place.

Katherine Hamilton: Oh, one of the things I was really keen to learn about was offshore wind vessels and the increase in production of those. That’s just been such a big hang-up because of the Jones Act, this Merchant Marine Act of 1920, which means you have to, any vessel has to have a U.S. flag, and the fact that we’re building more of those is really important. Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems to hate wind more than almost anything else in the world, but I still think it’s really important for us to have that capacity, and I was really happy to see that those have increased significantly.

MJ Shiao: This is what drives me nuts about what’s happening, is that it’s so baffling. The industry is doing the things that the administration, the president campaigned on in terms of wanting to bring back shipbuilding. So what’s a way to do that? Why not help the offshore wind industry create more demand for American flagged vessels? That’s something we bring to the table. And that just gets repeated throughout all these examples across the supply chain. So I don’t want to be the person that is always kind of being negative here because I agree there are a lot of manufacturers that have stood up that are, I think, especially trying to make things work, especially in a very increasingly complex and uncertain environment, and there is a lot of innovation happening there. We should be excited about that and that actually is my favorite part of this role, is to go and visit those facilities and see folks build stuff. But it just is, again, this baffling thing where the industry brings to the table these things that the administration has campaigned on, has said they want, and yet it is not being supported.

Jigar Shah: I think to be clear, MJ, I think it is a good news story. So I think we should be crystal clear that what has occurred over the last few years is definitively a good news story. I think my comment is more around what is the trajectory that we are all agreeing to over the next 10 years, right? Because I think that regardless of who the next president is, regardless of who the next Congress is, my sense is these trends continue and it’s not actually a U.S. thing. I mean, speaking from Australia today, the Australians love to buy the cheapest possible stuff, and I’ve had this conversation with them around their made in Australia efforts, which is that you have to be intentional about what you want to make here. You have to be intentional about the friend-shoring efforts that you want to make, and that friend-shoring might be a few pennies a watt more expensive.

But the point of it is that as our industry continues to dominate all new stuff that gets added to the grid, then I just think that the electorate is very complex in the way in which it thinks about these issues. I think your report highlights that, and I think it’s just important for us to be sending the right signals so that investors understand where people sit.

Stephen Lacey: Can you give us an overview, MJ, of where America’s current greatest strengths are in manufacturing? What’s dominating? Where have we made the most progress?

MJ Shiao: So I’m not going to be able to say much about the broader manufacturing economy, which there are a lot more. There are many sectors that are far ahead of where the clean energy sector is in terms of on-shoring. I would say in terms of clean energy manufacturing, we have made a ton of inroads into certainly bringing solar module manufacturing back to the U.S. We have done a great job of increasing the amount of grid storage cells, battery cells, lithium ion in particular to the U.S. I think we’ve done a good job in terms of, and to Katherine’s very early point, we’ve always had a very robust wind manufacturing space in the U.S. I think some of the things that have been exciting to see too is a lot of the programs that have supported upstream extraction and critical mineral processing that are going to be important for especially battery supply chains and other energy technologies.

We have sometimes even technologies like cadmium telluride solar that are unique almost to the U.S. in a lot of ways in terms of production and use and provide an alternative to just kind of a single supply stream. So I think the innovation front in general is something that I think, again, Jigar has touched on. This is something where we should as Americans, and I think it is part of the American identity of being innovative and being a technology leader is something that we should be doing a better job of supporting. I mean certainly both in terms of federal policy going forward, but I think importantly as an industry that cares about its own future too.

Jigar Shah: Well, I mean one thing I would say is definitively a good news story is the battery supply chain. I think when you think about where we were in 2021, we had the Panasonic facility and almost nothing else. You had a couple of other facilities like SK in Georgia, but we are now on track to 270 gigawatt hours this year of battery manufacturing capacity. I think that number will be 400 gigawatt hours in a few years, and we’re on track to being an exporter of lithium from the United States by the early 2030s. So there’s some other critical minerals work that has to get done, the graphite and some of these other pieces, but those I think are continuing to move forward within the current administration. And so I think you’re going to increasingly see a lot of the battery separators and insulation and all the other pieces come together.

Then I think we also have really done a great job of the diversification of battery chemistries, whether it’s LFP batteries that are now under construction here in the United States, or whether it’s the zinc halide batteries that we funded with Eos and the eight to 12 hour battery storage range. You’ve got the form energy facility in West Virginia. You’ve got some of these other technologies that are only for data centers in the nickel zinc space that are being manufactured here. And so my sense is that on that side there is definitive movement and I think with the 10-year extension within OBBB, I think you’re going to see so much more domestic content in the battery space.

The one space that I continue to watch for is the grid space. So for years we really never made a lot of wire in a lot of the transmission equipment here. I think you see the TS conductor facility that they’re building in South Carolina. You see a couple of other wires facilities that are being onshored here in the United States. And so we have this great technology around advanced conductors, around dynamic line ratings, around some of that other stuff. And I think you’re starting to see those folks manufacture here, which gives me great joy, but I think again, that’s going to require a concerted effort by the industry, which includes electric utilities, to say, “You know what? We’re going to make, we’re going to buy equipment that’s made here, even if it’s 10% more expensive than getting it from another country.”

MJ Shiao: Yeah, I think Jigar touches on a great point with the grid technologies too. It talks to transformers and advanced transformers and switchgear and different types of high voltage switchgear that’s developed. There are huge supply chain bottlenecks in that space right now that is impacting not just the clean energy build out, but just energy build out of all generation types and the data center build out, and I think you’re starting to see that investment open up into domestic manufacturing of transformers and grid equipment that is also going to bring more innovative products to the market too.

Katherine Hamilton: So I spoke with Evan Gillespie, who is a partner at Industrious Labs, and it’s a nonprofit that works on a whole bunch of sectors. These are all the upstream sectors that provide the inputs to everything that clean energy needs, aluminum, steel, cement, chemicals, plastics, all of those pieces. I don’t know if you all know, but in 1980, the United States supplied one third of the aluminum in the entire world, and now we supply 1% of it. And steel is so important to everything else that we build and in order to bring steel back to the U.S., and to be clear, we have been shutting down steel mills. Michigan has no steel mills at the moment for the auto industry, and that’s crucial to the auto industry. In order to bring back more steel mills, and there was a big story today about Century Aluminum and Emirates Global Aluminum who are looking for sites to build their steel plants, their aluminum plants.

And the issue is where are they getting their electricity? And the best electricity they can get is clean energy. It’s cheaper and it’s quicker for them to get, but this is a bottleneck. So this is this whole circular bottleneck where you need electricity, massive amounts. As Evan said, “Eye watering amounts of electricity are needed to run these plants,” and I know that there were three steel mills that were slotted in Indiana to be fed with hydrogen that was like 10 gigawatts of electricity they needed. I mean, that’s just phenomenal. Maybe you could use thermal batteries instead. I’m a big proponent of them, but 40% of the cost of aluminum is energy, is electricity, and if you can get that from clean energy sources, which of course then we need to manufacture which need steel to be manufactured.

It’s a loop and a cycle that we need to make sure that we prop up and support and incentivize not just the clean energy manufacturing, but also all of those input manufacturers that go into those. And I think that’s something we need to think about because all of those, the data setter demand is just putting additional pressure on electricity needs.

Policy challenges and future outlook

Stephen Lacey: And that relationship is becoming more complicated, that circular relationship because of changes to the tax code, to permitting. MJ, how is that starting to complicate the changes in policy to building new supply, how is that complicating the picture for domestic manufacturers?

MJ Shiao: My perspective is that American manufacturers are being disproportionately impacted and almost punished for having the audacity to even try to build here, and it’s just exactly the things that we’ve been talking about. If you look at one of the core advantages that the U.S. has had versus a lot of other countries, it is that we’ve had relatively cheap energy, cheap electricity over the past couple of decades, and now we’re going to threaten that because of just political ideology, which makes zero sense. It just makes our manufacturers less competitive. We have tariff policy that’s purported to support domestic manufacturers, and yet it makes it way more complex to operate in manufacturing facility. One thing that I’ve heard recently is that there’s almost this perversity where it’s simpler to just buy an end component or a downstream component because you know exactly what tariffs are going to apply.

Versus to buy from a domestic manufacturer because that domestic manufacturer is balancing these imports and these domestic sources from all different sources and all different geographies, and they’re having a really tough time figuring out how they assess their costs and what to charge in terms of price. So they can’t give that certainty to their customers, whereas foreign manufacturers may have at least a simpler time doing that. And even just the tax credits that were adjusted in OBBB in terms of like 45X, some of the prohibitive foreign entity rules are the grayest and the least clear when you apply that to manufacturers. And so they’re going through a ton of diligence through their entire supply chain without really having the clarity they need to continue moving forward. So I think that’s kind of the challenge that I see moving forward with manufacturing cares that we say that we want it, but we’re just making it so difficult for people to do it.

Katherine Hamilton: I was talking to my business partner about this because we work with a lot of startups, we work with a lot of folks who are manufacturing, and there are really a couple of different things. One is that the Inflation Reduction Act really leveled the playing field for deep tech. So whereas we weren’t doing it before, we could start manufacturing deep tech. And so for some of those manufacturers, those that already got started, they’re going to stay, but other ones are saying, “We can’t really support this,” and if they have international investors, they’re going to go elsewhere to build. And the second thing of course that MJ raised up was tariffs because while we’re waiting, and the first piece was about FEOC. Look, if you have FEOC that’s been thrown in there and then you also have tariffs, there’s so much uncertainty that if you have international investors and if you haven’t stockpiled, you might as well go somewhere else to build. And that is exactly the perverse incentive that those are providing.

Jigar Shah: Yeah. And this is the tactics versus strategy conversation that I was having, which is that here in Australia, the conversations or I’ve had these conversations in the EU or the UK, they’re saying, “Look, Jigar, this is exactly opposite of what you guys were telling us in the 1990s.” When Bill Clinton was in power and you had Robert Rubin and Larry Summers and Tim Geithner, we all decimated our industrial strategy chops on purpose because the whole point was to reduce tariffs and to let all of the manufacturing go to wherever it was lowest cost to manufacturer, and we weren’t supposed to have any of these industrial strategy chops, and it was sort of a little bit of a black eye that Canada kept a little bit of theirs and Germany kept a little bit of theirs and they were supposed to not do that. It was an unlevel playing field.

We were all supposed to get rid of all that expertise. So now you’re asking us to build this expertise back up. You’re asking us to get smart around how we use tariffs and how we use production tax credits and how we use our free trade agreements with Japan and all this other stuff, and people are feeling a little bit of whiplash. And so then when you go down to the actual startup companies and their investors and that kind stuff and say, “Hey, this is the real reason why you should invest in these early stage companies,” and take them through the missing middle and do all this stuff, when you then go to the government officials and say, “What do you think we need to do to be able to support this re-industrialization,” right? They’re like, “We’re still in the middle of whiplash. We’re trying to figure out what our policies are.”

And the announcements at the high level are very good, to be clear, whether it’s by America or future main Australia or whatever it is. But then when you get down to the details, there are hundreds of people who have to rewire the programming that they’ve been given for 30 years, and those people don’t get reprogrammed quickly. These are a lot of people that work in treasury. There are a lot of people that work in places that move very slowly. And so the timing mismatch is real.

Stephen Lacey: Let’s dig a little bit deeper into what is certainly going to be Merriam-Webster’s word of the year, which is uncertainty, and I want to hear more about what manufacturers are saying about the decisions behind pausing or canceling factories. What kind of companies are hitting the pause button right now? Can you characterize where we are starting to see the most friction right now?

MJ Shiao: Yeah, I think in terms of just kind of crudely bucketing things, right? This certainly isn’t always going to be true, but in general, if the facility is operating or had imported its manufacturing lines, it’s going to come online. And we saw facilities like Nordex in West Branch, Iowa, LG’s facility in Holland, Michigan, and others that came online even as we’re in the middle of this big negotiation around reconciliation and OBBB, right? So there is a certain point where facilities are going to move forward and they’re going to try to make it work. I think where we do see pause is where there have been folks that have announced new facilities, and especially a lot of facilities that are looking upstream. They might have reached site selection or they’re kind of negotiating with different sites or different states, but they’re early enough in the process where at this point they’re going to just hit pause because they’re going to want to try to understand what this new world looks like before they put those hundreds of millions of dollars or billions of dollars into a venture.

And I think what concerns me there too is that that freeze, that pause is going to have a much bigger impact in the sense that at a certain point, things just, you’re going to hit inertia. Things don’t make sense. The manufacturers around the world aren’t just going to say, “Well, the U.S. is pausing its investment in upstream supply chains. Why don’t we pause as well?” Right? They’re going to continue to invest, they’re going to continue to innovate, and we’re losing that ability to regain, or in some cases maintain our lead, because of that.

Jigar Shah: The other thing I’d say though is I do think that we’re getting really confusing signals. So when you look at the Rare Earth Deal that the Trump administration just did with MP, I think there were even positive comments made by Tom Steyer and a few other folks on that. That is a really bad deal when you think about putting 400 million of equity from DoD into a company that has never made magnets before in its life, then I know of 20 other companies who I thought were far better off, and we did one deal when I was with the loan programs office for a group that continues to move forward on the magnet market. Everything else is radioactive right now. You can’t get another permanent magnet deal done because they’re saying, “What was this deal? Is there an office at DoD that I’m supposed to go to get $400 million worth of equity?”

Oh no, that office doesn’t exist. That’s Stephen Miller in the White House. Am I supposed to go to Apple and get an off-tick agreement? Oh no, that was just like Trump was talking to Apple and Apple just sort of did the deal. And so some of this is also just like what signals are we supposed to be sent in this moment around critical minerals processing or rare earths processing? What are the rule sets? I mean, I think some people are like, “Well, maybe there’s just free money, unlimited money from DoD, and then DoD is also going to stockpile all the rare earths and just buy it from us on the other side.” But then when you go to folks and say, “Well, I’d like to replicate that deal, please,” they’re like, “No.” That was a weird custom deal that was done over signal.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I think as MJ said, those that already got started, they’re going to keep going and it’s the ones that are just unsure of what FEOC and the tariffs are going to bring that may be at least pausing. I would say there are a couple of sectors that I’ve been interacting with and working with that I think are interesting. One is geothermal. Of course, a lot of geothermal projects come out of the oil and gas industry. They need data, which oil and gas has in spades. They need drilling and construction. They need people, they need engineering civil contractors. A lot of the equipment comes out of that industry. So I think geothermal has a pretty good path forward. Again, there’s an issue of steel and aluminum, so we need to kind of build that into the equation, but it certainly does learn from oil and gas.

And then the other is hydropower. There’s a company called NewStream that is water to wire. It’s 100% built in the U.S. in Alabama. It’s modular. Those are the kinds of equipment that can get us to clean energy very quickly if we allow them to thrive. And that was bought by Mesa, so they’re in good shape. So I feel like there’s some that are going to continue and do well. And I think that another thing we really need to think about is state policy. So we’ve been talking a lot about what’s happening on the federal side, but states can do a lot to help. They can provide incentives, they can provide training programs, often which are crucial because there are a lot of, as MJ said, if you’re building in a rural area, you need to train a lot of people that are local that may not have worked in this particular industry before.

Local permitting requirements are often the whole bottleneck to a project. So certainly states can help with that. States and locales can help with that. And infrastructure, giving access to infrastructure and all kinds of other energy facilities, whether it’s being able to have access to a substation to be able to interconnect, but also just making sure that from a state level that the policies on clean energy and what a state wants to do on clean energy and what it wants to deploy are aligned with the manufacturing that is occurring there. Because I think having that linked will make both sides stronger. It’ll make both clean energy and manufacturing, whether the manufacturing is clean energy or something else will make both sides stronger.

Jigar Shah: The one area that I’m seeing a lot of weakness in is in the green metal space. So I do think that when you think about the electricity cost assumptions that people had for that, and I think there is a definitive desire for AI to get that access to electricity more than green metals. And so I think you’re seeing a lot of green metals, people reevaluate their projects here in the United States.

MJ Shiao: I want to echo the point that Katherine made about state policy. I hesitate a little bit because state policy can’t always bridge the full gap if federal policy isn’t there, but it is a clear opportunity that I think a lot of the states can lean into more. And just my experience in the past and having to cite facilities and talk to different states, there was definitely a spectrum of states who are really good at knowing these industries and knowing how to attract energy manufacturers to their state and exactly what they needed and other states that honestly could use some help in terms of understanding what the industry needs. Some of that is within those economic development agencies, and a lot of that too is going to be on what the state legislators want to support. And I think a lot of them do want to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. and specifically back to their their state.

And from that perspective, I think there are a lot of opportunities that don’t necessarily have to be just tax giveaways or grants or things like that, but can be like workforce training or helping companies convert manufacturing from one sector to another. That can be really interesting and can, again, help support the manufacturing that is interested in that area.

Stephen Lacey: All right, so to close this out, we’ve seen this incredible momentum now ramming headfirst into a very chaotic and contradictory policy environment. What are the big storylines that we should be watching headed into 2026? What’s the general sentiment in the manufacturing sector?

Jigar Shah: Well, I mean it’s very obvious that everyone is doing a deep dive of their supply chain now to figure out the FEOC rules and what the implications might be. I think you are seeing a very aggressive stance from countries from around the world to come attract our companies from the United States. I mean, some of whom were their companies who then were lulled over here by the IRA who are now going back to their home countries. And so I think you are seeing a tremendous interest from Canada, the UK, the EU, Australia and others to try to get some of that business and to bring it to other places. I think the other piece of this though that I’m watching for is a real interest in figuring out where the Department of Defense and some of the other players are going to sit, right? Because I mean, they have been very clear that this whole rare earth stuff, critical mineral stuff, battery stuff has been freaking them out and they want to have a more domestic supply chain that really meets their national security needs.

To date, it’s been half-hazard, in my opinion. I don’t quite see the signal from the noise on what’s been said, but I’m hoping that by 2026 there’ll be a real signal around what it is that we should be doing. I’ll give you an example. In the OBBB, there was a bunch of money taken from the loan programs office to the Department of Defense to stand up their loan program, but their loan program doesn’t actually function. So people aren’t sure whether they can get a loan out of that program for critical minerals. And so do you go to the loan programs office for a critical minerals loan? Do you go to the OSC for a critical minerals loan? It’s just not clear where that money is for people who want to do stuff here in the United States. And so my hope is that there’ll be a lot more clarity in 2026 around which office is responsible for which one of the priorities.

And nuclear is the same. We really haven’t talked a lot about nuclear, but the FEOC rules are actually quite disruptive to the existing supply chain for the AP1000. And so if you’re going to build 10 new AP1000s, which has been announced within the executive order, you’re going to have to shift those supply chains to be able to meet the FEOC rules. And part of the challenge with that is also the tariff policy between Canada and the United States.

So I’ll give you an example. When we announced that the trade deal between the United States and Japan, Toyota’s stock went up 10% and the big three automakers went down 10%. Why? Because it is more expensive to import the supply chain from Canada with the tariffs they have now for the big three than it is to buy a car from a Japanese-made auto and just pay a flat 15% tariff. And so there is a lot of cross-currency here and a lot of people are like, “Wait a second, what? Wait, what am I supposed to be doing?” And so there’s a lot of sorting happening right now, and I think 2026 will hopefully bring a lot more clarity.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine?

Katherine Hamilton: I spend a lot of time working on kind of the customer-sided resources on clean energy, and I am going to watch, even starting this fall, what’s going to happen to the economy and consumer prices. Rates, just prices of goods as the tariffs start hitting those, just to see if that changes the dynamic of how we think about the solutions that are going to work and how we think about even the manufacturing and all those jobs that that creates, because we’ve talked so much about the disconnect between the political decisions that are being made and the jobs that are on the ground. And I am wondering if some of the customer consumer impacts are going to also have an impact on the politics. I’ll be watching that this fall and next year.

Stephen Lacey: MJ, round us out.

MJ Shiao: So think I look at something that’s micro and then macro. On the micro side, it’s something that I know I’m going to get thrown into the policy basement for months to figure out all these new foreign entity of concern provisions that are OBBB and what do they mean and what does this and/or in this place need, and how does Treasury actually write rules that make this workable for the type of project deployments and suppliers that we want to see in the U.S.? So that’s going to be a very complicated and very lawyer heavy conversation. And then on the macro side, I just want to see how the environment continues to play out, where we just continue to shoot ourselves in the foot and promote, have policies that are totally antithetical to the things that they’re supposed to promote. Jigar talked about the confusing signals that you get from tariffs and trade deals that are happening.

And also just again, if we want AI dominance, we want data centers built, we want affordable energy for manufacturers in the U.S., we need to build out clean energy. We can’t stop clean energy from being built and deployed around the country. If we want manufacturers to come here and be cited here, we can’t destroy the domestic end market for those products and stop the deployment of those clean energy products too. So that’s something else that’s just like our policymakers, our folks in the White House and Congress going to get out of this campaign mode and snap out of that haze and start to govern to the priorities that they actually have purported.

Stephen Lacey: Well, if you get too dizzy and you’re sick of being in the analyst basement trying to figure this all out, and you want to go and try to get that dream job of being an ingot puller, I will give you a recommendation.

MJ Shiao: Thank you.

Stephen Lacey: MJ Shiao is the vice president of supply chain and manufacturing at American Clean Power. MJ, this was fun. Thank you.

Still, the carmaker will reduce the base price of EQ models between 4% and 16% starting in 2026.","Financial results from automaker Mercedes-Benz show US battery EV sales falling as the firm moves to mitigate the impact of new US tariffs.

Despite reporting what it called a “robust free cash flow” in its Q2 financial results, in the first half of the year the German carmaker’s net profit dropped from €6.1 billion (£5.2 billion) to €2.7 billion (£2.3 billion), a 56% year-on-year decrease.

EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and earnings per share have both fallen by 68%.

According to Mercedes-Benz Group AG CEO Ola Källenius, the company’s financial results were robust “given the dynamic business environment”.

He added: “The best response is to stay on course to deliver desirable and intelligent products, while keeping a tight grip on costs.”

In Q2, electrified car models took a 20.7% share of all car sales (which were down 9% from Q2 2024), but all-electric models only made up 7.7% of the total, while demand for plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) remained strong.

The company will pause US deliveries of its EQ electric range and cut the price of the model there. While deliveries of the EQ range are paused, the firm will try to run down existing inventories in the US and continue supplying new vehicles from its manufacturing plant in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

Mercedes-Benz said that US tariff policy combined with countermeasures by other government are leading to considerable uncertainty. US president Donald Trump’s revocation of EV tax credits and federal support for EV charging infrastructure is due to hit sooner than expected, after the so-called 'One Big Beautiful Bill' passed on 4 July.

The company’s manufacturing predominantly takes place in Europe. Despite an agreement having been reached between the US and EU that will see automotive import tariffs sit at 15%, lower than previously threatened rates, this is still an increase from current 2.5% tariffs.

Speaking in a presentation of the company’s results, Källenius said the company doesn’t see BEV demand dropping to zero: “We still think that the medium to long-term adoption rate of BEVs in the US will creep upwards.""

The UK’s move comes amid similar tensions in Europe, where EU authorities are investigating Chinese EV imports that threaten the dominance of local auto manufacturers.
A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesperson said: ""Our electric car grant will give drivers across the UK access to discounts on dozens of new electric car models, helping them save up to £3,750 per car and putting money back into the pockets of working people.""","The policy aims to support the switchover to electric and help the UK reach climate goals, but could limit Brit consumers’ access to some of the most advanced and affordable EVs on the market

A hugely popular EV with 500-mile range is at risk of being banned from the UK’s new £3,750 electric car grant due to new government restrictions.

The UK government’s £650m Electric Car Grant (ECG) subsidises up to £3,750 off the purchase price of new EVs costing under £37,000, in the hopes of accelerating the country’s transition away from petrol and diesel vehicles ahead of the 2030 ban on new internal combustion engine (ICE) car sales.

However, the scheme contains strict criteria — only manufacturers who meet ""minimum environmental standards"" qualify. Notably, vehicles manufactured in countries with ""poor sustainability records or high carbon emissions"" are ineligible for the scheme. It comes after UK drivers were warned over 'avoiding' road instead of having to follow new rule.

China, which dominates global EV and battery manufacturing, relies heavily on coal-powered electricity for its factories. According to Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood, in an effort to ensure that the EV shift not only reduces emissions on the road, but also in the manufacturing and supply chain, any manufacturer whose production is powered significantly by coal will be excluded from grant eligibility. As a result, Chinese EVs, including those from BYD and MG, will not qualify.

This also includes Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi’s game-changing entry into the EV market, the new new YU7 electric SUV, which received over 200,000 pre-orders within just three minutes of its launch. The impressive model has an incredible 518-mile range, gets from naught to 60 mph in just 3.23 seconds and boasts a top speed of 157 mph.

China’s government has strongly protested the measure, arguing the UK is violating World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules by giving ""favourable treatment"" to certain countries over others. WTO rules prohibit discrimination in international trade.

An embassy spokesperson said: ""China has abolished all market access restrictions on foreign investment in manufacturing and remains open to international carmakers, including those from the UK, who can fully share in the dividends of China’s big market.

""We hope the UK’s industry policy will observe WTO rules, respect market economy laws and provide an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for the investment and operation of businesses from all countries, including China. The Chinese side is closely following the situation and will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.""

The UK’s move comes amid similar tensions in Europe, where EU authorities are investigating Chinese EV imports that threaten the dominance of local auto manufacturers.

On July 16, Ms Greenwood told the BBC’s Today programme: ""We don’t expect any cars that are assembled in China to be eligible for this scheme. The grant is restricted to those manufacturers that reach minimum environmental standards. And, frankly, if you generate a lot of the electricity that powers your factory through coal power stations, then you are not going to be able to access this grant.""

A Department for Transport (DfT) spokesperson said: ""Our electric car grant will give drivers across the UK access to discounts on dozens of new electric car models, helping them save up to £3,750 per car and putting money back into the pockets of working people.""

So while the policy aims to support to switchover to EVs and help the UK reach its climate goals, it could also limit Brit consumers’ access to some of the most advanced and affordable EVs on the market.",https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article35642717.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_PROD-Electric-Car-Charging.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 13:02:31.749691

If you look across Gleason Street from the New Mt. Hermon Baptist Church in Detroit’s 48217 ZIP code, you’ll see an empty, grassy field. The church’s pastor, Rev. Dr. Alex Hill, and residents see much more: the $21 million Eden Park Community Project.

Their vision calls for a walk through a great lawn with large “mechanical trees” that remove 1,000 times more carbon dioxide than normal trees. To the left are abundant vegetable and botanical gardens, and to the right is an amphitheater, playground, and splash pad. At the end of the park, people with Alzheimer’s and their caretakers take a break in a lush, secured area, and children attend Montessori school in the community house.

This is the vision residents have for the nearly 6-acre lot on the former Mark Twain Elementary School site. The project is a long time coming, said Dr. Alicia Renee Farris, co-chair of Eden Park Steering Committee and board treasurer for the Tri-City Community Development Corp.

“Residents haven’t seen this level of investment in years,” Farris said. “Most of it has been new corporations being a part of the problem, not necessarily solution-based community development.”

In Southwest Detroit, vehicle and industrial pollution from both sides of the Detroit River is an everyday problem for residents, taking a toll on their health and quality of life. Through clean energy alternatives like stormwater management, solar panels, and a parking lot with EV chargers, Farris said she hopes Eden Park will mitigate the damage from industrial pollution.

‘Tranquil’ vision for Eden Park

The project will provide direct access to resources to support health and wellness, Farris said, like a resiliency hub with utility assistance, food and clothing during power outages, and a community garden.

The Eden Park plans call for a 2,000-square-foot pavilion and a 1,300-square-foot amphitheater, according to a project outline. The plans include a veterans memorial and community programming and resources targeting youth and seniors.

This programming will take place at a two-story “Community House” with a Montessori school, a computer literacy center, and a resilience hub. Eden Park will offer workshops for doctors to “better understand the conditions in which their patients live,” Farris said.

Eden Park is a place to promote health and wellness, rather than a recreational area, she said.

“We do not want to compete with the Kemeny Recreation Center. We want this to be a tranquil surrounding,” she said.

The concept for a gated Alzheimer’s park, accessible through the community house, was designed with help by the University of Michigan Alzheimer’s Disease Center, and includes calming features such as gardens, Farris said.

Eden Park is a project of the Tri-City Community Development Corporation, a 25-year-old nonprofit empowering residents of Southwest Detroit, River Rouge, and Ecorse through youth and senior programming, opportunity training, and a family resource center.

The project established a green infrastructure task force in 2017, and the nonprofit acquired the property in 2019, Farris said. The COVID-19 pandemic slowed progress, Farris said, though Eden Park held a ceremonial groundbreaking in 2022.

The Eden Park backers plan to begin construction in 2026, and it will take about a year, Farris said.

$20M fundraising goal for Southwest Detroit development

At first, Farris said the plans for the park were simple. The funding goals for the project spiked from $2 million to $20 million once residents’ voices were heard, she said: they asked for a community house with programming, a picnic pavilion, secure spaces, and gardens.

“The $2 million originally projected would have been just a park in the midst of 42 polluting entities,” Farris said.

The project has raised 6% of the approximately $21 million goal, with $20 million left to raise, Farris said. The community development corporation’s fundraising campaign is called Ten Bring $Ten. Someone donates $10, and asks 10 people to donate $10, New Mt. Hermon’s Hill said.

“It takes a lot of people, but a lot of people do a little,” Hill said. “By doing it this way, it’ll not only make it reasonable for people to donate, but it also gives them an opportunity to be vested in the project itself.”

Farris said Eden Park’s revenue streams will include farmers’ markets; a day care center; and event rental spaces for residents, nonprofits or corporations, including the community house, amphitheater, and pavilion.

The project applied for the Environmental Protection Agency’s community change grant in November 2024, Farris said. The program, a nearly $1.6 billion historic investment in environmental justice under the Inflation Reduction Act, aimed to advance local projects that reduce pollution, increase community climate resilience, and build community capacity.

In Michigan, six projects were awarded community change grants in December 2024, ranging from $3 million to $20 million. Under the Trump administration, all projects have been at a standstill since early May, Bridge Michigan reported.

Eden Park never received a formal rejection letter, Farris said, adding that the EPA responded suggesting the group look for other funding options.

The only project in Detroit awarded a grant, EcoWorks, a Detroit-based nonprofit awarded $20 million in December, had planned to transform houses of worship into community resilience hubs powered by solar energy. Its work is now stalled, as Planet Detroit previously reported.

The state’s environmental assessment of the Eden Park site found arsenic, selenium, and zinc, Farris said. Though not mandated by the environmental agency, the project’s backers decided to “do their due diligence,” Farris said, and remove 2 feet of soil beginning this fall. The remediation costs of about $1 million are being funded by the Wayne County Brownfield Redevelopment Authority, she said.

Environmental justice projects in the tri cities were funded by a $2 million settlement between the Sierra Club and DTE Energy signed in 2020, ending a “decade-long dispute over the utility company’s alleged Clean Air Act violations,” The Detroit News reported.

The settlement contributed $500,000 for Eden Park, Farris said, and the funds were used for architectural design, pre-construction activities, and community engagement efforts.

“We intend to make sure that everyone is feeling very safe and comfortable, and there’s something for all ages,” Farris said.",https://i0.wp.com/www.bridgedetroit.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/eden-park-.png?fit=2404%2C1232&ssl=1,N,,2025-08-01 11:03:34.576960

On X—the platform owned by billionaire Elon Musk, who left the Trump administration earlier this year—the department shared an image of coal with the message, ""She's an icon. She's a legend. And she is the moment.""

The audio of television host Wendy Williams saying that, while speaking about rapper Lil' Kim, often has been repurposed by social media users. However, the DOE's use of the phrase to glamorize coal sparked swift and intense backlash.

Much of the response came on X, with critics calling the post ""some weird shit"" and ""literally unhinged.""

""POV: It's 1885 and you work for the Department of Energy,"" wrote Jonas Nahm, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who served on the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Joe Biden.

Democratic members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources replied: ""She is inefficient. She is dirtier air. She is higher energy bills.""

Multiple X users pointed to coal workers' pneumoconiosis, a condition that occurs when coal dust is inhaled—including California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom's press office, which wrote, ""She's black lung.""

The national Democratic Party account said, ""In April, Trump cut a program that gave free black lung screenings to coal miners.""

After U.S. District Judge Irene Berger—appointed by former President Barack Obama in West Virginia—issued a preliminary injunction against firings at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program, nearly 200 workers who screen coal miners for black lung were reinstated.

Since returning to office in January, Trump has taken various steps to attack the climate and benefit the fossil fuel industry, such as picking fracking CEO Chris Wright to lead DOE, signing coal-friendly executive orders in April and issuing proclamations that provide what the White House called ""regulatory relief"" for a range of facilities, including coal plants, earlier this month.

""Hard to fathom this coming from the DOE if there were any sane, reasonable, rational, or thoughtful government in control,"" Graham Lau, an astrobiologist and science communicator, said of the department's pro-coal X post. ""The Trump administration wants us all choking, sick, misinformed, and working ourselves to death so that a few from the luxury class can be ever more wealthy. Coal is not the moment. Coal is not going to meet U.S. energy needs. Coal is not the way forward.""

Climate and clean energy investor Ramez Naam wrote, ""She is the past,"" and shared the graph below, which features data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration about coal consumption since 1960.

Ryan Katz-Rosene, an associate professor at Canada's University of Ottawa studying contentious climate debates, quipped, ""Just the U.S. Department of Energy shilling for one of the most destructive industries known to humanity cool cool cool.""

In the early 1900s, coal mining in the United States often killed more than 2,000 workers per year, according to the U.S. Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration. Over the past decade, it has killed roughly 10 people annually.

It's not just coal miners who are at risk. Research published in the journal Science two years ago found that ""from 1999-2020, approximately 460,000 deaths in the Medicare population were attributable to coal electricity-generating emissions.""

Genevieve Guenther, founding director of End Climate Silence, said Thursday: ""The fact that they're coding coal as female is right in line with the fact that Trump is a rapist.

The state’s “Rebate+” incentives, which are available to certain prequalified low- and moderate-income buyers, will remain the same for the time being, DEEP said.
Federal tax credits are expiring as a result of Republicans’ tax and spending plan, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4.
The law ended tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used vehicles.
(Rebate+ incentives for new vehicles previously been expected to increase as part of the August changes, before being held flat).","A recent spike in demand for electric vehicles ahead of soon-to-expire federal tax credits has led Connecticut to lower some of its own incentives for car buyers, officials said this week.

The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced on Thursday that it would lower its standard rebate for purchasers of new EVs and plug-in hybrids from $1,500 to $500, due in part to what officials said was a more than 30% increase in demand for the rebates before federal tax credits expire on Sep. 30.

During a virtual meeting with reporters and public stakeholders Thursday, DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes said the sudden spike in demand had forced the agency to begin “rationing” its incentives to ensure the ongoing fiscal health of the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Vehicle Purchase Rebate program.

“The budget that we have for the CHEAPR program is finite,” Dykes said. “We’re trying to be good stewards of that money.”

The new, lower standard rebates will take effect Aug. 1. The state’s “Rebate+” incentives, which are available to certain prequalified low- and moderate-income buyers, will remain the same for the time being, DEEP said.

Federal tax credits are expiring as a result of Republicans’ tax and spending plan, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed on July 4. The law ended tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used vehicles.

While DEEP did not immediately provide data on the number of state rebates that have been requested or approved since the federal law took effect, automakers have been publicly pushing customers to take advantage of the tax credits before they go away.

Tesla — which cannot sell its cars directly to buyers in Connecticut — recently published a banner advertisement on its website about the expiring tax credits, urging customers to “Take Inventory Now.”

The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.

Barry Kresch, the president of the EV Club of Connecticut, said that while he understood DEEP’s rationale for lowering its incentives, the move comes at a precarious time for the industry. Nationally, EV sales are expected to hit a slump later this year after the expiration of the tax breaks, he said.

“I’m sad to see the reduction of the incentive, because I think it was effective,” Kresch said. “Hopefully it can come back, depending on how the market looks.”

The number of EVs in Connecticut has quadrupled since 2020, but still only account for about 2.7 % of registered vehicles in the state. Despite the limits on direct sales, Tesla cars are by far the state’s most popular brand of EVs, followed by Toyota, Jeep and Chevrolet.

Oliver Johnson, a sales manager at Toyota of Stamford, said his dealership has experienced a slight increase in interest in the automaker’s EV lineup — led by the plug-in hybrid RAV 4 — since the new law went into effect. The dealership typically sells under a dozen EVs a month, he said, meaning the bump resulted in about three to four additional sales.

Johnson said that customers in the market for EVs are well aware of the deadline. “Everyone knows about it,” he said.

Since launching in 2015, the CHEAPR program has issued more than 21,000 rebates worth over $42 million, according to DEEP. The program is funded through a fee assessed on new vehicle sales and registrations.

This year’s standard rebate was already reduced in January from last year’s maximum of $2,250, due to strong demand. It had previously been set to drop again in August, to $1,000, prior to DEEP’s announcement of further cuts on Thursday. (Rebate+ incentives for new vehicles previously been expected to increase as part of the August changes, before being held flat).

In its announcement on Thursday, DEEP said officials would work with the CHEAPR Board to discuss potentially increasing incentives again to meet demand following the expiration of the federal tax credits in September.

That requirement would have disincentivized the use and manufacturing of domestic solar and wind materials.
That led Curtis and Murkowski — and others more quietly — to strike a deal that included removing the excise tax.
Others saw a potential culprit in domestic solar manufacturers, who have long sought to punish China for matters like skirting tariffs, among other issues.
Observers like Russ Greene, a senior fellow at the Charles Koch-founded group Stand Together, said that solar manufacturers were backing the tax, writing on X, “The proposed excise tax on wind and solar was supported by *solar manufacturers*.","When the Senate Finance Committee released its portion of the “big, beautiful bill” in June, it included a new tax on solar and wind projects, prompting a mad scramble among senators and renewable energy executives to kill it.

Kill it they did, but more than a month later, the origin of the excise tax remains a mystery. No lawmaker has claimed credit for the idea, and one senator involved said leaders were just as surprised as everyone else.

“I brought it up at the lunch [soon after the text’s release] and leadership had not heard about it,” Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah), a key negotiator pushing to save renewable energy incentives, said in a recent interview.

“Some members of Finance got surprised when I brought it up.”

There has been no shortage of theories spread online and in group chats. Was a fossil fuel advocate behind it? Did the White House want it? Was a single senator quietly championing it? And why was one solar industry advocate saying it was “a step in the right direction”?

Specifically, the tax would have penalized wind and solar projects sourcing materials and parts from countries like China, the world’s leading supplier of clean energy technologies.

That would have been on top of a sharp phase-down of green energy incentives from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law. Companies spent millions trying to keep some of those credits alive.

Soon after the text was released, energy executives started calling people “in the middle of the night,” as one industry player put it, with another calling it a “kill shot.”

By Saturday morning, American Clean Power Association president Jason Grumet declared the “midnight dumping” would freeze markets. Princeton professor and well-known climate modeler Jesse Jenkins declared on X, “utter insanity!”

In the end, the provision vanished about as fast as it appeared. Curtis and Murkowski struck a deal with leadership to remove it along with other changes.

But its origin has remained largely a mystery.

“There had been no heads up — none,” Murkowski said recently. “We had been focusing on what we might be able to negotiate with regards to the clean tax credits and kind of the longer phase-out … and then — boom! It’s like, ‘What’s this?’”

She continued: “We’re still asking the question.”

‘It was a perfect MacGuffin’

According to interviews with senators, aides and lobbyists familiar with the process, what happened went something like this: Committee staff took scores of meetings for over a year. They received direction from lawmakers to find a solution that could be supported by Senate Republicans based on what was in the House version. They were concerned about hurting manufacturing jobs and dealing with politics in both chambers.

Ultimately, the idea came out of policy discussions with the Joint Committee on Taxation, legislative counsel and internally among staff.

But given the quickly approaching July 4 deadline demanded by President Donald Trump, and a broad array of changes in the bill, the people said, not all ideas were discussed broadly with members prior to public release.

“It was a perfect MacGuffin for the most frenzied point in the process,” reflected Liam Donovan, a political strategist at the firm Bracewell. He called it a “reminder to industry that things could get worse.”

A Senate leadership aide referred questions to the committee; the Finance Committee did not return requests for comment nor a request for an interview with Chair Mike Crapo (R-Idaho).

Finance Committee member Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), who opposed the final legislation, thought it was an attempt to put the nail in the coffin for the renewable industry. But a month later he said he was still in the dark.

“I really don’t know [where it came from],” Tillis said recently “I can’t think of any member. I haven’t been able to trace it to any one member.”

Another committee member, Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), explained that Crapo and his team were trying to strike a balance to “make sure that you didn’t have foreign entities actually trying to be able to come in, but we also wanted to make sure they could actually finish the projects they had.”

‘Aren’t that many tools in the toolbox’

Even without the excise tax, renewable energy executives were up against House Republicans and Trump who had pushed for projects to be plugged into the grid, or “placed in service,” by the end of 2027 to qualify for credits. That requirement would have disincentivized the use and manufacturing of domestic solar and wind materials.

As one Republican aide granted anonymity to speak candidly explained, while the excise tax was in part an attempt to Band-Aid problems, it ultimately was “moving chairs on the Titanic” and senators saw it as more problematic than beneficial.

That led Curtis and Murkowski — and others more quietly — to strike a deal that included removing the excise tax.

“It was a good win to get out — and stay out,” Murkowski said.

The idea behind an excise tax aligned with the growing anti-China sentiment that’s been building on Capitol Hill, particularly after years of official reports about forced labor in the Xinjiang Region.

Such a tax would serve as a stick to reshore domestic manufacturing, a key purpose of the Inflation Reduction Act, which offered mostly carrots.

“There aren’t that many tools in the toolbox,” said Adrian Deveny, founder of Climate Vision and a former top energy aide to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “The committee staffers know the basic tools.”

He added: “The truth of how a lot of this stuff happens, much of the policy is not requested by a member, it’s committee staff, it’s not a new phenomenon.”

Finger-pointing all over

When the text dropped, the finger-pointing was immediate and relentless.

Some tried to blame the tax on fossil fuel proponent Alex Epstein, who had been personally pushing senators for quicker ends to clean energy investment and production tax credits. He denied it.

“I was not in D.C. when this happened,” he said in a recent interview. “Privately, I made the case this was very bad and worth fighting against. … I was most aggressively fighting for the placed in service by end of 2027 cut off. My view was that kind of thing would undercut the messaging of, ‘Hey, we’re against favoritism. We don’t want to punish solar and wind, but we don’t want to give it special preferences.’”

He added he doesn’t have “100 percent” confidence of where it came from.

Others saw a potential culprit in domestic solar manufacturers, who have long sought to punish China for matters like skirting tariffs, among other issues.

Such splits have sometimes manifested themselves in fights on Capitol Hill, with some lawmakers arguing that overly punitive measures on Chinese solar imports could inflict more harm than good on the domestic solar industry and the jobs it creates. Others argue that domestic producers will never be able to outcompete cheap Chinese parts unless aggressive measures are taken.

Observers like Russ Greene, a senior fellow at the Charles Koch-founded group Stand Together, said that solar manufacturers were backing the tax, writing on X, “The proposed excise tax on wind and solar was supported by *solar manufacturers*. Not by @Alex Epstein. People on here were saying the opposite, so I hope they issue retractions.”

The Solar Energy Manufacturers for America (SEMA) Coalition, whose member companies represent more than 14,000 U.S. workers, stressed they were lobbying for other priorities along with project developers.

A SEMA fact sheet in June called for maintaining the domestic content bonus, an additional incentive for projects using American made materials, and amending requirements surrounding the advanced manufacturing credit, 45X.

After the updated text was released, Mike Carr, the coalition’s executive director, offered some praise for the excise tax, saying that while it was “not a complete replacement for the proven approach of the domestic content incentive, it is a step in the right direction and should be retained in the final package.”

SEMA defended themselves online and in a follow-up statement to POLITICO’s E&E News.

“We as manufacturers wanted 48E/Domestic Content Bonus duration to support billions in investments in advanced manufacturing,” said SEMA chief strategy officer Yogin Kothari, echoing a post on X in response to Greene’s accusations.

“Unfortunately, the Friday Senate text did not incorporate such an incentive and put us in a position where we could not forego the only lifeline offered.”

When asked more recently, Carr said, “The first time we saw the excise tax provision was the same time as everyone else. We didn’t provide any input on that provision. We were and remain focused on domestic content incentives to support the onshoring of advanced manufacturing.”

Murkowski and Curtis both said they never heard from solar manufacturers pushing the idea. “I don’t believe — I have no reason to believe they knew it was in there or that it was a strategy,” Curtis said.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/65/4d/96b933a54e75b552444d701ed104/u-s-congress-22903.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 11:02:53.690392

U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Release New Guidance on Energy Community Bonus Credit

On June 23, 2025, the IRS issued Notice 2025-31, which provides the latest guidance on eligibility for the energy community bonus credit as defined in Section 45(b)(11) of the IRC and related IRS guidance. The energy community bonus credit can be applied to Sections 48, 48E, 45, and 45Y of the IRC. For taxpayers claiming an investment tax credit (ITC) or a production tax credit (PTC) in an eligible energy community, the applicable ITC or PTC base credit percentage is increased by two percent, or 10 percent (a five-times multiplier) if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met.

Notice 2025-31 provides new five new appendices to update relevant features of the statistical area category eligibility. The new appendices a) list additional counties that satisfy the fossil fuel employment threshold, b) list counties that satisfy both the fossil fuel employment and the unemployment rate criteria for eligibility as an energy community, and c) list additional census tracts that satisfy the coal closure category for eligibility as an energy community. The updates are effective from June 23, 2025, until the next annual update.

New Executive Order Indicates Forthcoming Guidance on Tech-Neutral Credits and Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Restrictions

On July 7, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order (the Order) which directs the Secretary of the Treasury to enforce the termination of the Tech-Neutral Credits for wind and solar (i.e., the credits under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Sections 45Y and 48E) by issuing new and/or revised guidance related to established beginning of construction rules. The Order also directs the Secretary to implement the enhanced FEOC restrictions included in the OBBB. Each action is to be taken within 45 days of the Order. Finally, the Order directs the Secretary of the Interior to revise regulations and policies to eliminate preferential treatment for wind and solar facilities over dispatchable energy sources.

California Legislature Modifies California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and State Housing Laws

On June 30, 2025, California Governor Gavin Newsom amended the CEQA by signing Assembly Bill 130 (AB 130) and Senate Bill 131 (SB 131) into law in conjunction with the state's budget package. AB 130 establishes a new method for developers to meet transportation-related CEQA requirements—contributing to a statewide mitigation fund—and both creates new and prolongs existing deadline requirements for agency decisions as to development projects. The bill also creates a new statutory exemption from CEQA for certain urban, low-acreage and high-density housing development projects based on nine qualifying criteria. SB 131 builds on this exemption by requiring the Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation to map urban sites in which projects would meet those nine criteria and further streamlines CEQA review for projects that fail to secure an exemption based on only one disqualifying condition. SB 131 also creates new statutory CEQA exemptions for certain other project types, including advanced manufacturing and high-speed rail facilities, with limitations based on the location and environmental context of such projects. These changes were immediately effective on June 30, 2025.

California Office of Administrative Law (OAL) Approves Amendment to Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS)

On June 27, 2025, the OAL approved an amendment to the LCFS, which the CARB confirmed would become effective on July 1, 2025. The LCFS was approved in 2009, and initial implementation began in 2011 with the aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution by creating a cap-and-trade system for carbon levels in California transportation fuels. Permissible carbon levels progressively decrease each year, and the cap-and-trade system allows producers that do not meet the target to purchase credits from compliant suppliers. The LCFS amendment increases the stringency of the benchmarks for fuel transactions that take place on and after July 1, 2025, with the goal of reducing the carbon in California's transportation fuel mix by 30 percent in the next five years, and by 90 percent in the next 20 years. The amendment, among other things, provides increased support for zero-emissions infrastructure and introduces requirements for fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin. Independent experts project that the amendment could increase gas prices by between five and eight cents per gallon.

Europe

Preliminary Agreement on Simplification of European Union (EU) Carbon Border Taxation

On June 18, 2025, the European Commission welcomed the provisional political agreement reached between the European Parliament (EP) and the Council of the European Union (Council) on the proposal to simplify the EU's carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), although the compromise text is not yet available. The key aspect of the proposal is a new exemption threshold of 50 tons for CBAM goods, meaning that companies which do not exceed a single mass-based threshold set at a level of 50 tons of imported goods per year are exempt from CBAM obligations.

The adjustment is anticipated to save around €1.12 billion (approx. US$1.31 billion) in administrative costs while still covering over 99 percent of emissions. The overall aim of the proposal is to reduce the regulatory and administrative burden, as well as compliance costs for EU companies, in particular for small and medium enterprises which import small or negligible quantities of goods. The EP and the Council must formally adopt the proposal before it can enter into force. It is expected that the adoption process will be finalized by September 2025.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7499_58.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 09:02:00.513906
,EVs,2025-08-01 10:58:14+00:00,Dialogue Earth,EV makers are still far from green - Dialogue Earth,"Li Meng, Zhu Ziqi, Ding Shanshan",,,,,https://dialogue.earth/en/climate/ev-makers-are-still-far-from-green/,"Interestingly, makers of electric vehicles (EVs) are actually lagging behind their traditional competitors when it comes to transparency on supply chain emissions.
Only 20 companies (39%) had published supply chain emissions data, and only 13 (25%) had published scope 3 emissions targets.
We found less than half of EV manufacturers calculate and publish supply chain emissions and collect actual data from suppliers.
EV makers also lagged slightly behind conventional vehicle makers when it came to disclosing action to cut emissions from battery manufacturing.
EV makers in particular should focus on shifting from manufacturing green vehicles – reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants during usage of their product – to a dual focus that includes “green manufacturing”.","The large contribution made by vehicles to global greenhouse gas emissions must not be overlooked. Road transport accounts for about 12% of emissions. But as vehicles become powered by cleaner sources of energy, the emission hotspot in their lifecycles is shifting from the driving to the manufacturing stage.

It is estimated that by 2040 up to 85% of vehicle emissions will arise from producing the raw materials needed to make them. If the industry is to go green, it will not be enough to phase out internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Emissions must be cut throughout the value chain, including in raw materials production.

At the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a non-profit environmental research organisation based in Beijing, we have surveyed the efforts of 51 Chinese and foreign carmakers to reduce emissions in their steel and aluminium supply chains.

Emissions arising from raw material production were a high proportion of total emissions in the production process for both ICE and all-electric vehicles. And most of the work to cut those emissions remains at a trial stage. Interestingly, makers of electric vehicles (EVs) are actually lagging behind their traditional competitors when it comes to transparency on supply chain emissions.

So, as the automotive industry becomes greener globally, what challenges does it face in China? And what opportunities?

Cutting emissions from steel and aluminium

When making the body of a vehicle, steel and aluminium account for a large share of the emissions incurred – 45-65% for an ICE car and 25-40% for an EV.

We found the proportion of steel and aluminium emissions in overall emissions increases with the size of a car, driving up the overall carbon footprint. As the industry shifts towards electrification, it needs to focus on scope 3 emissions and particularly emissions from its raw material supply chains. Stronger cooperation with steel and aluminium suppliers will help cut lifetime emissions.

We calculate that all-electric vehicles made by EV manufacturers have higher emissions from steel and aluminium than all-electrics made by traditional manufacturers.

Different types of manufacturers try to cut emissions from raw materials in different ways. Traditional manufacturers that make both EVs and ICEs tend to implement measures on both steel and aluminium. But because the power system of an EV – that is, the electric motor, battery and control system – is heavy, EV makers are keen to save weight elsewhere in the car body. They use an aluminium-magnesium alloy, a mix of steel and aluminium, or an all-aluminium body. They therefore focus more on cutting emissions from aluminium, and could do more on steel.

Vehicle supply chain emissions: Not enough info, not enough action

Last year, we evaluated the 51 companies that sell the most cars in China and are worth most on stock markets, both in China and abroad. Nineteen of these were foreign manufacturers.

Fifty had made commitments to mitigate climate change, and disclosed their actions on scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, action on supply chain emissions remains inadequate. Only 20 companies (39%) had published supply chain emissions data, and only 13 (25%) had published scope 3 emissions targets. Twenty-six published actions taken on steel and aluminium emissions, but most of those were trials and of limited scope. It remains to be seen if those projects will be sustainable and they are not yet enough to encourage suppliers to speed up decarbonisation.

Moreover, carmakers’ disclosures tend to be qualitative or given in percentage terms. This makes it hard to quantify actual contributions to emissions reductions.

Too early to call electric vehicles green

It is true that EVs avoid considerable emissions during usage and have, in usual circumstances, smaller carbon footprints than ICE vehicles. However, our survey found that 10 firms making EVs primarily were actually doing less on supply chain emissions than traditional manufacturers.

We found less than half of EV manufacturers calculate and publish supply chain emissions and collect actual data from suppliers. Only two EV makers have set targets for cutting emissions in their steel and aluminium supply chains, and neither has said how much progress has been made. EV makers also lagged slightly behind conventional vehicle makers when it came to disclosing action to cut emissions from battery manufacturing.

Vehicle supply chain emissions: Challenges and opportunities

Manufacturers face various challenges as they try to cut emissions from steel and aluminium supply chains. First, it is hard to obtain actual emissions data from suppliers and “emission factors” are sometimes inaccurate, which hampers the measuring of emissions and progress on reductions.

Further, the companies lack expertise on how to cut emissions in their supply chain, particularly for steel and aluminium, and do not have targets or assessment mechanisms. Also, producing low-carbon or recycled steel or aluminium incurs too high a price premium.

These internal issues arise from external barriers. First, the main international raters of ESG (environmental, social and governance) performance are not yet able to effectively assess progress in carmaking supply chains. This reduces motivation. Second, supply chain stakeholders have not yet reached agreement on defining “low carbon” or “green” steel and aluminium, making procurement decisions harder. In China, steel and aluminium recycling systems are not yet fully developed and recycled aluminium alloys are low-grade, with little supply of recycled material. And again, consumers are unwilling to pay a premium for green or low carbon products.

Nevertheless, the Chinese government has issued a number of policies extending emissions targets throughout the automobile value chain. For example, its Plan for Peak Carbon in the Industrial Sector proposes to:

“support leading carmakers to play a leading role in supply chain integration and low carbon innovation efforts, building low carbon principles into the entire process of product design, raw materials procurement, production, transportation, storage, use and recycling, and to accelerate the construction of a unified green-product certification and labelling system to promote the green and low carbon development of the entire supply chain”.

Various government bodies have issued policies encouraging steel and aluminium makers to take energy-saving and emissions-reduction measures. This year, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment has expanded China’s national carbon market to cover steel and aluminium makers. This provides low-carbon transition routes and targets for the automobile supply chain, as well as policy support for action by the suppliers. For example, the inclusion of steel and aluminium makers on carbon markets makes their specific responsibilities clear. Carbon pricing mechanisms will push them to cut emissions, thus reducing those supply chain emissions.

Meanwhile, China is also working on carbon accounting and disclosure standards, as well as speeding up work on methods for calculating product carbon footprints and building a lifecycle assessment factor database. This will boost carbon-accounting capability at vehicle makers and their metals suppliers. For example, as of May 2025, an automobile industry carbon disclosure platform had collected emissions data for 8,000 passenger vehicle models, while a steel industry platform was making 200 environmental product declarations available. China’s expansion of renewable energy will also help the car industry to decarbonise.

As the country builds more cars than any other, China needs to be on top of low carbon trends in the industry, then use its influence over the value chain to put quantified green procurement requirements in place to promote emissions cuts. EV makers in particular should focus on shifting from manufacturing green vehicles – reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants during usage of their product – to a dual focus that includes “green manufacturing”. This will help to promote global climate action.

And as the world’s largest car market, China’s consumers could pay attention to lifecycle emissions of their cars and choose those with the lowest footprint. This would encourage manufacturers to make the transition and spur deeper decarbonisation in upstream suppliers.",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/07/Fuzhou-car-factory_Alamy_2WM4T92-e1753951842693.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 10:05:16.528352

All right. Welcome back to EnergyCents, an S&P Global Commodity Insights podcast covering all topics on the intersection of energy and finance. This is your host, Hill Vaden with your other host, Sam Humphreys. Sam, how's it going?

Sam Humphreys:

It's all right. Thank you, Hill. How are you?

Hill Vaden:

I'm all right. I warned the listeners that you are still ill from your travels.

Sam Humphreys:

Yeah, this is what happens when you go to events. They are wonderful, and I love meeting people. But spend that much time in an air-conditioned room, you're going to get sick.

Hill Vaden:

Yes. Or an airplane or both?

Sam Humphreys:

Or an airplane. Yeah, just throw the whole mix together. It's great.

Hill Vaden:

I had a person cancel a meeting with me yesterday and opt to do it virtually because she was sick and she said, ""I'm not going to come into the office because I'm ill, so let's meet virtually."" So I guess I'm today not sick thanks to her behavior.

It's very COVID-esque, isn't it?

Hill Vaden:

It is. So good for that.

Sam Humphreys:

Good for that. Yay.

Hill Vaden:

So this is a Change Makers episode where we try to interview people doing things in energy from outside of S&P Global, and we were lucky enough to speak with Alfred Johnson, who is the co-founder and CEO of Crux. And Crux as a capital markets platform where supporting transactions on tax credits and more recently debt. So can you set up the listeners on some of the things to listen to from Alfred?

Sam Humphreys:

Yeah, definitely. So what's remarkable about this is the speed at which this company has grown. So it was founded in 2023, and we do go into this, but some of the venture capital backers that have supported the company are of pretty high caliber, and they've raised quite a lot of capital in a relatively short space of time, dealing with this relatively new market. We've talked about the Inflation Reduction Act and the impact that has had on companies and the tax credits that are available and how companies are trading those. But what sets this apart, I think as well, which he goes into is the market intelligence aspect that the company offers. So they're not only facilitating these deals, they're offering that insights into how the market is operating, which is fascinating. It's very apt we're talking to them at the moment. But yeah, and he does a fantastic job of just explaining their growth and their strategy. But what about you? What did you think?

Hill Vaden:

Yeah, one, I really enjoyed meeting and talking with Alfred, who's got a fascinating bio of its own, where he was involved in playing football and climbing mountains and doing all sorts of stuff and working in Washington for prior administrations. And the investment, as you mentioned, the investors behind this company are very well recognized players, and I think it's interesting to talk to somebody doing an asset-light business given so many of the asset-heavy investments on windmills or solar or oil, whatever else, that so much is happening on the steel in the ground side. And this is an interesting asset-light way to play it. So it's a good conversation and we can hand off to Alfred now.

Sam Humphreys:

Enjoy.

Hill Vaden:

All right. Well, Alfred, thanks so much for joining us today. It appears to be a beautiful day outside your home where you're joining us from. Where are we speaking to you from?

Alfred Johnson:

We are currently at the beach, and it is beautiful out there though it looks like it's about to start raining.

Hill Vaden:

Okay. I think it rains every day at the beach, which is generally needed.

Alfred Johnson:

It's part of the charm.

Hill Vaden:

Part of the charm.

Alfred Johnson:

Yeah.

Hill Vaden:

So we're here to talk about your role in your company, Crux, and I'm going to take a slight direct digression. Are you familiar with the phrase crux of the biscuit, and do you know what the crux of the biscuit is?

Alfred Johnson:

This is a new one for me. Tell me.

Hill Vaden:

Well, Sam will know that Frank Zappa is a big fan of EnergyCents. Frank Zappa is no longer around. But the crux of the biscuit is the apostrophe, and that is from his album Apostrophe, which I assume is not a reference to your naming the company Crux. So maybe to set us up, what inspired you to name the company Crux?

Alfred Johnson:

It's funny, Hill. So we set out with this intention of building a capital markets platform for the clean economy, and we found that there was a real market that needed to form in the transferable tax credits that were created by the Inflation Reduction Act. I was approaching the problem for the second time with the same co-founder. I had started another business before with Allen Kramer and we were looking at this space and it was a really exciting dynamic time in the market. The credits had just been made transferable at the start of 2023. We went out to raise capital for the early company, and we're really excited about the opportunity to have Lowercarbon lead our seed round. Clay Dumas there who sits on our board, and Chris Sacca had participated in the last company all the way from the beginning until the end, and they are just excellent and incisive about the importance of a name.

And so we had all these terrible names for the company, and they were basically insistent that we change it, which at the time I thought was very opinionated of them about a pretty particular thing. But it turned out that they were so right and we kept working on it until we found something that we loved. And the thing we loved about Crux was these transactions are really complicated. Energy project finance is really complicated. And the tax financing component of it is especially difficult to crack, but once the tax credit piece of a transaction is solved and you find a buyer for the credits or somebody to participate in the investment of tax equity into the project, so many other things come downstream of that.

And so the tax financing really is kind of the crux of the project finance capital stack, and we found that to be the case. So since we launched the market for transferable tax credits, we have found that our clients, our developer manufacturer, clients and investors on the other side of the platform are really eager to look for other kinds of capital through a market type mechanism like the one that we offer for the transferable credits. And we've launched a debt marketplace earlier this year. There's been just a ton of interest in that product because again, there's a lot of complexity and a lot of need to source capital for these projects.

Sam Humphreys:

So can you sort of expand on this a little bit? Who are the main customers that you are trying to facilitate here to access some of this financing for these projects, and how have you gone about that to start with?

Alfred Johnson:

Yeah, so I'll back up a little bit further to talk about the transferable credit market and how that led to the formation of a central market for capital around projects because it's material to answering the question of who the participants are. So the Inflation Reduction Act was passed in 2022. What it did was expand certain credits that had already been in the tax code for carbon capture, wind and solar. And it extended those credits for a very long period of time, so extended it well into the 2030s.

The law also provided for tax credits for a wide range of other technologies, nuclear, hydrogen, the advanced manufacturing credits, which are supportive of all different kinds of manufacturing for batteries and solar and wind and critical minerals. The credits were extended and provided to categories like clean fuels. And what that really did was take all of these otherwise heterogeneous project finance markets for all of these different kinds of technology and created common collateral in the form of tax credits that all of those different kinds of projects received.

And so all of a sudden there was a central market or a need for a central clearinghouse of the tax credits, and that then opened up the need for other kinds of financing to flow through a similar mechanism. So our clients on the sell side of the market as we think of it or the borrowing side of the market, are project developers building all kinds of different technologies. They are manufacturers that are operating manufacturing facilities and accessing capital to support that. They're people that are building carbon capture kinds of facilities. And so there's a really wide range. And then on the buy side of the market and tax credits, buyers tend to be corporations that pay US federal taxes. And the investors are a wide range of private credit, family offices, banks of all sizes, pensions, insurance companies that are looking to source opportunities to invest directly in US energy and manufacturing real assets.

Hill Vaden:

And so can you talk a little bit about the size of the platform in terms of... So the IRA unleashed this investment in clean tech and whatever else. Is every tax credit coming out of the IRA on your platform or what's the size of participation both from the credit providers and those who are buying it? Is this dozens? Is this hundreds? Is this thousands of entities and credits?

Alfred Johnson:

There are thousands of companies that receive the credits in one form or another. The market in total in 2023 was, we estimate, about 7 to 9 billion in total transfers. The market in '24 was about 30 billion in total transfers. And here I'm talking about just the transferable tax credit. There is another market that is directly adjacent called the tax equity market where investments are made into projects and some amount of tax attributes are retained by a project ownership structure that is formed for the specific purpose of managing the tax credit.

So in total tax equity and transferable credits in 2024, we estimate it was about a $50 billion market, the transfers and the tax equity. As far as Crux, we've now done more than 80 transactions of all different kinds. We've done deals in wind, solar, battery storage, bioenergy, geothermal, advanced manufacturing, critical minerals of all different shapes and sizes. Our smallest deals have been in the five digits, so the tens of thousands. Our largest deals have been in the hundreds of millions. And in the debt market, we're seeing similar diversity in terms of different kinds of project developers, manufacturers that are sourcing all kinds of different capital. And we're currently facilitating loans of all sizes into those markets.

Sam Humphreys:

So if I was a customer, I'm just trying to get this in my head, and say I am an investment bank and I want to purchase some tax credits from someone. What is the typical timeframe that Crux facilitates that sort of deal to happen? Is it days, is it months, is it longer?

Alfred Johnson:

It's generally weeks or months. So to put it in context, the tax equity deal, these very complicated project structures, might take six to nine months to fully effectuate. The transferable credits are much simpler. And so we see deals that close for production tax credits on average in six weeks or less. For investment tax credits we see that number more like three months. It's a bit of a more complicated origination and underwriting exercise in investment tax credits. But the speed of the deals really depends a lot on how urgent both sides are to get the deal done. When deals have that time pressure associated to them, they can go a lot faster. The fastest deal we have done is 17 days from the indication of interest to closing between a utility seller and a Fortune 250 buyer. We're currently working on a transaction that I think we'll close faster than that deal.

Sam Humphreys:

Wow.

Hill Vaden:

How hands-on is Crux in this process? Is it a, call it a passive platform where these two parties are interacting through the technology that Crux has built? Or are you guys hands-on throughout, in kind of a meeting-maker type relationship?

Alfred Johnson:

We're quite hands-on. So we think about these transactions in four different stages. There's the planning stage where the tax credit seller or the borrower is thinking about the way that they will structure the capitalization of the project and looking for market intelligence and data to understand things like pricing and how deals will come together. Then there's the matching stage where buyers and sellers or borrowers and lenders are looking to connect with each other and unlock the financing, identify the specific commercial terms that might be associated with the deal. Then there's transaction where the parties are getting to a term sheet, are navigating that transaction, are doing diligence, the buyer is doing diligence on the credit, and then there's the management of the deal after it has closed. And we really think of ourselves as the facilitator, enabler of the transaction through all stages.

We deliver liquidity in the tax credits and loan markets that we operate. We deliver efficiency by building software that helps to make these transactions simpler. And we deliver intelligence in the form of market data that we deliver to participants in the market and also integrate directly within our platform so that when a buyer is looking at a tax credit for example, they're able to see the market estimate price on that directly within the platform. And that's based on our internal data of more than $30 billion worth of transaction information and algorithms that help us process it for a specific transaction that the buyer may be looking at. So really, we're trying to make this orchestration of all these moving parts across lots of different stakeholders through those four stages as simple and well-orchestrated and efficient as possible.

Sam Humphreys:

I'm really interested in the market intelligence angle that your company offers. Can you give a little bit more insights behind that because I think that's a really key piece of this whole picture that I think is really fascinating?

Alfred Johnson:

Yeah. So we found in 2023, this was a brand new market, right? Nobody knew how the credits would trade, at what prices, what deal dynamics would look like, what market standard documents would have to be. In fact, they didn't exist in 2023. And one of the things that people within the market kept telling us is that there really needed to be transparency. Transparency in price, transparency in deals, transparency and risk. And we put out in early '24, after the market had closed on 2023, a market intelligence report in the form of a PDF available via our website that showed all that information. We did a survey that aggregated up details on the market from participants within it. We augmented that with our platform data and found some instances of publicly announced deals or deals that had been filed on financial statements or were available through the financial statements.

And that initial PDF had just a remarkable amount of uptake. It was downloaded thousands of times within weeks. We found that people were quoting pricing back to us from the report that we issued. And in that we really found that there was this authentic deep hunger for information around these transactions. And since then we've continued to invest in those capabilities. We've launched additional reports. We now view them regularly. We just released a report on the project finance debt market. We integrate the information, as I mentioned, directly within the platform. And really what we are doing there is trying to arm participants in these transactions with transparent market data so that they can make the best decisions that make sense for their company as they're navigating what would otherwise be a really complicated, obfuscated and not transparent transaction.

Hill Vaden:

And can you talk a little bit more about the debt marketplace, which I think is one of the newest projects that you guys have released, and how that fits into the original Crux idea? Is that somewhat of a hedge with the policy concerns around transferability?

Alfred Johnson:

So the initial intention behind the debt marketplace was part of the theory of the company from the very beginning. If you go back to that deck that we were pitching in early 2023 where Lowercarbon said the name wasn't good enough, there are slides within that deck that talk about how transferable credits are this essential piece of the capital stack, but developers, manufacturers need to find the rest of the capital for their projects and there's an opportunity to build the deep and liquid market for the transferable credits and extend into debt capital markets. So that was always part of the story that we were telling, always part of the vision. When we raised the Series A from Andreessen Horowitz, that was even clearer in our minds as something that we needed to do. Starting this time last year, a little bit before, we brought in an individual named Andrew Hsiung, who I had worked with at BlackRock who really started to work with our developer manufacturer clients and would be investors in the market to understand what a debt offering could look like adjacent to the transferable credit market.

And we found that there was, again, just a huge amount of need for other kinds of capital into these projects. So we did our first deal at the end of 2024. We launched the marketplace in March of this year. Developers and manufacturers have now received about a billion and a half of term sheets through the marketplace, of which 700 million have been signed and are starting to close. And what we're finding there again is that there's this real need for transparency, efficiency, liquidity and intelligence in these transactions, and that software can be really helpful to navigating them.

To your question about a hedge to policy, it's certainly no secret that there is very active consideration right now about the future of tax credits and how the new bill that's working its way through the House and Senate will treat these tax credits that were provided under the Inflation Reduction Act. What we are finding is that there are categories of the market that even if you expect that the House and Senate will pass the most restrictive version of legislation, there's still substantial categories of the market that will be protected. One key example there is nuclear, which again, even in the House version of the bill, which is expected to be moderated in what the Senate produces, nuclear credits are extended until the 2030s. And the same is true of other categories like manufacturing and critical minerals and clean fuels.

So we have an expectation that the transferable credit market will remain a really important cornerstone of energy project finance. But it's also no secret that the debt markets for project finance for all of these different kinds of projects are enormous. If the tax credit market is a $30 billion annual market, the debt market for these projects is a $230 billion annual market. So we are finding that by providing multiple kinds of capital, and particularly leaning into debt capital, we can drive a lot of transaction value through the platform.

Sam Humphreys:

So one thing I did want to ask, maybe I should have asked this to start with, is obviously this Crux started in what, 2023? And in a relatively short time, you've received an incredible amount of investment from various partners. I think the most recent one was what, last month with MassMutual? Or was it this month?

Alfred Johnson:

Yes.

Sam Humphreys:

Can you talk a little bit about some of the partners and investors that have backed this company because it is a significant statement that there's been so many in a very short space of time.

Alfred Johnson:

Yes. So we've raised 77 million of total venture and strategic capital across four rounds. Our seed round was led by Lowercarbon. That was 4.6 million. We did a seed extension pretty shortly on the back of that, that Arden Venture Partners led in that round. We added some strategic investors. So Orsted, LS Power, Hartree all participated in that round. That 9 million of initial capital allowed us to really lean into the market in 2023. Andreessen Horowitz then led our Series A, that was another 18 million in that round. We brought in more strategic investors, Pattern, Intersect, EDFR all invested in the company as well, as some new net venture investors.

And then as the market really started to form in 2024 and we started to close a lot of deals and progress into other parts of the capital stack, we saw a lot of interest in further capitalizing the company. So raised a $50 million Series B very recently. Lowercarbon again led that. And into that round we brought some strategic investors from the other side of the transaction ledger, from the investment side of it, MassMutual Ventures participated, Liberty Mutual Ventures also participated, and OMERS the Ontario Municipal Employees system.

And really what we were trying to do there through all of these capital raises was bring the best venture capital investors in the world around the company, people with specialty in energy and climate tech and FinTech and tech marketplaces alongside the largest participants in these markets, the sellers and the people that were going to be building billions of dollars of infrastructure, and investors and lenders that all have a categorical imperative to deploy billions of dollars within these markets. And if we could bring those strategic investors next to the venture investors in this platform, we could build a platform that is central to energy manufacturing project finance.

Hill Vaden:

Yeah, that's a great roster of investors and probably a challenge managing all those investors. I'm going to use that as a segue to ask you about some of your resume, which I looked at. So you've gotten into Crux having climbed... You spent a semester at sea. You've played tight end at Stanford, and you've climbed Mount Marcus Baker, who I didn't know, but he's got a fantastic mustache if you Google him, in looking at Wikipedia. How does this entrepreneurship compare to those experiences? And can you talk a little bit about some of your experience climbing Mount Marcus Baker?

Alfred Johnson:

Listen, Hill, it's been a varied and unusual path. I feel compelled to say that I was a defensive end as opposed to a tight end at Stanford. And the reason that it's an important correction is the reason I didn't play tight end is I was not very good at catching. So they put me in the role where I had less of the nuance of the position.

Hill Vaden:

You just catch the people.

Alfred Johnson:

And it was more about tackling people. And that experience was probably the most important single experience that I had in college. I went to Stanford and was really lucky to play on a team right before Coach Harbaugh came in and really turned the program around. We say that we were in the foundation building phase of Stanford football, and that was also really fun because as the team went on to win a number of BCS bowls and really have a ton of success, I retroactively became a better football player because the team was so much better than when I was there.

And then the Marcus Baker thing, I was going back to business school. So I had worked in the Treasury Department in the White House in the 2009 through 2012 period, working on the financial crisis response and working in the West Wing of the White House for Bill Daley when he was President Obama's chief of staff, and was going back to business school and really was trying to lose 10 pounds before I went to business school, get in shape. And so I had found this thing called NOLS, the National Outdoor Leadership School, and they had this program called Alaska Mountaineering, which sounded hard, so I signed up for it. And the timing was right, and it turned out that it was a group of climbers that were preparing to summit Denali as a group, and they just put me into it. And they were attempting in precedence of that to go after the third-largest peak in Alaska, which is this Mount Marcus Baker on the Matanuska Glacier.

And I call it the most accidentally difficult thing that I ever did in my life. It was just terrible. We were on this glacier for two weeks with only the food that we had packed in on our backpacks. It was a real starvation kind of journey. And then we tried to summit the peak, but a big storm came in as we were doing it. So again, I have to correct the record, Hill, even though it is more generous to me. We didn't successfully summit the peak, but that team that I was doing it with went on and did do Denali.

Hill Vaden:

But you lived on a glacier in a storm that... Don't sell yourself short.

Alfred Johnson:

I've walked around a glacier for two weeks and ate a lot of trail mix, and it achieved the objective.

Hill Vaden:

Yes.

Sam Humphreys:

Can't beat trail mix. Well, I mean that sounds phenomenal. As someone who loves climbing, that sounds phenomenal. We could talk about that for a long time. But in the awareness of time, we always like to sort of round these conversations up with some highlights and some things to watch out for. So if you want to let people know some key things we should be looking out for with Crux in the next six to 12 months, now is your chance.

Alfred Johnson:

Thank you. So it's been an exciting year so far, having launched this debt platform. There's a lot of additional investments that we will make in that platform from a technical capabilities and a market growth perspective. I would keep an eye out for other kinds of products that we will start to enable through the platform as well as we look to be the central operating system that developers, manufacturers are using across multiple different capital raises.

We are also going to continue to place a lot of investment in the efficiency of these deals. So we have already made really great headway in offering standard documents for the transactions that can be populated through a term sheet builder that we have available within the system. We've launched our sort of V2 of our data room that is now used by 80%-plus of transactions. We are finding that we're really well situated to implement solutions in the transaction journey that make these deals significantly more efficient. And it is a real benefit that we started the company at basically the exact same time that AI became commercially available. So we are using it extensively within the four walls of Crux. It is part of the way that we do the algorithmic delivery of the tax credit pricing within the system. I would keep an eye out for all of the other places where there are opportunities to significantly enhance the transaction journey with LLMs among other things.

Hill Vaden:

All right. Well, very good. This has been very interesting. And as Sam said, we could continue this conversation for a very long time to talk about Crux or to talk about your incredible biography, which seems to have all sorts of nooks and crannies to explore. But we can adjourn, and I really appreciate the time that you're spending with us, and I look forward to watching Crux go forward from here.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-01 11:04:35.777359

The highly anticipated Highlander EV is expected to debut as a 2027 model year vehicle, with production beginning next year.

This comes as part of Toyota’s broader electrification strategy to “load the bases,” as described by David Christ, Vice President of Toyota Motor North America. Over the next few months, the company plans to roll out a wave of new fully electric, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid vehicles across the U.S. market.

Highlander EV Production Shifted to Kentucky

Following the success of the RAV4, the Highlander and Grand Highlander remain among Toyota’s top-selling SUVs in the United States. However, sales have recently skewed in favor of the larger Grand Highlander. In response, Toyota announced earlier this month that it would consolidate electric vehicle production at its Kentucky plant. This strategic move is intended to free up capacity at its Princeton, Indiana, facility for increased Grand Highlander output.

Originally, Toyota planned to build a new electric SUV at its Indiana plant, but this model—expected to be the Highlander EV—will now be manufactured in Kentucky. The electric Highlander will be built alongside another three-row electric SUV, with both vehicles departing from Toyota’s current “bZ” naming convention.

Highlander EV to Debut by Late 2025

Industry insiders suggest the new Highlander EV could be revealed as early as the end of 2025, ahead of its official 2027 model year release. This model is part of a larger pipeline that includes seven new EVs Toyota aims to launch in the U.S. by mid-2027.

In a statement, Toyota confirmed, “We plan to produce two all-new, three-row battery electric SUVs in the U.S. Both vehicles will now be assembled at Toyota Kentucky.”

Expanded EV Lineup Underway

Toyota’s electrification roadmap also includes upgrades to its existing bZ electric SUV line. The new bZ model—replacing the bZ4X—is set to arrive later this year with an extended driving range and support for Tesla’s NACS charging standard.

In 2026, Toyota will follow up with the smaller all-electric C-HR and the bZ Woodland SUV. Both are expected to deliver improved performance and range, aiming to overcome the mixed reception of the original bZ4X.

A Strategic Leap Toward Electric Mobility

The announcement marks a significant pivot for Toyota, which has historically focused on hybrids. With the Highlander EV and a growing lineup of battery-electric vehicles, the company is reinforcing its long-term commitment to sustainable mobility.

The move positions Toyota to remain competitive in a U.S. market increasingly dominated by electric SUVs. It also underscores the automaker’s renewed emphasis on local manufacturing and adaptability to shifting consumer preferences.
