For residential solar, this figure includes customers with net metered solar energy systems and those participating in virtual net metering programs. For residential battery storage, this figure includes both solar-connected and non-solar-connected systems capable of supplying power to the grid. For both solar and batteries, data on the number of households with non-net metered solar and storage systems was not available, and as a result, these households are excluded from the data. This may exclude a significant number of residential energy storage systems.

Electric vehicles – The number of registered electric vehicles in 2024 is derived from Alliance for Automotive Innovation, Get Connected Electric Vehicle Quarterly Report, 4th Quarter, 2024, accessed at https://www.autosinnovate.org/posts/papers-reports/Get%20Connected%20EV%20Quarterly%20Report%202024%20Q4.pdf, September 22, 2025. The report does not provide a direct estimate of electric vehicle registrations but instead provides figures for the number of EV chargers and number of registered electric vehicles per charger, from which an estimate of the total number of registered electric vehicles was calculated.

Voluntary renewable electricity purchases – The number of electricity customers in each state engaging in voluntary purchases of renewable electricity is based on 2023 data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, downloaded in Microsoft Excel format from https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/renewable-power on July 23, 2025.

""The American auto industry frankly is in limbo, whether they're going to be able to continue to be competitive in the global market and even here at home,"" said Jesse Lee, a senior advisor at Climate Power.

The elimination of the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing EVs under the Trump administration's policies was cited as a setback for production.

Lee warned, ""If this doesn't get kind of turned around by Congress before Trump leaves office, you know in the next three years, you know you're gonna be looking at a place where it may never be possible to catch up.""

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reinstated the $7,500 tax credit, but it ended in September.

Marick Masters, a professor of business emeritus at Wayne State University, noted the challenges for companies to invest in EVs without policy incentives and mandates.

There are the obvious ones, the natural consequences of living adjacent to this abundant resource that so many notorious players seek to take advantage of — the environmental devastation posed by the Line 5 pipeline running underneath the Straits of Mackinac and the commodification of water by companies like Nestle circumventing the Great Lakes Compact, for example. But then there are the other problems — the obscured shortcuts and mistakes that are more indicative of the tenuous relationship between politicians and their constituents, between those with power and those without it. Infamously, we’ve seen this with the Flint Water Crisis over the past decade, where a switch in city water supply initially exposed more than 100,000 people to contaminated water and led to criminal charges being pressed against negligent state officials (but these were eventually dropped). Recently, though, tensions pertaining to water infrastructure and access are bubbling to the surface a little bit closer to home.

In Detroit, water justice is a pressing issue, but a neglected one. Residents across the city are experiencing perpetual flooding cycles that are directly connected to city water infrastructure, and tens of thousands are regularly unable to afford water services to their homes at all. It’s a complicated web, one in which the term “water crisis” doesn’t fully do justice to the variety of calamities unfolding. Despite this, a consistent through line remains: The city’s response and non-local media coverage have been lacking, keeping the crisis shrouded in an air of secrecy and away from sustainable avenues for change that truly address its root causes.

***

Over the past decade, access to safe and affordable water has increasingly become a luxury in Detroit. In 2014, one year after the City of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, the Detroit Water and Sewage Department shut off water services for more than 20,000 Detroit residents with unpaid water bills in an effort to pay off their own debts. Between 2014 and 2020, more than 141,000 Detroit residences had their water shut off at some point — a little more than 20% of the city’s current population. Shut-offs were paused for more than three years during the pandemic — a combination of a moratorium issued by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the City of Detroit’s extension — but in August 2023, the shut-off campaign resumed. The impact has been enormous, predominantly for low-income residents, leaving tens of thousands of households suddenly on the hook for $700 to $10,000 in water debt they cannot pay off, and with no access to running water in the meantime — a human rights violation, according to the United Nations.

In an email with The Michigan Daily, Monica Lewis-Patrick, We the People of Detroit CEO and president, contextualized the rationale driving these mass shutoff campaigns.

“Shutoffs have been used by water systems as a tool to manage debt rather than to support residents’ needs,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “These decisions have been driven by financial pressures tied to bond obligations, state oversight and austerity politics, which prioritize revenue collection over basic human needs. It’s deeply unjust that Detroiters, largely Black and low-income residents, are targeted to absorb the system’s financial strain while external customers are not paying their fair share.”

In addition to the increased financial pressures and practical consequences associated with one’s water being turned off, Lewis-Patrick emphasized the negative physical and emotional health impacts created by water shutoffs.

“A study by researchers at the Henry Ford Global Health Initiative found that residents living on blocks where water shutoffs occurred were 1.55 times more likely to be diagnosed with a water-associated illness,” Lewis-Patrick wrote.

All of this is coming at a time when water is becoming increasingly unaffordable for the average household. Across the United States, water bills are rising about 7% every year, and Detroit is not exempt from this pattern. The Great Lakes Water Authority placed a 10-year 4% cap on water rate increases, but this expired in June 2025, prompting a 7.73% proposed hike in Metro Detroit water rates for 2026. In relation to its suburbs, the city of Detroit is disproportionately feeling the impacts of this due to the 1999 Rate Settlement Agreement dubbed the “83/17 split,” which burdens Detroit residents with paying 83% of regional stormwater treatment infrastructure costs while its suburbs (with a 2021 median household income more than twice that of Detroit’s) only pay a collective 17%. With 34% of Detroit residents living below the poverty line, these inflated water bills are proving increasingly difficult to pay. In 2022, DWSD implemented the water affordability Lifeline Plan in an attempt to address these issues, but the funding has since mostly dried up, raising questions about the program’s efficacy moving forward.

“The underlying problem isn’t just the loss of one program,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “It’s the absence of a long-term, water affordability plan that ensures every household can maintain access regardless of income.”

The water issues plaguing Detroit aren’t limited to increasing rates and water shutoffs, too; there are also significant problems with the city’s water infrastructure that are directly impacting Detroit residents and going unaddressed. On July 19, 2024, a water main broke in northwest Detroit, near the corner of Biltmore and Gilchrist streets, flooding the basements of nearby residents like Diana Hill, Sabrina Moore and Tina Wixon, and causing thousands of dollars in damages.

“I’m still struggling to pay off the debt for all of the damages, and I still need stuff fixed,” Wixon said in an interview with The Daily.

All three described severe damageafter water seeped into their homes for more than 12 hours. The flood and its aftermath ruined appliances, destroyed family keepsakes and left black mold covering the floor.

“I had to replace my heating system because it was inoperable,” Moore said. “That furnace cost $9,000.”

Beyond the damage to their physical possessions, these women and their families have been experiencing different health issues since the floods began, citing asthma and other respiratory issues that have been exacerbated by the black mold in their homes. Part of the reason for concern is the water itself, Moore adds, describing how she has to run the water coming from her bathroom sink before using it because of how it smells.

“I’m starting to question that the water system is even safe for us to be consuming,” Moore said. “I believe our water is contaminated. Our water needs to be checked by an independent source.”

In response, the city and the DWSD have been unhelpful.

“The (DWSD) still refuses to give us any compensation. They refused to even help us,” Hill said. “I had to call the Red Cross, I called (the Federal Emergency Management Agency), and each one of them told me it wasn’t a disaster so they couldn’t help me. So I had to lose my emergency money.”

These three women were introduced to me by Beulah Walker, vice chief director of Hydrate Detroit, a Detroit-based water relief organization. And as the five of us met over Zoom to talk about the flooding, Walker described how July 19, 2024 is only one instance in a bigger pattern of Band-Aid solutions and neglect.

“This flooding has been going on for 10 years, ever since the bankruptcy,” Walker said. Hill nodded, elaborating to say that it’s happening all across the city, but “not every area is getting the same treatment.”

According to Hill, the claims the women filed were denied on the basis of the Michigan Governmental Liability for Negligence Act of 1964. Section 17 of this act makes the government not liable for damages resulting from the overflow of a sewage disposal system. But that’s not what happened on Gilchrist Street, Hill argues — it’s fresh water that they’ve seen filling up their basements.

“The interpretation of the rules — what (Hill) is reading — we might see it one way, but they have already interpreted it a whole different way,” Moore said. “We need to understand what is the verbiage really saying. We’re tired of people just lying to us.”

Frustration with the lack of institutional powers listening to what’s going on is a common theme across each of these three women’s experiences.

“We live here in this beautiful city of Detroit, raise our families, we are homeowners, we pay taxes. We should never have to deal with flooding in our homes due to a lack of services that are supposed to keep our city water system safe,” Moore said. “To me, it shows there’s a lack of respect for people — for human rights.”

At the end of our conversation, Hill, who is now in her 70s, tells me that she used to work for the University of Michigan — first in housekeeping and then in a lab on North Campus.

“These people have occupations,” Walker said, jumping in to add that Moore works in health care and Wixon works in quality control. “You know, when people are reading these stories, they go, ‘Oh these people don’t do nothing but just sit at home.’ You know how people think about Detroit residents: that we’re just lazy and don’t do shit.”

Hill, Moore and Wixon’s resilience in the face of these challenges, alongside the tenacious work of local water rights advocacy groups like Hydrate Detroit and We the People of Detroit, couldn’t be clearer in refuting the stereotypes Walker references. There is an abundance of grassroots movements taking shape in Detroit right now, from the informal neighborhood collective of Gilchrist Street to formal institutions taking a statewide approach like the People’s Water Board Coalition. The fight is far from over.

“We’re not giving up,” Moore said.

Like any good Michigander, I could talk at length about what’s happening in Flint or the evils posed to the Great Lakes by Nestle, but can I let you in on a secret? Even though I grew up in Royal Oak, a suburb about three miles north of Detroit, I had no idea of the extent to which Detroiters were facing similar water issues. The state of various water crises in Detroit was introduced to me for the first time only a few weeks ago when We the People of Detroit came to present in my Sociology 225 class. Hearing about the 83/17 split, I felt ashamed for not having paid closer attention to the structural injustices embedded in the communities around me. Now, though, the shock factor has worn off, and I’m angry. Tens of thousands of Detroit residents are regularly experiencing the effects of water injustice, whether it’s with uncompensated flooding damages as the result of poorly maintained DWSD infrastructure or water services being shut off to their home. This should not be a secret. Why aren’t more people talking about this?

What’s happening with water in Detroit is the type of crisis that should be making national headlines, but it’s not. Whether water should be commodified or considered a human right is a major topic of conversation across the U.S. and the world, but Detroit, with its majority-Black population, largely seems to be excluded from these dialogues. The city’s complicated web of water issues is being diligently covered by Metro Detroit news outlets such as the Detroit Free Press and Bridge Detroit, but by and large, the crisis is not getting the attention it deserves.

“It’s striking how many people still don’t know about the water crisis in Detroit, despite its inextricable connection to Flint and the broader fight for water justice,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “Too often, crises that predominantly impact Black and Brown people are underreported or framed as management failures instead of systemic injustices rooted in policy and disinvestment.”

In Flint — another city with a majority-Black population and a severe water crisis — national media coverage has slipped significantly despite lingering contaminated water and distrust towards the city’s institutions persisting even 10 years after the water supply was initially switched. Flint’s water crisis was quickly catapulted from a local story to an international one in early 2016 when a state of emergency was declared, but has since slipped back into being an exclusively local story, even though the crisis is far from over — public trust is damaged, physical and mental health issues are prevalent and residents still haven’t seen any money from the $626.25 million settlement fund (though checks are promised in November). This begs the question in Flint, Detroit and beyond: What does it take for people to keep their eyes on a crisis long enough to see its resolution through?

It’s easy to look at data chronicling Detroit’s recent population growth and the success of the city’s sports teams and agree with the flashy national headlines that argue for Detroit’s rebound: “Detroit is Cool Again,” a National Geographic article reads. I’m hesitant to fully follow this line of thinking, though, because, first of all, it implies a time when Detroit wasn’t a cultural hub. But, more importantly, proclamations that “Detroit’s so back,” seem to neglect the experiences of so many of the city’s residents who are still suffering the consequences of the bankruptcy and struggling to access clean and affordable water. We shouldn’t let these on-the-ground realities become secrets, obscured by powerful people incentivized to maintain a facade of an upward trend experienced equally across the city. If you’re reading this in Ann Arbor, thinking that living an hour west of Detroit makes you removed from the city’s problems, I can promise you that it does not. The way the University prides itself on being “Leaders and the Best” sometimes facilitates an elitist sense of disconnect from the communities around it, as if U-M students are meant to remain posed in this ivory tower, looking down at these experiences of inequality beneath us. In reality, the University alone does not represent all of the “best” the state of Michigan has to offer, but it is an integral player, just like Detroit is. It is our responsibility to be using the power of the University’s resources and, equally as important, the power of our attention, to engage with the state of Michigan community in meaningful ways — and most immediately, to give the Detroit Water Crisis the spotlight it deserves.

Texas is poised to make the largest investment in its water supply in the state’s 180-year history after voters on Tuesday approved Proposition 4, which authorizes $20 billion to be spent on water projects over the next two decades.

The vote comes at a time when communities are scrambling to find new water supplies to meet the needs of their growing population, all the while deteriorating infrastructure, and a warming climate threatens the state’s water supply.

Throughout Texas’ history, ensuring water supply has rarely been a partisan issue. Many see it as a precious resource essential to both survival and the prosperity of the state’s economy. However, this year proved that water is personal and deeply emotional too. Proposed reservoirs and groundwater exports in East Texas have outraged many in the water-rich region, desalination projects along the Coastal Bend region have sparked political debate amid a water crisis, and data centers expanding across arid West Texas have locals worried about their dwindling groundwater supply.

These challenges and others pushed lawmakers to make big investments in water at the Capitol this year.

“Prop 4 is the culmination of almost 30 years of bipartisan work to create reliable and predictable funding for Texas water,” said Sarah Rountree Schlessinger, CEO of Texas Water Foundation, a nonprofit that educates Texans on water issues.

“We are thrilled that Texans showed up, asked deep questions, and that they chose to prioritize water infrastructure needs across the state. That tells you a lot about the state of Texas water.”

A portion of existing state sales tax revenue — up to $1 billion annually — would be deposited into the Texas Water Fund each year, starting in 2027 to help fund water, wastewater and flood infrastructure projects.

The funding comes from existing revenue, meaning no new taxes would be created. However, the money would only be transferred to the fund when sales tax collections exceed $46.5 billion in a given year. The past two fiscal years have surpassed that amount. Assuming the state’s growth continues, there will be enough money available to dedicate the $1 billion to the fund.

The $20 billion is far short of what the state needs to maintain its water infrastructure. According to one estimate, Texas communities need nearly $154 billion over the next 50 years for projects. Both rural and urban communities will be able to tap the fund to address their existing infrastructure needs.

“Today’s vote shows that Texans across the political spectrum understand the stakes and are ready to invest in solutions that will protect our water for generations,” said Jennifer Walker, a special adviser to the National Wildlife Federation Action Fund.

“Investing in our water infrastructure now means fewer leaks, safer drinking water, conservation of natural resources, and a stronger economy that can support families and communities for decades.”

The money will be managed by the Texas Water Development Board, the state agency that oversees the state’s water supply. Funding would be divided into two categories: water supply projects, and other existing water programs.

Water supply projects would expand the overall volume of water available in Texas. Projects that could be paid for include desalination, which cleans salty water for drinking and agricultural use, fixing leaking pipes, water reuse, which includes treating wastewater and produced water from the oil and gas industry, conservation strategies and constructing permitted reservoirs. Existing water programs include improving flood control infrastructure and flood mitigation, ensuring clean drinking water, and agricultural water conservation.

While oil and gas, and big statewide water groups in Texas supported the proposition, some environmental groups were concerned that certain projects, like reservoirs, will be prioritized as a form of new water supply and take the land of farmers and residents who live in areas where they plan to be built.

Other organizations feared it will help fund mega projects like desalination, which they believe will help industry expansion in their communities, and that local communities will be cut out of water decisions. Some conservative groups argued that spending should not be written into the Texas Constitution.

The proposition does not greenlight projects, but rather provides a way to finance projects. Any particular project that receives funds from the Water Development Board will go through a regular application process. The Texas Water Foundation said that the proposition prohibits the use of the New Water Supply Fund for the transfer of groundwater.

The fund also comes with some oversight. Lawmakers have created a special committee to oversee the water board’s administration of the funding. The water board will be required to report on how the money is being distributed and the impact they are having in meeting state needs and the public will have a chance to give input.

“Dedicated funding is the most important tool available to address the looming water challenges and rising costs for ratepayers across the state,” said Stacey Allison Steinbach, Texas Water Association’s Executive Director.

Even if all current commitments are fully implemented, global temperatures would still rise by 2.3-2.5°C, well above the 1.5-2°C targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Under the Trump administration, the US has retracted several pollution controls and climate policies, which could add up to 0.1 degree Celsius to future global warming projections.

The Details: The UN’s Emissions Gap Report 2025 highlights a widening gap between national climate pledges and actual policies, projecting that current measures would result in roughly 2.8°C of warming by the end of the century. Even if all current commitments are fully implemented, global temperatures would still rise by 2.3-2.5°C, well above the 1.5-2°C targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said that “this will be difficult to reverse – requiring faster and bigger additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to minimize overshoot.” While the UNEP reported some progress–the world was previously on track for a 4°C rise–CO2 emissions continued to increase 2.3% in 2024 to 57.7 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent.

For Context: Among the highest CO2 emitters are China, the US, India and the European Union. China pledged to cut emissions by 7-10% from their peak by 2035. Under the Trump administration, the US has retracted several pollution controls and climate policies, which could add up to 0.1 degree Celsius to future global warming projections. The European Union is reportedly attempting to align at least 15 of its 27 nations’ targets ahead of the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. In 2022, the UN climate change panel issued a report, arguing that unchecked global warming presents ""a threat to human well-being and planetary health.""

How the Media Covered It: The Washington Times (Lean Right bias) and New York Times (Lean Left) both highlighted the slight progress reported, but that overall efforts fell short. Breitbart (Right) noted 300 mayors pledged coordinated climate action ahead of the Brazil summit. Reuters (Center) emphasized the world's failure to meet the main climate change target, and quoted a UNEP lead report author who said, “we can no longer totally avoid it.” CNN (Lean Left) and Bloomberg (Lean Left) both highlighted the role of individual countries, noting the UNEP’s argument that “countries’ slow action” have led to the increase, and that “none of the roughly 60 countries” heading to the summit “have submitted an updated climate pledge.”",https://www.allsides.com/images/meta-images/allsides-logo-open-graph.png,N,,2025-11-04 22:18:05.673660

That just changed. Wake Forest University School of Medicine’s Charlotte campus welcomed its first class in July 2025. The medical school is just one component of The Pearl, a $1.5 billion development that will transform health care and be a catalyst for the city’s continued economic growth and diversification.

Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR), an S&P 500 REIT focused on the secular megatrend of a large and growing aging population, provided the capital for The Pearl and jointly owns the project with its partners Advocate Health, the third-largest nonprofit integrated health system in the U.S., and Wexford Science & Technology, LLC, a private real estate company that partners with universities, research centers, and academic medical centers to create mixed-use “Knowledge Communities.” Alongside its partners, the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, Ventas broke ground on the project in December 2022. The grand opening of The Pearl occurred in June 2025 and marked the completion of the first 700,000 square feet of a multi-phased project potentially encompassing 3.5 million square feet.

“Our investment focus is on the longevity economy,” says Debra A. Cafaro, chairman and CEO of Ventas. “Ventas is a leader at the intersection of medicine, research, and universities, and we partner with first class companies. The Pearl fits squarely in that intersection.”

“We had tremendous local and institutional commitment to The Pearl,” Cafaro says. “Charlotte is a growing city known for its financial services economy and its leaders want to build on that with better health care and a diversified economy.”

The Pearl is the largest public-private partnership in the history of Charlotte, according to Collin Lane, senior vice president of facilities for Advocate Health, and it will bring significant benefits to the city and its residents. The Pearl is anticipated to generate 5,500 jobs on site and more than 11,500 jobs total in the region over the next 15 years, according to city officials.

About the grand opening of The Pearl, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said, “As The Pearl opens its doors, it’s not only a symbol of Charlotte’s ambitions — it’s proof that those ambitions are becoming reality.” She added, “Whether you’re a student, a job seeker, an entrepreneur, a health care professional, or simply proud to call Charlotte home, now is an exciting time to watch our city rise as a life sciences powerhouse.”

The Pearl came together quickly for a project of its size, according to Cafaro, taking three to five years from start to finish.

“For our investors, this has been a jewel of a project since the beginning because all the necessary ingredients were in place, including pre-leasing,” Cafaro says. “The high-end tenants The Pearl has attracted are interested in synergistic interactions—they want to be together in an exceptional space. When you have institutional investment, financial support, experienced partners, and you’re fulfilling a need in the community with a project like this, it dramatically increases the likelihood of success.”

The Pearl’s signature Howard R. Levine Center for Education was 100% preleased, with the entire project, including a state-of-the-art research tower, 905 Pearl Park Way, now more than 80% leased.

Another partner that helped streamline development of The Pearl was Duke Energy, says Ted Russell, president, CEO, and CFO of Wexford. The Pearl is built in a historic neighborhood and Duke Energy worked to bring in the power lines, utilities, and high-speed transmission lines that were needed for the new buildings. They also agreed to bury a lot of the lines and helped in a variety of ways during the entire project, he adds.

Paying Homage to a Community

The Pearl, located in the historic Brooklyn neighborhood of midtown Charlotte, incorporates the community history throughout the development with murals and signs. The neighborhood was predominantly Black residents, but much of its population was displaced during the 1950s through the 1970s due to urban renewal projects and highway construction.

“The community has been very supportive of The Pearl, in part because the development team engaged local residents throughout the planning stages,” Russell says. “In partnership with Advocate Health, we created the ‘Purposeful Walk’ which explains the history of the neighborhood with interactive signs. The Pearl and its open-air plaza called Jacob’s Ladder will also be open to community events.”

Russell says that local residents wanted to feel included in the economic development generated by The Pearl as well as have building access. “Many of the training opportunities and jobs that are generated are available to people without a four-year degree, which makes this project valuable to everyone,” he notes. “The leadership in Charlotte had the strategic vision to diversify the economy so it’s not dependent on the financial services industry. They view growing the academic, health care, and life sciences research fields as essential to growing the Charlotte economy.""

Innovative Research and Training Facilities

Wexford has developed nearly two dozen “Knowledge Communities” or “Innovation Districts” that link research universities with entrepreneurs and technology companies to create economic development in their cities and regions.

“We worked with Atrium Health [now part of Advocate Health] on their Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston Salem, when Advocate Health’s CEO Gene Woods reached out to us because he wanted to close the gap on health care outcomes,” Russell says.

“At The Pearl and other Knowledge Communities, we bring together primary health care providers, life science researchers, and tech-based companies to leverage the strength of the universities themselves. Those institutions serve as magnetic anchors to attract collaborations with private companies and entrepreneurs,” he adds.

Among the most prestigious tenants at The Pearl is IRCAD North America. “IRCAD is the premium global surgical training center, and this is their first U.S. license,” Russell says. About 8,000 surgeons are expected to come annually for two to five-day programs centered on the latest techniques and devices in cardiovascular, neuro, and orthopedic surgery as well as other types of surgery.

In addition to IRCAD, Siemens is opening a 60,000-square-foot Siemens Healthineers Experience Center USA at The Pearl, which features the latest technologies in imaging, diagnostics, cancer care, and advanced therapies in order to demonstrate them to health care professionals from around the world.

There is also 35,000 square feet of Connect Labs by Wexford scheduled to open in November 2025, comprised of small suites and labs for medical, tech, and life science entrepreneurs, Russell says. “They can interact with physicians in the Advocate Health buildings and with other entrepreneurs. There will be intentional programming with private industry in the field and opportunities for informal interaction,” he notes.

The location of The Pearl was driven in part by Advocate Health’s flagship hospital, Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte.

“Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center is one of the largest hospitals in the Southeastern U.S.,” says Lane. It’s the region’s only Level 1 trauma center and provides cancer treatment, transplants, a children’s hospital, and is one of the largest neuroscience centers. “This hospital brings together a high density of super-sub specialists in Charlotte, which is part of why organizations like Siemens and IRCAD are drawn here,” he adds.

Patients and medical professionals come from areas throughout the Southeast for care and training, since the Carolinas Medical Center is the only provider of some specialized treatments between Atlanta and Washington, D.C., Lane points out.

The architecture of The Pearl, meanwhile, contributes to collaboration, according to Lane. “The buildings are deliberately not siloed because we think it’s a value proposition to have undergraduates, faculty members, and researchers work adjacent to each other and alongside a training platform,” he says.

Investing in a Pipeline of Trained Professionals

The Wake Forest University School of Medicine location at The Pearl is just one part of a systematic plan to generate more highly qualified health care providers in Charlotte.

“When Wake Forest announced their intention to build a second medical school in Charlotte, there was an immediate reaction that other people in the health care industry wanted to locate nearby,” Lane says. “There are hundreds of companies in the area who could find synergies with medical researchers and other professionals.”

Advocate Health has academic relationships with numerous colleges and universities, not just Wake Forest, with the premise that multiple avenues can create a talent pipeline for health care providers. The Carolinas College of Health Sciences, co-located with the Wake Forest University School for Professional Services, is owned by Advocate Health.

“Advocate Health has also partnered with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to create a STEM program for fifth to eighth graders to bring students on field trips and engage them in other ways so they can envision themselves in various health care roles,” Lane says. “There’s an early college program from ninth grade on for students to start taking classes to prepare for a health care career.”

Creating that pipeline of talent will also attract people in other related industries to Charlotte, Lane says. In turn, the programs can be tailored to meet their needs for future employees, he says.",https://www.reit.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/media-images/triggsphoto_wexford_pearl_5web.jpg?itok=WkLXL8bw,N,,2025-11-04 22:57:33.918683

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has already approved 300 MW to be installed at Sherco. Xcel’s proposal would increase that capacity to 600 MW, making it the largest battery storage site in the upper Midwest, according to the utility. It would also add another 135.5 MW at the company’s Blue Lake facility and expand the company’s Sherco Solar facility with an additional 200-MW array.

Xcel plans to start construction on the battery storage projects in 2026, and bring them online in late 2027. The projects will use lithium iron phosphate battery cell technology that “discharge energy in four-hour increments and are quick to recharge, allowing for regular use,” the utility said in a statement.

Xcel said it plans to reuse existing grid connections for the batteries to store energy produced by wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas facilities across its system.

“Batteries help us store energy when it’s inexpensive to produce and dispatch it when needed, allowing us to continue delivering reliable electricity to customers while keeping bills low,” Shea said.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and another 710 are being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it will close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The banking industry is urging the Treasury Department to limit stablecoin rewards payments under the GENIUS Act.

In a letter Tuesday, the American Bankers Association (ABA) and state bankers associations from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico called for the agency to “broadly interpret” the law’s prohibition on interest.

The Treasury Department put out an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in September, seeking input on implementation of various provisions of the stablecoin measure, including “prohibitions on certain issuances.”

The banking associations argue that a broad interpretation of the law reflects “Congress’ intent for payment stablecoins to be used for transactions and not as investment vehicles.”

“But while Congress’s intent is clear, digital asset platforms today offer incentives to attract users to hold payment stablecoins including, high-yield rewards, token bonuses, and promotional payouts, asserting the ban on interest does not apply beyond stablecoin issuers,” the letter reads.

They also warn that allowing such rewards could draw deposits away from banks, placing strain on community banks in particular.

However, the crypto industry has pushed back on these arguments, contending that the banks are trying to block new competition and are overstating the impacts of deposit outflows.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 21:18:31.109709

AUSTIN — Governor Greg Abbott celebrated Texas being named America’s Top Business Climate for the third year in a row by Site Selection magazine.

“Texas once again emerges as the national champion for the top business climate in America,” said Governor Abbott. “As the eighth-largest economy in the world, Texas offers the freedom and opportunity for companies of all sizes and all industries to thrive. Coupled with the pro-growth, pro-business laws I signed this year, Texas improved the process of doing business to help them succeed in our great state. We will continue to make strategic investments and partner with job-creating businesses to ensure that Texas remains the top state in the nation to do business.”

Driving Texas’ top ranking is a powerful combination of factors: the number of job-creating corporate relocation and expansion projects, a pro-growth mindset and environment where enterprise can flourish, investments in workforce development and infrastructure, access to technology and tech talent, and a predictable regulatory landscape.

Another key measure contributing to Site Selection magazine’s Top Business Climate ranking is a survey of corporate real estate executives and site selectors—for which Texas earned top marks, beating out all other states.

Earlier this year, Governor Abbott accepted Site Selection magazine’s Governor’s Cup for a record-shattering 13th consecutive win for Texas as the nation’s top-performing state for job-creating business relocations and expansions. Texas also won the 2025 Prosperity Cup from Site Selection magazine, which recognizes the top state in the U.S. for attracting new business investments.

S&P Global Mobility analysts expect slower EV sales to contribute to “muted growth” in the new-vehicle market through the rest of the year.","The numbers are in—and they show that the EV market has officially started a new chapter.

Battery-electric vehicles made up just over 5% of new-vehicle retail sales in October, according to JD Power and GlobalData. That’s down more than half from September’s all-time high of nearly 13%.

The drop-off comes after the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for EVs of up to $7,500, thanks to President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill. Industry analysts and executives predicted EV sales would fall as soon as the credits went away, and October’s sales numbers back them up.

Ford’s EV sales fell by nearly 25% YoY, while the automaker’s internal combustion engine vehicle sales grew 3.4% and its overall sales rose 1.6%.

Kia’s sales ticked up slightly in October. While the brand’s electrified vehicle sales (which include hybrids) grew by 16%, some all-electric models, including the EV6 and EV9, had lower sales.

Sister brand Hyundai reported a 2% YoY sales decline in October. Sales of the all-electric Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 models were down.

“Hybrid vehicles led the way in October with a 41% increase, and electrified sales were up 8%,” Randy Parker, Hyundai Motor North America’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “We saw strong EV demand leading up to the expiration of federal tax credits, and while that shift has temporarily disrupted the market, we’re confident it will reset.”

Honda’s sales inched up 0.7% YoY. The Honda brand’s electrified vehicle sales (including hybrids) set a new record for the month and made up nearly one-third of brand sales, though sales of its all-electric Prologue model dropped 80% from September.

Slowdown: EV sales surged in the months leading up to the credit’s expiration, boosting the new-vehicle market.

In an analysis released before industry sales reports, data provider Urban Science reported that industry sales were down as of October 25, “driven mainly by a 43% decline in battery and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles.”

Tom Kondrat, global lead for advanced analytics at Urban Science, said he expects BEV sales “to remain behind last year’s pace through Q4 and into the early part of next year” before picking up in the spring.

S&P Global Mobility analysts expect slower EV sales to contribute to “muted growth” in the new-vehicle market through the rest of the year.

New era: Hybrids’ market share climbed two percentage points in October to 14.2%, according to JD Power and GlobalData.

“While hybrid growth is encouraging, the recent EV market correction underscores a critical lesson: consumers prefer having access to a range of powertrain options that deliver comparable value,” Tyson Jominy, SVP of data and analytics at JD Power, said in a statement. “A singular focus on any one technology—be it EVs or hybrids—risks repeating past missteps. A diversified strategy that embraces multiple powertrain solutions will be essential to meeting evolving consumer preferences.”

Jessica Caldwell, AVP of insights for Edmunds, wrote in a blog post that “October mark[ed] the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.”

And interest remains: According to Edmunds’ data, EV buyer consideration saw only a “modest” dip, from 12.7% in September to 9% in October. Going forward, Caldwell said, the EV market will be driven less by incentives and more by considerations like model variety and ownership costs.

“The ‘reset era’ will reveal which brands and retailers can make EV ownership feel not just aspirational but practical and within reach for the next wave of buyers,” she said.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-11-05 00:18:36.022958

“Repealing the GHGRP would undermine decades of progress to ensure the EPA is collecting and publicly disclosing data to effectively address climate change and ensure American global competitiveness,” the Members wrote. “We urge EPA to preserve and strengthen the GHGRP knowing the important role it plays to protect hardworking American families and the value it has for businesses and investors.”

Since 2010, the GHGRP has collected and tracked vital greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases from over 8,000 sites, including landfills, power plants, and oil refineries. This rollback by the Trump Administration will strip valuable data and science needed to combat climate change, inform families of the environmental threats in their community, and eliminate good-paying jobs.

The Members continued: “It is our responsibility to protect public health, preserve our environment, and strengthen the economy of our country and our communities. The Trump Administration’s proposed rollback of GHGRP would set our country back decades and expose American families to the harmful environmental, health, and economic impacts of climate change. We demand that the EPA withdraw its proposal and strengthen and maintain a transparent and comprehensive reporting program.”

A full copy of the letter can be found here.

Background:

On September 16, 2025, the Trump EPA announced the rollback of the GHGRP.

For decades, the GHGRP has provided up-to-date information that EPA needs to fulfill its mission of protecting human health and the environment. The GHGRP requires reporting of GHG data and other relevant information from large GHG emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites across the United States. This data is an invaluable resource that is relied on by federal agencies, state and local governments, businesses, the financial industry, and community-based organizations.

Congresswoman Rivas’ letter was co-signed by Representatives Yassamin Ansari (AZ-03), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Julia Brownley (CA-26), André Carson (IN-07), Troy Carter (LA-02), Kathy Castor (FL-14), Yvette Clarke (NY-09), Diana DeGette (CO-01), Pablo Hernandez Rivera (PR-AL), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Sara Jacobs (CA-51), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Raja Krishnamoorthi (IL-08), John Larson (CT-01), Stephen Lynch (MA-08), Doris Matsui (CA-07), Dave Min (CA-47), Jennifer McClellan (VA-04), Seth Moulton (MA-06), Kevin Mullin (CA-15), Jerry Nadler (NY-10), Scott Peters (CA-50), Mike Quigley (IL-05), Raul Ruíz (CA-25), Jan Schakowsky (IL-09), Bobby Scott (VA-03), Darren Soto (FL-09), Paul Tonko (NY-20), and Nydia Velázquez (NY-07).

But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.
And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States' withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.
Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.
Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.","All nations of the world had homework this year: submit new-and-improved plans to fight climate change. But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States' withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three-tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration's policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, the U.N. Environment Program's Emissions Gap report said Tuesday.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,″ said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. ”It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise. ″

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 C (2.7 F) since the mid-1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 C (4.1 to 4.5 F), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 C (5 F) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 C (3.1 F) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.

“We are making progress,'' UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. ""We have to go faster.""

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

UNEP said the U.S. did not provide comments on the report by their deadline and asked for emissions data about the U.S. to be removed. The UNEP declined but included a footnote at the U.S. request, saying that it doesn’t support the report.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year, the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/04/PDTN/87092983007-ap-25307773257233.jpg?crop=5390,3034,x3,y468&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-04 18:18:26.455190

Including Rivian.

As we meander into this electric automotive world, it’s apparent that they are more expensive to make. and therefore, more expensive to sell.

While a select few companies have been able to make affordable yet adept electric cars this year, bringing the entry barrier down, some luxury brands haven’t been able to match that trend.

However, it looks like Rivian has decided enough is enough, and to avoid being priced out, a new affordable 4×4 is on the way.

Rivian CFO says no EV tax credits have sparked a new mass-market car coming in 2026

The end of the EV tax credit in America has already left some companies scrambling.

While sales rocketed in June, now they’re in freefall, and it comes as no coincidence.

At least in the eyes of Rivian, as Chief Finance Officer, Claire McDonough revealed plans for a cheaper EV in retaliation.

“One of our core strategies and approaches to offset some of the impacts of the elimination of some of the credits for consumers is to bring a product to market that opens up the addressable market of consumers that can now say yes to a Rivian,” she said.

“It meant that we needed to reduce our costs in our vehicle roadmap.

“And the key strategy for us is to bring to market a more mass-market-priced product, which is coming out next year.”

As to what this car will be, well, it’s only speculation, but Rivian officials have stated that they intend to stay away from other genres like sports cars, so another EV truck is likely.

Why the EV tax credit ending is having such an impact

With experts predicting a sharp fall-off in new electric car purchases, some brands like Ford and GM have extended an olive branch to buyers by offering their own discounts for three months.

Others have built an olive tree and made their own five-year tax credit lines.

But others haven’t been able to afford that, and it’s having a knock-on effect amid the possible insurgency of Chinese EVs.

Tesla has already released a ‘Standard’ Model 3 and Model Y, and now Rivian is following suit.

What this means is that brands are looking to make more affordable cars, but at the expense of some of the gadgets you might be used to.

The administration’s FY26 budget delivered $2 million to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for the construction and building trades in Massachusetts and also expand registered apprenticeship to more industries.
In addition, the Healey-Driscoll Administration enacted legislation to expand eligibility for the Registered Apprenticeship Tax Credit, which offers employers a $4,800 credit for each apprentice hired.
“Interest in registered apprenticeship is growing fast and our GROW grants are helping employers meet this need,” said Undersecretary of Labor Josh Cutler.
The GROW Grant will provide critical resources to strengthen these programs, expand access to Registered Apprenticeship pathways, enhance hands-on-learning, and build stronger partnerships with employers.","LOWELL — The Healey-Driscoll Administration today announced $2.1 million in Grants for Registered Apprenticeship Opportunities in Workforce (GROW) to 34 organizations to train and place more than 300 apprentices and pre-apprentices across the state. The grants, which include contract renewals and new awards, leverage nearly $2 million in state funding complemented by support from federal funds to train apprentices in high growth industries like health care, manufacturing, clean energy, and life sciences.

Registered Apprenticeship provides individuals with paid work experience including classroom instruction and on-the-job training combined with securing nationally recognized credentials, progressive wage increases, and economic mobility and advancement.

Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Lauren Jones made the announcement at Middlesex Community College in Lowell, Massachusetts. Among grantees, Middlesex Community College received $125,000 to launch a Surgical Technology registered apprenticeship program.

“The GROW grants are an effective way to expand Registered Apprenticeship opportunities that connect people to good jobs and help build a skilled workforce,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Through these investments, our administration is helping more residents access pathways into growing industries while supporting employers who are ready to train and hire.”

“These GROW grants strengthen local and regional partnerships that help employers build a skilled workforce specific to their needs,” said Lt. Governor Kim Driscoll. “By supporting registered apprenticeship programs in industries like health care, advanced manufacturing, early education, and IT, we’re creating more opportunities for Massachusetts residents to earn, learn, and advance their careers.”

The Division of Apprentice Standards (DAS) within the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD) administers the Commonwealth’s Registered Apprenticeship Programs. DAS serves more than 500 active programs with more than 10,000 active apprentices. Construction and building trades apprenticeships comprise the majority of programs with nearly a quarter of registered apprentices represented by expansion industries such as health care, education and manufacturing.

“Expanding and growing Registered Apprenticeship in the Massachusetts is an important part of our workforce agenda,” said Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Lauren Jones. “The GROW awards are part of the administration’s efforts to build workforce pipelines in our in-demand industries while increasing access and opportunity for our residents to pursue a career, gain industry-recognized credentials, and secure meaningful wages and benefits.”

The Healey-Driscoll Administration is committed to expanding apprenticeship. The administration’s FY26 budget delivered $2 million to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for the construction and building trades in Massachusetts and also expand registered apprenticeship to more industries. In addition, the Healey-Driscoll Administration enacted legislation to expand eligibility for the Registered Apprenticeship Tax Credit, which offers employers a $4,800 credit for each apprentice hired.

“Interest in registered apprenticeship is growing fast and our GROW grants are helping employers meet this need,” said Undersecretary of Labor Josh Cutler. “Whether it’s a career in the building trades, health care, IT, manufacturing, clean energy, or education, there’s a registered apprenticeship program for that. We look forward to working with all partners to support even more apprenticeship opportunities.”

“We are so excited to work with this group of thirty-four sponsors across the Commonwealth who see the immense potential of Registered Apprenticeship to support their workforce development needs,” said Director of the Division of Apprentice Standards Lara Thomas. “Apprenticeship changes lives, and we are honored to be able to provide this support and partner with these employers.”

A ""squirrel"" earned its acorns as the device was used by an Indiana Michigan Power linesman to show what happens when the pesky rodents short out a transformer that makes customers lose power. The result was a jarring boom that resounded throughout the coliseum's Expo Center.

At REMC's display, two students competed by using 15-foot insulated poles while wearing insulated gloves to touch an area on a simulated power pole, which stopped a timer.

""We're giving them a little bit of an experience of what it's like to be a lineman, like a storm restoration or a power outage,"" Chris Todd, director of marketing and communications for Northeastern REMC, based in Whitley County.

It gives the students an inside look and appreciation of what it's like for linemen to work on weekends and evenings when a power outage occurs.

Jhon Estevez, a design tech in engineering at Indiana Michigan Power, said he wanted to show students that I&M has more jobs than just lineman.

""When you think about a power company, you think electricity, that's all you're gonna do,"" he said. ""But there's people in the background who actually have to design stuff, and never ever come into contact with electricity.""

Estevez said he came to the company as a mechanical engineer with no degrees dealing with electricity.

Whether is was games with robotic ""dogs,"" seeing a pig ultrasound, or getting their hair braided, each table had something to get students' interest sparked in a career. Bowen Health had students don dark glasses and try to negotiate a path lined with plastic cones with a walker at the dementia empathy obstacle course.

At SDI's booth, students donned virtual reality headsets.

""Mostly they're seeing our melt shop,"" said Robb Stiver, rebar supervisor for SDI's Columbia City location. ""the demonstration where we take the electrical sticks and melt down the steel, 3,000 degrees.""

Columbia City makes flat-rolled steel. The Fort Wayne-based company also makes rebar, rails and many other products.

The third-quarter adjusted loss was 65 cents a share, the company said in a letter to shareholders. That’s better than the 71-cent average deficit expected by analysts. Rivian slashed automotive cost of revenue by nearly $19,000 on a per-vehicle basis year over year, according to the letter.

Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe is pushing to control expenses and corral years of losses as it prepares to launch a new midsized R2 SUV next year. The model is critical for Rivian’s goal to boost sales volumes and achieve profitability in the future. Rivian said it’s on track for R2 deliveries in the first half of 2026.

The company also said it set up a new company this month called Mind Robotics, focused on the advancement of AI-enabled robotics in industrial applications. The new venture secured about $110 million in external seed capital.

Rivan had already trimmed its vehicle-sales outlook twice this year and warned of mounting losses. The company has also seen higher costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs while the elimination of policies supporting EV adoption have hurt revenue.

“While we face near-term uncertainty from trade, tariffs and regulatory policy, we remain focused on long-term growth and value creation,” the company said in the letter.

The electric vehicle maker expects its third-quarter delivery performance to be its best of the year.

Rivian posted third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

Rivian Automotive posted revenue that narrowly topped analysts' expectations, after expiring electric-vehicle tax credits helped boost sales.

The company's revenue hit $1.56 billion for the September quarter, narrowly beating the $1.51 billion expected by analysts. That also marked a 78% increase relative to a year before.

Rivian (RIVN) said its software and services division brought in $416 million revenue, a 324% increase compared to a year earlier, primarily reflecting contributions from services that the company didn't perform in the year-prior period.

Automotive revenue came in at $1.14 million, above estimates that called for $1.08 billion. That was driven by the sale of 13,201 electric trucks and SUVs for the September quarter, a number the company reported a month ago. At the time, that figure came in below analysts' expectations, but Rivian noted Tuesday that the third quarter's delivery performance will likely be the strongest of the year.

Rivian shares fell by more than 5% on Tuesday before the market closed, but rose by almost 4% in the extended session after earnings were reported.

Sales are expected to slow across the EV industry in the current quarter, after consumers pulled ahead their purchases to take advantage of tax credits that expired in September. Rivian, which makes vehicles that start at more than $70,000, is expected to sell about 10,000 EVs next quarter, down from the more than 14,000 it delivered a year earlier.

The company maintained its full-year sales guidance of between 41,500 and 43,500 EVs, which it announced in August. Initially, Rivian had expected deliveries of between 40,000 and 46,000 units. Last year, it sold close to 52,000 vehicles.

But Rivian expects its sales performance to improve next year with the launch of the R2, a more mass-market friendly mid-size crossover that's expected to start at $45,000. The company said Tuesday that deliveries are on track to begin in the first half of next year.

""In Q3, we continued to make significant progress across our strategic priorities which includes R2 and our technology roadmap,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. ""Over the long term, we believe the automotive industry will be fully electric, autonomous and software-defined.""

Rivian generated a positive gross profit in the September quarter after failing to do so in the June quarter.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.
GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.
Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.
“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant and another 710 being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announce layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 17:18:40.814328

“The global economic activity generated by decarbonization is one of the greatest opportunities of this century. Canada’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy, announced by the federal government today, is a good first step toward ensuring Canada can succeed in this context. If Canada aims to double non-U.S. exports over the next decade, it will be critical to increase trade with Europe, Asia, and the Americas—all of which continue to take strong action to accelerate the shift to renewables, electric vehicles, and other low-carbon electric technologies.

“The budget proposes actions and delivery timelines to bolster Canada’s climate competitiveness—especially on core policies such as industrial carbon pricing, stronger methane regulations, sustainable investment guidelines, and tax credits for expanding clean electricity. We look forward to working with the federal government to ensure these essential policies result in more abundant and affordable energy, attract new investment to Canadian industries, support more well-paying jobs and economic growth across the country, and help make communities more secure and resilient.

“Swift implementation of climate competitiveness priorities will define how Canada succeeds or fails. In the absence of some remaining details, policy uncertainty persists, undermining Canadian firms’ ability to attract investment.”

KEY POLICY DETAILS

For the last six months, the Climate Institute has emphasized the importance of several climate and competitiveness priorities. This budget addresses each of them, with varying levels of detail:

Industrial carbon pricing:

Modernizing industrial carbon pricing remains one of the most important things the federal government can do to reduce emissions while keeping costs low for businesses and having virtually no impact on the cost of living. Doing so requires fixing problems with provincial carbon credit markets, and creating certainty around carbon markets beyond 2030 so that businesses can make big investments in low-carbon projects.

Critically, Budget 2025 makes a clear commitment to bring more certainty to industrial carbon pricing. It commits to fixing the federal benchmark (which defines minimum standards for provincial systems), improving the federal backstop (which will be decisively applied in jurisdictions that do not meet the benchmark), and developing a long-term price trajectory. The details and specifics of these changes will make or break this policy’s effectiveness, both for the climate and competitiveness. We look forward to contributing to the government’s efforts to improve this critical policy tool.

Methane regulations for oil and gas:

We support the government’s commitment to finalize enhanced rules to reduce methane emissions for the oil and gas sector. Oil and gas emissions remain a barrier to Canada’s overall climate progress and make up nearly a third of the country’s greenhouse gases. Stronger rules to reduce methane pollution would build on an impressive record of success in provinces like B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan, and create new opportunities for Canadian companies that have been leaders in commercializing technologies to manage methane. And methane represents some of the lowest-cost emissions reductions available.

Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit:

Budget 2025 explicitly recognizes the importance of dramatically increasing investment into Canada’s electricity system, and commits to introduce legislation soon implementing the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit to support provinces in upgrading and expanding their electricity grids, as well as enhancements to existing tax credits. We also support the decision to maintain the federal Clean Electricity Regulations, which will help accelerate the transition to clean, reliable power. Low-carbon electricity is already a major Canadian competitive advantage, and making sure electricity remains abundant and affordable will be essential for future competitiveness as demand continues to grow.

Climate Investment Taxonomy:

Importantly, the Budget recommits Canada to finalizing anational climate investment taxonomy (referred to as “Made-in Canada Sustainable Investment Guildelines”) for the financial sector by the end of 2026. The voluntary guidelines will provide much-need criteria to help investors evaluate material risks and opportunities from transition. Budget 2025 also notes the government’s intention to explore a Sustainable Bond Framework in support of issuing both green and transition bonds to be aligned with a Canadian taxonomy, further mobilizing investment to support the transition.

Electric Vehicle Availability Standard:

While Budget 2025 notes that the national Electric Vehicle Availability Standard is currently under review, we urge the federal government to maintain the core elements of the policy, to help increase Canadians’ access to high-quality, lower-cost electric vehicles. The federal government should follow through on its commitment to bring clarity and transparency to any change to the policy within the following weeks.

Resilient communities and infrastructure:

Budget 2025 makes little mention of how the federal government will support provinces and communities in making infrastructure more resilient to climate-fueled extreme weather. Investing in adaptation is not a ‘nice to have’—upgrading infrastructure for current and future extreme weather will be crucial to saving billions of dollars in costs from disrupted trade and other economic impacts, and should be a key component of any climate competitiveness strategy.

In particular, the announcement of $51 billion for a new Build Communities Strong Fund should be carefully designed to ensure that projects funded through this program do not make Canada more vulnerable to climate change. Funded projects should both strengthen resilience by building infrastructure that can withstand a harsher and more volatile climate, and avoid encouraging new development in areas that are—or will become—unsafe from threats such as flooding and wildfire.

Critical minerals:

Budget 2025 explicitly tackles some of the concerns the Climate Institute raised in our report, Critical Path, which called for policy to de-risk investment in Canadian critical minerals projects. The Budget responds to this concern by committing $2 billion dollars in a new Critical Minerals Sovereign Wealth Fund to make strategic investments in critical mineral projects and companies. This approach, if well-implemented, will unlock private investment in Canadian projects to help seize a growing opportunity in the global energy transition, while also protecting the economic security of Canadian electrification supply chains.

Indigenous housing:

Budget 2025 commits to addressing the unique and persistent housing and infrastructure challenges facing Indigenous communities. It commits to work with Indigenous leadership in developing Build Canada Homes to ensure it meets First Nations, Inuit, and Métis identified needs and priorities. It also confirms $2.8 billion for urban, rural, and northern Indigenous housing as well as an increase in the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s target for investments in Indigenous infrastructure from at least $1 billion to at least $3 billion. As it implements these changes, the federal government should work to link these actions with both reconciliation and climate objectives.

Ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil, here is a look at China's climate commitments:

Emissions

China emits over 30% of global greenhouse gases—an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60% of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70% of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10% by 2035.

But it did not set a baseline year from which to measure those reductions and experts say China needs to cut emissions by closer to 30% from 2023 levels to keep global temperatures from rising over 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

—Renewable goals—

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30% by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36% in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles,"" which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40% of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signaled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic meters, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

,Detroit Environment,2025-11-04 21:39:44+00:00,The Hill,"Companies hit the brakes on EVs, laying off thousands of workers",Rachel Frazin,,,,,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/5589084-evs-electric-vehicles-tax-credits-layoffs-gm-cox-rivian/amp/,"In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.
The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.
GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.
Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.
“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant and another 710 being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announce layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 21:57:44.508347

Someone is considered energy burdened if they pay six percent or more of their household income on energy costs.
The reasons for rising electricity costs vary by state, but some trends in the report can help explain why those costs may be causing older women across the country to feel more anxiety over their utility bills.
And despite Trump’s promises to lower energy bills, his landmark legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to further impact energy prices.
“It is not just the energy cost, it is the cumulative effect of all those,” she said.","Molly Mandel is on a budget. Like many others her age, the 77-year-old retiree depends on her Social Security check and a small monthly pension to cover her expenses. She only buys food that’s on sale at the grocery store. She thrifts her clothes because the prices at department stores are too high these days. “You go into Penney’s, and you look at a blouse, and it’s 24.99!” she said.

But despite all her penny-pinching, her spending is still more than she sees in her monthly checks. “I’m economizing in as many places as I can, but the inflation of almost everything I use is outpacing my income,” she said.

Now her electricity provider, Arizona Public Service, is proposing to raise her electricity bills for the third time in three years. So when the opportunity came to speak at a town hall on the potential rate hike in Sun City, a retirement community north of Phoenix, she was one of the first to share the way rising costs were already impacting her tight budgeting.

Sitting at a roundtable near the front of the room, she spoke directly to the state attorney general, Kris Mayes, who convened the meeting. “I am a retiree who lives on Social Security and a small pension, and with increases in the Medicare costs that are deducted from Social Security, the food costs, and tariff costs for almost every product brought into the United States, an increase of 16 percent seems outrageous to me,” she said.

She was one of around 40 people who had shown up to the meeting, the first in a series of town halls organized by the attorney general, after the state’s largest electricity providers announced potential rate hikes.

‘The new eggs’

For people across the country, rates are going up at a fast clip, with some experts now calling electricity “the new eggs.”

Over the last year, electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation. And residents in 41 states are looking at even higher costs for electricity and natural gas due to proposed rate hikes this year and next, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank.

In some states, like Arizona, the increases have been particularly stark. As Mayes noted at the town hall, “The cost of electricity in Arizona has risen faster in the past two years than in the previous nine.” The latest request would raise residential bills by an estimated $240 a year.

For Arizonans, the price increase is on top of the already skyrocketing bills residents are paying in the summertime due to extreme heat, which continues to worsen from climate change.

Utilities have various reasons for raising their rates. In Arizona, for example, an explosion of data centers is leading to a skyrocketing demand for electricity. Extreme weather, like heat and wildfires, is also straining the grid, and the need to upgrade existing infrastructure like transmission lines is raising costs for utilities.

But many utilities are also for-profit entities. Arizona Public Service, one of two utilities asking for rate increases, made a net profit of $608 million in 2024, after raising rates 8 percent last year and the year before.

The CEO of APS, Ted Geiser, has said the rate hikes are necessary to pay for needed upgrades to infrastructure and that the new rate proposal also includes a new way to charge large electricity consumers like data centers to pay for the strain they are putting on the system.

But Mayes, who formerly served on the Arizona Corporation Commission, the body responsible for approving rate hikes, is intervening in this rate case in the hopes of stopping the hike. She thinks it’s obvious that the consecutive hikes are a sign that residents are shouldering some of the cost. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” she told The 19th in an interview. “I’ve been watching utilities for 25 years. I was a utility regulator, and I’ve never seen a situation like this where such incredibly profitable companies are asking residential consumers to subsidize their electricity costs.”

“Enough is enough,” she continued. “Arizonans can’t afford these rate increases anymore and the utility shouldn’t be trying to foist them on people that are already struggling.”

Who is impacted

At 77, Mandel is emblematic of the people who stand to be hit disproportionately by the rising costs: older women.

This demographic is typically living on a fixed income with less in retirement savings and Social Security benefits than men. Women over 65 are also more likely to be living in poverty than men of the same age.

Those realities are translating to worries over how to make ends meet. According to an April poll by the AARP of adults 50 and older, women were more likely to say they were concerned about their electricity bills going up over men, with 50% of women saying they were very concerned compared to 35% of men.

“High energy costs can lead to older adults having to make difficult decisions between paying for heating, cooling, medication, or food,” said Jenn Jones, vice president of financial security and livable communities at AARP, in an email. “The bottom line is stable, affordable energy helps ensure people’s safety, comfort, and health — particularly during extreme weather.”

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

The elderly are also more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. They have a harder time regulating their body temperature, making them more susceptible to heat illness, which is becoming more common due to rising temperatures.

“We’ve had multiple heat-related deaths in Arizona, and one of the reasons I am being so aggressive in these rate cases is because I am very worried that more and more folks are going to feel like they have to turn their AC off so that they can afford their bills,” said Mayes, who is currently investigating the death of an 82-year old woman who died in Sun City in May after her electricity was shut off due to failure to pay her bills.

While there are no nationwide studies on electricity burden that focus on gender and age, in August, the Gender Equity Policy Institute published a California-specific analysis, finding that women are hit hardest by rising energy costs in the state. It also found that senior women — or those 65 and older, were most likely to be energy-burdened — more than senior men and younger adults of any gender. Someone is considered energy burdened if they pay six percent or more of their household income on energy costs. The report also found that in California, the energy burden is worse for Black women and Native women.

The reasons for rising electricity costs vary by state, but some trends in the report can help explain why those costs may be causing older women across the country to feel more anxiety over their utility bills. “A lot of this goes back to the gendered inequalities that women have experienced over their whole life. They on average or more likely to have earned lower wages and accumulated less wealth. And women live longer than men,” said Nancy Cohen, founder and CEO of the institute, and author on the report. “It is understandable and pretty much predictable that senior women would experience this difficulty.”

The report also found that 31% of women-led households were energy burdened compared to 24% of men-led households and that 37% of families headed by single mothers are energy burdened compared to 28% headed by single mothers.

Trump policies

At the same time that rates are going up, policies that could make bills go down are being upended by the Trump administration. Funding to bring more clean energy into the mix, which has consistently gotten cheaper, has been gutted. Energy efficiency standards, which ultimately help consumers save money by incentivizing appliances that use less electricity, have also been rolled back.

And despite Trump’s promises to lower energy bills, his landmark legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to further impact energy prices. According to an analysis by Princeton University, the legislation, which repeals clean energy tax credits and rescinds funding for renewables, is expected to increase electricity costs by $165 a year by 2030, and up to $280 a year by 2035.

And now due to the government shutdown, the Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program, one of the few that helps low-income Americans pay their energy bills, and that prioritizes the elderly, the disabled and those with young children, is in limbo, with funding delayed.

Usually states would have received their allocation by late October or early November – 80% of which is distributed for heating costs. Now, the best estimate by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization that works with state directors of the program, says that funding won’t come until December at the earliest.

According to the organization, the cost of heating a home is expected to increase by 8 percent this year, largely due to the increase in electricity prices, making the dispersal of money even more urgent.

As a result, the organization is asking utilities to voluntarily pause shutoffs for customers who don’t pay their bills. “No family should be forced to choose between heat and food because of a federal funding delay,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, in a news release. “Utilities must act in the public interest and pause shutoffs until federal aid is available again.”

Competing costs

For older people it’s not just electricity that’s rising; health care costs are going up as well.

Margaret Mohr, a 62-year-old who also was in attendance at the Sun City town hall, is facing $800 a month premiums on her health insurance; she is not old enough to qualify for Medicare. She works part time as a licensed counselor, a job she had wanted to transition to long before she retired from law enforcement, but now it’s become the way she can afford her rising costs. “Everything goes up except income,” she said.

Even for those on Medicare like Mandel, costs are also going up. Her premiums are rising by $21 a month, a cost that eats up the recently announced cost of living increase to Social Security. Mandel also worries about the price of medications. She just got a proposal from Cigna, her healthcare provider, which would require her to cover a higher percentage of the cost of certain prescription drugs.

Mandel considers herself lucky. She owns her home and has some resources she can draw from if forced to. But she worries about people she knows who have no financial buffer at all. “It is not just the energy cost, it is the cumulative effect of all those,” she said. “Even if you have additional assets they are depleting those the longer you live.”

She herself worries she might have to relocate. “I might have to downsize, or consider moving outside the country,” she said. “But because I have so much family here I don’t know if I want to make that drastic move.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/electricity-meter.png,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:42.716035

The company also maintained its full-year loss projection, as trade wars and the loss of EV tax credits continued to be complicating factors. Rivian reiterated an adjusted 2025 full-year EBITDA loss in a range of $2 billion to $2.25 billion, with capital expenditures of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.

""In Q3, we continued to make significant progress across our strategic priorities which includes R2 and our technology roadmap,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. ""We continue to believe that Rivian’s vertically integrated technologies and direct-to-customer ownership experience position our company to build a category-defining brand with a strong product portfolio for the U.S. and European markets.""

Swtch Energy, a Toronto-based company that provides EV charging ports for multifamily and other commercial buildings, conducted a survey in September 2024 that revealed 82 percent of North America multifamily residents lack home access to EV charging, said Carter Li, SWTCH’s CEO and founder.

“We found that multifamily residents are two and a half times more likely to own an EV if they have charging access in their buildings,” Li said. “Furthermore, they would actually pay $50 to $100 more per month for their apartment if they had access to charging in these locations. But there’s a relative abundance of what we call, ‘garage orphans,’ who don’t have access to charging where they work and live.”

Swtch has seen an increase in how many buildings have EV charging, said Li.

“I think we did a survey two or three years ago and it was 6 percent of the multifamily buildings that had access to EV charging in North America,” but he now estimates that 13 to 14 percent of buildings are currently equipped with the necessary technology.

Founded in 2016, Swtch was created when Li realized his own challenges in owning an EV where he lived in Downtown Toronto.

“The technology, the business model, everything was designed around: How do you put in charging in multifamily buildings in Downtown Toronto?” he recalled. Since then, EV adoption in Canada and the U.S. has been similar: about 10 percent of new vehicle sales. Swtch’s business is primarily U.S.-based, with a significant presence in the Northeast and California, said Li.

The growth in EV ownership, despite periods of political opposition to subsidies in the U.S. and Canada, has been a net positive.

“The rate of increase might plateau a little bit, but there’s this consistent overall increase in EV adoption,” said Li. “There might be states and provinces across North America that have higher rates of adoption due to state or provincial policies, but irrespective of that, the general trend, with or without policies, is still increasing. It’s just how quickly it’s increasing.”

EV ownership and the subsequent demand for residential charging ports is particularly strong in California, Florida and Texas, said Olga Shevorenkova, CEO of Loop Global, a Los Angeles-based company that integrates EV charging hardware and software services into residential and other commercial buildings.

“We’re seeing that multifamily is one segment where demand continues strong, because a lot of tenants would not move into the building if there is no EV charger,” said Shevorenkova. “And that’s not just California. That goes across the country.” Founded in 2019, Loop Global has about 7,000 ports — approximately 6,000 in multifamily and under 1,000 in single-family homes — across 30 states, Shevorenkova said.

As far as demand for EVs, Shevorenkova doesn’t see Trump administration cuts to EV subsidies as being a huge negative — in particular, specific cuts to certain charging portals.

“Federal subsidies, which Trump canceled or nearly canceled, were designed to support corridor charging,” she said, meaning highway charging stations. “Those fast chargers are built alongside corridors to eliminate the range anxiety of a lot of people who buy these vehicles.

But we’re not playing in that market. So that particular federal subsidy affected a lot of companies, but not ours.

“The multifamily segments still have state, municipal and utility subsidies and rebates. Those didn’t go away. Despite federal subsidy cuts, state and municipal subsidies remain strong.”

Consistent demand from multifamily owners is a big plus to providers such as Loop Global, as real estate investment trusts that own many apartment buildings look to spread good practices throughout their portfolios, said Shevorenkova.

“If you’ve done a good job for them in a few buildings, they continue to do business with you,” she said. “And it’s a very agile way to grow your revenues and adoption, versus going and knocking on every building’s door. You’re not working with a corporate structure who pushes down your solution on individual buildings.”

Loop Global’s technology, too, can work with charging stations in underground concrete multifamily garages.

“The garages have very bad reception on a cellular site, and the chargers are smart devices for 21st-century infrastructure,” she said. “They don’t work without a connection to the internet. You need the internet for billing, reporting and connectivity for the car to send the signal to the charger, and so on and so forth.”

Tapping into a building’s WiFi is a bad solution, because security wouldn’t allow it, she continued. So, Loop Global developed what it calls network access packages and connectivity infrastructure to create a local Wi-Fi network that connects all the chargers and allows for local load management.

In addition, later this year, the company plans to bring to market what it calls Infinity Link, a Bluetooth-based technology that allows the charger to go offline if there is a grid outage and then connect back to the network.

Shevorenkova also noted growing investor interest in profitability over rapid growth for EV charging companies.

“The era of, ‘I’m going to grow at any cost,’ is over,” she said. “Investors only want to invest in companies which have either reached profitability, which not that many have done or maybe no one has done. An EV charging company must have a very clear path and strategy towards getting there. We have two fantastic investors, Fifth Wall and Agility, which is a large Middle Eastern group.”

Swtch’s Li said installing EV charging ports in a single-family home is far easier than in multifamily.

“Single-family is growing for sure, because they require less of what we call managed charging,” said Li. “It’s relatively easy to put a charger in a single-family home. You just hook it up to your electrical panel and it gets included as part of your monthly electrical bill. It’s when you’re dealing with complex common shared amenities and assets that it becomes really complicated in multifamily or commercial buildings.

“People who own and operate these EV charging assets — what they call charge point operators — raise money and go in there and own and operate. So it’s a zero capex model for the people the site hosts. They don’t have to necessarily put any skin in the game.”

A firm like Swtch is different, Li said.

“We are taking on the risks because we believe in the business model, and we’ve done all the math, and everything that we understand pencils,” he said. “So this has been a much easier way for people who still want to provide the amenity for their residents and tenants, but don’t quite understand the ecosystem, don’t really understand the risks involved. We do this day in and day out to be able to take on that risk and to deploy these assets in these locations.”

Aubrey Gunnels, CEO and co-founder at 3V Infrastructure, a Manhattan-based EV charging infrastructure investor, owner and operator, said in an email that her company is tackling the challenges of single-family and multifamily installations.

“Historically, it’s been easier to own an EV if you lived in a single-family home and could install charging yourself,” said Gunnels. “We’re trying to change that at 3V Infrastructure by removing the cost and burden for property owners to offer charging to their residents. 3V Infrastructure is one of the only companies addressing the market gap in infrastructure dollars to build chargers in multifamily buildings. This removes the financial and operational barriers for property owners to offer charging as an amenity to their residents.

“As EV adoption increases, more residents expect at-home charging, and they’re willing to pay more in rent for it.”

Gunnels cited a recent survey from multifamily ownership giant Greystar. It showed that residents were willing to pay $66 a month for EV charging — and won’t rent without it.

“Even if EV penetration peaks at 20 percent, that’s still 20 percent of building residents who will expect access to charging,” she said. “Multifamily property owners can’t ignore that.”",https://commercialobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/EV-charging-RF-GettyImages-2164056823-WEB.jpg?quality=80&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:24.692291

Mike Lawler (NY-17), Don Beyer (VA-08), and Chellie Pingree (ME-01) introduced the Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act, bipartisan legislation to improve soil health on farms and support sustainable alternatives to annual agriculture. The legislation would ensure United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) conservation programs are better able to support farmers who incorporate perennial systems and agroforestry into their operations.

“By supporting farmers in the utilization of perennial systems and agroforestry, the Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act encourages healthy soil management – improving overall farm productivity and stimulating microbial life,” said Congressman Lawler. “This is a win for farmers, a win for the environment, and a win for American families. I’m proud to join my colleagues Don Beyer and Chellie Pingree in introducing this commonsense bipartisan bill.”

“American agriculture faces many challenges today, including harmful soil erosion exacerbated by the climate crisis’ extreme weather patterns,” said Congressman Beyer. “Our bill is a significant step to support the health and sustainability of American farms by ensuring the USDA has the resources necessary to be a strong partner for farmers who prioritize perennial agriculture and agroforestry. These practices promote soil health, which not only makes the soil more resilient to extreme weather events and erosion but also improves long-term agricultural productivity and farming’s impacts on watersheds and wildlife.”

“In Maine and across the country, farmers are on the frontlines of the climate crisis – dealing with severe drought, flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather conditions,” said Congresswoman Pingree. “In order to make our food system more resilient and to ensure our agricultural producers survive the worsening climate crisis, we must encourage and invest in climate-smart practices. My Representatives Beyer and Lawler’s Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act does just that – promoting soil health, investing in agroforestry research and development, and incentivizing greenhouse gas reduction. Our bipartisan, commonsense bill is a win-win.”

""The Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act provides common-sense, straight-forward support for high-impact perennial practices through NRCS conservation programs. It also ensures increased technical capacity at USDA for new and exciting perennial practices through a series of agroforestry centers,” said National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition Conservation Specialist Jesse Womack. “This bill is a win for farmers committed to building soil health across their operation through plant diversity and strong, living roots.”

“Perennial and agroforestry systems strengthen soils by minimizing disturbance, maximizing living roots, and bolstering land-based carbon sinks – all while delivering benefits across biodiversity, on-farm resilience, and producer bottom lines,” said Interim Director of Policy at Carbon180 Mary Olive. “The Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act of 2025 enhances NRCS conservation programs to increase support and flexibility for US farmers and ranchers looking to implement these innovative, soil-friendly production systems. We applaud Representatives Beyer, Lawler, and Pingree for their leadership in prioritizing soil health.”

At the Battery Show North America in early October in Detroit, the Fraunhofer IWU and the automotive supplier Amsted Automotive presented an integrally designed battery housing with aluminum foam sandwiches. This is a special material structure consisting of two solid aluminum sheets enclosing an inner core of aluminum foam. Such housings can, if needed, incorporate a cooling structure or a thermal storage medium known as Phase Change Material (PCM), which stores or releases heat as it changes between solid and liquid states.

Fraunhofer IWU has successfully integrated PCM into closed-cell aluminum foam. PCM can absorb or release large amounts of thermal energy while changing its state (solid to liquid or vice versa) without significantly altering its own temperature. This makes them particularly well-suited for efficient thermal management in lithium-ion batteries.

The demonstrator presented in Detroit shows a wide range of possible serial solutions. Depending on the prioritized properties, pure AAS (Aluminum-Aluminum Foam Sandwiches), AAS with infiltrated PCM, AAS with a cooling structure, or AAS with a cooling structure and PCM can be implemented.

To ensure that battery housings made from aluminum foam are also used in mass-produced vehicles, researchers led by Dr. Thomas Hipke and Dr. Rico Schmerler are now focusing more on cost-effectiveness. A key factor in determining future manufacturing prices is the cost of raw materials. Hipke states: ""We are increasingly using recycled material to produce the aluminum foam. Not only is this significantly more cost-effective, but it also greatly reduces the CO2 footprint.""

Since 2021, electricity demand within the Texas electricity grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has steadily increased.

Additionally, Oklahoma Energy investors track this Texas surge because regional transmission expansion pressures cross-state planning models.

In the first nine months of 2025, electricity demand in ERCOT, which manages about 90% of the state’s load, reached a record high compared with the same period in previous years.

Therefore, peak load trendlines now drive new investor assumptions on future infrastructure scale.

Fastest demand growth among U.S. grids

Over those same months, ERCOT had the fastest electricity demand growth among U.S. electricity grids between 2024 and 2025.

Also, analysts continue to treat ERCOT load as the leading indicator benchmark.

From January through September 2025, demand for electric power in ERCOT increased 5% compared with the same period in 2024 to 372 terawatthours (TWh), 23% more than the same months in 2021.

Finally, this type of sustained sequential comp growth rarely appears in modern grid cycles.

Since 2023, wind and solar generation, especially utility-scale solar, have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in ERCOT and are increasingly meeting rising demand.

Therefore, this structural shift restricts natural gas mid-day market share.

Wind and solar scaling in ERCOT

Utility-scale solar generated 45 TWh of electricity in the first nine months of 2025, 50% more than the same period in 2024 and nearly four times more than the same period in 2021, when utility-scale solar only produced 11 TWh.

Additionally, utility-scale solar is showing the steepest absolute lift across the entire U.S. grid fleet.

Wind generation through the first nine months of this year totaled 87 TWh, up 4% compared with the same period in 2024 and 36% since the same period in 2021.

Also, wind additions continue to support diversification across the Texas balancing mix.

Together, wind and solar generation met 36% of ERCOT’s electricity demand in the first nine months of 2025.

Finally, this composite share shift highlights the new renewable-first pathway emerging within ERCOT economics.

Note: The other category includes nuclear, hydroelectric, biomass, batteries, and other nonrenewable sources. ERCOT=Electric Reliability Council of Texas

Natural gas levels flatten

Natural gas-fired generation also increased after 2021 but flattened more recently.

Therefore, market share compression continues at the margin during primary daylight generation windows.

Natural gas-fired generation between January and September increased to 161 TWh in 2023, 24% more than the same period in 2021.

Also, this period helped establish the dominance baseline for comparison modeling.

Since 2023, natural gas-fired generation remained relatively flat, totaling 158 TWh between January and September 2025.

Meanwhile, capital rotation toward solar remains strong through ERCOT interconnection queues.

Although it is still the largest source of electricity for ERCOT, natural gas-fired generation averaged 43% in the first nine months of 2025, compared with 47% in the first nine months of 2023 and 2024.

Therefore, solar and wind scaling continue to shrink the mid-day thermal footprint.

Midday generation shift

The types of energy sources used for electricity generation can vary on an hourly basis, especially during the summer.

Also, Texas demand spikes often trigger short-term market dislocations.

Solar output is highest during midday hours, and the increased availability of solar generation in ERCOT in recent years has reduced the need for natural gas-fired generation during that time of the day.

Additionally, intraday flexibility remains the critical technical advantage.

Solar generators in ERCOT produced an average of 24 gigawatts (GW) between noon and 1:00 p.m. during the summer months of June through September compared with an average of 12 GW of solar generation at noon in the summer months of 2023.

Therefore, solar output doubling materially alters summer dispatch dynamics.

Over the same period, the share of natural gas-fired generation at midday fell from 50% in 2023 to 37% in 2025.

Finally, intraday displacement becomes central to market redesign forecasting.

Batteries emerging as a grid stabilizer

Batteries store electricity during daytime when generation from wind and solar is the highest, and they supply electricity when generation from wind and solar is declining.

Additionally, storage adds timing flexibility that directly strengthens ERCOT balancing authority.

Beginning in October 2024, ERCOT began reporting battery output separately in its hourly grid data.

Also, storage tracking now improves operational transparency for developers and investors.

In the summer months of 2025, batteries helped supply electricity in the evening as solar output declined, supplying an average of 4 GW in the 8:00 p.m. hour.

Therefore, battery deployment is now considered a major competitive reliability lever.

Forward forecast

ERCOT’s electricity demand is forecast to grow faster than that of any other grid operator in the United States through at least 2026.

Additionally, analysts across Oklahoma Energy markets now price this load trend as a baseline assumption.

In our October Short-Term Energy Outlook, we forecast demand will rise another 14% in the first nine months of 2026 compared with the same period this year, reaching 425 TWh.

Finally, ERCOT’s growth story continues to dominate national planning models and mid-cap development strategy.",,N,,2025-11-04 18:05:40.361478

Governor Whitmer Signs Bipartisan Bills to Protect Michigan’s Environment, Supporting Clean Water, Air, and Land Across the State

Other bills include lowering costs for Michigan National Guard members and cutting red tape for local governments

LANSING, Mich. – Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a bill to lower costs for Michigan National Guard members. Last month, she signed six bipartisan bills to implement the budget. These bills secured resources to support local parks and recreation projects across the state, bolstered conservation programs and protected Michigan’s land, air, and water, and cut red tape for local governments. Including today’s legislation, Governor Whitmer has signed a record 1,531 bipartisan bills into law since taking office.

""Since I took office, I’ve been committed to protecting Michigan’s environment, ensuring generations of Michiganders can explore and enjoy all our state has to offer,” said Governor Whitmer. “That’s why I’m proud to sign these seven bills into law so our departments have enough funding and support to continue programs that protect Michigan’s water, air, and land. Whether it’s maintaining a supply of clean drinking water or creating new trails in our parks, I’ll keep working with anyone to protect and defend our environment. Together, let’s get it done.”

“We must all work hard to protect the natural resources we are blessed to steward,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “These bills will ensure Michigan can continue to conserve natural resources and protect water, air, and land across our state. We’re also making a difference for the National Guard members who step up for our state each and every day. Let’s keep working together to build a bright future for Michigan families.”

House Bill 4962, sponsored by state Representative Ron Robinson (R-Utica), supports Michigan’s National Guard members by establishing a Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund to put more money back in servicemembers’ pockets. Specifically, the fund will help Michigan National Guard members afford childcare, health care, and tuition. The fund ensures servicemembers and their families have the support they need to make it in Michigan. HB 4962 will not take effect immediately, as the tie-barred bills have not been passed out of the legislature.

House Bill 4392, sponsored by state Representative Ken Borton (R-Gaylord), protects Michigan’s environment by allocating $41.8 million from the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund for 85 projects across the state. Specifically, the projects conserve natural resources and develop land to support public recreation, conservation, and accessibility. This includes protecting wildlife habitats, building new trails, improvements to parks, and more.

Senate Bill 273, sponsored by state Senator Kevin Daley (R-Lum), supports environmental conservation efforts by continuing water quality protection fees. The fees were set to expire in 2025 but have been extended through fiscal year 2029. The money collected from the fees funds environmental and conservation efforts run by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

Senate Bill 574, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), amends the tobacco settlement fund allocations and helps to increase the Michigan Merit Award Trust Fund, supporting scholarships, tuition assistance programs, nursing scholarships, and other related expenses.

Senate Bill 577, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), ensures Michiganders continue to have clean drinking water across the state. Specifically, the bill extends the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy authority to charge fees for training and certifying people who operate public water systems. The fees help fund important programs that train and certify water operators, support emergency responses to drinking water threats, and monitor and protect Michigan’s water quality. Overall, this bill generates around $600,000 per year in funding for these programs.

Senate Bill 579, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), protects Michigan’s environment by allowing the state of Michigan to continue collecting certain environmental fees. The fees are paid by individuals, businesses, or governments when they apply for permits to build near bodies of water, discharge water into storm drains or rivers, handle hazardous waste, or get certified to operate wastewater or stormwater systems. The fees help fund important programs that protect Michigan’s environment. Overall, this bill delivers $7.6 million a year for environmental protection programs.

The roots of controlled environment certification trace back to the mid-20th century, when clean air and contamination control became essential to aerospace, defense, and nascent semiconductor manufacturing. A watershed moment arrived in 1960, when engineer Willis Whitfield introduced the modern laminar-flow cleanroom—technology that revolutionized contamination control by sweeping particles away from sensitive processes. As cleanrooms expanded across industries, the need for standardized testing grew, giving rise to methods for measuring particulates, verifying filter performance, and documenting airflow behavior.

In the following decades, international consensus matured. The ISO 14644 series (first published in 1999) provided a common language for cleanroom classification and testing. In healthcare, sterile compounding and aseptic processing accelerated demand for qualified facilities. Regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration emphasized contamination-control strategy, aseptic behavior, and the importance of robust, defensible data—work that certifiers enable through routine testing and thorough reporting.

As the field professionalized, certifiers organized around shared practices, mentorship, and credentialing. CETA (Controlled Environment Testing Association) brought together field certifiers, manufacturers, and laboratories to exchange methods, refine procedures, and champion excellence. Through training, standardization efforts, and credentialing programs, the role of the controlled environment certifier evolved from “good to have” to “business critical.” Today, certifiers are essential in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, medical device production, microelectronics, hospitals and pharmacies, and advanced research facilities.",https://nationaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/National-Controlled-Environment-Certifier-Day-header.png,N,,2025-11-04 16:18:40.935118

Texans are heading to the polls on Tuesday to decide the fate of 17 proposed amendments to the state Constitution, fill vacancies in Congress and the state Senate, and vote on scores of local offices and bond measures.

The off-year election is set to draw only a fraction of the turnout seen in typical even-year elections for the presidency and Congress, even with major referendums on the ballot affecting taxes, water, criminal justice and other areas.

As the polls opened Tuesday, more than a million Texans had already cast their ballots during the 12-day early voting period, which ended last week.

Here are three of the biggest storylines to watch on Election Day.

18th Congressional District special election

Residents of Texas’ 18th Congressional District have waited months for a special election to fill out the remainder of Rep. Sylvester Turner’s term. Turner died in March, leaving the seat vacant.

But with 16 candidates in the race, Houstonians will likely need to wait longer, with nobody expected to reach the 50% threshold needed to win outright. In that case, the race would head to a runoff early next year between the top two finishers Tuesday.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and former Houston City Councilmember Amanda Edwards, both Democrats, have led most public polling of the race. State Rep. Jolanda Jones, D-Houston, was delayed in announcing her campaign while the Legislature was in session earlier this year, but she is also expected to be competitive.

While the district is heavily Democratic — having voted for Vice President Kamala Harris by a margin of nearly 40 percentage points — vote splitting among Democrats could allow a Republican candidate to make the runoff. Carmen Montiel Maria, a former Republican nominee for the seat, has polled highest among Republicans.

The 18th District has served as a launchpad for several storied Black politicians, including former Reps. Barbara Jordan and Sheila Jackson Lee — and Tuesday’s election could be the starting point for a lengthy congressional career for the winner. But redistricting has scrambled the politics of the district, whose boundaries will shift significantly come the March primary, when voters will pick the nominees for a full two-year term starting in 2027. Neighboring Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, was drawn into the new version of the 18th District and has heavily hinted he plans to run there.

The district encompasses downtown Houston and — for now — several of the city’s historic neighborhoods, including Third Ward and parts of The Heights and Acres Homes. Under the new lines, much of the 18th will be shifted to the south and northeast parts of Harris County.

Senate District 9 special election

In North Texas, two Republicans and a Democrat are facing off in the special election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by Acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock.

The winner of the special election — or any runoff election, if no candidate wins a majority of votes Tuesday — will serve out the rest of Hancock’s Senate term through the end of 2026. The seat has been vacant since Hancock resigned from the upper chamber in June.

The two Republican candidates vying to represent the solidly red district are conservative activist Leigh Wambsganss and former Southlake Mayor John Huffman. Both have touted their experience in conservative politics and pledged to focus on reducing property taxes. Wambsganss won most of the biggest Republican endorsements, including from President Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the Senate president who has stocked the chamber with political allies. Huffman, on the other hand, has raked in millions of dollars in contributions from casino magnate Miriam Adelson and her pro-gambling groups.

Meanwhile, Taylor Rehmet, a union leader, machinist and Air Force veteran, is running a long-shot bid as a Democrat and focusing his campaign on working class interests.

The district, which covers about half of Fort Worth and much of Tarrant County’s northern suburbs, voted for Trump by over 17 percentage points last year. If a Republican wins the seat, as expected, the 31-member state Senate will be made up of 19 Republicans and 11 Democrats, with another vacant seat in a dark-red district based in Conroe to be filled in May.

Constitutional amendments

Texas voters will decide whether to approve 17 proposed edits to the state’s Constitution, with major implications for property taxes, the state’s dwindling water supply and the rules governing its criminal justice system.

Most of the proposed amendments, which will be listed at the top of the ballot, seek to reduce taxes for various groups of Texas residents. Proposition 2 would prohibit the state from collecting taxes on money earned through capital assets like investments, real estate and valuable items. It would also end a franchise tax on business trusts.

Proposition 13 would increase the share of a home’s value that can’t be taxed to pay for public schools, from $100,000 to $140,000. A Tribune calculation shows that the owner of a typical Texas home, worth about $302,000 last year, would have saved about $490 on their school property taxes under the proposed change.

Proposition 4 asks voters to approve $20 billion over the next two decades for water projects mostly aimed at addressing aging pipes and infrastructure, developing new water sources and mitigating future floods.

Additionally, two measures could alter the state’s judicial system. Proposition 3 would require judges to deny bail to individuals accused of committing specific felonies, including murder, aggravated assault and indecency with a child, if the state demonstrates that doing so is necessary to ensure public safety or the defendant’s appearance in court.

And Proposition 12 would shake up the composition of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, a 13-member oversight group that investigates judicial misconduct. The commission is currently made up of six judges appointed by the Texas Supreme Court, two attorneys appointed by the State Bar of Texas and five citizens appointed by the governor. If Proposition 12 is approved, the two lawyers would be replaced by additional Abbott-appointed citizens, putting the governor in charge of seven appointments — a majority of the body.

Proposition 14 would create a $3 billion Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to study dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and other brain-related conditions.

Corn may soon fuel more than cars. With airlines under pressure to decarbonize, ethanol is emerging as a promising source for sustainable aviation fuel. The technology is ready, the chemistry is proven, and the market potential is massive — but policy and timing could determine whether American farmers lead or get left behind.

The Inflation Reduction Act created the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit to reward fuels with low carbon intensity (CI) scores. The lower the score, the greater the credit. That simple equation could spark a new carbon race across agriculture, with every decision — from seed selection to nitrogen efficiency — influencing a farmer’s bottom line.

Kansas Corn’s director of policy and economics Taylor Williamson recently spoke on the topic at the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) Forage, Turf and Conservation Seed Conference in Kansas City. He explains that race is already underway, but the rules are still unclear. He says the government’s delay in finalizing the 45Z regulations is putting growers at a disadvantage.

“If Treasury doesn’t get these rules out soon, it’ll be too late for the 2026 crop,” Williamson says. “Once the seed is in the ground, it’s too late to change your CI score.”

He believes the program could be a powerful tool to inject dollars into the ag economy if it’s rolled out in time for farmers to respond.

“This is one way to put cash into the ag economy during a time of really bad prices,” he says. “The program already exists. It just needs rules and regulations.”

From Field to Flight

Ethanol already makes up about one-third of Kansas corn’s market, but the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway could push demand to new heights. Even a small percentage of global jet fuel made from ethanol would have ripple effects across the grain economy.

Williamson breaks it down simply. If SAF could become 1% of the world’s aviation fuel, and 1%of that came from ethanol-based SAF, that would use about 5.6 million bushels of corn — roughly 10% of Kansas’ annual production. Push SAF to 10% of global aviation fuel, and even if only 1% of that is ethanol-based SAF, the number jumps to 56 million bushels.

“If an airport like Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport converted half its jet fuel to SAF made from ethanol, that’s 389 million bushels,” he says. “That’s why we’re paying attention.” “Similarly, if 10% of global aviation fuel were SAF, and 1% of that came from ethanol-to-SAF, you’d get to 56 million bushels. But when we talk about a scenario like DFW, we’re assuming a full 50% SAF made purely from ethanol.”

He says the potential for ethanol-to-jet-fuel production not only strengthens corn markets but creates a symbiotic relationship with the livestock industry. Ethanol’s byproduct remains feed grain, keeping value cycling through rural economies.

“There’s not enough used cooking oil in the world to fuel every plane,” Williamson says. “If we want real sustainable aviation fuel, ethanol has to be part of the solution.”

Flexibility Over Mandates

To qualify for the highest 45Z credits, farmers may need to meet specific carbon-reduction standards based on production practices. That could include adopting no-till, planting cover crops, or switching to enhanced nitrogen fertilizers. Williamson says the intent is good, but the approach risks being too rigid.

“Don’t tell us exactly how to do it,” he says. “Just give us a number, give us the data, and we’ll go do it.”

He says although Kansas is known as The Wheat State, its plentiful corn farmers know better than anyone that what works in one field may fail in another. Eastern Kansas often benefits from cover crops that improve soil health and water retention. Western Kansas, with half the rainfall, can’t often afford to sacrifice moisture to a cover crop stand.

“Cover crops work in some places and not in others — and that’s okay,” he says. “Not all farmers, especially in Kansas, farm the same way.”

Williamson argues that flexibility, not prescription, will determine whether the program succeeds.

“You can’t accomplish your goal unless farmers can make it work for their bottom line,” he says.

Seeds of a Low-Carbon Future

The carbon-intensity push is already influencing conversations far beyond ethanol. Seed developers are exploring hybrids with better nitrogen efficiency and improved residue management. Agronomy teams are looking at how microbial products, stabilizers, and data analytics can cut emissions. Ethanol plants are developing traceability systems to verify the carbon profile of each bushel they buy.

Williamson sees this as a defining moment for the seed value chain — a chance to link genetics, agronomy, and markets in a measurable way. He believes farmers are ready to adapt, as long as risk and reward are balanced.

“Farmers aren’t afraid to innovate,” he says. “They just need to know a government program won’t put them out of business if they take a chance.”

For now, he says everyone is waiting on Washington. The potential for ethanol to power the planes of tomorrow — and for farmers to get paid for lowering carbon — hinges on clarity that hasn’t yet landed.",https://www.seedworld.com/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_1614423625-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:01.299935

A press release from the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology said the federal government signed a “non-binding” letter of intent to provide $50 billion to the company.
As a result of the investment, the Commerce Department is set to take $50 million of equity in Vulcan Elements, according to the government press release.

Additionally, the firm noted that as part of the overall deal, the loan to ReElement Technologies is being matched by a private investment while Vulcan Elements is also receiving $550 million in private capital.","WASHINGTON — The federal government has agreed to provide millions in funding to a firm focused on building a robust rare earths supply chain in the U.S. as the Trump administration expands its efforts to counter China’s dominant presence in the minerals space that is critical for manufacturing and technology moving forward.

The company, Vulcan Elements, announced the deal in a press release Monday in which it said, in total, the partnership involving the government will result in $1.4 billion dollars for it and American-based refiner ReElement Technologies to scale its domestic magnet supply chain.

Specifically, the firm, based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, said the fresh funds will allow it to build a new facility in the U.S. and increase magnet production to about 10,000 metric tons a year, with a “focus on recycling end-of-life magnets and electronic waste.” ReElement Technologies, it added, will be able to expand its recycling and processing capabilities with the new cash.

A press release from the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology said the federal government signed a “non-binding” letter of intent to provide $50 billion to the company. The funds, according to the department, are set to be used for Vulcan Elements to purchase equipment for the production of domestic Neodymium Iron Boron magnets specifically, which it notes “have significant commercial and defense applications,” including for semiconductor manufacturing, robotics, industrial motors, electric vehicles, drones, fighter jets, nuclear submarines, satellites and more.

The money comes from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, championed by Democratic former President Joe Biden and passed by Congress when he was in office. As a result of the investment, the Commerce Department is set to take $50 million of equity in Vulcan Elements, according to the government press release.

Along with the $50 million from the CHIPS program, the Defense Department will offer a $700 million conditional loan. ReElement Technologies will also receive an $80 million loan from the Office of Strategic Capital, Vulcan Elements said in its press release.

Additionally, the firm noted that as part of the overall deal, the loan to ReElement Technologies is being matched by a private investment while Vulcan Elements is also receiving $550 million in private capital.

“Accelerating Vulcan Elements’ rare earth magnet production is strategic to the United States and will have profound ramifications for industries including semiconductors, AI data centers, defense, aerospace, and automobiles,” Michael Grimes, executive director of the U.S. Investment Accelerator, said in a statement with the announcement from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The move marks the Trump administration’s latest effort to bolster critical mineral supplies in the U.S. to rely less on China, which processes nearly 90% of the world’s rare earths, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Last month, President Donald Trump hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House to sign a new critical minerals deal, and the president inked several new agreements on the matter with nations on his trip to Asia last week.

The topic has also loomed over recent trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with Trump threatening to place significantly higher tariffs on Beijing if it moved ahead with its announcement to place new export controls and restrictions on access to its rare earths. But China agreed to delay those new policies — and the U.S. said the same for its higher tariff rate — following a closely watched meeting between the countries’ two leaders in South Korea last week.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Rare_earth_AP_23026825512861_NAT_0823,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:20.308268

Geothermal energy production requires three key components: surface water and shallow groundwater seeping deep toward the Earth’s heated interior.","EDITOR’S NOTE: In the final installment in our series on geothermal energy, its availability in the West and the implications in Greater Yellowstone, Madison Dapcevich looks at the future of geothermal sites in Montana, sparking interest, and marrying the technology.

Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs has a long history of psychiatric treatment. Predating statehood in 1889 by 12 years, the state’s only public psychiatric hospital has served some of the Rocky Mountain West’s most vulnerable populations. But it was resource intensive and costly to heat water for the patients. Then, in the mid-20th century, the hospital began piping water from a natural hot spring was piped into the area for use in laundry and shower facilities. Since at least the 1980s, Montana has eyed the hospital for its hydrothermal and geothermal potential.

Water has historically been pumped to the state hospital from the nearby Fairmont Hot Springs, a 152-room resort 15 miles south that utilizes naturally heated water to warm its purported healing pools and buildings. Recently, private companies have been exploring the feasibility of installing geothermal power systems near the springs to generate electricity and pump hot water, reducing heating costs for local residents.

John Metesh, director of the Montana Bureau of Geology and Mines, says his agency is currently creating an inventory of geothermal sites around the state to do so.

“This begins by looking at data from oil and gas wells because these sites are very deep, and companies exploring for oil and gas can afford to conduct exploratory drilling,” Metesh said. “They’re drilling into geothermal formations to extract gas. So, the bureau looks at the data compared with seismic activity and geophysics data to build out maps of geothermal areas.” Between six and eight sites in Montana show potential to be transformed into geothermal power facilities, he added, one of which is the Montana State Hospital.

A previous estimation conducted in 2000 by Metesh and his colleague Jodey Kougioulis identified five areas that could be considered for geothermal development, including those near Bozeman, Ennis, Butte, Boulder and Camas Prairie.

Similar programs exist around the state. In 2020, Romney Hall at Montana State University launched a geothermal energy system, which efficiently cools and heats campus buildings and reduces their reliance on fossil fuels.

Aside from geothermal energy production through power plant facilities, hydrothermal features allow hot water to be pumped to nearby communities. Since the heated water is already close to the surface, it can be used as a hot water and energy source.

The Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology estimates roughly 150 springs and wells of low to moderate temperature could serve as potential geothermal resources, most of which are found in the southwestern part of the state. These abundant resources put the Treasure State in a unique position to become a major geothermal energy producer, particularly as its temperature extremes contribute to its place among the top five states with the highest per-capita energy consumption, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, coal accounts for 45 percent of Montana’s in-state power generation and about 30 percent of total U.S. coal production.

But like other alternative power generation proposals, Metesh says the reality of switching to geothermal energy comes down to the simple economics of its production cost versus its benefits.

“As traditional power costs increase and co-location of sources and transmission/use improve, geothermal will become more attractive, but the cost of [geothermal] production still needs to decrease,” Metesh said. “Montana, in general, has moderate potential for commercial geothermal in two broad categories: eastern Montana geothermal systems related to oil and gas development, and western Montana fault-controlled valleys.”

The Bureau of Geology and Mines is now conducting a new survey to identify potential geothermal sites across the state and has published the raw data on its website. In addition to pinpointing well locations, the Bureau of Geology and Mines is also cataloguing the geochemistry of known geothermal areas and their aerial geophysics, such as magnetism or radiometrics, which allows for a subsurface view of the Earth without needing to drill.

“It’s giving us a good idea of where we can narrow down the areas to look and eliminate some of the other areas – some of these formations are warm, but not quite hot and are at a lower threshold than what we’re looking for,” said Metesh, who estimates that the report will be out next year.

Geothermal energy production requires three key components: surface water and shallow groundwater seeping deep toward the Earth’s heated interior. There, fluid warms to high enough temperatures to rise in fault lines as either hot water or steam, eventually reaching the surface. In shallow geothermal features like hot springs, accessing heat is relatively easy. But deep heat sources, those 10,000 feet and beyond, require large drills to access.

Current efforts by the Bureau of Mines and Geology pull available data from oil and gas exploration wells and seismic data indicative of fault-line fracture zones to “define and assess subsurface geology in areas that demonstrate higher-than-background temperatures.”

Angela Seligman, senior geoscientist at the nonprofit environmental organization Clean Air Task Force, notes that since extraction methods have recently improved, power plants can more easily access deep geothermal energy and produce energy from lower temperature resources more efficiently.

“We would like to think that all regions are thinking about geothermal energy as an important source of reliable electricity that is available 24/7,” Seligman said, “and that is also clean in terms of having little to no air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions.”

Metesh is optimistic about finding sites in Montana, sparking interest, and marrying the technology.

“As population grows and as demand for energy certainly grows, I think geothermal is going to become more and more important,” Metesh said.

Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said the solar plants will bring clean energy to the local grid.
The solar plants are expected to generate over $100 million each in combined state and local taxes and about 300 jobs during peak construction, Treaty Oak said.
State regulators and local parish governments must also approve each of the solar plants.
So far in 2025, Meta has signed agreements to purchase more than 3 gigawatts of solar power from U.S. companies.","Facebook parent company Meta will contract to purchase power generated at two new solar energy plants in Louisiana, a move that will help power the company’s new $10 billion data center and meet its long-term climate goals.

Meta has signed an agreement with Texas-based Treaty Oak Clean Energy, a builder and operator of utility-scale solar and battery storage projects, to supply power generated at the 200-megawatt Hollis Creek Solar Plant in Sabine Parish and the 185-megawatt Beekman Solar Plant in Morehouse Parish. The plants will deliver a combined 385 megawatts to the local grid in Entergy‘s territory in northeast and west central Louisiana, Treaty Oak said in a statement.

While Meta will purchase the renewable energy credits associated with the two plants, the electricity produced will help power the social media giant’s new AI data center under construction in Richland Parish. As part of its strategy to reach net-zero emissions by 2030, Meta typically either purchases carbon removal credits or invests in renewable power projects connected to the same grid as its data centers and offices.

Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said the solar plants will bring clean energy to the local grid. “When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid — and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy while contributing to local energy resilience and economic growth across Louisiana.”

The announcement follows the Louisiana Public Service Commission’s approval in August of a settlement with the Southern Renewable Energy Association, Walmart, the Sierra Club and others that allows Entergy to build three new natural gas generation plants and transmission facilities to power Meta’s data center, as reported by The Center Square.

As part of the settlement, Entergy committed to the expedited procurement and certification of up to 1,500 megawatts of solar or hybrid power, which Meta will use to help meet its clean energy targets. Entergy also agreed to update its request for proposals process for renewables to include wind energy.

Meta’s Richland Parish data center is expected to consume about 2,000 megawatts of power when it goes online, with its electricity demand potentially reaching as much as 5,000 gigawatts.

The solar plants are expected to generate over $100 million each in combined state and local taxes and about 300 jobs during peak construction, Treaty Oak said. The company expects to bring both solar facilities into service in the third quarter of 2027. State regulators and local parish governments must also approve each of the solar plants.

Treaty Oak, a portfolio company of Macquarie Asset Management, began construction on a 100-megawatt solar power plant in Arkansas in October 2024 and expects to begin producing clean energy in the first or second quarter of 2026.

Macquarie Asset Management is one of the world’s largest infrastructure managers with more than 105 gigawatts of green energy assets currently under development or in operation. On Oct. 23, Louisiana regulators approved a 200-megawatt solar plant near Bogalusa in Washington Parish being developed by Galehead Development, a subsidiary of Macquarie Asset Management.

Meta has contracted to purchase power generated at solar facilities in other states as well. The company agreed on Oct. 27 to purchase 600 megawatts from a large solar farm near Lubbock, Texas, which will feed the local grid beginning in 2027. So far in 2025, Meta has signed agreements to purchase more than 3 gigawatts of solar power from U.S. companies.

To meet a pledge to be “water positive” by 2030, Meta has vowed to restore more water than it uses in its operations, and earlier this year the company committed to a reforestation and wetland treatment project at Bayou Pierre in the Red River watershed, near the company’s data center site in northeast Louisiana.

Meta is partnering with Houston-based Resource Environmental Solutions to improve water quality in the watershed through the restoration of a 316-acre cattle pasture to native forested upland and wetland habitats, according to Meta’s website. The company estimates the project will restore 36.1 million gallons of water annually to the Red River watershed.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/11/5.-Depositphotos_solar-panel.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:44.407087

Last week, Carolyn Fortuna had an interesting article on Kamala Harris. Within that article, Harris had a quote that asked an important question: “Why. Didn’t. I. Separate. Myself. From. Joe. Biden?”

Overall, the most obvious answer to that question was that she didn’t have much time. Introducing ideas takes time, especially when you are busy trying to introduce yourself to people. Getting those people to understand those new ideas takes more time. Getting them to see the implications is not quick or easy. Candidates tend to listen to polls for what people want now and then repeat it back to them. Staying the course is easier.

But we have time now. Time before the next presidential election. Time to explore new ideas. People have time to wrap their minds around them. We have the time to change course. Time to explore how to separate ourselves from the past and take a new path into the future.

Trump’s simplicity clearly reveals flaws in approaches that might have been less noticeable with a more moderate execution. Opinions are shifting against Trump’s policies, especially regarding trade. We can further expose bad policies. We can create contrast with better policy. Leaders have an opportunity to lead on policy ideas, even if they are not yet in power to execute them.

We also are free to separate ourselves from Biden. Blind loyalty does not help. We are free to criticize. The election is over. We do not have to debate whether distancing ourselves helps Trump. People can still support their team while policy evolves. Holding onto bad policy out of loyalty hurts us going forward.

Which gets to another article by Steve Hanley on trade. Whether or not you think anyone can truly win a trade war, the US is clearly losing. Tariffs are being taken up by a the Supreme Court this week, which could have a long-term impact not only on trade, but also on presidential powers. A shift in direction on trade could differentiate from the disfunction and lead to better overall policy moving forward.

Protectionism Increases the Price of Cleantech

Tariffs increase prices. Not just when a Republican is in office. When those tariffs target cleantech, they raise prices compared to fossil fuels and legacy industry. Subsidies can only partially compensate. Despite the “Inflation Reduction Act,” the net effect was increased US prices with trailing renewable energy and EV adoption rates.

In the US, we pay over three times as much per watt on solar panels compared to China. That price does not count the 45X transferable manufacturing tax credits that also add up to more than the total cost of solar panels in China. Those tax credits continue under Trump, even though the 30% residential consumer tax credit is going away at the end of the year. With a change in trade policies, solar panel prices could be closer to Europe.

The average transaction price for EVs in the US in August was $57,245, according to Kelley Blue Book, which is more than three times BYD’s average selling price of $16,700 for 2024. Those are not apples to apples metrics, as BYD’s number was the price of vehicles sold to dealers, rather than the retail price. However, even when factoring in the $7,500 tax credit, our prices were still far more than double. Now, the rising protectionism on materials and components and the elimination of consumer subsidies are poised to make EVs even more expensive. Many manufacturer subsidies also continue for EVs, including the $45/kWh Battery Production Tax Credit, but we are not meaningfully closing the price gap. Trade has the potential to drop EV prices below legacy fossil-fueled vehicles.

Increasing the price of cleantech has economic consequences. For solar, the bulk of jobs are associated with installation and implementation. Multiplying the cost of the critical enabling component impacts net jobs. Most of the economic and environmental benefit from clean technology comes from the decades of usage, rather than the initial manufacturing. Increasing the price of clean technology slows adoption and the resulting usage. That perpetuates fossil fuel use and extractive economic models. That put us on the wrong path in the long term.

Politics of Protectionism

Biden and Trump are easily the two most protectionist US presidents since Herbert Hoover. There is a simplistic “us vs. them” mindset behind protectionism that doesn’t appreciate the increased value creation that accompanies increased value exchange between countries. Trade is not a zero-sum game. Hoover’s protectionist policies amplified the Great Depression, which taught an economic lesson the hard way. Many people, unfortunately, forgot that lesson. The continued inflation of prices under Trump will likely lead to a painful reminder.

Among Democrats, Biden was the most protectionist President in the two-century history of the Democratic Party. There are relatively few policies that extend from the pre-Civil War Democratic Party through to the post-Civil Rights Democratic Party other than an aversion to tariffs. There have been some outlier policies, like LBJ’s chicken tax, but other Democratic presidents removed more trade barriers than they added. Biden also issued more sanctions than any prior president of either party. There is potential to differentiate from both Biden and Trump.

Not that free trade is a purely Democratic idea. The intellectual conservative movement, with people like Ayn Rand and William F. Buckley, supported free trade. Republicans after WWII saw the economic errors of Hoover and tended to support free trade with an overall bipartisan consensus. Up until Trump. I know Republicans who would like a return to more intelligent trade policy. There is also an opportunity for a Republican who decides to distance himself from the obvious destruction Trump is creating.

Trump started a love affair with tariffs that Biden accelerated. Biden being more protectionist in action than Trump’s first term but less protectionist than what Trump proposed for his second term did not create much contrast. Having a nuanced presentation on the same policy direction does not create a lot of differentiation either. Trump has taken protectionism to new levels in his second term. With enough time, Harris could have differentiated herself with support of free trade, rather than just continuing a slower protectionist escalation. If Harris had the opportunity to communicate a policy focused on increasing trade to support cleantech adoption and accelerate progress, the contrast would be even more significant.

Own Being Smart

At this point, many are probably thinking that what I just suggested would be political suicide. The common assumption is that there is no way that our populist politics based on personal attacks and soundbites would support rational policies. Xenophobes will persist in their ignorance. Bigotry will perpetuate its fallacies. But maybe. Just maybe. We are not giving people enough credit.

Maybe, if we take the time to talk to people in terms they can understand, they will start to understand the concept. Jargon and acronyms can be avoided, but full sentences and logic are good things. Simply parroting back what pollsters say voters already believe might get agreement. But it is not evolving the beliefs that can evolve policy.

A leader should lead people to a better path forward. Elections should not just be a popularity contest or a contest of insults. Pandering to the most ignorant elements of society can be effective in drumming up votes in the short term, but it really does not set up a competition that educated Democrats are positioned to win long term. A more intellectual approach could turn some people off. However, were those people ever going to strongly support a highly educated, mixed-race female lawyer in the first place?

So, own it. Take the smart position and take the time to explain that position. Republicans can also take smart positions with a more conservative approach. We can have intelligent debates from different perspectives. We have time before the next presidential election to shift the narrative. And many people are already realizing that there is something wrong with Trump’s policies, such as protectionism. A little guidance can help people to understand what is wrong. Taking a slightly less stupid position does not create contrast. Try being smart.

We can take a smart position on trade. And that is just one of several ways that we can pursue smarter policy moving forward.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/green-shipping.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:59.103336

Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue.
Gates noted his personal funding of both climate change and public health efforts are increasing.
If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates told reporters, according to The Associated Press.
Gates, in the Monday interview, pushed back on climate scientists who suggested he was setting up a false dichotomy between mitigating poverty and addressing climate change.","Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates on Monday defended his call to refocus the climate debate on prioritizing human welfare.

In an interview with Axios n Monday evening, in front of about 1,000 students at the California Institute of Technology, Gates stood by the controversial memo he released last week, in which he argued that climate change is a serious problem but will not bring about the end of civilization. He also urged the world to focus more on preventing human suffering than on limiting rising temperatures.

“I’m glad people are listening,” Gates said at the event, noting it’s difficult to convey “nuanced positions nowadays.”

Gates has faced significant backlash from all sides of the climate debate since releasing his controversial memo on Oct. 28. Many conservatives have characterized the memo as a backpedaling of the pro-climate agenda.

“I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform last week.

But Gates, at the Monday event, pushed back against that take.

“It’s a gigantic misreading of the memo,” Gates said of Trump’s view and similar sentiments. Gates noted his personal funding of both climate change and public health efforts are increasing.

“I didn’t think the memo was going to convert the non-believers into believers, and sure enough, it didn’t convert them,” Gates said at the event.

At a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the memo’s release, Gates recognized that the “tough truths about climate” contained in the memo were likely to be controversial.

“If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates told reporters, according to The Associated Press. “It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.”

In the memo, Gates criticized the climate community for focusing too much on near-term goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diverting resources from effective ways of improving lives and mitigating suffering today.

Gates, in the Monday interview, pushed back on climate scientists who suggested he was setting up a false dichotomy between mitigating poverty and addressing climate change.

“What world do they live in?” Gates said, noting many foreign aid budgets must choose between climate and public health. “This is a numeric game in a world with very finite resources, more finite than they should be.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/AP24260763800896-e1754390789918.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:43.735659

[xxiv] Our Mission and What We Do, U.S. EPA, https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do (last accessed Oct. 22, 2025) [https://perma.cc/5WZE-95C9].","Blog by: Emma Carlo

Following a change in presidential administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is asking the U.S. Court of Appeals in a civil suit to rescind, and therefore weaken, regulations regarding safe drinking water.[i] These regulations addressed the presence of six specific short-chain chemicals called PFAS which are known to increase an individual's risk of cancer and other health risks such as kidney and liver damage, harm to reproductive systems, and cardiovascular diseases.[ii] The danger of these chemicals is evident by the fact that even low levels of the chemicals can still cause adverse health risks.[iii] Importantly, more than 70 million people utilize water systems with PFAS levels that are above the safe limit.[iv] Additionally, these chemicals, also known as “forever chemicals,” are known to take upwards of thousands of years to breakdown in the environment.[v] Instead of maintaining the existing regulations for PFAS chemicals, the newly proposed regulations will only filter out two types of the PFAS rather than all six of the ones regulated by the prior administration, hence leaving the country at risk for drinking water with higher levels of contamination than what is considered safe.[vi]

This action is demonstrative of the trend towards deregulation currently happening within the EPA.[vii] Where the core of this action is hidden under the guise of improving efficiency, the true purpose is one of corporate favoritism and allotting more power to the chemical industry, rather than a true concern for regulatory burden or the country’s health.[viii] This action revealed that the current administration and utility companies have put a price on the cost of safe drinking water for the public.[ix] The estimated $800 million cost of implementation to filter out PFAS is considered too expensive in protecting public health and has instead been characterized as an economic burden.[x] Moreover, environmental advocates characterize this action as wealthy industries taking advantage of the relationships they have with the administration.[xi]

The current limits on PFAS were recently imposed by the prior administration through an action which environmental advocates counted as a win both for the health of the people and the planet.[xii] Specifically, these limits, known as maximum contaminant levels, set the legal standard as to how much of these chemicals can be allowed in drinking water and still be considered safe.[xiii] This action was the first ever limit to be imposed on such chemicals and were expected to reduce exposure to them for over 100 million people, of which would have prevented 9,600 deaths as well as 30,000 illnesses.[xiv] While the water utility companies were set to fulfill these regulations and fully complete them by 2029, by loosening the reins on regulation the EPA risks severe delay and even potential elimination of safer drinking water as a whole.[xv] Unfortunately, this dangerous choice suggests the conclusion that $800 million is worth more to utility companies and the EPA than the cost of 9,600 lives saved by more stringent safety requirements on drinking water.

Despite the current administration promising to provide clean water and better environmental protection, it also promised fewer and looser regulations.[xvi] As such, there will be less regulations regarding not only drinking water, but greenhouse gas emissions, car emissions, and clean-up standards for coal plant waste.[xvii] The contradictory nature of promising safe and clean drinking water while reversing important regulations that would guarantee it has led many activists to call the EPA a mockery as this deregulation will continue to place the health of Americans and the environment in jeopardy.[xviii] Deregulation of clean drinking water as proposed by the EPA will eliminate or delay desperately needed protection for over 100 million people with water that has contaminants well above the safety standard.[xix]

However, not all hope is lost in the fight against PFAS. Many environmental nonprofit organizations have already filed suit against the EPA, countering the deregulation as a violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.[xx] Generally, this Act provides an anti-backsliding provision which prevents the EPA from repealing or weakening regulations once they are established.[xxi] Thus, to get around this provision, the EPA is asking the court to repeal this regulation on the grounds that it was improperly enacted.[xxii] The decision of the court rests on whether the regulations were properly enacted as per the Safe Drinking Water Act or whether they were improperly enacted on a procedural basis.[xxiii]

Ultimately, in attempting to deregulate safe drinking water, the EPA has proven to be an oxymoron. This current attempt at deregulation does not align with their mission of wanting to “protect human health and the environment,” but is indicative of avoiding expensive implementation costs.[xxiv] Unfortunately, the EPA does not seem to prioritize the very thing they were created to protect and made a costly decision which will adversely affect the health of America.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-11-04 20:02:08+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Musk's partisan actions cost Tesla more than 1 million car sales - Los Angeles Times,"Michael Hiltzik, www.latimes.com, michael-hiltzik",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-11-04/musks-right-wing-politics-cost-tesla-more-than-1-million-car-sales,"A new study from Yale researchers has put meat on that bone.
Tesla sales rose in Republican areas after that break, but not enough to offset the Democratic decline.
The partisan divide in EV sales has been widely studied.
In both periods, overall EV sales in the U.S. rose, by 7.3% last year and 11.7% through the third quarter this year.
The Yale researchers took pains to distinguish those factors from the Musk effect by matching auto registrations to county-level Democratic and Republican votes.","If you’ve spent any time on a California freeway, you’ve probably seen an increasing number of Tesla cars on the road bearing anti-Musk bumper stickers.

“I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,” reads one. “Eco-friendly, not Elon-friendly,” reads another. Some bear Elon Musk’s name or image with a bright red slash through them.

Those defensive messages would seem to validate the reasonable expectation that Tesla Chief Executive Musk’s foray into partisan politics — specifically, far-right politics — has sapped the appeal among Democrats and liberals for a product that once proclaimed its owners’ commitment to the fight against global warming and other progressive policies.

A new study from Yale researchers has put meat on that bone. They found that Musk’s partisan behavior has cost Tesla as many as 1.26 million car sales since October 2022. That’s when Musk acquired the social media platform Twitter and gave greater access on it to the far right and other extremist voices.

Musk intensified his partisan journey during the run-up to the 2024 presidential campaign, when he heavily funded Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, and after Trump’s inauguration, when he launched the DOGE service, which strewed chaos throughout the federal government by instituting mass layoffs purportedly in the name of budget-cutting.

What the sales numbers say is that “it’s probably not a good idea to alienate your core constituency with extracurricular political activities if you’re a CEO,” says Kenneth T. Gillingham, an economics professor at Yale’s School of the Environment and lead author of the paper.

The Yale researchers’ analysis of sales figures show that Tesla sales were stronger in Democratic-leaning counties than in Republican counties — until October 2022, when they began to plateau in Democratic areas and then began to fall. Tesla sales rose in Republican areas after that break, but not enough to offset the Democratic decline.

The partisan divide in EV sales has been widely studied. Republican and conservative car buyers have never been a target market for EVs generally, and Teslas particularly.

The Yale study also found that overall EV sales in the U.S. continued to rise after October 2022, benefiting non-Tesla makers of EVs and gas-electric hybrids at virtually a one-to-one rate—those products gained by about 1.26 million sales above what they would have been without the Musk effect.

I asked Tesla to comment on the Yale findings, but haven’t received a reply.

The Yale study points to the effects of CEO outspokenness for good or ill, especially when their topics have little or nothing to do with their companies’ direct interests. It’s one thing to go public with concerns about corporate taxes or tariffs, quite another to divagate into divisive political issues such as global warming or anti-LGBTQ discrimination.

The researchers also point to the Musk effect’s implications for public ecological initiatives, notably California’s EV policies. California’s official target is for 25% of new vehicle sales be for zero emission vehicles next, and 100% by 2035. But ZEV sales have stalled out, according to recent figures.

“The 2026 target was set when Tesla was rapidly increasing its sales,” Gillingham told me. “Without the Musk effect, it would have been easily met. Now it looks unlikely.”

In part that’s because buyers who formerly would have opted for a Tesla have shifted to other brands, but are choosing hybrids, which don’t meet the EV sales standard, rather than full electric models.

The study comes just as Tesla shareholders are scheduled to vote on a pay package for Musk with an estimated value of $1 trillion. The vote will come at the company’s annual meeting Thursday.

As I reported, that pay package treats Musk as the sole indispensable figure in Tesla’s future. But although the Tesla board members who approved the pay proposal described the milestones Musk must meet to collect the full value, the standards have been tweaked to make them more achievable than they appear on the surface.

Whether Tesla shareholders will ever come to see Musk as a drag on the company rather than its savior isn’t currently clear, but with Tesla stock trading at a meme-level price-earnings multiple of about 320 and a market value of more than $1.5 trillion, that epiphany plainly hasn’t occurred yet.

The effect that CEOs’ political excursions have on their companies’ fortunes has been debated for years. The common conclusion is that it depends on whether their statements and positions align with those of their core customer base, or flout them — whether they will “bolster brand loyalty or trigger a backlash against the CEO’s company, as Aaron K. Chatterji of Duke and Michael Toffel of Harvard wrote in 2016.

Chatterji and Toffel examined the impact of several CEOs’ criticisms of Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2015, which expanded the ability of defendants in civil lawsuits, including those alleging discrimination, to cite their religious beliefs as justification for their actions.

Among the law’s public critics was Apple CEO Tim Cook. Chatterji and Toffel found that Cook’s statement that the law might foster anti-LGBTQ discrimination reduced public acceptance of the law significantly, and even increased the popularity of Apple products. Other corporate leaders have spoken out in favor of international initiatives to fight global warming.

Such forthright commentary about current events and issues are rare, however. The reason may be that it’s difficult for a high-profile executive to keep track of the shifting winds of public discourse; what may appear to be a popular position at one time can draw brickbats as public opinion evolves. Corporate interests may also outweigh the desire to be heard on issues of public concern.

In recent years, many corporate leaders pledged to stand firm against right-wing assaults on voting rights, access to women’s reproductive healthcare, diversity and democracy itself.

Many companies initially promised to end or review their campaign contributions to the 147 Republican lawmakers who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over Trump. Over time, as it happened, many resumed their contributions.

Toyota, for instance, continued to contribute to some of those politicians, explaining that it “supports candidates based on their position on issues that are important to the auto industry and the company ... We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress back on their votes on the electoral certification.”

How CEO comments are received by their presumed audience can depend on their context. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff was long regarded as an echt San Francisco liberal billionaire. But last month he came out in favor of deploying the National Guard to patrol the city’s streets, evidently aligning himself with Trump’s militarization of local law enforcement.

Clearly, Benioff didn’t read the room. His statement caused a furor, prompting some entertainment figures to drop out of Salesforce’s annual tech conference, Dreamforce, causing the prominent venture investor Ron Conway to resign from a Salesforce philanthropic board, and culminating in Benioff’s apologetically withdrawing his suggestion.

Musk is a unique personage in the CEO ranks, as the Yale researchers observe — “the world’s wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization.”

Tesla’s sales pattern is also unusual in terms of the EV market. The company’s unit sales in the U.S. fell year-to-year in 2024 (by 5.5%) and through the third quarter of this year (by 4.3%). In both periods, overall EV sales in the U.S. rose, by 7.3% last year and 11.7% through the third quarter this year.

Tesla has faced a raft of challenges not directly related to Musk’s personal behavior: an aging product lineup, competitive models from Hyundai, Audi, GM and Ford, and the Edsel-esque sales flop of Musk’s pet project, the Cybertruck.

The Yale researchers took pains to distinguish those factors from the Musk effect by matching auto registrations to county-level Democratic and Republican votes. They found that “more Democratic counties show an increasing propensity to purchase Teslas over time prior to October 2022.” After that point, the trend reversed.

By the first quarter of this year, they found, without the Musk effect, Tesla monthly sales would have been about 150% higher than it was. From October 2022 through the first quarter, they calculated, the lost sales totaled 1 million to 1.26 million vehicles, or 67% to 83% of actual sales during the period.

Over the same time frame, sales of EVs and hybrids by Tesla’s rivals gained 17% to 22% due to consumers rejecting Musk, providing “a clear example of very significant adverse impacts on corporate performance due to the social and political decisions by one of the world’s best-known CEOs.”

The Yale paper suggests that Musk may be too well-known to be good for Tesla. His identification with the company has long been crucial for its success and for its high-flying stock price. The new study suggests that Musk has turned, at long last, into a negative.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20f40ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5390x2830+0+382/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2F2c%2Feba036fe40b0b290e86da0d56353%2F1497888-me-tesla-drivers-betrayed-by-musk-5-gmf.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:36.236039

2,000 Miles for 2 Years

The offer (see Tesla’s current offers here) says that trading in an old car for a new Tesla will result in 2,000 free Supercharging miles. That’s a nice thing to have for long-distance travel, especially considering the size of the Supercharging network.

The “Supercharging miles” must be utilized within two years of delivery, or they will expire:

“Terms & Conditions

Promotion requires completed trade-in of a gas or hybrid vehicle and is subject to change or end at any time. Supercharging miles expire two years after delivery date and cannot be postponed, assigned or redeemed for cash. Supercharging-related fees, like congestion fees, still apply. Used cars and B2B sales not eligible. Promotional miles may be revoked if the trade-in cannot be completed for any reason. Actual miles may vary and is dependent on factors like driving behavior and environment. Terms and conditions apply.”

What Models?

Tesla already offers Free Lifetime Supercharging for the Model S and Model X as part of the Luxe Package (standard on all versions). The same concerns the top-of-the-line Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast.

This means that the latest incentive will only apply for the Model 3, Model Y, and regular Cybertruck AWD. These are less expensive Tesla EVs, so the incentive is also much smaller compared to Free Lifetime Supercharging.

The Value of Free Supercharging

It’s always tricky to estimate the value of free Supercharging. The prices of energy vary significantly between states, and there are different use cases.

If we assume a Tesla Model Y with an energy efficiency of 3.5-4 miles/kWh, then 2,000 miles should result in 500-571 kWh. The numbers might be slightly lower for the Model 3, and noticeably higher for the Cybertruck AWD.

We are not sure how Tesla calculates the number of kWh a user should get (most likely based on the EPA test cycle), but assuming 570 kWh and roughly $0.40/kWh, the incentive’s value is $228. It might be closer to $200 for the Model 3 and closer to $350 for the Cybertruck AWD.

That’s a relatively small perk, good to have when switching to an EV, but definitely not a game-changer.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Group_51-3x-Model-Y-Perf.-Premium-and-Standard.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:28.719677

Meanwhile, intense opposition has hounded similar projects, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success. But Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline is being praised because of community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing the gas before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles of pipe and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. The South Dakota Legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit stated.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations like a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was sent to a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska. His home is half a mile from the pipeline.

Tallgrass benefited from working with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost said.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold Nebraska, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://djcoregon.com/files/2025/11/1105_Pipeline_Infrastructure_WEB.jpg?_t=1762284559,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:15.403101

Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, that aims to reduce electric bills, create jobs and strengthen Illinois’ electric grid.

“Homes and businesses across my district are being forced to spend far too much on rising energy costs,” said Stuart. “This legislation will provide immediate short-term relief while making strategic investments in clean energy to secure lower consumer energy costs long term.”

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket. Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further.

In an effort to combat these rising costs, highlights of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) include:

– Virtual Power Plants: By capturing clean energy already being generated as surplus power by home solar panels and other green sources, better coordination through virtual power plants can redistribute energy across the system and lower costs for all consumers. This change is expected to reduce bills by up to $4.34 per month for Ameren users.

– Increased Battery Storage: Adding battery storage will make the grid more reliable and affordable, further acting as insurance for the system. This improvement is expected to lower bills for Ameren customers by up to $8 each month.

– Energy Efficiency: By expanding and investing in energy efficiency programs, Ameren consumers are expected to save up to $1.41 per month.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill—including 50,000 manufacturing jobs projected to be lost in Illinois. As utility demands increase during the fall and winter months, Senate Bill 25 will play a significant role in meeting the state’s energy needs, strengthening reliability and helping manage untenable costs for customers for both short- and long-term relief.

The European Union's member states have been haggling for months over two separate targets for slashing greenhouse-gas emissions: one for 2035 they must bring to the UN climate talks, and the other for 2040.

""This is a crucial day,"" French Environment Minister Monique Barbut told reporters in Brussels -- warning that turning up empty-handed at the November 10-21 talks in Brazil's city of Belem would spell ""disaster"" for the EU.

Behind only China, the United States and India in terms of emissions, the EU has been the most committed of the major polluters to climate action and has already cut emissions by 37 percent compared to 1990 levels.

But after blazing a trail, the EU's political landscape has shifted right, and climate concerns have taken a backseat to defence and competitiveness -- amid concerns in some capitals that greening Europe's economy is harming growth.

""It's very, very difficult,"" said an EU diplomat, summing up the state of play in Brussels late Tuesday.

Denmark, which holds the bloc's rotating presidency, was understood to be working hard to win over Italy, one of the countries most sceptical of the proposed targets.

The most urgent challenge for ministers is to reach a unanimous deal on an EU emissions target for 2035, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which Paris Agreement signatories are supposed to bring to the COP30.

""I want our heads of state and government to go to Brazil with a very strong mandate, a clear leadership role for Europe,"" German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider declared on arrival -- saying the decision must be ""today"".

Beyond the Belem target, the EU hopes to lock in the support of a weighted majority of countries for the next big climate target set out by the European Commission on the path to carbon neutrality by 2050.

The EU executive said in July it wanted to cut emissions by 90 percent by 2040, compared to 1990 levels -- a major step towards net zero.

But the bloc's capitals have yet to endorse that next step, which would require sweeping changes to industry and daily life at a time of growing concern over adverse impacts on Europe's economy.

Spain and the Nordic countries support the 2040 proposal, as does Germany, with some caveats. But Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Italy remain opposed, citing risks to their industrial sectors.

Heavyweight France, meanwhile, has kept observers guessing on its position -- demanding guarantees its nuclear sector would not lose out under green transition plans and wiggle room on emissions should Europe's forests absorb less carbon than expected.

- 'Not pretty' -

To win over the staunchest sceptics, Tuesday's talks were covering a range of ""flexibilities"" for member states, including letting countries count carbon credits purchased to finance projects outside Europe.

A commission pledge for credits to account for up to three percent of a nation's 2040 emission cuts failed to win over hardliners, with countries pushing for a higher threshold of five percent.

Some also want the overall objective reassessed every two years.

Regarding the 2035 target for Belem, EU countries in September agreed to a non-binding ""statement of intent"" for the bloc to cut emissions by between 66.25 percent and 72.5 percent by 2035.

To avoid deadlock just days before COP30, ministers are expected Tuesday to formalise that range as the bloc's legally binding NDC under the Paris Agreement.

Environmental groups have accused states of undermining the bloc's climate ambitions with loopholes.

But a diplomat involved in the process defended the compromise shaping up in Brussels, while conceding it was ""not necessarily pretty"".

Bridging the electric vehicle divide in America Electric vehicle adoption in the United States certainly isn’t uniform.","As the U.S. accelerates towards a future of innovative transportation, not all states are keeping up. The rate of electric vehicle adoption across the country is more varied than many realize and is often shaped on a state-by-state basis by state policies, ability to deploy infrastructure, and economic or demographic factors. With some states surging ahead and others lagging behind, it’s crucial to map and analyze the differences to understand how to close the gaps.

Using data from the Department of Energy, state transportation agencies, and the third quarterly electric vehicle report by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, The General has put together a guide to help you navigate these trends.

The leaders: Top states driving EV adoption

As outlined within the Alliance for Automotive Innovation Q3-2024 electric vehicle report, some states are already recording remarkably high electric vehicle shares among their new auto sales. Other states are going even further, boasting significant electric vehicle fleets compared to their population.

Many West Coast and Northeastern states are leading the charge. However, the data also shows an interesting statistic: The highest state has only 5.8% adoption of electric vehicles in operation. This goes to show that despite the rapid evolution of technology, its adoption is still in its infancy.

California: The undisputed champion

California is the undisputed champion of electric vehicle adoption across the United States, holding the aforementioned 5.8% total electric vehicles among those in operation. This value amounts to over 1.8 million vehicles. Part of this is due to the fact that, as outlined in the report, the Clean Air Act allows California to set stricter emissions standards. This has incidentally led to accelerated growth of the market, in addition to the state’s long history of electric vehicle incentives and dense urban markets.

Washington: High per-capita performance

Washington also ranks as a top performer in the country, with 3.1%, or over 219,000, of their total vehicle fleet being made up of electric vehicles. While they are ranked fourth on a percentage basis, they are second only to California on a number basis. They are also one of the six states that adopted the ACC II ZEV mandate that goes into effect with the 2026 model year, which effectively prohibits the sale of new gas-powered vehicles.

Vermont: Small state, big impact

Vermont is special, not because it rivals California and Washington in terms of the number of electric vehicles in operation, but because of its market penetration. As outlined by Visual Capitalist data from the end of FY23, Vermont had one of the highest electric vehicle registration rates per 100,000 residents at roughly 1,100.

Falling behind: States struggling with EV adoption

While some states are surging ahead, others are still facing issues. There are more reasons than one for why a state may be lagging behind, but below are some of the key trends:

Mississippi: Lowest adoption in America

At 0.21% based on the Alliance for Automotive Innovation data, Mississippi has the lowest adoption rate in the country. It also has one of the lowest rates of electric vehicles per charger across the country at a meager 14, ranking it near the bottom for electric vehicle adoption in more ways than one.

Rural state challenges

One key challenge for electric vehicle adoption lies in the demographics of certain states. Small, dispersed, or lower-income states can sometimes face additional issues. Take the following three states, for instance:

North Dakota: North Dakota is the 48th most populated state and has a population density of only 11 people per square mile. Building out a charging infrastructure is expensive, and doing it for such a low population density can only exacerbate the issue.

Wyoming: Wyoming faces the same issue as North Dakota, with an even lower population and population density based on the same World Population Review Report. With few electric vehicles and limited grid connectivity given the space between people, adoption lags.

Arkansas: Unlike North Dakota and Wyoming, Arkansas has a larger population. However, the appetite for electric vehicles in the state has been cited as being low, particularly due to the rural nature and distance between potential charging sites.

Key factors driving the divide

There are some common barriers to entry for the electric vehicle market. It’s worth taking a deeper dive into three of the most prominent:

State policies and incentives

The states leading the charge are those that are pairing strong incentives with regulatory mandates. Six states adopted the mandate limiting gas-powered sales starting in 2026. Based on the same data source, an additional six signed up to start in the 2027 model year.

Beyond this, state policy extends further. California has 48% more electric vehicle chargers than gas nozzles now, demonstrating the investment in the technology. Other states more towards the bottom of the list simply aren’t matching this investment.

Charging infrastructure distribution

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation report also tells an interesting story regarding electric vehicles per public charger across the U.S. Buyers won’t commit to an electric vehicle without realistic access to a charging port, and the difference in charging density across the country is vast.

New Jersey, Illinois, Oklahoma and Hawai‘i rank at the bottom of electric vehicles per public charger. States that have a higher electric vehicle to port ratio face a greater potential strain and wait time at those sites, de-incentivizing purchasing such a vehicle.

Demographic and economic influences

Beyond state policy and infrastructure, there also could be socioeconomic conditions at play. The average transaction price for an electric vehicle sale in August 2025 was nearly $60,000, based on Kelley Blue Book data, which is no small sum. For states with smaller populations and less developed economies, the average salary range may put this price point far out of reach for the time being.

Looking Ahead: Future trends and implications

Continued investment into programs such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure plan outlined by the Department of Energy will be crucial to the future of the market. Another factor that will inevitably shape the market will be the cost of technology utilized in the construction of electric vehicles, as a reduction could bring the entry price point down far enough for more state populations to partake. Overall, though, it will take widespread state policy changes to ensure there is a reliable electricity supply and smart charging available to service electric vehicle fleets as they develop.

Bridging the electric vehicle divide in America

Electric vehicle adoption in the United States certainly isn’t uniform. While states like California, Washington, and Vermont are leading the charge, others are lagging behind due to socioeconomic and political factors. These reasons aren’t mysterious, and the right mix of policy changes and investments in infrastructure can make a significant dent. As the nation continues to adopt cleaner transportation, ensuring no state is left behind will be critical to the development of a nationwide electric vehicle infrastructure.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rpaPjeQLGzykNhVguBWx2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/stacker_642/587000606d8bc5446b789a9ab2ff3044,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:18.816270

Rivian’s expected gross loss is $39 million.","Rivian and Lucid entered this week’s third-quarter earnings with investors watching every dollar, every unit, and every forecast cut.

Rivian reports after the bell today, and Lucid follows on Wednesday, and both companies expect higher revenue and smaller adjusted losses, helped by what analysts say was likely the peak of U.S. EV sales before federal credits disappeared in September.

But the bigger story is the pressure ahead: shrinking margins, reduced production guidance, and a policy environment that just made life harder for “pure-EV” manufacturers.

RBC analyst Tom Narayan said, “Both of these are really challenged,” adding that in the near term, “it’s all about the underlying profitability.”

That profitability is exactly where the cracks show, because Rivian has already cut expectations for 2025 gross profit and adjusted earnings, while Lucid faces similar margin strain.

Both of these guys are trying to convince their current and potential investors that they have long-term plans worth sticking around for, but in an era of tight competition, they’re finding that harder than it used to be.

Credit cuts, tariffs, and changing policy reshape revenue outlooks

The Trump administration this fall removed the federal EV purchase incentive of up to $7,500 and also ended penalties for automakers who fall short on fuel-efficiency targets.

RJ Scaringe, Rivian’s CEO, said during the company’s last earnings call that the policy changes are “complex and rapidly evolving,” and will affect both performance and cash flow.

Rivian had expected $300 million in regulatory-credit revenue this year; that is now closer to $160 million. The company also lowered its gross profit forecast from a modest gain to roughly breakeven and carried out layoffs to cut expenses.

Tariffs are adding more pressure. Rivian said tariffs are costing the company “a couple thousand dollars per unit.” Lucid reported that tariffs hit its margins by $54 million in the second quarter.

Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs said the loss of Inflation Reduction Act credits could create a “double-digit percent headwind” for industry sales. Tesla, also a seller of regulatory credits, reported credit revenue dropping 44% in the third quarter, from $739 million to $417 million.

The third quarter was the high-water mark for EV demand before credits expired. Barclays analyst Dan Levy warned that it’s unclear how long the slowdown that follows will last, saying Q3 likely marks “the highest” U.S. EV market penetration for some time.

Rivian delivered 13,201 vehicles in Q3, a 32% increase from last year. Lucid delivered 4,078 vehicles, a 47% rise. Yet both remain unprofitable.

Rivian is expected to report a quarterly loss of $0.72 per share on $1.5 billion in revenue, compared to a $0.99 loss on $874 million last year. Rivian also now projects a core loss between $2 billion and $2.25 billion for 2025. Analysts have questioned its goal to reach EBITDA profitability by 2027.

Lucid is expected to report a $2.27 adjusted per-share loss on $379 million in revenue, nearly 90% growth from last year, but still with a gross loss of $255 million. Rivian’s expected gross loss is $39 million. Rivian shares are down less than 5% this year. Lucid shares are down roughly 45%, after a 1-for-10 reverse split.

New models and tech partnerships aim to prove future demand

Rivian is leaning hard on its upcoming R2 midsize vehicle, targeted at roughly $45,000 and scheduled to begin production in the first half of next year.

But many of Rivian’s competitors plan similar-priced midsize EVs with longer ranges, so you get why Wall Street is questioning how many units Rivian can realistically sell.

Rivian has a $5.8 billion software and electrical architecture partnership with Volkswagen, and the company has been promising that its next-generation system will support advanced driver-assistance features since at least Q1 2025.

Meanwhile, Lucid’s interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said their upcoming Gravity SUV and a new midsize platform, saying the company is “pushing the boundaries of what EVs can be.”

Lucid signed a $300 million deal with Uber in July to deploy 20,000 Gravity SUVs equipped with autonomous technology from Nuro over six years.

But Winterhoff admitted on Tuesday that:- “We are not where we want to be with Lucid Gravity production relative to our target at this point in the year. We believe we will significantly increase production in the second half of the year.”",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lucid.webp,N,,2025-11-04 15:04:49.112639

NEW BEDFORD — As the assembly line of turbine towers standing at the quayside of the staging terminal peters out, Vineyard Wind has more than doubled its power production, according to the latest federal data, even as the Trump administration keeps trying to shut down the offshore wind industry.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released the latest data on electricity sold by Vineyard Wind on Oct. 31. In the third (and latest) quarter, July through September, the project sold approximately 136,000 megawatt-hours of energy, up from 57,000 in the second quarter.

What does that mean for Massachusetts residents? The under-construction project sold enough electricity this summer to power an estimated 50,000 homes, up from about 33,000 in the spring, The Light calculated. (Depending on the residential consumption over a month or year, the homes-powered estimate can vary by thousands.)

Vineyard Wind and state officials say the project will power up to 400,000 homes when completed. The company declined to comment on the latest figures, which it reported to the federal agency.

The project is producing power from about 50% of its turbines as of October, according to an Oct. 28 report from Iberdrola, the project’s parent company. It’s an increase since July, when company officials said 17 turbines were generating nearly 30% of the project’s power.

What’s left?

More than two years since it sent the first set of turbine components out from the Port of New Bedford, Vineyard Wind has at most five of its 62 turbine towers left to install as of the end of October.

At the start of October, a Vineyard Wind spokesperson said the project was delivering at a capacity of 400 megawatts, or about half of the 806-megawatt project.

Satellite images from late October reviewed by The Light, which capture the project’s expansive white blades popping against the atmospheric view of the Atlantic, showed at least 56 towers were standing. Most of the towers have blades, but several don’t.

Vessel shipments suggest 57 towers may now be in, but more recent satellite images are not clear or capture clouds covering the lease site.

This week, vessel trackers show the installation vessel, the Sea Installer, near the location for a turbine that was shipped out on a barge in recent days, suggesting the installation of the 58th tower is underway.

In September, Vineyard Wind had only 10 “loadouts” to go, meaning 10 more barge shipments that usually — though not always — contain three blades, two tower pieces, and one nacelle.

It’s not clear whether workers will complete installation by the year’s end, as Iberdrola projected this summer. Construction usually slows in the colder seasons, which brings with it stronger winds and seas.

If Vineyard Wind doesn’t finish by December, the project has another six months on its lease to utilize the state’s commerce terminal.

New Bedford’s Marine Commerce Terminal, previously packed with blades, nacelles and towers for Vineyard Wind, has grown sparse. Blue metal cages that once hugged the components are now empty and stacked, waiting to be shipped out.

After all 62 towers are installed, work may continue with the help of a second specialized installation vessel, the Wind Pace, which has been at work removing blades and taking them to Canada as part of the government-mandated response to the July 2024 blade failure. The new replacement blades have been coming from a French factory.

In October, the terminal took in three vessel shipments from France, altogether carrying more than 20 blades, as well as a shipment of tower components. Meanwhile, one vessel carrying at least four blades set course for Canada, according to Port Authority vessel alerts and images shared by West Island Weather Station.

Vineyard Wind, 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard, is Massachusetts’ only offshore wind farm currently under construction and generating power.

New England Wind 1 and SouthCoast Wind, two other Massachusetts wind projects that intend to base some operations or construction out of New Bedford, face mounting delays due to the Trump administration’s opposition to the industry.

The Trump administration is looking to remand critical permits for those two Massachusetts projects. From January through September, the administration took more than 20 actions against multiple offshore wind projects (and the industry at large) through numerous agencies.

Revolution Wind, contracted by Rhode Island and Connecticut, is also under construction to the west of Vineyard Wind. Its developer, Orsted, is using New London, Connecticut, as its staging area. Sunrise Wind, another Orsted project, is in earlier stages of construction. Orsted completed a 12-turbine farm, South Fork Wind, last year.

Estimating homes powered

According to the FERC report, Vineyard Wind 1 produced about 136,200,000 kilowatt-hours of energy in the last quarter, which spanned July, August and September.

Using recent U.S. Energy Information Administration data, which captures monthly residential consumption only up to August of this year, The Light estimated about 50,000 homes powered for just the months of July and August. During this period, the average household usage was about 760 kilowatt-hours in Massachusetts.

Usage is often higher in the summer, as that’s when people are running their air conditioners. It’s greater than the monthly average calculated over a year, which was 580 kilowatt-hours in 2024.

Using the lower, year-round figure, The Light estimates Vineyard Wind sold enough energy to power up to 78,000 homes.

ISO New England, the grid operator, publishes data on what resources are powering the grid at any given time. However, the company does not disclose the electrical output of specific projects, citing “confidentiality rules.”

Capacity figures

The project’s 806-megawatts figure represents the nameplate capacity, which is the amount of energy a project could generate if its turbines ran 100% of the time at optimal wind speeds.

In reality, a wind turbine’s output ranges, affected by wind speeds and downtime for maintenance; it varies on a given day, week, and month; and it underpins an important concept: capacity factor. If a 100-megawatt project has a capacity factor of 50%, it produces 50 megawatts on average.

Offshore wind projects have a capacity factor ranging between about 40% and 50% (sometimes a bit higher). It’s comparable to the rates achieved by coal and natural gas plants, per federal data.

Vineyard Wind has not provided details on the project’s capacity factor thus far. A 2020 construction and operations plan for the project listed a capacity factor “in excess of 45%.”

Generally, capacity factor increases in the winter, when wind speeds are higher. Because of seasonal variability, this metric is best calculated over the course of one year.

It’s likely that once Vineyard Wind reaches full power, the FERC electricity reports will vary by season.",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1387.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:42.953903

DETROIT — Challenges are mounting for all-electric vehicle manufacturers Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group as the companies try to sell investors on a brighter, more profitable future to come.

But things could get worse before they get better as both automakers are set to report third-quarter results this week, starting with Rivian after the bell Tuesday, followed by Lucid on Wednesday.

Both ""pure EV"" companies are expected to report notable growths in revenue and narrowed adjusted earnings losses amid record third-quarter U.S. EV sales. But investors are also expecting the manufacturers to give updates on future growth opportunities as well as impacts from more challenging market conditions.

""Both of these are really challenged,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan told CNBC during an interview, saying he's cautious about much near-term upside for investors. ""To me, it's all about the underlying profitability.""

Both automakers have already cut vehicle production guidance due to more challenging market conditions, while Rivian also has negatively changed its adjusted earnings and gross profit expectations for 2025.

EV manufacturers face industrywide issues such as increasing costs due to tariffs and slower forecasted sales of EVs, as well as company-specific problems that include new product challenges, and regulatory changes that are negatively impacting sales and profits, including the end of consumer federal incentives.

The Trump administration this fall got rid of federal incentives of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV. In addition to that, it also ended the practice of fining automakers for failing to meet fuel efficiency rules. That hurts EV manufacturers, which had been counting on selling credits to legacy automakers that could offset some penalties.

Rivian this summer cut its expected earnings from credit sales from $300 million to $160 million. In connection to the change, Rivian also lowered its gross profit guidance for the year to roughly breakeven from a modest profit. It also has conducted layoffs this year to cut costs.

""Changes to EV tax credits, regulatory credits, trade regulation and tariffs are expected to have an impact on the results and the cash flow of our business.""

Rivian has maintained that it has enough cash to get it through the launch of its new ""R2"" product during the first half of next year, but the ongoing changes don't assist the company by any means.

Tariffs are hitting the automaker to the tune of ""a couple thousand dollars per unit"" this year, Rivian has said. Lucid also said tariff costs are hurting its profit margins this year, including $54 million during the second quarter.

""We expect the loss of the credit to be a headwind for the market in the coming quarters. Our prior elasticity of demand analysis implied that the loss of IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] credits could equate to a double-digit percent headwind to industry volumes, all else equal,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said in an Oct. 3 investor note on Rivian and Tesla.

Tesla , which has also sold automotive regulatory credits, reported revenue from those credits in the third quarter fell 44% to $417 million from $739 million.

Pull ahead, Q3 results

The third quarter is expected to be the peak of EV sales for the foreseeable future, as customers rushed to purchase new models ahead of the federal credits ending in September.

As a result, the companies are expected to spend more time touting future products and technology opportunities to investors during their third-quarter calls this week rather than their near-term core businesses of producing and selling EVs.

""It remains to be seen how long the EV hangover will last in the US, though we suspect 3Q EV penetration will likely be the highest mark for quite some time,"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in an Oct. 13 investor note.

Rivian last month reported vehicle deliveries of 13,201 vehicles during the third quarter, a 32% increase from a year earlier. Lucid reported deliveries of 4,078 units, up 47% from 2,781 units from the third quarter of 2024.

Even with an uptick in sales, both companies are expected to report notable losses, albeit narrowed from a year ago and smaller than the second quarter.

Rivian is expected to report an adjusted earnings per share loss of 72 cents on revenue of $1.5 billion, based on average analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. That would compare to an adjusted EPS loss of 99 cents on revenue of $874 million a year earlier.

When reporting its second-quarter results, Rivian said it expected its adjusted core loss to be between $2 billion and $2.25 billion this year, compared with $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously forecast. Analysts also have expressed concerns about Rivian's previous goal to be profitable on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization basis by 2027.

Lucid is expected to report a $2.27 adjusted EPS loss for the third quarter, down from $2.80 a year earlier (based on recalculated results following a reverse stock split), on a roughly 90% increase in revenue to $379.1 million, according to LSEG.

Narayan and other analysts have largely focused on improvements in the gross profits of the companies as proof of progress. Such results are a key indicator of a business's profitability before operating expenses, interest, and taxes deductions.

""[Investors] will want to see what that gross profit number is in Q3, but they also have a high bar to pass over with where consensus already is,"" Narayan said.

Rivian is expected to report a gross loss of $39 million during the third quarter, according to average estimates compiled by FactSet. Lucid, meanwhile, is expected to report a $255 million gross loss, according to the estimates.

Shares of Rivian are off less than 5% this year, while Lucid's stock is off roughly 45%, including a 1-for-10 reverse stock split in September.

Product and tech promises

Both Rivian and Lucid have tried to sell investors on the success of their future vehicles as well as technologies to save the companies from continued losses.

Rivian's future heavily relies on its new ""R2"" vehicles that are expected to begin production for customers the first half of next year. The roughly $45,000 midsize vehicle, per Rivian, is expected to cut build material costs in half, reduce production complexity and significantly grow demand and sales.

""I'm more bullish on this vehicle than any product we've developed. I believe that the product market fit is incredible. The packaging, the technology and overall value proposition set R2 up for meaningful share,"" Scaringe said in August.

However, the R2 will launch in a challenging market ripe with plenty of vehicle competition — many of which are expected to have longer EV ranges at a similar, if not lower, price.

Barclay's Levy earlier this year did an analysis of the potential total addressable market of the R2, questioning the company's bullishness on the product amid ""risks"" of weaker expected U.S. EV demand, additional costs and a more competitive market.

Narayan and other analysts also have questioned the company's sales targets for the vehicle: ""It's a very competitive market, and you have this EV slowdown in full effect. What are the volumes they're going to get on R2 going up against all this competition? … [General Motors ] can barely get to hundreds of thousands,"" Narayan said in the interview.

Rivian also has touted its potential for revenue with new technologies, such as the $5.8 billion deal it struck with Volkswagen for its software and electrical architecture.

Rivian has said the next generation of technology also is expected to help it become a leader in advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, despite the automaker trailing many other systems.

Lucid

The story is similar at Lucid. The company has placed significant importance on the launch of its Gravity SUV, which Lucid has described as challenging, as well as a future midsize vehicle platform to broaden its market reach.

""We are not simply building electrical vehicles. We are pushing the boundaries of what EVs can be,"" Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said during the company's second-quarter call in August. ""From the record-breaking performance and efficiency of the Lucid Air to the game-changing Lucid Gravity, to our upcoming midsize platform, our technology continues to redefine what's possible.""

More recently, Lucid also has touted future ADAS technologies and the potential of personal autonomous vehicle capabilities as part of its future, despite a history of underwhelming capabilities in its current luxury models.

Lucid signed a $300 million deal with Uber in July that included the ride-hailing platform acquiring and deploying more than 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle technology from startup Nuro over the next six years.

Other topics investors will be watching include any updates to Rivian's timeline for its R2 production or Lucid's production of the Gravity SUV as well as cash flows and profitability outlooks for both companies.

""We are not where we want to be with Lucid Gravity production relative to our target at this point in the year,"" Winterhoff said in August. ""We believe we will significantly increase production [in] the second half of the year.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107420148-1716586096525-gettyimages-2154514894-js1_9845_axy5pfiz.jpeg?v=1751487196&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:04.127244

Reed told Rhode Island Current on his way out of the teachers union headquarters that he believed the Trump administration would provide full funding to SNAP.
Three minutes later, after Reed had left the building, an emailed alert showed the Trump administration had submitted its plan for partial funding.
Whitehouse during the press conference called the initial halt of SNAP funding by the federal government “a truly deliberate act of cruelty.” “Every shutdown has had SNAP benefits continue until this one,” he told reporters.
“Essentially, it will destroy SNAP,” Reed said.","Rhode Island’s four Democratic congressional delegates demanded that the Trump administration release funding for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during a 40-minute late morning press conference Monday in Cranston.

If they had stayed for just four more minutes, they would have received the news that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreed to comply with a court order to partially fund SNAP for the month of November.

But U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse were off to Washington D.C. where the Senate was set to resume at 3 p.m. after a weekend recess. U.S. Reps. Gabe Amo and Seth Magaziner remained in Rhode Island — though both noted they have returned to D.C. on a weekly basis despite the House not meeting since the shutdown began Oct. 1.

At 11:59 a.m., the USDA submitted a four-page report responding to an order from U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. to force the Trump administration to pay at least a portion of benefits to the 42 million people who receive SNAP benefits by the end of Wednesday, despite the government shutdown.

Trump administration to pay about half of November SNAP benefits amid shutdown

“The U.S. Department of Agriculture is complying with the court’s order and will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today by generating the table required for states to calculate the benefits available for each eligible household in that state,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in the Trump administration’s court filing submitted one minute before the administration’s noon deadline.

Rhode Island receives about $29 million each month to administer the SNAP program across the state. Food pantries around Rhode Island are seeing increased demand as SNAP recipients prepared for the first lapse in benefit payments in the program’s history. Food drives have been organized by labor unions, local nonprofits, and advocacy organizations to support the RI Community Food Bank and food pantries across the Ocean State.

The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Community Center in Newport saw a 34% increase in people using its food pantry in the month of October compared to September, according to its email newsletter.

“Trump can move very fast when he wants to,” Amo had told a half dozen reporters inside the office of the National Education Association of Rhode Island headquarters on Bald Hill Road in Cranston. “So why can’t he find the time to work on behalf of the hardworking Americans who make this country what it is?”

McConnell on Saturday gave the Trump administration two choices after ruling it must use available funds to keep food aid flowing: Cover partial benefits through a $5.5 billion contingency fund or find other reserves, or to pay for a full month tapping into additional revenue sources such as the Child Nutrition Program.

The USDA opted for the latter, stating in an attached declaration that officials determined child nutrition funds “must remain available to protect full operation” of programs through the federal fiscal year.

“Using billions of dollars from Child Nutrition for SNAP would leave an unprecedented gap in Child Nutrition funding that Congress has never had to fill with annual appropriations, and USDA cannot predict what Congress will do under these circumstances,” wrote USDA Undersecretary Patrick Penn.

Reed told Rhode Island Current on his way out of the teachers union headquarters that he believed the Trump administration would provide full funding to SNAP.

“Why would you concede half when you’re conceding?” Reed said.

Three minutes later, after Reed had left the building, an emailed alert showed the Trump administration had submitted its plan for partial funding.

In a statement issued after 4 p.m., Reed called the administration’s decision to partially fund SNAP “a half-baked approach.”

“Partial funding hurts the whole country and underscores Trump’s gross mismanagement,” Reed said.

Whitehouse during the press conference called the initial halt of SNAP funding by the federal government “a truly deliberate act of cruelty.”

“Every shutdown has had SNAP benefits continue until this one,” he told reporters.

Magaziner called Trump’s actions “shameful and unnecessary.”

“Hunger should never be used as a political weapon,” Magaziner said. “We cannot give into their bullying. If we give in now, then it will be four more years of assaults on working people and we cannot go along with that.”

Reed warned the brief chaos from the SNAP cuts will become the norm after the “Big Beautiful Bill” adopted by Republicans in July reduced $186 billion from SNAP funding through 2034.

“Essentially, it will destroy SNAP,” Reed said.

Rhode Island’s congressional delegation has voiced similar concerns about other federal aid programs, particularly health care subsidies. The delegation echoed Senate Democrats’ demands that Congressional Republicans extend the Obama-era subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.

Whitehouse said he is confident the GOP-controlled Senate will start to come to the table to meet Democratic demands and end the shutdown.

“They’re feeling the heat,” Whitehouse said.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ReedNextToFood.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 15:04:35.861751

“It’s undeniable that Illinois is at the forefront of groundbreaking quantum research, with Fermilab and Argonne leading the charge,"" Durbin said in a written statement.","The federal government renewed two $125 million grants for quantum research at Chicago’s two national laboratories.

The Department of Energy chose Argonne and Fermi national laboratories for quantum research projects five years ago. They were among five laboratories across the United States that received $25 million-a-year grants over five years, but the grants expired Sept. 30.

EARLIER:

Chicago-led quantum research effort in the running for $160M from NSF

Dario Gil, undersecretary for science at DOE, announced the re-authorization of the grants this morning at the Chicago Quantum Summit, a two-day gathering of 700 researchers at Willis Tower.

The funding supports more than 500 research jobs at the two national labs, including more than 100 students at the University of Chicago. It also adds more fuel Chicago’s quest to become the nation’s top hub for quantum science, which is the next generation of computer and communication technology. In addition to Argonne, Fermi and the Chicago Quantum Exchange, the state is building a quantum research park on the former U.S. Steel South Works factory, which was championed by Gov. JB Pritzker, who committed $500 million in state economic-development funds to quantum.

“Our research will continue uninterrupted,” said David Awschalom, a quantum researcher at the University of Chicago and chief science officer of one of the DOE-funded QNext quantum information research center at Argonne. “It’s fantastic news.”

The funding also is a boost for Fermilab in Batavia and its work in quantum materials and sensing. “This renewal allows us to build on that foundation and take the next leap: moving from discovery to deployment,” Anna Grassellino, director of Fermi’s Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, said in a statement.

Paul Kearns, director of Argonne, called the announcement “excellent news” that will allow the research facility near Lemont to make additional investment in tools and equipment and bring on some additional staff. More than 200 researchers are involved in the quantum research center at Argonne.

Gil, a former top IBM research laid down a daunting challenge for quantum researchers, saying the Tump administration wants to have a fault-tolerant quantum computer running by 2028. Such a computer would be both stable enough to be usable and large enough to be commercially useful.

“By 2028, we need to demonstrate the first generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of performing the next frontier of scientific calculations,” he said. “It is the time to build this first of a kind scientific instrument for the nation, and we will and we must accomplish this.”

The timeframe aligns with those of startups such as PsiQuantum and Infleqtion, both of which are building quantum computers at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park that is being built along Lake Michigan on the far south side. If the companies can deliver, it will put Chicago at the center of what Gil described as “a revolution in computing that’s going to transform how science and technology is practiced and how R&D is done.”

Sen. Dick Durbin welcomed the money announced today but says more will be required. “It’s undeniable that Illinois is at the forefront of groundbreaking quantum research, with Fermilab and Argonne leading the charge,"" Durbin said in a written statement. ""I’m encouraged to see continued investment in our national labs, but if we hope to maintain our position as a global leader in quantum technology, our federal government must supply the funding to match this ambition.”

Quantum computing, which involves using tiny particles to carry information at exponentially greater rates than traditional technology, is expected to enable breakthroughs in research such as drug discovery and materials science, as well as encryption of communications and data.

The basic research has been underway for decades. The technology is still unproven, but companies such as IBM and Google have made significant progress in the past few years. Gil believes quantum is at an inflection point.

It’s part of a larger goal he described of doubling scientific productivity and impact within a decade. The vision is to combine high-performance computing, AI and quantum, which will “allow us to solve some of the most challenging scientific problems of this century,” Gil said, while also framing quantum development as a critical national security goal.

“There is no doubt that our most formidable competitors and geopolitical adversaries aim to achieve similar goals,” he said. “And reap the benefits of economic and national security that would come with success. We cannot allow that to happen. It is unacceptable for the U.S. not to lead in quantum and AI.”

Argonne is at the center of that strategy. Gil pointed to the success in developing exascale supercomputers—or machines that can perform a quintillion — or 1 billion-billion — calculations per second. Such machines, including a half-billion-dollar computer at Argonne known as Aurora, were built in less than a decade.

The Energy Department doubled down on its investment in a new generation of supercomputers to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, choosing Argonne last week to build a system with more than 100,000 Nvidia graphics-processing chips.

“It’s been an amazing week,” said Kearns, who was in the audience for Gil’s announcement.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/fermi.png,N,,2025-11-04 18:06:20.883358

In the sea of enthusiasm for the global expansion of commercial nuclear power, there are modern-day Nostradamuses confidently predicting failure.

“Most [small modular reactors] SMRs are on paper [… and] the tech bros don’t seem to be grounded in reality,” prophesized a Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairperson in a recent BBC interview.

On social media, a noted nuclear power critic predicted, “you must know that none of this is actually going to happen” when referring to new nuclear microreactors “that are doomed to fail.”

It is very possible that these criticisms will be proven correct, and small reactors under 300 megawatts (MW) may lose steam as they slog through the thicket of design, licensing, and demonstration. Certainly, a new report on OKLO raises numerous concerns about technological readiness.

Also, as the critics note, there are no new commercial nuclear plants in the United States under construction or even under contract by energy utilities at this time. There are lots of memoranda of understanding (MOU) and paper reactors, but not much groundbreaking.

But the Trump administration has promulgated reams of requirements for advancing nuclear power, including adding 300 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear energy capacity by 2050, and now has a plan to add financial fuel to this process.

The question is whether the critics are right and there are too many holes for projects to fall through, or whether the Trump mandates will shock the slow-to-change nuclear energy ecosystem into supercharging deployment.

AI Energy Expansion

The Trump administration’s nuclear energy objectives are fueled by several imperatives, but a core one is to win the artificial intelligence (AI) race with China.

That means it needs to concentrate capital and energy resources on the data center buildout. Today, the United States has 522 data centers, about half of the world’s total. Another 280 are expected to come online by 2028. This would jump energy demand in this sector from two percent of total US electricity to 12 percent.

The United States is currently adding only about 65 GW to the grid, but according to an ICF International analysis, it “should be adding about 80 gigawatts of new power generation capacity a year to keep pace with AI as well as cloud computing, crypto, industrial demand, and electrification trends.”

The last nuclear power capability the United States added was the completion of 2.2 GW at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating site in Georgia in 2024. By contrast, China has 33 reactors under construction and another 43 planned.

Since then, several shuttered nuclear plants have been slated for refurbishment in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Iowa. They will contribute new energy in the next few years, along with power uprates for existing reactors that are expected to be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

The partially completed VC Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina will be finished now that the Santee Cooper utility has chosen Brookfield, Westinghouse Electric Company’s majority owner, to complete the work on the AP-1000 reactors.

A number of tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and META, are investing in small reactors that will power the AI race, and Microsoft is supporting the restart of a shuttered reactor at Three Mile Island.

Reactor Role Reversal

The critics are betting that the challenges of achieving commercialization will sink the small reactor data center rally. Driving this view is a trifecta of concerns about emerging reactors’ cost-effectiveness, licensing ability, and delivery certainty. It may take a decade or more before these reactors are ready for deployment. By then, the AI boom may have slaked its energy thirst.

Evidence is already accumulating that proven large reactors in the one GW range, like Westinghouse’s AP-1000, are becoming more appealing for AI power after being cast aside in favor of the smaller newcomers.

Except for NuScale’s Voygr small modular reactor, no US-based SMRs have received NRC design approval, while the AP-1000 is licensed and has been built in the United States and abroad.

But AI is not the only application for small reactors. There are industrial applications for small reactors, including process heat, and small and disaggregated power grid uses that exist in developed and developing countries. The X-Energy deal with Dow to power the Seadrift plant is a good example of matching power plant output and consumption on one large industrial footprint.

Outside the United States, the Canadian Province of Ontario has approved the construction of four 300 MW General Electric Hitachi BWRX reactors at the Darlington nuclear plant. Ontario and the federal government committed $3 billion Canadian dollars for the project. If licensed, these would become the first commercial SMRs operating in North America. That will provide important concrete cost and construction information that may be applicable to other small reactor deployments.

Financing

Spinning up the American nuclear buildout will require billions in financing, and the history of significant cost overruns on previous plant construction casts a shadow on private sector financing enthusiasm.

The Trump administration, however, does not seem to be deterred by this history. It has embraced and revamped the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office into the Energy Dominance Financing Program (EDF), which has an objective of “reinvigorating the nuclear industry.” It demands that projects move forward expeditiously.

EDF seems prepared to provide tens of billions of dollars in nuclear project loans beyond the commitments it has made to date. And, while the administration is willing to work with utility companies on this nuclear build-out, it is not waiting on them.

As part of its shockwave shake-up of the US nuclear industry, the Commerce Department has entered into a binding term sheet to facilitate financing of $80 billion for the domestic and overseas deployment of the AP-1000. The US government will be granted a participation interest of 20 percent of any cash distribution over $17.5 billion earned by Westinghouse if it secures the funding and assures the reactors will be completed.

Large reactors may be the next residents on federal land if Fermi America is any indication. That project aims to become the country’s largest nuclear complex, with multiple AP-1000s at the site.

But several factors need to fall together for the free flow of money to matter, including creating an assured fuel supply, developing significant efficiencies in the reactor Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) process to reduce overall cost and construction time, and rebuilding or importing a skilled labor cadre.

This is where US allies like South Korea could play an important role, particularly on AP-1000 construction. South Korea has experience with AP-1000s at home, has a world-class nuclear construction capability, produces components America can’t, and possesses a substantial and well-trained workforce. Korean companies are already partners in some US SMR projects.

Fuel Supply

Access to high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) nuclear fuel is a major bottleneck for small reactors, and fuel supply could become a challenge for the US nuclear fleet if domestic uranium enrichment can’t quickly scale up.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations made revitalizing US nuclear fuel production a priority. The reasons were to reduce dependence on Russian fuel imports, increase domestic uranium enrichment, and ensure that a steady supply of fuel is available. Collectively, the two administrations have devoted billions to uranium enrichment.

The Trump administration is also enamored with plutonium as a fuel, and recently offered to provide nuclear companies access to almost 20 tons of weapon-grade plutonium for reactor fuel. Tens of millions of dollars in research on plutonium reprocessing technologies have been provided by both administrations.

Nuclear critics have cited nuclear proliferation problems associated with the use of HALEU and weapon-grade plutonium in the civil nuclear fuel cycle. For now, the administration is pushing forward on multiple nuclear fuel fronts, but it is not certain that its efforts will succeed in substantially breaking out of the reactor fuel bottleneck.

Military Reactors

While SMR skeptics are relying on the commercial requirements to smother the viability of next-gen reactors, they have not adequately accounted for the commitment of the US Department of Defense (DOD) to the development of small reactors. The key projects are Project Pele and the Janus Program. And DOD has vast experience turning nascent technology into commercial products.

The PELE reactor is a 1.5 MW TRISO-fueled, gas-cooled demonstration micro reactor that is manufactured by BWXT Advanced Technologies. The project broke ground at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in 2024, and the reactor is expected to begin operation in 2028. The goal is to provide the US military with “a mobile, reliable, sustainable, and resilient power source which does not require a long logistics tail.”

The Janus project was launched in October 2025, and it is designed to be a micro reactor of one to 20 MWs that provides power for national defense facilities and critical missions. The program is a response to Trump’s executive order, which called for the operation of a US Army-regulated nuclear reactor at a domestic nuclear installation by September 2028.

The Janus reactors will be commercially owned and operated and could provide power to the local grid. The Army wants pairs of reactors demonstrated to underscore that the effort is not just research and development but aimed at wider-scale deployment.

There are questions about the ability of a reactor controlled by the defense department to provide commercial power, but the Atomic Energy Act does provide some authority.

Export Markets

The export of American nuclear reactors has slowed dramatically over the past 40 years but is now showing some signs of life. The AP-1000 is slated to be built in Poland, with the reactors possibly being deployed in Finland, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Ukraine. Much of this interest is driven by the need to decouple from Russian energy.

US small reactors, however, are not faring as well in the export market in part because of the focus on the need to demonstrate them in the United States first.

However, these SMRs have applicability as an export technology, particularly to developing economy nations with growing populations and energy demand. But there is the need to first develop the nuclear power capacity and infrastcuture in many of these nations.

The United States has a slow, stepwise process for developing nuclear power capacity in countries that need assistance. It emphasizes training, technical assistance, and knowledge sharing. It has not resulted in the development of many markets for emerging US reactors, although it has provided SMR simulators to Romania and Ghana.

That process needs to evolve into one that identifies target countries and then applies the necessary technical and financial resources to develop them for the import of US small reactors. The think tank, Clearpath, has developed the concept of Energy Security Compacts (ESC) that would align US nuclear and financial tools to achieve this goal. It proposes 5 to 10-year agreements that align the various bureaucratic elements of the US government to work toward “clear, measurable outcomes” that support US foreign policy and energy security objectives.

This concept would strengthen the ability of the United States to win nuclear markets against the state-financed companies of Russia and China, which are already operating their own SMRs. And seizing markets outside of North America for US small reactors would push forward their commercialization in America, thereby responding to the concerns of the critics.

“This is not economically feasible otherwise,” said Mary Alice Boehm-McKaughan, general counsel with the Texas Rural Water Association.
Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.
According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation.
This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state’s water fund during this year’s legislative session.","Subscribe to The Y’all — a weekly dispatch about the people, places and policies defining Texas, produced by Texas Tribune journalists living in communities across the state.

LUBBOCK — Two years ago, Texas voters overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Texas Water Fund with an initial $1 billion allotment to help the state get its water systems back on track. Since then, the state’s leading water agency has allocated nearly a quarter of that money to rural towns, according to state data reviewed by The Texas Tribune.

More than 40 projects totaling nearly $223 million have been approved for fixing water storage tanks and water service lines, building new water wells, and improving drinking water systems, state data shows. That money, paired with money allocated for projects that prioritize creating new water supply through water conservation and water loss mitigation, a statewide public awareness program and more, means more than $735 million has been committed by the Texas Water Development Board.

The data, which the Tribune requested, comes on the eve of another election in which Texas lawmakers are asking voters to spend $20 billion in sales tax revenue over the next two decades to secure the state’s water supply.

Texas’ water supply has long been under duress. Critical infrastructure has aged beyond repair, causing it to fail. More people are moving to the Lone Star State every day, which has spurred water demand, especially in areas that are already running dry. And climate instability is compounding matters.

Proposition 4, the ballot question that would authorize spending $20 billion, is one of 17 constitutional amendments on this fall’s ballot. Election Day is Tuesday. If it passes, at least 50% of the funds, and possibly more, would be used for creating new water supplies that expand the state’s water portfolio, including projects involving desalination, water conservation, reuse, and aquifer storage. The other portion of the money would be used for water infrastructure needs. And there would be stronger legislative oversight by creating a committee to review how the board administers the fund.

Supporters of the proposition — including Gov. Greg Abbott, state lawmakers, and water advocacy groups — have argued the state needs the money to continue the work started in 2023. At the time, nearly 80% of voters approved what seemed like a good start to address the growing water needs that plagued every region of the state.

While the Texas Water Development Board is in the final stages of spending the first billion, some of those same supporters are calling for better tracking and transparency of how funds are being spent to ensure lawmakers and taxpayers are willing to make more money available in the future.

“There’s going to be an option for a future Legislature to continue it or renew it,” said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at Texas 2036. “But in order for that to happen, there needs to be clear evidence that this funding stream has worked.”

Progress from the 2023 effort offers a look into the future if the $20 billion initiative is approved. In rural Texas specifically, the money has thrown a lifeline to communities struggling with inflation, supply chain issues and construction costs that make it impossible to make repairs on their own.

“This is not economically feasible otherwise,” said Mary Alice Boehm-McKaughan, general counsel with the Texas Rural Water Association. “These systems literally cannot afford to upgrade their system without access to these funds.”

The $1 billion tranche was more of a band-aid than a panacea, water experts said. At best, it helped clear a backlog of needs that had built up in recent years.

“That $1 billion injection was, in some ways, like if somebody has a wound and it’s bleeding and you have to put a temporary stop on it,” said Sarah Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation. “All the programs are so oversubscribed that it’s not like that was new money for new fun projects.”

Data obtained by the Tribune from the water board through a public records request shows the state has or will fund more than 40 projects. Most of those projects are in rural areas with fewer than 10,000 residents. Only six entities that serve a population between 10,001 and 150,000 residents were awarded grant dollars.

According to the data, these projects range from rehabbing water storage tanks and generators in the small town of Alba, in East Texas, and water service line and meter replacements in Benjamin, 130 miles east of Lubbock. The projects also include a new water well in Corrigan and Weimar, two towns with populations under 3,300 people, and drinking water system improvements in several towns, including Jefferson in far East Texas. Dozens of municipalities, including Matador and Paducah, two towns in the High Plains that both have less than 1,000 residents, were approved for water supply and distribution system improvements.

“Rural communities need this investment in critical infrastructure,” said Kelty Garbee, executive director of Texas Rural Funders, a nonprofit that has championed the 2023 and 2025 constitutional amendments. “Every dollar spent on water will deliver powerful results — repairing old systems, reducing waste, and keeping water affordable for Texas families and businesses.”

Clearer accounting wanted

There’s rarely simple accounting in government. The $1 billion that voters approved in 2023 is no exception.

The water board received the money on Jan. 1, 2024, then took several months to plot a path with public input on how the money should be spent. In the summer of 2024, they put together a list of what programs they would like to make commitments to.

Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.

The board later solicited project applications from waste and wastewater systems in Texas. According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation. Of those forms, 46 received funding, all of which went toward water infrastructure needs.

About $45 million was allocated for entities with populations of 1,000 or less to receive 100% grant funding from the rural assistance fund. According to Boehm-McKaughan, the East Medina County Special Utility District was able to fix leaks in more than a mile of water line thanks to that grant money.

“The good news here is that the board is prudently and rationally executing its due diligence,” Mazur said. “And doing what it needs to do to get money out the door in an appropriate manner.”

The board does not have a clear indication on how funds have been spent so far on their website, or for what projects. This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state’s water fund during this year’s legislative session.

Perry Fowler, executive director of the Texas Water Infrastructure Network, said the water board is under a lot of pressure to get the money out, but it also must vet projects to ensure tax dollars are used correctly.

“There probably are ways they could help demonstrate how money is being spent and when and where a little better,” Fowler said. “But I don’t think they’re being irresponsible.”

Senate Bill 7, which spells out in part how the $20 billion for water is to be spent, will add more oversight and require the water board to report on how the state is providing financial assistance and the progress being made toward addressing water infrastructure challenges.

Mazur said that moving forward, it would be helpful to have a clear description of the benefits to the communities when projects are completed.

“I think it’s going to be important for the board to start telling a story with these projects when they’re completed and what the actual tangible benefit will be to the communities they serve,” Mazur said.

Fowler agreed that more transparency is important. However, he said the public should be more concerned about the volume of projects the board is able to approve.

“As great as this billion is, and if we’re going to get it every year, it’s never going to be enough,” Fowler said. “We’re probably going to have to have additional appropriations because what we’re seeing is we’re not able to meet the demand we have.”

A Texas 2036 report estimates the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure — an estimate that does not include money for projects that create new water supply.

By the water board’s own estimates in the state’s 2022 water plan, towns and cities could be on a path toward a severe shortage of water by 2030. This would happen if there are recurring, record-breaking drought conditions across the state, and if water entities and state leaders fail to put in place key strategies to secure water supplies.

“I don’t think we’re going to end up with a scenario where there’s just money sitting around not being used,” Schlessinger said. “My gut says that $1 billion doesn’t get anywhere close to meeting the amount of project funding needs there are.”

That demands a massive scale-up in renewables and adaptation backed by a surge in finance for developing countries.
Renewables are leading that transformation and rewriting the rules of energy.
We need a quantum leap in climate finance to lower the cost of capital and expand concessional lending.","Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message for the 2025 Emissions Gap Report, issued by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in Nairobi today:

The new Emissions Gap Report, issued by the United Nations Environment Programme, is clear and uncompromising.

If nationally determined contributions are fully implemented by 2035, global warming would reach 2.3°C – down from 2.6°C in last year’s projections. That is progress, but nowhere near enough.

Current commitments still point to climate breakdown. Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5°C is now inevitable — starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. And the path to a liveable future gets steeper by the day.

But this is no reason to surrender. It’s a reason to step up and speed up. 1.5°C by the end of the century remains our North Star. And the science is clear: this goal is still within reach, but only if we meaningfully increase our ambition.

Our mission is simple, but not easy: Make any overshoot as small and as short as possible; reach global net-zero emissions by 2050 and move swiftly onto a progressive, irreversible net-negative pathway; and bring the global temperature increase back below 1.5°C by the end of the century.

That means peaking global emissions immediately; achieving far deeper emission reductions during this decade; cutting methane sharply; accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to renewables; and protecting forests and oceans — our carbon sinks.

Make no mistake: Any period of overshooting will inevitably bring dramatic consequences – with lives lost, communities uprooted and development gains reversed. But we have the solutions to make this overshoot as small, as short and as safe as possible.

That demands a massive scale-up in renewables and adaptation backed by a surge in finance for developing countries. Renewables are leading that transformation and rewriting the rules of energy. Costs are falling, investments are rising, innovation is surging.

Clean power is now the cheapest source of electricity in most markets and the fastest to deploy. It strengthens energy security, cuts pollution and creates millions of decent jobs.

Leaders must seize this moment and waste no time in tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency by 2030; building modern grids and large-scale storage; and ending all new coal, oil and gas expansion in a just and equitable manner.

The clean energy revolution must reach everyone, everywhere. But developing countries face crippling capital costs and a fraction of global investment. They also need far greater support to adapt to worsening climate impacts — protecting lives and building resilience.

We need a quantum leap in climate finance to lower the cost of capital and expand concessional lending. Developed countries must lead in delivering predictable, affordable finance through multilateral development bank reform, effective debt solutions and tools that crowd in private investment at scale.

COP30 [thirtieth Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change] in Belém must be the turning point where the world delivers a bold and credible response plan to close the ambition and implementation gaps; to mobilize the $1.3 trillion a year by 2035 in climate finance for developing countries; and to advance climate justice for all.

The path to 1.5°C is narrow but open. Let us accelerate to keep that path alive for people, for the planet and for our common future.",https://press.un.org/themes/custom/un3_press/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:25.455187

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

Article content

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

Article content

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

First American is designing a 240-megawatt liquid metal reactor that uses lead bismuth as a coolant. It’s the only company using this technology in the US, though it’s been used in Russian submarines for years.

Article content

The reprocessing system will be able to convert spent uranium from the plant into new fuel, making the plants cheaper to operate and eliminating the challenge posed by the toxic waste created by conventional reactors.

""The work being carried out at NNSA to harness AI will have an impact on national security as the Manhattan Project did in the 1940s,"" Under Secretary for Nuclear Security and NNSA Administrator Brandon Williams said in the press release.","The National Nuclear Security Administration announced in late September that it plans to power massive new artificial intelligence data centers on two federal sites in South Carolina and Tennessee, which will help the United States get ahead in the AI race while reducing pollution from the industry.

As a news release from the Department of Energy detailed, the NNSA is ""seeking proposals from U.S. private sector partners"" to construct and power data centers on large tracts of land at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee.

According to the American Nuclear Society, the sites were chosen because they can serve dual purposes: hosting data centers and nuclear power production, thereby boosting grid reliability, reducing energy costs, and bolstering national security.

Other selected sites include the Idaho National Laboratory and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, both of which are awaiting requests for proposals.

The NNSA has identified 10 tracts totaling more than 3,100 acres at the Savannah River Site for the development of AI data centers, along with approximately 44,000 acres at the Idaho National Laboratory, according to the ANS. The DOE stated that private-sector partners chosen for the project will enter into long-term leasing agreements at the site and will be tasked with constructing, powering, and decommissioning each data center.

""Proposals will be competitively evaluated for technological readiness, financial viability, and detailed plans to complete regulatory and permitting requirements,"" the DOE added.

While the DOE selected the sites for their easy access or potential for energy development, it also expects proposals to include innovative on-site energy generation, such as co-located nuclear reactors, geothermal energy, and energy storage solutions.

The DOE has acknowledged several risks associated with nuclear power, including public perception, safety concerns, high upfront costs for power plants, and the safe disposal of used fuel. It is working on many improvements, including ""accident-tolerant fuels"" that will boost performance and produce less waste.

Since data centers and artificial intelligence applications are notorious for needing enormous amounts of water and energy to operate, powering them with nuclear will help reduce heat-trapping pollution and conserve resources. Not to mention, it provides a major opportunity for the U.S. to take the lead in the digital and clean energy transition.

The study, conducted in Ecuador’s páramo, a high-altitude grassland ecosystem, found that even tiny ponds can release surprisingly large amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Until now, these remote mountain wetlands have been largely overlooked in global carbon studies.

“Our study shows that the smallest ponds can make a big difference, emitting more carbon than larger waters just meters away,” said Kriddie Whitmore, a recent Ph.D. graduate from UNC who led the fieldwork and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Umeå University in Sweden. “These results highlight the need for increased research focused on small aquatic systems.”

By measuring emissions across ponds at different elevations and temperatures, the researchers found that elevation, water temperature, and how ponds connect with surrounding soils all strongly influence how much carbon they release. Contrary to past assumptions, smaller doesn’t necessarily mean less impactful.

“These areas have long been blind spots in global climate models,” said Diego Riveros-Iregui, the study’s principal investigator and professor of geography and environment at UNC. “By uncovering what drives carbon emissions in these remote, high-elevation ecosystems, we are filling a major gap in global climate science. This knowledge helps us refine climate models and better understand how tropical mountain landscapes influence Earth’s carbon balance.”

The findings suggest that high-altitude ecosystems like the páramo, which store vast amounts of carbon in their soils, could be important players in regulating the planet’s climate. Incorporating emissions from these small ponds into global models will help scientists make more accurate carbon budgets and predict how climate change might affect carbon cycling in tropical mountain regions.

If federal permitting for solar and wind does not resume soon, our states risk losing projects already in development.","Washington, D.C. — U.S. Senators Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) demanded answers from U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum on the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) recent order requiring Secretary Burgum’s personal approval for routine wind and solar energy project permitting decisions. In their letter, the lawmakers highlight that added red tape threatens to permanently block wind and solar energy projects on both public and private land, while giving the Secretary discretion to pick winning and losing clean energy projects, and driving up energy costs across the West.

“We are writing to express concerns about the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) recent Secretarial order, which puts forward new requirements for Secretarial approval for routine permitting steps that risk delaying or blocking low-cost wind and solar energy projects,” said Bennet, Hickenlooper, and Luján.

“This ensnares virtually every ongoing wind and solar project in multiple layers of red tape and bureaucratic review, creating significant legal and regulatory uncertainty about timelines and raising questions about whether project approval is even possible. It also creates a significant deterrent to the development of new projects. This indefinite effective pause on wind and solar permits comes at a time of increasing energy demand and energy prices,” continued the senators.

The senators emphasized the importance of clean energy in providing Western families, farmers, and businesses with reliable and affordable energy, generating 44 percent of electricity in Western states. Blocking the cheapest and most abundant type of generation jeopardizes grid reliability and abandons existing private investments. The senators demanded clarity on how DOI’s new heightened reviews will affect current and future wind and solar energy projects, pointing out how this policy is irreconcilable with President Trump’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability.

“Western states have led the way in demonstrating that clean energy strengthens local economies and the electric grid, setting ambitious goals for its energy transition. Additional layers of federal bureaucracy could effectively stall new renewable projects, forcing Westerners to face higher costs, less reliable energy service, and fewer opportunities for economic growth,” concluded the senators.

The text of the letter is available HERE and below.

Dear Secretary Burgum:

We are writing to express concerns about the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) recent Secretarial order, which puts forward new requirements for Secretarial approval for routine permitting steps that risk delaying or blocking low-cost wind and solar energy projects. This order affects projects not only on federal lands, but also on state and private lands since DOI sign-off is needed at multiple steps during wind and solar project development – for example, ecological baseline studies, access road authorizations, federal wildlife permits, or utility corridor concurrences.

DOI’s recent Secretarial order, Departmental Review Procedures for Decisions, Actions, Consultations, and Other Undertakings Related to Wind and Solar Energy Facilities, outlines an expansive list of 69 DOI decisions and actions related to wind and solar projects that now newly require your personal review, including routine steps such as right-of-way applications or biological assessments. This ensnares virtually every ongoing wind and solar project in multiple layers of red tape and bureaucratic review, creating significant legal and regulatory uncertainty about timelines and raising questions about whether project approval is even possible. It also creates a significant deterrent to the development of new projects. This indefinite effective pause on wind and solar permits comes at a time of increasing energy demand and energy prices. It is difficult to understand how these actions align with the President’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability. With that in mind, we seek to better understand DOI’s rationale for these new policies and how they will be implemented in practice.

As you are aware, Western families, farmers, and businesses depend on reliable and affordable energy to power their homes, grow their crops, and keep our economy competitive. Clean energy is a cornerstone of that effort – generating 44 percent of electricity in our states while supporting good-paying jobs in both urban and rural communities and strengthening the region’s energy security. As the least expensive and fastest-to-deploy sources of new electricity generation, wind and solar are critical to meeting rising demand while keeping electricity affordable.

The Western Interconnection projects a 17% increase in peak demand between 2024 and 2034. Meeting this increase in the most affordable way will require 68 GW of additional solar and 40 GW of land-based wind over the next decade. Yet, DOI’s new policies effectively take these options off the table. If federal permitting for solar and wind does not resume soon, our states risk losing projects already in development. Cancellations or indefinite delays of this scale would eliminate expected capacity from the interconnection queue, jeopardizing energy reliability while increasing costs for Western families and businesses.

We request answers to the following questions:

How will DOI’s new heightened federal reviews be applied in practice? Specifically

Will this be applied to all projects or will certain projects be exempt?

If certain projects are exempt, can DOI lay out the criteria and process for an exemption?

How will DOI ensure transparency in this review process to provide certainty to developers and stakeholders?

How will DOI ensure timely approvals for wind and solar projects for all 69 listed items on the heightened review list given the likely bottleneck created by elevating 69 new decision and action items to your office?

Can DOI clarify how impeding the development and deployment of the lowest-cost and most widely available energy sources is consistent with the Administration’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability? Has DOI conducted any internal legal, environmental, or economic analyses to evaluate the effects of this order on the nation’s ability to meet those goals?

The DOI Secretarial order defines actions broadly enough that it not only affects solar and wind projects on federal lands, but also state and private lands. Please explain why projects largely dependent on state and private development should be subjected to heightened federal reviews?

To what extent, if at all, has DOI consulted with any relevant authorities – such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, or state Public Utility Commissions – to assess the potential implications of DOI restricting wind and solar power permitting on grid reliability? Specifically, has DOI examined how these new actions might impact resource adequacy, reserve requirements, or reliability metrics such as loss of load expectation if there’s no new generation buildout?

Western states have led the way in demonstrating that clean energy strengthens local economies and the electric grid, setting ambitious goals for its energy transition. Additional layers of federal bureaucracy could effectively stall new renewable projects, forcing Westerners to face higher costs, less reliable energy service, and fewer opportunities for economic growth.

I urge you to address these questions swiftly and work in partnership with states to ensure that federal permitting supports, rather than undermines, efforts to build a secure and affordable energy future.

About the e-bike program CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground.
More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December.
Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.
Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.","California is halting its landmark electric bike voucher program with no announcement and millions of dollars still in the bank, and transit advocates are frustrated that the money appears to be going to a program geared toward electric cars instead.

The Electric Bicycle Incentive Program offered up to $2,000 to lower-income Californians to purchase e-bikes beginning last year. In a statement, the California Air Resources Board said only that it has redirected the funds toward another program “due to state budget constraints.”

“This is a recent outcome of legislative direction, and we have just started informing program partners,” CARB spokesperson Joe DeAnda said in an email, adding that it’s possible funding could be allocated for the program in future years.

Where is the money going instead?

But Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike), said she was told in mid-October that CARB would shift the program’s remaining funds to Clean Cars 4 All, a similar incentive program for electric vehicles.

While she said she felt the conversation was meant to be private, she expected it would be followed by a more formal announcement from the agency.

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.

According to Ramsey, about $17 million — more than half of the $30 million that’s been allocated to the e-bike program since its inception in 2022 — is set to go to the program for electric vehicles.

She said she was told that the funds were reallocated based on direction from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office to use any available CARB funding to continue supporting electric vehicle purchases as the federal government does away with its own incentives.

The Trump administration’s controversial One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 toward electric vehicle purchases.

“I think that’s really unfortunate that we’re responding to the current federal situation by limiting Californians’ ability to get really the cheapest and most economical, sustainable transportation option, instead of sort of doubling down and saying, ‘We have this really low-cost option that opens trips up for more people, and then we also have this other option for people who need cars,’” Ramsey said.

About the e-bike program

CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground. It wasn’t until 2024 that the agency began issuing $1,750 vouchers for a range of approved bikes to people whose annual household income fell under 300% of the federal poverty line. An additional $250 was available to applicants who met further income criteria.

The program was designed to expand access to an affordable transportation model, especially for non-drivers and people with limited mobility.

While it was heralded initially as an ambitious and significant step toward clean transportation, it also invited widespread criticism after a slow rollout, multiple pushed-back application timelines and two state investigations into Pedal Ahead, the nonprofit chosen to administer the vouchers.

Applicants also expressed frustration over technical issues with the application process once it got underway.

While the state’s electric vehicle incentive program has a rolling application process, the e-bike voucher program, by contrast, requires people to log onto the website at a prescribed time, click the application portal at just the right moment and enter their information under a time crunch.

“I found it a little bit surprising that the same entity would have two similar voucher programs run completely different ways ... when they had an existing program that was already working, that was distributing a large amount of money as well,” Ramsey said.

More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December. A second drop in May yielded a similar interest level.

“There were a lot of challenges. I don’t think anyone will tell you different,” Ramsey said.

Still, she said, at least some of the technology and availability frustrations the program spurred were also a sign of its value.

“The program was successful in showing that if you give people the opportunity to get an e-bike in an affordable manner, that they will take that opportunity and they will use e-bikes,” Ramsey told KQED.

Future drops were expected incrementally as long as funding was available. DeAnda said a third application round had been planned for next year before funds were redirected.

Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.

“Such a popular program shouldn’t be ended,” said Christopher White, the executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. “It should be operated well and fully funded because it promises to transform the mobility habits of tens of thousands of Californians to be more sustainable, far safer, [and it’s] far less expensive for the individuals to operate their new vehicles.

Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.

“It definitely gives the sense that CARB knows that this is the wrong direction to be moving in, to keep it so quiet,” he said.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/964abe9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1020x536+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F80%2F46%2F54d8ee634d70a3d414de9b540b55%2F240823-valenciatelegraphbikelanes-33-bl-qed-1020x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:02.188012

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States’ withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.
Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.

But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States’ withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three-tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, the U.N. Environment Program’s Emissions Gap report said Tuesday.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,″ said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. ”It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise. ″

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 C (2.7 F) since the mid-1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 C (4.1 to 4.5 F), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 C (5 F) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 C (3.1 F) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.

“We are making progress,’' UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. “We have to go faster.”

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

UNEP said the U.S. did not provide comments on the report by their deadline and asked for emissions data about the U.S. to be removed. The UNEP declined but included a footnote at the U.S. request, saying that it doesn’t support the report.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year, the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.

Light vehicle sales decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units last month, data from market analysis firm Omdia showed. Unadjusted sales of electric vehicles dropped to 74,897 units from 98,289 units in September.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill approved by the U.S. Congress this year eliminated $7,500 tax credits for buying or leasing new electric vehicles and a $4,000 used-EV credit at the end of September. The subsidies, implemented by the previous Democratic Biden administration, boosted EV sales in recent years.

“Sharply lower electric vehicle sales, following the expiration of the federal tax credit on Oct. 1, reduced dealer volumes over the month,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide Financial. “With concerns about the labor market building, the near-term outlook for auto sales could be soft as more consumers stay away from auto showrooms this holiday season.”

Overall unadjusted light vehicle sales were down 4.5% in October from a year ago. Last month’s sharp decline would suggest moderate or weak retail sales in October. But a 35-day shutdown of the government, on track to be the longest on record, has led to an economic data blackout.

The Chicago Federal Reserve is estimating retail sales excluding motor vehicles increased 0.3% last month after a projected 0.4% gain in September.

Limited data have suggested the labor market has remained stagnant since August, with layoffs still relatively low and hiring tepid. Economists say demand for labor has ebbed because of economic uncertainty, tariffs and companies embracing artificial intelligence. A sharp reduction in workers because of raids on undocumented immigrants is also weighing on the labor market.

A survey from the Conference Board last month showed consumers’ perceptions of the labor market remained downbeat in October. The unemployment rate was near a four-year high of 4.3% in August.

“Vehicle sales will face headwinds in the coming months,” said Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics. “New vehicles are one of the most exposed sectors to tariffs. So far, foreign and domestic automakers have largely absorbed the costs through their profit margins, but this isn’t sustainable.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/11/9016199_web1_2025-11-04T170102Z_2_LYNXMPELA3100_RTROPTP_4_CALIFORNIA-CARS.JPG,N,,2025-11-04 18:06:30.728639

For now, it remains a concept

It’s a true technology showcase for TRD.

It boasts no less than 547 horsepower

Developed by Toyota Racing Development (TRD) engineers in California and North Carolina, with support from Toyota Motor North America’s R&D department, this concept was created for the SEMA Show in Las Vegas. With 547 horsepower, a nearly silent powertrain, and a wealth of camping innovations, the Tacoma H2-Overlander embodies the fusion of performance, sustainability, and adventure.

“We wanted to preserve TRD’s off-road and desert racing heritage while incorporating cutting-edge powertrain technologies,” said Craig Cauthen, manager of TRD’s Emerging Technologies Group. “This vehicle showcases the TRD team’s capabilities beyond the racetrack.”

Design and Functionality

The exterior adopts a decidedly utilitarian look, featuring a custom overlanding camper made with recycled carbon-fibre aerodynamic panels. Reinforced bumpers, integrated tow points, a winch, recovery board mounts, and full DOT-compliant lighting complete the package.

“The Tacoma H2-Overlander Concept illustrates Toyota’s multi-pathway approach to carbon neutrality,” said Mike Tripp, vice president of Toyota Marketing. “Under the theme ‘Powered by Possibility,’ we’re demonstrating that hydrogen is not only viable but central to our vision of the future. This concept proves that clean energy and real-world capability can go hand in hand.”

A true team player, this next-generation Tacoma can also assist other electric vehicles thanks to a 15-kW power takeoff capable of powering an off-grid home or charging two EVs simultaneously via NEMA 14-50 outlets.

High-Performance Fuel Cell

When not building roaring NASCAR engines, the TRD-USA team acts as an innovation lab dedicated to Toyota’s sustainability goals. It has notably developed mobile hydrogen generators capable of powering an entire race weekend without noise or emissions.

The Tacoma H2-Overlander carries that same spirit forward. It incorporates Toyota Mirai’s second-generation hydrogen fuel cell and three tanks holding a total of 6 kg of hydrogen, all neatly packaged within the frame. The fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen in a chemical reaction that produces electricity and water vapor and nothing else.

The setup is supported by a 24.9-kWh lithium-ion battery. Together, they power a 225-kW (302 hp) front motor and a 188-kW (252 hp) rear eAxle. The result: the instant torque and responsiveness of an EV combined with the fast refuelling benefits of hydrogen.

Power is delivered through a front limited-slip differential and a rear electronic locking differential, making it a true four-wheel-drive adventurer. The engineers also strengthened the chassis with a TRD long-travel suspension kit, Fox 2.5 Performance Elite Series shocks derived from the Tundra, and upgraded front brakes. The 17 x 8.5-inch wheels are wrapped in 35-inch off-road tires, while a custom TRD cooling system, inspired by the Tacoma TRD Pro and Lexus RZ, maintains thermal stability for both the electric and hydrogen systems.

Another remarkable innovation is TRD’s patented water recovery system. It captures and filters the hydrogen fuel cell’s only byproduct, water, making it usable at the campsite. This distilled, mineral-free water can be used for washing or cleaning. While not recommended for drinking, it provides a valuable resource for explorers far from natural sources.

Toyota bZ Time Attack Concept: Electrified Power Takes on SEMA 2025

From Concept to Reality

Transforming a gasoline-powered Tacoma into a four-wheel-drive hydrogen vehicle in just a few months was a monumental challenge.

“Time was our greatest enemy,” admitted Cauthen. “The question was: what can we achieve within a tight timeline to bring to SEMA a fully functional vehicle that once ran on gasoline and now runs on hydrogen?”

To meet this challenge, TRD teams relied on 3D modeling, additive manufacturing, and a cross-country collaboration between North Carolina and California. The project resulted in several firsts, including the water recovery system and a “roboformed” tailgate developed with Toyota Motor North America Stamping.",https://motorillustrated.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-Tacoma_H2_Overlander_Concept_Toyota_SEMA-5.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 18:06:10.908551

Established in 2017, Edmonton Global is the economic development organization representing 14 municipalities within the Edmonton Metropolitan Region working together on economic development. Throughout the last eight years, our mandate has remained clear and consistent:

Help local companies expand into new markets through trade, and

Attract foreign direct investment (FDI) — bringing new companies, capital, and jobs to our region.

Both goals are critical to building a resilient, diverse, and globally competitive regional economy – and both outcomes exist under the umbrella term, economic development.

When people hear the term economic development, they often think of visible changes — new buildings, local business openings, or business improvement districts. While those are positive signs, they don’t necessarily tell the whole story of true economic growth.

Real economic development happens when a community brings new money into its economy — through exports, tourism, or investment from outside its borders. That external capital expands the community’s economic base, supports employment growth, and creates a ripple effect that benefits local businesses and residents alike.

This is where foreign direct investment plays a vital role. When a company from another country builds a facility, hires local talent, or partners with local suppliers, it’s not just creating jobs — it’s injecting new income into the local economy. Those wages are spent in local shops, restaurants, and services, creating what economists call the multiplier effect – every export-oriented job supports additional jobs in local sectors.

Focusing solely on “supporting local” businesses, while important, isn’t enough on its own. To grow, a community must attract new capital and produce goods and services that reach beyond local borders.

Foreign direct investment ensures that new wealth flows into the region, fueling innovation and expanding opportunities for everyone — from skilled tradespeople and engineers to small business owners and service providers. It connects our local economy to the global marketplace — and in doing so, strengthens the communities that make up our region.

This blog is the first post in a two-part series that explores why FDI matters and how it supports long-term regional prosperity. In Part 2, we’ll dive into the data to see how the Edmonton region stacks up globally and nationally.

What is Foreign Direct Investment?

Foreign direct investment happens when a company invests in another country – this can be through building a new facility, hiring local teams, or acquiring an existing business. These investments can take many forms. Just a couple of examples could include:

A manufacturer opening a new plant (for example UK’s Linde is currently constructing a $2 billion hydrogen production facility in Fort Saskatchewan),

A tech firming hiring a local team of software engineers (for example French multinational Sia partners opening an Edmonton office in 2022), or

A global company acquiring a local enterprise to grow its operations (for example US multinational Johnson Controls acquiring local tech giant Silent Aire in 2021 for $1.3 billion).

These types of investments do more than create new facilities or business expansions — they generate lasting economic benefits. When companies invest abroad, they bring with them new capital, technology, expertise, and market reach, helping to strengthen local supply chains, create high-quality jobs, and build global connections.

In short, FDI is one of the most effective ways for communities to grow their economies — which is why countries and regions around the world compete to attract it.

Why FDI matters

Countries and regions around the world rely on FDI to provide good quality jobs for their communities. In the United States, approximately 16 million (or around one in 10) jobs were directly or indirectly attributable to FDI. Here in Canada, that number is even higher, with more than one-third of positions being held by multinationals. In Alberta, roughly one in every four jobs is tied to a multinational organization. Many of the Edmonton region’s largest employers – including Shell, Gilead, and Cargill – are foreign investors who have built long-term operations here. Others, such as Stantec, Bee Clean, and Capital Power, are homegrown companies that are investing abroad and are building globally competitive businesses from right here in the Edmonton region.

According to Statistics Canada, multinational companies now employ more Albertans than ever — about 685,000 in 2023, up from 527,000 in 2010 (Figure 1).

Figure 1

This makes Alberta the third highest province in Canada for number of jobs from multinational organizations (Figure 2).

Figure 2

The same dataset highlights which sectors have seen job growth driven by multinational companies. Between 2010 and 2023, employment from multinationals increased across nearly all sectors (Figure 3).

Figure 3

Looking ahead

Global FDI has more than doubled over the past two decades – growing from 0.77 trillion USD in 2003 to more than 1.34 trillion in 2024, with the strongest growth in technology, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. Interestingly, investment flows for technology (especially electronics) surpassed energy and mining last year – bumping that sector into second; followed by general manufacturing in third (Figure 4).

This shows that Edmonton Global’s sector priorities are well aligned with global investment trends — all five of our focus sectors appear in the data, with energy and information technology among the top three.

Figure 4

Conclusion

These trends underscore why foreign direct investment is central to Edmonton Global’s mission. Each new investment represents more than capital — it’s a vote of confidence in our people, our industries, and our potential. By connecting the Edmonton region to global markets, we strengthen our local economy and ensure that prosperity is shared across our 14 municipalities.

In the next part of this series, we’ll examine how the Edmonton region compares nationally and globally, and where the biggest opportunities for growth lie ahead.",https://edmontonglobal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Title-Page.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:38.753271

The Path Forward This session demonstrated California’s ability to pair ambitious climate policy with practical solutions for affordability and reliability.","Last month, Governor Gavin Newsom wrapped up bill actions for the 2025 legislative session, signing into law a suite of measures that together comprise one of California’s most comprehensive climate and energy packages in recent years. This year’s session was defined by efforts to pair climate ambition with affordability, with major bills aimed at cutting costs, stabilizing markets, and advancing clean energy deployment.

CATF’s advocacy, expertise sharing, and policy development helped shape several of these wins. While the legislature advanced a broad set of climate and energy-related measures, the following bills reflect areas of most direct CATF engagement and alignment with current priorities — ensuring strong climate ambition, supporting durable market frameworks, enabling policies that help meet the state’s Scoping Plan targets, and advancing energy affordability for Californians.

Electricity Affordability

Electricity affordability is one of California’s biggest clean energy challenges, with rates far outpacing inflation over the last several years. A key legislative priority this session was to advance policies to address near-term and long-term drivers of rising rates. SB 254establishes financing reforms for a portion of wildfire mitigation expenditures — a major near-term driver of rate increases. To address costs of grid infrastructure over the next several decades, the bill contains a lower-cost alternative to utility financing by enabling public financing for transmission infrastructure. Analysis from CATF and Net-Zero California found that Californians could save $3 billion per year, or approximately $123 billion over 40 years, by replacing high-cost equity with lower-cost public debt financing in the form of a public-private partnership. SB 254 turns this research into action by establishing the California Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator to coordinate transmission planning, facilitate public financing, reduce project costs, and develop a public-private partnership plan to maximize public financing and ratepayer benefits. The bill also establishes the Transmission Accelerator Revolving Fund, seeded with $325 million from Proposition 4 and a five-year allocation of 5% of Cap-and-Invest revenues from utility allowances as established under AB 1207 (Irwin).

Looking ahead: SB 254 lays a strong foundation for delivering real savings and accelerating grid expansion. Its success will depend on how effectively the Accelerator can structure and deploy public financing to lower capital costs and demonstrate measurable ratepayer benefits.

Extending Cap-and-Invest and Strengthening Market Integrity

California’s Cap-and-Invest program is the cornerstone of the state’s economy-wide approach to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, providing a market signal for clean investment and generating billions in annual revenue for climate priorities. The program’s authorization was set to expire at the end of the decade; AB 1207 (Irwin) reauthorizes California’s Cap-and-Invest program through 2045, while companion legislation SB 840 (Limón) outlines a plan for allocating revenues from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

Both bills contain provisions around the use of offsets. SB 840 directs CARB to update all existing compliance offset protocols by 2029 to reflect the best available science, with reviews every five years starting in 2034. AB 1207 caps the use of offsets at 6% of an entity’s compliance obligation, requiring that half of those offsets deliver environmental benefits in-state, and permanently retires an equal number of allowances so that their use effectively translates into a tightening of the overall cap.

SB 840 also directs CARB to consider new carbon-removal protocols and for the first time, earmarks funding for climate-focused technological innovation — a yet-to-be-fully-defined category of technologies that could range from carbon dioxide removal and storage to industrial decarbonization solutions.

Looking ahead: The reauthorization of California’s Cap-and-Invest program marks a pivotal moment for aligning long-term climate goals with durable market design. As implementation begins, attention will turn to ensuring that the Cap-and-Invest program maintains a high bar for climate ambition and that the offset protocols reflect best-available science. Recent research from CATF and leading U.S. forest carbon scientists found that while high-quality forest carbon credits are possible under California’s current protocol, the protocol needs to be strengthened to ensure credits deliver their promised climate benefits. The assessment offers a roadmap for incorporating new data and scientific advances to improve accuracy, durability, and transparency for forest carbon offsets.

Modernizing Permitting and Regulatory Frameworks for Geothermal Energy

California is home to some of the nation’s richest geothermal resources, which offer a vital source of clean, firm power that can operate around the clock to complement the state’s growing portfolio of renewables and battery storage. Yet development remains constrained by fragmented permitting processes, outdated well regulations, and high development costs. AB 531 (Rogers),expands eligibility for geothermal projects of all sizes to use the California Energy Commission’s “one-stop-shop” permitting process, providing an additional option to streamline project approvals. A companion bill, AB 527 (Papan), was vetoed and would have exempted exploration wells from CEQA under certain conditions and required the state to modernize its well regulations for enhanced geothermal systems.

Looking ahead: The veto underscores the need for modernizing the state’s geothermal regulations through administrative action and evaluating whether additional permitting streamlining measures are needed to accelerate project development. As outlined in CATF’s recent report, “Unlocking California’s Geothermal Potential: A Strategic Opportunity for Clean, Firm Power,” these are important components to unlocking the state’s full potential for clean, reliable, around-the-clock power.

Lifting the Moratorium on CO₂ Pipelines

California’s currentstrategy to achieve carbon neutrality calls for capturing or removing 100 million metric tons (MMT) of CO₂ annually by 2045. To help operationalize this pathway, SB 905 (Caballero, 2022) directed CARB and other state agencies to develop a regulatory framework for carbon capture, utilization, and storage and carbon dioxide removal to support the safe and effective deployment of these technologies. SB 905 also established a moratorium on pipeline transport of CO₂ until updated federal safety regulations were finalized.

With the timing of federal rulemaking still uncertain, the state has now taken action to pass SB 614 (Stern), which gives California the authority to define safe CO₂ transport. The bill lifts the moratorium on intrastate CO₂ pipelines and directs the State Fire Marshal to adopt safety regulations by 2026 that meet or exceed federal standards proposed by PHMSA in January 2025. SB 614 builds on the framework established under SB 905, ensuring that transport infrastructure for carbon management can be developed safely and consistently.

Looking ahead: Coordination across agencies will be essential to align safety, permitting, and public engagement processes. Effective implementation of both laws will help California advance carbon management projects responsibly and transparently.

Indirect Source Review for Mobile Source Pollution

Under the Clean Air Act, states and localities have the authority to regulate emissions from stationary facilities that attract mobile sources of pollution. In California, mobile sources contribute the majority of the state’s NOx emissions (a precursor to ozone and particular matter), and the transportation sector accounts for 40 percent of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect Source Review (ISR) can be a powerful tool to regulate mobile sources of pollution at facilities like airports, warehouses, ports, and distribution centers, and several districts in California have promulgated rules for warehouses and new development. This session, lawmakers considered two ISR bills. AB 914 (Garcia) sought to affirm the CARB’s authority to promulgate statewide ISR rules and clarify a pathway for state-wide regulation of pollution from major transportation hubs. The bill ultimately stalled, but the debate underscored the importance of using every available state policy tool to cut harmful emissions in the face of federal attacks on California’s mobile source regulations.

SB 34 (Richardson) would have imposed restrictions on the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s ISR rule for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, establishing a harmful precedent of legislative constraint on air district ISR authority. Governor Newsom vetoed the bill, citing the need for the state to maintain every tool at its disposal to reduce air and climate pollution.

Looking ahead: As federal efforts to weaken mobile-source regulations continue, California’s leadership will depend on leveraging its full suite of policy tools — including ISR — to advance clean, reliable, and equitable transportation decarbonization. Clarifying statewide authority to adopt ISR rules could enable the state to drive deeper emission reductions across transportation and industrial corridors, accelerate the deployment of zero-emission technologies, and deliver cleaner air for communities most affected by mobile source pollution.

Other Key Measures

The legislature also advanced several major measures with broad implications for reliability, affordability, and the state’s long-term energy transition.

Regional Grid Integration – AB 825 authorizes California’s participation in a western regional electricity market, paving the way for greater coordination across state lines. Regional integration is expected to enhance grid reliability, lower costs for ratepayers by hundreds of millions annually, and enable more efficient use of renewable and clean firm generation resources across the West. This marks an important step toward building the transmission and market structures needed for a decarbonized, resilient power system.

Refinery Transition – With two of California’s refineries announcing closure, concerns had been mounting regarding potential gasoline supply shortages that could increase prices at the pump. SB 237 (Grayson) sought to mitigate potential fuel supply disruptions and price volatility during the state’s clean energy transition. The bill streamlines permitting for certain in-state oil projects, authorizes the Governor to suspend summer-blend fuel requirements if gasoline prices rise sharply, and directs the California Energy Commission to study alternative fuel blends and explore a regional approach to stabilizing prices across western states. The measure underscores the complexity of sustaining climate progress while maintaining affordability.

The Path Forward

This session demonstrated California’s ability to pair ambitious climate policy with practical solutions for affordability and reliability. With landmark measures now on the books, the challenge ahead lies in implementation — translating statute into durable progress, sound regulation, and tangible results for households and businesses while sustaining momentum toward the state’s 2045 climate and energy goals.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10133250/california-clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:00:54.594520

Businesses would also face significant financial challenges in planning for emissions reductions, making it harder to compete with companies in countries that maintain robust emissions reporting and compliance systems.","Chicago– Attorney General Kwame Raoul, as part of a coalition of 15 attorneys general and two cities, filed a comment letter opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to rescind the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The program is designed to collect accurate and comprehensive data on greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial sources across the United States. Its primary purpose is to provide policymakers, businesses, researchers and the public with reliable information to track emissions trends and evaluate the effectiveness of climate policies.

“Ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would jeopardize public health and the environment,” Raoul said. “This program is a longstanding source of reliable greenhouse gas emissions data that strengthens our nation’s competitiveness and allows policymakers to plan emissions reductions effectively. I join my fellow attorneys general in opposing this unlawful proposal.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program was established in 2009 by the EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act, following a congressional mandate. The program requires facilities releasing 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, along with suppliers of fossil fuels and certain industrial gases, to report their annual emissions. The program has been recognized as the most comprehensive national inventory of greenhouse gas data in the world, covering about 85% to 90% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This data has informed regulatory actions, corporate sustainability strategies and research on emissions trends across key economic sectors.

Last month, the EPA issued a Proposed Rule seeking to eliminate the program arguing that it does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to require emissions reporting and that the data collected isn’t necessary for any current or future federal rule or regulation.

Raoul and the coalition argue in their comment letter that the lack of emissions reporting could lead to higher greenhouse gas concentrations, contributing to climate change, extreme weather events and ecosystem disruption.

The program collects comprehensive data on harmful greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources across the United States, providing policymakers, businesses, researchers, and the public with reliable information to track pollution and evaluate the effectiveness of climate policies.

In the comment letter, the coalition highlights how the rescission of the program would not only be unlawful but would also jeopardize public health and the environment. It would undermine the nation’s competitiveness worldwide by eliminating the U.S.’s longstanding source of reliable facility-level greenhouse gas data needed to plan emissions reductions effectively.

“Climate change driven by pollution represents one of the biggest challenges our communities face today. Continual denial of the scope of this problem only threatens to make our country weaker, less healthy, and less prepared for the consequences,” Brown said.

The reporting program was established in 2009 by the EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act, following a congressional mandate. The program requires facilities releasing 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, along with suppliers of fossil fuels and certain industrial gases, to report their annual emissions.

It has been recognized as “the most comprehensive national inventory of greenhouse gas data in the world” and the “gold standard of emissions reporting,” covering about 85-90% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions – providing benefits that dramatically outweigh the minor burden reporting poses to a covered facility. This data has informed regulatory actions, corporate sustainability strategies, and research on emissions trends across key economic sectors.

Last month, the EPA issued a Proposed Rule seeking to virtually eliminate the GHGRP, arguing that it does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to require emissions reporting and that the data collected isn’t necessary for any current or future federal rule or regulation.

In the comment letter, the multistate coalition argues:

Lack of emissions reporting could lead to higher greenhouse gas concentrations, contributing to climate change, extreme weather events, and ecosystem disruption.

Without emissions data, states and businesses would struggle to develop effective mitigation strategies, resulting in severe consequences for public health and the environment nationwide. At the same time, companies would face significant financial challenges in planning for emissions reductions, making it harder to compete with companies in countries that maintain robust emissions reporting and compliance systems.

Emissions

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

Under the OBBBA, solar facilities must either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027.
The ITC also benefits from the fact that solar credits, like Section 45L, do not reduce LIHTC basis under current law.
For LIHTC developers, rooftop and carport solar facilities on affordable housing properties are often prime candidates under category 3.","The window to pair affordable housing incentives with clean energy credits is narrowing, and developers of low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) properties face a pivotal period over the next 18 months. The Section 45L new energy efficient home credit, a valuable financing tool for housing developers which was substantially enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), now sunsets for housing acquired after June 30, 2026, as called for under H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).

At the same time, the clean electricity investment tax credit (ITC) for solar, under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 48E, is also on a compressed runway and under new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions. OBBBA requires projects to either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027, and the supply chain for facilities financed must be heavily divested from China and other nations of concern by 2026 to secure the full value of the credit. For sponsors navigating lease-up schedules, financing timelines and rising construction costs, the multiple near-term deadlines present both a challenge and an opportunity.

Affordable housing developers still have opportunities to leverage Sections 45L and 48E credits, as well as the Low-Income Communities Bonus (LICB) program, but they must act quickly and proactively adapt or even pivot to meet new near-term deadlines for eligibility.

The Lease-Up Clock for Section 45L

The Section 45L effective date is based on when a unit is acquired, meaning the timing is driven by when the financed improvements are placed in service, and the housing is first leased or sold. For LIHTC developers, this timing sensitivity makes lease-up as important as physical construction. To claim Section 45L credits in the 2025 tax year, apartments must be placed in service and leased or sold before Dec. 31, 2025. If lease-up occurs after June 30, 2026, the credit disappears entirely. This creates pressure for sponsors to coordinate not only construction schedules but also leasing strategies that align with financing needs and equity adjusters.

The Inflation Reduction Act made Section 45L particularly attractive to affordable housing developers because it no longer reduces LIHTC basis when combined with the LIHTC. The Section 45L credit itself can range from $500 to $5,000 per unit, depending on whether developments meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR or U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Zero Energy Ready Home standards and whether prevailing wage requirements are satisfied.

The approaching sunset means that Section 45L qualification must be treated as a race against the calendar. Importantly, since Section 45L qualification is determined on a unit-by-unit basis, credits can be claimed for the proportion of Section 45L qualifying apartments that are leased up by June 30, 2026, even if all apartments on the property will not be leased at that time. For example, if 80% of the apartments are leased by the June 30, 2026, deadline, then the property owner can still claim 80% of the available Section 45L credits.

The ITC for Residential Solar as a Boost and a Backstop

While Section 45L is now only available through June 2026, small solar installations that qualify for the Section 48E ITC offer a critical backstop. Under the OBBBA, solar facilities must either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027. Developers that begin construction by the July 2026 deadline retain access to the four-year continuity safe harbor, allowing additional time to complete developments without losing eligibility.

For LIHTC properties, small on-site systems of 1.5 megawatts (MW) AC or less are particularly well positioned. According to new IRS guidance on beginning construction issued Aug. 15, Notice 2025-42, these systems can still rely on both the established 5% safe harbor test, achieved by incurring at least 5% of energy property costs before the deadline, or the physical work test. While the physical work test remains the same, requiring demonstrable progress on-site or through off-site fabrication under binding contracts, facilities will now need to more significantly demonstrate and document that construction has begun because of the administration and U.S. Department of the Treasury’s focus on stricter enforcement to prevent perceived circumventions. The result is that distributed solar remains one of the few asset classes where developers can choose their compliance path, an advantage in a market where interconnection and procurement delays are common.

The ITC also benefits from the fact that solar credits, like Section 45L, do not reduce LIHTC basis under current law. This allows developers to fully stack LIHTC equity, the ITC (with potential bonus credits such as the low-income communities bonus), and Section 45L where eligible. For developments where the Section 45L value is at risk because of timing, small photovoltaic systems can “backfill” the capital stack to an extent by providing alternative credits not tied to lease-up schedules and with a longer horizon.

The Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program

The LICB program (also known as the Environmental Justice Solar and Wind Capacity Limitation) established by the IRA has been a particularly important tool for LIHTC properties leveraging small solar. Administered by the DOE and the IRS, the LICB program selects qualified solar or wind facilities under 5 MW serving low-income households, affordable housing or designated low-income census tracts up to 1.8 GWs in annual aggregate capacity (unused amounts may be carried forward). Awardees are then eligible to increase their ITC by an additional 10% or 20%.

The program is divided into four categories that cover facilities located in low-income communities or on Indian land (categories 1 and 2 respectively), low-income residential buildings (category 3), and low-income economic benefits projects (category 4). The 1.8 GWs are shared across the categories, plus unallocated capacity carried over from the previous year. In 2025, category 1 received an approximately 33% allocation, or 643.6 MWs; categories 2 and 3 each received approximately 12%, or 243.6 MWs; and category 4 received 43%, or 843.6 MWs, for a total of 1.974 GWs.

For LIHTC developers, rooftop and carport solar facilities on affordable housing properties are often prime candidates under category 3.

The challenge is uncertainty: while the 2025 application round remained active after the change in administration and the IRS program page remains active and still includes the annual awards schedule out to 2032, questions persist. It is unclear whether it will continue to be implemented in 2026 on time or at all given legislative changes, administrative delays, and the administration’s energy agenda and actions taken so far to stymie solar generation, in addition to wind.

Despite this uncertainty, developers should prepare: if the next allocation round proceeds as planned, housing and solar developers should be ready to submit applications as early as possible. The applications require detailed project information, interconnection status and documentation tying the facility to eligible communities. Because allocations are competitive, readiness at the time of application can determine whether a development secures the bonus.

Under the existing Biden-era schedule still provided on the IRS program page, the 2026 round will open Feb. 2, 2026, at 9 a.m. with the standard 30-day initial application window, which is set to close March 3. The rolling application period then closes Aug. 7 for all other applications outside of the initial 30-day window.

Documentation and Compliance Risks

The ability to claim these credits depends heavily on documentation. A solar developer should prepare for heightened scrutiny of beginning-of-construction evidence, whether relying on the 5% safe harbor or physical work, by creating and retaining extensive documentation including but not limited to binding contracts, invoices, fabrication logs, site photographs and interconnection applications to substantiate eligibility.

Developers will also need to prove compliance with FEOC restrictions on prohibited foreign entities and material assistance starting in 2026. Restrictions on material assistance up to the thresholds initially set in the OBBBA can be avoided by establishing that construction has begun prior to 2026, but the prohibition on prohibited entities as taxpayers goes into effect with minimal exemptions and safe harbors. Treasury has not yet issued guidance or regulations on how the restrictions will be implemented but developers can begin reasonably preparing by examining business and project structures based on what the legislation has laid out. While FEOC compliance will be the responsibility of the taxpayer that owns the solar facility, any developer that works with the solar taxpayer will need to be prepared as well to assist with due diligence.

Prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) compliance can also play a role. For multifamily developments, full Section 45L value is only available if wage requirements are met (the apprenticeship requirement does not apply to Section 45L), potentially adding costs but also significantly increasing the per-unit credit. While facilities less than 1 MW automatically qualify for the PWA credit step-up rate, if financing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or other federal financial assistance assists the property, this would trigger wage requirements. Facilities more than 1 MW must of course adhere to the requirements as required by Section 48E.

Developers must weigh these compliance obligations against the potential tax benefits and ensure that payroll and certification documentation is in place well before credits are claimed.

What Developers Should Do Now

For LIHTC sponsors, the strategic imperative is clear: accelerate lease-ups where possible to capture Section 45L credits before July 2026, while simultaneously advancing rooftop solar facilities that can secure ITC value. This dual approach provides a hedge against timing risk. If apartments are leased by June 30, 2026, Section 45L credits can be claimed; if lease-up slips, solar can still anchor the financing structure. Early coordination with investors and syndicators is vital, since equity adjusters may hinge on the year credits are recognized or when developments are placed in service.

Rooftop and carport arrays at LIHTC properties are strong candidates for LICB program awards, particularly category 3. Category 1 and 2 applicable facilities that are in low-income communities or on Indian land qualify for a 10% increase. Category 3 and 4 applicable facilities that are part of a qualified low-income residential building project or a qualified low-income economic benefit project are eligible for a 20% increase.

The LICB program, if accessed, can transform the economics of LIHTC developments with on-site solar. A 20% bonus layered on top of the base 30% ITC materially strengthens the case for including distributed solar, even in developments where Section 45L may slip away.

LIHTC and Residential Solar Resilience

Two clocks are ticking for affordable housing developers. The first is the Section 45L clock, which measures not just when developments are completed, but when housing is leased. The second is the ITC clock, which requires projects to either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027. While these deadlines create pressure and urgency, there are also opportunities.

The LICB program adds a third dimension. Its future may be uncertain, but the rewards for developers that prepare could be substantial. In a financing environment where every dollar counts, the difference between securing or missing a LICB allocation could reshape a development’s feasibility.

For developers willing to accelerate schedules, tighten documentation practices and integrate small solar into their developments, the near-term period represents a chance to capture substantial additional value without sacrificing LIHTC equity. Treat Section 45L as a race to lease-up, treat small solar as both a backstop and a catalyst, and treat the LICB program as a potential bonus too valuable to overlook. The next three to nine months will determine whether affordable housing properties leave millions of dollars on the table or seize the chance to strengthen financial resilience and energy security for decades to come.

Wang’s work had piled up after the company, led by billionaire cofounder Lei Jun (雷軍), unveiled a bold plan to become the first tech firm to successfully shift into automaking.

Lei, 55, staked his reputation on the transition, a feat even Apple Inc failed to achieve, vowing that it was his “last entrepreneurial project.”

A key part of executing that vision was Xiaomi’s retail network — Wang’s responsibility. To compete with the likes of BYD Co and Tesla Inc in China’s burgeoning EV market, the company had decided to overhaul its chain of retail outlets by converting stores designed for smartphones into showrooms to feature full-sized sedans and SUVs.

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Xiaomi fired about half of the staff responsible for the effort, leaving about 10 people, according to a former employee and a current staff member, both of whom worked with Wang and asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive issues.

The small team felt their workload sharply increase at the beginning of last year, when the company raced to roll out EV stores in time for the launch of its signature SU7 sedan, the people said.

Wang worked longer hours as he took on the team’s biggest projects in addition to his duties carrying out routine maintenance on the company’s web of stores, they said.

Plus, he was based in Xiaomi’s headquarters in Beijing, making him more visible to top company brass.

In the first eight months of the year, he worked on at least 267 retail stores, often retrofitting stores with an area for EVs, according to a trove of internal documents, photographs and WeChat messages reviewed by Bloomberg News.

On Aug. 25 last year, less than three days after he collapsed in front of his son, he died of a heart attack at the age of 34.

Local authorities ruled that Wang’s death was not related to his job at Xiaomi, but his widow is convinced that his punishing work schedule contributed to his death.

“He was treated just like a leaf: When it falls, people step on it without noticing its existence,” Luna Liu told Bloomberg News.

She agreed to speak publicly for the first time since his death because she thinks his case deserves more attention. She also shared thousands of her late husband’s work-related WeChat messages out of concern that Chinese companies push their employees too hard, with little regard for their health and welfare.

Xiaomi had given Wang more responsibility because he took his duties so seriously. He was in charge of some of the company’s most high-profile projects, including its flagship showroom just off Tiananmen Square. He still had dozens of other projects to manage at the same time.

Wang’s motivation for working long hours is complicated. People close to him said he felt a strong sense of obligation and would take on tasks himself because there was not anyone else who could share his duties. He also drove himself hard, keeping track of hundreds of projects and grinding for hours to make sure he delivered on what the company needed.

He was paid well by Chinese standards, bringing home about 600,000 yuan (US$84,000) a year, including stock options, according to his widow.

However, he lived under “immense mental strain” because he was caught between the demands of top company leaders and the realities on the ground, she said.

“He was sandwiched between his bosses and the stores whenever there was an issue with one of the projects,” she said.

In response to a detailed request for comment from Bloomberg News, a spokesperson for Xiaomi said: “We are deeply saddened by the unfortunate passing of our colleague and extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. At the same time, we do our utmost to provide support and assistance to our colleague’s family under the applicable laws and regulations.”

Xiaomi is not the only company pushing its employees to work long hours. Staff across China’s tech sector complain that they spend all their time at the office. Several told Bloomberg News that overwork — defined by the WHO as more than 55 hours a week — is prevalent in many top firms.

Wang’s story offers a rare glimpse of the enormous pressure inside China’s tech companies. One reason is a renewed urgency to stay competitive in China’s increasingly crowded market, where battles for customers in sectors from EVs to e-commerce are red hot. Rivalry with the US in semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) has also brought the culture to some state-affiliated companies.

Excessive work culture, dubbed “996” for the expectation to be in the office from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, is deeply rooted in China’s tech sector.

A decade ago, it was driven by the belief that hard work would reap rewards as rapid economic growth created opportunities, according to Mary Gallagher, a professor of global affairs at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.

Now, it is more about national priorities and a sense of patriotic duty as China competes in chips, AI and EVs.

“These industries that are doing so well — including on export markets — and are so important to the confidence that [Chinese President] Xi Jinping [習近平] wants to see in the economy,” said Gallagher, the author of Authoritarian Legality in China: Law, Workers, and the State.

“There’s enormous pressure in those places,” she said.

Lei’s pivot to EVs began with an initial investment of US$1.4 billion, followed by massive spending on nearly every corner of the supply chain, from batteries and chips to air suspension and sensors.

In all, it pumped more than US$1.6 billion into more than 100 suppliers from 2021 to last year, according to data compiled by Chinese analytics firm Zhangtongshe and Bloomberg.

As EV production was ramping up at the beginning of last year, company leadership also turned their attention to boosting sales. Two months before Xiaomi launched the SU7, Wang took on even more work. He was sending WeChat messages to colleagues from early in the morning to late at night, with some of them sent from his home. On one particularly long day at the end of January last year, he asked about the installation of mirrors at an outlet at about 2:30am. A few hours later, he pressed a furniture supplier to finish a project five times faster than originally quoted.

“At one point he was shouldering the workload of seven or eight people. He said he was busy like a spinning top,” Liu said. “Many times I told him: ‘Although you come back home every day, sometimes I feel I haven’t seen you for days.’”

After the Lunar New Year holiday in February last year, Wang worked at a relentless pace, exchanging hundreds of photos and messages with colleagues about the flagship showroom in Beijing, according to the collection of documents reviewed by Bloomberg.

As the location neared completion at the end of March, Wang spent all night there, toiling to fix the lighting system and charging poles in the basement. He also raced to get the floor reinforced after finding it had cracked under the weight of a car.

One evening, Xiaomi president Lu Weibing (盧偉冰) announced in a post on Chinese social media that he would make a long-awaited visit to the flagship store in Beijing the next morning. After sharing the news with a colleague, Wang worried about getting the showroom ready at short notice.

“Tomorrow decides everything,” he wrote on WeChat.

His hard work paid off: About two weeks later, Lei lauded the flagship location as “one of the most iconic among our 59 stores nationwide.”

The SU7 launch in March last year catapulted Xiaomi into China’s EV market.

Costing 215,900 yuan, it comes in below the 219,800 yuan asking price for a BYD Han L and the 235,500 yuan price tag of a Tesla Model 3. The Porsche Taycan — the vehicle to which the SU7 bears an uncanny resemblance — starts at about US$100,000.

Since the unveiling, Xiaomi’s stock has soared about 200 percent in Hong Kong, but the company still has a long way to go before it could break into the elite club of automakers. It has set a delivery target of 350,000 units this year, up from its previous goal of 300,000. By comparison, China’s top car brand, BYD Co, sold about 4.3 million EVs and hybrids last year, many overseas, while Tesla moved about 1.8 million vehicles globally.

Xiaomi has “democratized technology” and created an image that has resonated well with Chinese consumers, said Bill Russo, founder and chief executive officer of Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility.

“Xiaomi is a known consumer brand that makes technology affordable and that’s been their value prop from the beginning for virtually every device that they manufacture,” Russo said. “Lei Jun is kind of a rock star in the perception of the Chinese consumer.”

In the past few years, China has been gripped by a national debate over the need to improve work-life balance. Social media platforms such as Weibo and Xiaohongshu have been flooded with posts — which are impossible to verify — about long working hours. The topic took on greater importance in the past few years following a series of high-profile deaths attributed to overwork, with the Chinese Communist Party voicing its support for protecting the rights of workers.

Work culture appeared to improve during the pandemic, when some tech staff were allowed to work flexible hours. The Chinese government also rolled out some efforts to improve working environments in an attempt to beat back the public outcry following a series of deaths attributed to overwork. Public officials held discussions and announced plans to improve working situations.

In 2021, Chinese authorities opened an investigation into working conditions at e-commerce company PDD Holdings Inc following the death of an employee in her early 20s. The employee collapsed while walking home with colleagues. Her death sparked a social media backlash against PDD and the relentless working schedules expected of its workers. The following year, a content moderator at Bilibili Inc, China’s largest anime streaming site, died from a brain hemorrhage.

Both companies have denied wrongdoing.

Neither PDD nor Bilibili responded to requests for comment.

China’s national labor laws cap standard working time at 44 hours per week, but employers can negotiate with trade unions and employees to extend that. Figures from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics show that staff at Chinese companies have worked longer hours in the past few years. Last year, the average workweek totaled 49 hours with no break, up slightly from 47.9 in 2022.

Full-time employees in the US last year worked an average of 43 hours a week, according to a Gallup survey.

This year, the Chinese government released an action plan to “regulate the unwholesome work culture,” pushing provincial governments to take a greater role in preventing excessive hours.

“Local authorities are urged to better protect workers’ rights to rest and tighten supervision over employers’ behaviors of illegally lengthening employees’ working hours without permission,” the state-owned China Daily reported in March.

However, the problem has not gone away.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s engineers canceled vacations and worked through this year’s Lunar New Year holiday to play catch up after DeepSeek shocked the global tech industry with its low-cost, powerful AI model in January.

PDD, locked in a price war with Alibaba and JD.com, also made some staff cancel their holiday plans during the same period.

It offered overtime bonuses to those who stayed behind to keep its Web site running, said one employee in Shanghai, who asked for anonymity to discuss their schedule.

The employee, in her mid-30s, said that she received a bonus of about 3,000 yuan after working four days during the holidays.

Alibaba and PDD did not respond to requests for comment.

Another engineer, at Shanghai-based chip equipment maker Ueascend, said that he was only able to take one day off per week since he joined the company last year.

Team calls were sometimes scheduled on the few days he had off, and when urgent projects came in, he would work from morning until 11pm for days, said the 25-year-old, who also asked for anonymity to talk about their working hours.

Staff at drone maker DJI and Apple supplier Desay Battery also claimed poor working conditions.

Bloomberg News was unable to reach Ueascend.

Desay Battery did not respond to requests for comment.

A DJI spokesperson said that its staff work an average of nine hours per day and regularly get a two-day weekend.

In April, Chinese media reported that Xiaomi was requiring employees to work at least 11.5 hours a day, with those who worked less than eight hours were told to submit a formal explanation.

Xiaomi did not respond to questions about the media reports.

A survey published last year by Chinese job hunting platform Maimai showed that Xiaomi workers averaged 11.5 hours a day, among the most in the country’s tech industry.

Staff at ByteDance Ltd. Meituan and Tencent Holdings Ltd all clocked double-digit hours, according to the survey, which did not explain its methodology.

In the US, the average workday spanned 8 hours and 44 minutes, with just 5 percent of employees working on weekends, according to data from workforce analytics company ActivTrak.

ByteDance declined to comment, while Meituan and Tencent did not respond to questions from Bloomberg News.

Wang’s long hours did not go unnoticed. He was praised by his bosses for expanding Xiaomi’s network of EV showrooms, according to his internal performance review, which covered the first half of last year.

The company credited him with rolling out new stores “at a unified standard, with high efficiency and quality,” the review said.

In the weeks leading up to his death in August last year, Wang worked on at least 80 stores, according to his WeChat messages.

Most of the sites he visited were in Beijing, but he kept a frantic schedule, criss-crossing northeastern China.

Only two team members were available to help him with a broad range of tasks that included renovation as well as supplier management and accounting, according to one of the former colleagues.

During a three-day trip at the beginning of the month that he died, he visited at least 14 Xiaomi outlets in Harbin, Changchun and Shenyang. He made his last business trip on Aug. 20 last year, visiting at least three stores in Tianjin, about 30 minutes from Beijing by train or a 1.5-hour drive.

On Aug. 22, Wang felt so weak he called in sick and went to a hospital for medical checks. While there, he received dozens of WeChat messages from staff at about five different outlets. He told a store manager in Shenyang that he was sick and someone else would visit his projects that day.

“Xiaomi’s employees are all warriors,” the manager replied, encouraging Wang to get better and including a crying facepalm emoji.

The work exchanges lasted until at least 4pm. Later that day, he took the trip with his son to a grocery store. There, his heart seized up, briefly stopping the flow of blood to his brain, and he slumped to the floor.

He was rushed to an intensive care unit by ambulance, his widow said.

Less than three days later he was dead.

Bloomberg News reviewed a copy of Wang’s death certificate that listed acute myocardial infarction — commonly known as a heart attack — as the cause of his death.

Wang was in good health at the time of his death, had no pre-existing conditions and maintained an active lifestyle, his widow said.

He underwent regular annual physical exams, but missed his appointment last year because of a scheduling conflict, she said.

He would spend his time off with his family, going on hikes in the mountains around Beijing and accompanying his son to extracurricular activities, she and a colleague said.

He regularly went on 5km runs to ease the stress of his job, another colleague said.

Wang’s widow told Xiaomi that she believed her husband had died from excessive work.

The company reported the incident to local authorities, which determined that Wang’s death was not work related.

According to Chinese guidelines, an employee is deemed to have had a work-related death only if they die within 48 hours of receiving treatment for an injury sustained on the job.

The Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.

Xiaomi denied any wrongdoing.

It offered the family 50,000 yuan as a hardship payment, but no funds were paid out, Liu said.

The company helped her access her husband’s investment portfolio, but later rescinded some of his stock options, she added.

Days after her husband passed away, Liu took to Sina Weibo to address Xiaomi’s boss directly.

“I hope Mr Lei can take a look at employee Wang Peizhi’s sudden death,” she wrote. “My husband contributed to the success of Xiaomi’s EVs. He was so tired because of too much pressure from work.”

Her posts gained little traction, with some people commenting that she was just seeking additional compensation from Xiaomi.

By the end of the year, she stopped using Sina Weibo.

“It’s okay if I was misunderstood or insulted, but the company still owes me an apology,” she wrote in one of her final posts.

Within Xiaomi, Wang’s death was not widely reported, two of his former colleagues said.

Zhang Jian (張建), a Xiaomi executive in charge of nationwide stores at the time, hosted an internal meeting about Wang’s death, according to the current employee.

He told colleagues that Wang had died from a heart attack and the company was talking to his family.

No changes to the team’s working hours were made.

Zhang has been promoted to head the company’s EV sales in China.

These days, the workload at the company varies by department.

On Wang’s former team, tasks usually pile up at the end of the month, the current employee said.

Another current Xiaomi employee who works on a different team in Beijing said they usually work between 50 and 60 hours per week and rarely go in on weekends.

A separate staffer on the company’s smartphone research team said they work more than 50 hours per week, including occasional hours on Saturday and Sunday.

Wang’s widow said he left his family with debts totaling about 4 million yuan, including the mortgage on their house.

His life insurance policy, provided by Xiaomi, disbursed a one-time payment of about 800,000 yuan.

At home in Beijing, she has tried to piece together the memories of her late husband by organizing his WeChat chat logs — most of which are related to his work.

However, she does not have access to a separate app he used for internal Xiaomi messages, leaving the full picture of his job responsibilities unknown.

What she is sure of is that she did not see her husband often during his final months.

“The work took all his time when he was needed as a father, as a husband,” she said, adding that Wang rarely returned home before 9pm and even then his phone kept buzzing with work messages.

“Almost every time he came back from work, our son was either already asleep or just about to go to bed,” she said.

One of the last messages Wang sent was a desperate plea for a contractor to work faster.

“What I signed up for was a life or death commitment,” Wang wrote. “Don’t leave me hanging.”",https://img.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/11/05/p07-251105-hkje.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:40.455996

Clean Energy Projects Termination

On October 2, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced the termination of 223 projects totaling more than $7.5 billion across multiple program offices, including Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), ARPA-E, and Fossil Energy (FE).

While many of the cuts appear to target projects in blue states, they have also sparked frustration among Republican lawmakers. Over two dozen electricity grid improvement initiatives — some aimed at adding new power capacity — were canceled, fueling concerns about potential increases in electricity prices.

Reports also indicate internal disagreements within DOE leadership over many of the project cuts, with the result that Undersecretary of Energy Wells Griffith was replaced on an acting basis by Alex Fitzsimmons, who is also serving as the Director of the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response.

The fate of the remaining $22 billion in DOE-funded projects, many of which would benefit Republican-leaning regions, remains uncertain.

Critical Minerals

New International Initiatives

On October 23, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) launched a Critical Mineral Consortium (CMC) with Orion Resource Partners and the Abu Dhabi–based ADQ, committing $1.8 billion toward a targeted $5 billion fund to finance mineral projects in emerging markets. The initiative aims to strengthen allied supply chains through investment, offtake management, domestic processing, and technology scaling.

Following China’s restrictions on rare earth exports, US officials signaled plans to expand investment in African mining and refining operations. Wayne Wall, Senior Director for Middle East and Africa Affairs at the National Security Council, said the administration aims to leverage financing from the DFC and Export-Import Bank (EXIM) to offer African nations an alternative to Chinese-backed infrastructure and mining deals.

In Congress, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced an amended version of the bipartisan Critical Minerals Partnership Act (S. 2550), sponsored by Senators John Curtis (R-UT) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). The bill authorizes $50 million for FY2026 to bolster global mineral supply chain security, empower the State Department’s Minerals Security Partnership to coordinate investments, and support the creation of a database of critical mineral projects to attract private-sector participation. It further underscores governance standards, recycling, joint financing, and risk insurance mechanisms for mining ventures.

US-Australia Critical Minerals Alliance and Investments

Complementing these efforts, the United States and Australia agreed on October 20 to a nonbinding framework to deepen cooperation in critical minerals mining, processing, and supply. Each country pledged at least $1 billion in new project financing to secure mineral supply chains vital to clean energy and defense. The agreement also establishes a joint response group to identify vulnerabilities and expedite mineral deliveries. Simultaneously, EXIM announced seven letters of interest totaling more than $2.2 billion to advance US critical minerals projects in Australia, including rare earth elements, graphite, magnesium, titanium, and scandium. Six of the seven projects are being pursued in partnership with Export Finance Australia (EFA) under the EXIM-EFA “Single Point of Entry” framework, demonstrating allied cooperation to counter China’s export dominance and ensure Western supply-chain resilience.

Critical Minerals Investment and Project Approval

Earlier in October, the White House announced that the Department of War would take a 10% equity stake in Trilogy Metals, a Vancouver-based mining company with claims in northwest Alaska. The Department of the Interior also reissued right-of-way permits for the Ambler Road project — a 211-mile corridor designed to unlock access to Alaska’s mineral deposits. Both actions were framed as advancing national security and revitalizing domestic mining capacity to reduce US dependence on China.

Also, at the beginning of November, Vulcan Elements announced a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to establish a fully domestic, vertically-integrated rare-earth magnet supply‐chain capable of producing 10,000 metric tons annually and recycling end-of-life magnets and e-waste. Subject to due diligence and final agreement, the financing structure includes a $620 million direct loan from the Office of Strategic Capital and $50 million of federal incentives via the CHIPS and Science Act. This marks the first time CHIPS Act authority has been used to support critical-minerals or rare earth investment, underscoring a strategic shift toward domestic supply-chain security for magnets used in advanced defense and non-defense sectors.

LPO Is Now the Energy Dominance Financing Program

On October 16, Secretary Chris Wright announced that the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) has been rebranded as the Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) Program, keeping with the new authority granted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passed in July. Its first project under this new designation — a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to an American Electric Power (AEP) subsidiary — will fund the reconductoring and rebuilding of approximately 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

Secretary Wright indicated that the administration will continue utilizing the EDF for projects originally proposed under the Biden administration, noting, “As we’re reviewing these things, of course, not all of them were nonsense.” While not the strong words of support all applicants were looking for, this shows that the EDF Program (formerly LPO) is open for business, a good sign for projects that align with the administration’s objectives.

Following Secretary Wright’s announcement, DOE issued an Interim Final Rule amending DOE’s loan guarantee regulations to implement the Energy Dominance Financing provisions of the OBBBA, which amended Section 1706 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to guarantee loans of up to a total principal amount of $250 billion through September 30, 2028. The rule replaces the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) framework established under the Inflation Reduction Act with a significantly broader lending authority and mandate, revising Part 609 to define “energy infrastructure” to mean “a facility, and associated equipment, used for enabling the identification, leasing, development, production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining, and generation needed for energy and critical minerals.” DOE is also revising Part 609 to reflect OBBBA’s elimination of the application requirement to “include an analysis of how the proposed project will engage with and affect associated communities.” DOE is providing a comment period until December 29, 2025.

Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC)

On October 23, the Energy Secretary invoked a rarely used provision of the Department of Energy Organization Act, directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate a preliminary Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on reforms to improve the timeliness and efficiency of interconnecting large energy loads to the transmission grid. Read more about this update from our Mintz colleagues here.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration officially appointed Laura Swett as FERC Chair on October 20, following her swearing-in ceremony. Swett’s elevation, which follows the White House’s earlier push for former Democratic Chair Willie Phillips to resign, gives Republicans a majority on the Commission and renews scrutiny of FERC’s political independence.

Fusion Commercialization Roadmaps

A number of studies outlining the path and impact of fusion commercialization were rolled out during the month. On October 16, DOE’s Office of Science released its Fusion Science & Technology Roadmap, outlining a federal strategy to build the infrastructure and partnerships necessary for commercial fusion energy scale-up in the 2030s. The Roadmap identifies 10 key actions across three pillars — Build, Innovate, and Grow — focused on closing gaps in materials and technology, advancing scientific research, and expanding the US fusion ecosystem through public-private and international collaboration. The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP)–led Commission on the Scaling of Fusion Energy also released their culminating report, “Fusion Forward: Powering America’s Future,” underscoring the imperative to declare fusion energy a national security priority, expand fusion leadership, and inject $10 billion to drive commercialization.

Mintz and ML Strategies continue to play an active role in this space, supporting the launch of Catalyzing California’s Fusion Advantage: Roadmap to Commercialization, a study led by General Atomics and released by the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (EDC). The report examines the economic potential and growth trajectory of California’s emerging fusion energy sector.

In July of 2025, the government made the decision to eliminate the federal EV tax credits that had been around since 2008.
General Motors saw a response in its third-quarter sales report, stating the automotive manufacturer saw a loss of $1.6 billion.

Mercedes-Benz went in a completely different direction than other brands, completely eliminating production of electric vehicles being build for the United States.","For a few years, it looked like the American automotive industry would slowly move away from internal combustion engines, and focus instead on electric vehicles. In August of 2024, American manufacturer General Motors told EV Magazine they were planning for a future comprised entirely of electric cars. That included an investment of $35 billion to phase out gas and diesel vehicles by 2035. More recently, Ford announced a $5 billion plan to create a lineup of affordable electric vehicles.

However, the tide may be turning back toward internal combustion engines and away from batteries. In July of 2025, the government made the decision to eliminate the federal EV tax credits that had been around since 2008. The announcement came just two months before the legislation was to take effect, and in that time, there was a massive jump in EV sales. Unfortunately, that jump in sales is starting to feel gravity as the tax credits are no longer available.

General Motors saw a response in its third-quarter sales report, stating the automotive manufacturer saw a loss of $1.6 billion. GM claimed that $1.2 billion of the losses came from ""adjustments to [GM's] EV capacity.""

As of right now, it means that the brand will slow down its electric vehicle production and research. Paul Jacobson, General Motors Chief Financial Officer, stated in September 2025 that although profitability needs scale, scaling up would go a little slower over the coming years.

Now, this doesn't mean that GM will eliminate its electric vehicle division entirely, as the brand has already invested a ton in EVs. Jacobson did mention seeing the bright side of this situation though, saying that GM will make a commitment to bringing down the price of its current EV lineup. Jacobson added that the focus would go more into cost reductions for electric vehicles, instead of making the lineup larger.

This slow down in EV production will also affect plants in Spring Hill, Tennessee and Hamtramck, Michigan, where the American brand had been building batteries in partnership with LG Energy Solution.

It's not just General Motors who has to figure out a workaround for the elimination of the EV tax credits, as it affects every other automaker as well. Hyundai recently cut the price of one of its most popular vehicles, the Ioniq 5, by nearly $10,000 in some of the upper trim levels. Ford is also in the same boat, as we mentioned earlier, and it plans on offering 0% financing lease deals on its EVs.

Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, is currently offering its EVs at a $7,500 discount, the same amount that the federal tax credit offered. Tesla did something similar, although the discount placed on its vehicles is less than what the tax credit offered.

Honda and Acura don't offer many EVs in North America, just the Prologue and the related Acura ZDX, although Acura nixed production of the ZDX recently. Mercedes-Benz went in a completely different direction than other brands, completely eliminating production of electric vehicles being build for the United States.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/gm-takes-a-1-6b-hit-after-fed-reverses-on-evs/l-intro-1761900742.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:00:46.048007

As noted by MPP Lisa Thompson: “The Bruce C Project marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s clean-energy future.","With up to 4,800 megawatts of additional capacity proposed, the Bruce C Project (currently undergoing a federal Impact Assessment) would bring Bruce Power’s total generation capacity to around 12,000 MW — making it the largest nuclear generator in the world.

Interim findings of a report indicate that, during construction, the project could support approximately 20,000 jobs annually; over its lifetime, it is projected to maintain an average of 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs across Canada (around 10,000 of these in Ontario). It is estimated to contribute nearly CAD $200 billion to Canada’s GDP (about CAD $172 billion in Ontario) and tens of billions of tax revenue for all levels of government.

Bruce Power already stands out as Canada’s largest public-private partnership; its current Life-Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project are the country’s largest privately financed electricity infrastructure endeavours. These existing operations support around 27,000 direct and indirect jobs each year. The Bruce C Project would build on that foundation, bringing new chances for skilled employment, regional economic development and durable prosperity in Ontario communities.

Currently, 95 % of Bruce Power’s spending is domestic, via an Ontario-based supply chain. The Bruce C Project would further that “Canadian at our Core” strategy — committing to safe and reliable power, global medical isotope production, economic growth and stronger Indigenous partnerships.

As stated by Stephen Lecce, Ontario’s Minister of Energy and Mines: “Ontario’s nuclear advantage is powering our future and showcasing the best of Canadian technology, resources and workers… The Bruce C Project will support jobs, add CAD $200 billion to the Canadian economy, and expand Ontario’s leadership in life-saving medical isotope production…”

Together with the potential refurbishment of Bruce Power’s Units 1 and 2, the Bruce C Project would enhance the already significant economic contributions of the Bruce Power site (which currently delivers about CAD $4 billion annually to the province via ongoing operations and life-extension activities). This supports Ontario’s ambition to become an energy superpower.

As noted by MPP Lisa Thompson: “The Bruce C Project marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s clean-energy future. By expanding nuclear capacity in Bruce County, we’re not only advancing energy security but also driving innovation, job creation and long-term prosperity across Ontario and beyond.”

Bruce Power COO and Executive VP James Scongack noted: “We’re proud of the work we do each and every day … and we’re proving that large-scale projects can be completed safely and on plan…” Further, the involvement of local residents, Indigenous partners and municipalities is promised to ensure that benefits materialize where they matter most — in the region of Bruce, Grey and Huron counties.",https://www.foronuclear.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_965524740-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:11.614423

Ahead of the agreement’s 2026 joint review, coalitions across sectors submitted comments demanding urgent reforms to address the USMCA’s flaws, including corporate giveaways, insufficient labor and environmental protections and enforcement, and rules that fuel displacement and undermine human rights.

Cross-Sector Demands

105 members of Congress, led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), endorsed a comment calling for substantial changes to the USMCA, including stronger protections for U.S. workers, consumers, small businesses, and farmers, improved enforcement mechanisms for labor and environmental standards, and the removal of rules that undermine sovereignty, access to medicines, Big Tech regulation, and more.

The issues highlighted in their letter mirrored demands by more than 700 organizations and more than 23,000 individuals who signed onto a comment co-sponsored by the Citizens Trade Campaign and a dozen other organizations.

Public Citizen submitted a detailed comment demanding a complete overhaul of the agreement, with special focus on removing the deal’s terms that benefit Big Tech and Big Pharma at the expense of the rest of us.

Access to Affordable Medicines

Public health organizations, including Médecins Sans Frontières USA, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, Public Citizen, and Health GAP, joined with unions – such as the Communications Workers of America and National Nurses United as well as faith groups like NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice – to call for the elimination of USMCA intellectual property rules that keep drug prices high, including patent term extensions, market exclusivity, and patent linkage.

Migrant Justice and Human Rights

Migrant rights organizations, including the National Partnership for New Americans, LULAC, and LCLAA, urged trade policy reforms to address displacement, exploitation, and inequality driven by decades of corporate-driven trade. They called for USMCA revisions that prioritize human rights, fair wages, climate resilience, and inclusive policymaking.

Centro de los Derechos del Migrante called for the agreement’s protections for migrant workers to be maintained, strengthened, and enforced, particularly for migrant women workers. They also advised that labor enforcement provisions be expanded to apply to facilities in the U.S. and Canada as well as Mexico.

Workers’ Rights

The Labor Advisory Committee (LAC) – a panel of USTR-cleared advisers including the AFL-CIO, the United Steelworkers, the United Auto Workers, the Teamsters, and more – warned that offshoring, job losses, and wage suppression persist under the USMCA. The committee called for renegotiation before any extension of the agreement’s 16-year term, with stronger labor enforcement, tighter rules of origin, and restored country-of-origin labeling for food.

Nearly 70 members of the Congressional Labor Caucus, led by Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), Donald Norcross (D-N.J.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), and Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) recommended pressuring Mexico to raise wages and labor standards; strengthening and expanding the USMCA’s labor “rapid response mechanism,” ensuring both Canada and Mexico fully enforce a ban on goods made with forced labor, and addressing transshipment from China.

Environment and Corporate Tribunals

Leading environmental organizations, Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, National Resources Defense Council, and Industrious Labs, called for revisions to the USMCA that support green and union jobs and clean water and air. Revisions including binding and enforceable environmental standards, a full elimination of ISDS that undermines labor and environmental safeguards, and a new tri-national body to tackle air pollution, and more.

BlueGreen Alliance, a powerful coalition of labor and environmental organizations, shared key provisions needed to support industrial resilience, clean manufacturing, and high-road labor and environmental standards.

Right to Repair

A collection of small-business, consumer, and digital organizations explained how certain USMCA provisions undermine governmental tools to support consumers’ right to repair. American Economic Liberties Project, Center for Democracy & Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, FULU Foundation, iFixit, Re: Create Coalition, The Repair Association, and U.S. PIRG recommended revising or removing terms that make it harder for people to fix the products they own.

While year-on-year financial comparisons indicate a more challenging environment than the previous year, the recent operational successes highlight the company's resilience and strategic execution, providing a nuanced outlook for investors and the broader energy sector.

The strong operational momentum, particularly the significant increase in October production to 49,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), positions Parex for a strong close to 2025 and an optimistic start to 2026. This performance, driven by key assets and successful exploration, suggests that well-managed independent producers can still thrive by optimizing existing assets and pursuing targeted growth, even as the global energy landscape grapples with wavering demand and price volatility.

Detailed Coverage: Parex Navigates Market Headwinds with Operational Acumen

Parex Resources Inc. (TSX: PXT) showcased a mixed but ultimately promising third quarter for 2025. The company generated funds flow from operations (FFO) of $105 million, translating to $1.09 per share, and recorded a net income of $50 million. Despite these solid figures, a year-on-year analysis reveals a decrease, with FFO per share dropping from $1.50 and net income declining by 23%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also experienced a 32% year-on-year decline, totaling $113.6 million, reflecting the broader economic pressures and commodity price fluctuations faced by the industry compared to the previous year. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $80.0 million, a slight decrease of 2.9% year-on-year, indicating disciplined spending.

The operational front, however, tells a story of significant momentum. Parex reported an average production of 43,953 boe/d for Q3 2025, marking a 3% increase from Q2 2025. More notably, October 2025 production surged to an average of 49,300 boe/d, exceeding the company's full-year 2025 guidance range of 43,000 to 47,000 boe/d. This impressive ramp-up is largely attributed to the LLA-32 block, where production rates have more than tripled to over 12,000 boe/d following a strategic tuck-in acquisition. Additionally, successful exploration at LLA-74 saw five producing wells brought online in 2025 with a 75% success rate, further bolstering output.

The company's strategic initiatives extend to future growth, with drilling initiated on the high-impact Guapo-1 exploration well at the VIM-1 block, with preliminary results expected by year-end 2025. This forward-looking approach, combined with strong performance from existing base assets and plans to bring four to six additional production-adding wells online in Q4 across LLA-32, Capachos, and Putumayo, sets a robust foundation for continued growth into 2026. While overall crude oil production saw a 9.2% year-on-year decline, a significant 93% increase in natural gas production, reaching 8.41 million cubic feet per day, highlights a strategic diversification in Parex's energy portfolio. In a move to return value to shareholders, Parex also declared a Q4 2025 regular dividend of C$0.385 per share, annualizing to C$1.54 per share, alongside maintaining its share buyback program.

Initial market reactions have been cautiously optimistic, with analysts acknowledging the strong operational execution despite the challenging financial comparisons. The company's robust balance sheet and attractive valuation metrics are seen as strengths, though some analysts express a desire for sustained financial performance to drive a market rerating. This balance between operational success and financial prudence positions Parex as a key player to watch in the evolving energy commodity landscape as of early November 2025.

Market Ripples: Winners and Losers in the Wake of Parex's Success

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) robust Q3 2025 results and impressive October 2025 production figures are poised to send ripples across the energy sector, creating both direct benefits for partners and heightened competitive pressure for other players, particularly those operating in Colombia's prolific basins or with similar exploration and production (E&P) profiles.

A clear beneficiary of Parex's strong performance is Ecopetrol S.A. (BVC: ECOPETROL), Colombia's state-owned oil company and a key strategic partner. Parex and Ecopetrol have active collaboration agreements, notably in the Putumayo Basin and the Llanos Foothills. Increased production and operational efficiency from Parex in these joint ventures directly translate to higher shared revenues and de-risked projects for Ecopetrol. This success not only validates their investment strategies in these areas but also fosters confidence for future collaborative ventures, potentially accelerating development across their shared portfolio.

On the other hand, several competitors face increased scrutiny and pressure. GeoPark Holdings (NYSE: GPRK), a significant Latin American E&P player, finds itself in a particularly precarious position. Parex's continued strong performance intensifies the spotlight on GeoPark, especially after its board rejected an all-cash acquisition proposal from Parex in September 2025, deeming it an undervaluation. With Parex having acquired an 11.8% ownership stake in GeoPark, the pressure is mounting for GeoPark to demonstrate its ability to deliver superior shareholder value from its existing assets and recent expansion into Argentina's Vaca Muerta basin, to justify its rejection and ward off further advances.

Other independent producers with significant Colombian operations, such as Frontera Energy (TSX: FEC) and Gran Tierra Energy (NYSE: GTE), are also likely to feel the heat. While Frontera Energy has previously engaged in farm-in agreements with Parex, including for the VIM-1 block where Parex is currently drilling a high-impact exploration well, the outcome of such ventures will determine its direct benefit. More broadly, Parex's operational efficiencies and exploration successes in areas like LLA-32 and LLA-74 set a high benchmark, compelling Frontera and Gran Tierra to demonstrate comparable growth and efficiency in their own operations to maintain investor confidence and market share. Gran Tierra, in particular, has faced challenges including production declines and blockades, which Parex's sustained performance could starkly highlight in contrast. Even Canacol Energy (TSX: CNE), a prominent natural gas producer, could experience indirect pressure as Parex expands its natural gas opportunities, increasing competition for resources and investor capital within the Colombian energy sector.

Wider Significance: A Barometer for the Energy Sector's Future

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) impressive Q3 2025 results and October 2025 production figures emerge as a compelling narrative within a global energy commodities landscape marked by complexity and often, contradiction. This strong showing offers critical insights into broader industry trends, competitive dynamics, evolving regulatory frameworks, and echoes historical patterns in the energy sector.

Parex's success stands out against a backdrop of global oil market softness. Forecasts for Brent crude in 2025 and 2026 indicate a decline from previous highs, primarily driven by global oil production outpacing demand, with a significant surplus projected. Factors such as the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles and flattening demand in major economies like China contribute to this softening. Despite these overarching pressures, Parex's ability to boost output and maintain its full-year guidance underscores the potential for well-managed, agile independent producers to thrive through operational efficiency, strategic asset management, and targeted exploration, even when larger market forces exert downward pressure on prices. The nuanced global natural gas market, with slowing demand growth but increasing LNG supply and new discoveries, also frames Parex's increasing natural gas production as a timely strategic diversification.

The ripple effects of Parex's performance extend to the broader competitive landscape. As the largest independent E&P company in Colombia, its sustained growth intensifies competition for acreage, resources, and investor capital against peers such as Ecopetrol (BVC: ECOPETROL), Frontera Energy (TSX: FEC), GeoPark Holdings (NYSE: GPRK), and Canacol Energy (TSX: CNE). Parex's strong financial health and production growth also bolster its capacity for strategic acquisitions, exemplified by its recent proposal to acquire GeoPark, potentially leading to increased market consolidation and operational synergies within the region. Furthermore, its enhanced strategic partnership with Ecopetrol, including joint exploration in areas like the Farallones Block, signals a positive trajectory for future collaborations and shared development opportunities, benefiting the broader Colombian energy supply chain through increased demand for services and equipment.

Operating in Colombia, Parex navigates an evolving regulatory environment characterized by both challenges and opportunities. The Colombian government's pursuit of an energy transition agenda, including a halt on new exploration licensing rounds and increased taxes on producers since August 2022, reflects a broader ""resource nationalism agenda."" This policy shift has contributed to investor uncertainty and a decline in foreign direct investment. However, recognizing a looming natural gas supply shortfall by early 2026, Colombian lawmakers are debating measures to ease LNG import rules and offer tax breaks for critical infrastructure. These policy adjustments, alongside positive changes like allowing pipelines to carry both oil and gas, demonstrate a dynamic regulatory landscape where the government attempts to balance energy transition goals with the immediate need for energy security.

Historically, Parex's performance resonates with several recurring themes in the energy industry. The company's growth amidst broader market fluctuations mirrors the inherent boom-and-bust cycles of the oil and gas sector, highlighting the imperative for companies to prioritize efficiency and strategic investment to weather potential downturns. Sustained growth in specific regions, driven by significant production, can also evoke historical precedents of regional economic impacts, akin to ""boomtown"" phenomena, bringing both prosperity and challenges like strained infrastructure. Moreover, Colombia's current policy stance on resource nationalism finds parallels in historical instances where nations sought greater control and benefit from their natural resources, often leading to complex negotiations and, at times, investor-state disputes. Parex's ability to maintain growth within this framework serves as a case study for navigating such nationalistic shifts.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future of Energy

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) strong Q3 2025 results and October 2025 production figures set a dynamic stage for its immediate future and offer a compelling case study for the broader energy commodity market. The company is poised for continued growth in the short term, but its long-term trajectory will be significantly influenced by global commodity price trends, geopolitical stability, and the accelerating energy transition.

In the short term (late 2025 - 2026), Parex anticipates robust production growth, with Q4 2025 average production expected to surpass its annual guidance. This momentum will be driven by successful exploration and development at key blocks like LLA-32 and LLA-74, and the potential transformational impact of the high-impact Guapo-1 exploration well at VIM-1, with results expected by year-end. The company's disciplined capital expenditure, focused on high-return development and exploitation, underscores its commitment to sustaining this growth while maintaining shareholder returns through consistent dividends.

Looking at the long term (beyond 2026), Parex aims to solidify its position as Colombia's largest independent E&P company, expanding its multi-field operator status and achieving sustainable production growth across its diversified portfolio, including the Llanos and Magdalena basins, and the newly acquired Putumayo blocks. Strategic initiatives like enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, such as polymer injection at LLA-34 and Cabrestero, are crucial for maximizing long-term liquids recovery. Furthermore, Parex's demonstrated interest in strategic acquisitions, like its bid for GeoPark (NYSE: GPRK), signals a potential for further expansion and consolidation within the Colombian and Latin American energy landscape.

However, navigating the future will require strategic pivots and adaptations. Parex must continuously balance its growth investments with its commitment to shareholder returns, ensuring long-term value creation amidst market volatility. Operating primarily in Colombia, the company must adeptly manage the evolving geopolitical and regulatory landscape, particularly the government's energy transition agenda and potential shifts in resource nationalism policies. While currently focused on conventional oil and gas, Parex may need to consider long-term strategies related to the broader energy transition, potentially through investments in emissions reduction technologies or complementary energy ventures, to maintain relevance and attract investment in a decarbonizing world. Flexible capital allocation will also be paramount to respond to fluctuating commodity prices.

Market opportunities for Parex include Latin America's increasing importance in global energy security, driven by surging oil and gas production in the region and growing natural gas demand for power generation. The ongoing consolidation in the oil and gas industry also presents opportunities for Parex to expand its asset base or optimize its portfolio through strategic mergers and acquisitions. Conversely, significant challenges loom, primarily the persistent crude oil price volatility, with forecasts suggesting a potential decline in Brent crude prices to the mid-$50s per barrel by 2026 due to rising global inventories. Geopolitical instability in other regions and the long-term uncertainty of fossil fuel demand due to the global energy transition will also demand careful strategic planning.

Considering these factors, potential scenarios and outcomes vary. An optimistic scenario sees Parex successfully executing its programs, exceeding production guidance, and making accretive acquisitions, while oil prices stabilize at favorable levels. A base case involves moderate growth with some revenue pressure from declining oil prices, requiring continued capital discipline. A pessimistic scenario could involve a sharp and sustained decline in crude oil prices, coupled with operational challenges, forcing significant capital cuts and a focus on balance sheet preservation. Ultimately, Parex's ability to adapt its strategy, maintain capital discipline, and capitalize on value-accretive opportunities will be crucial for its long-term success in a dynamic energy market.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: Navigating a Dynamic Energy Future

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) strong Q3 2025 financial and operational performance, capped by an impressive surge in October 2025 production, presents a compelling narrative of resilience and strategic execution within a complex and often volatile energy commodity market. The company's ability to deliver robust results amidst broader market headwinds underscores its effective operational strategies and prudent financial management.

The key takeaways from Parex's recent performance are multi-faceted. The company reported a solid $105 million in funds flow from operations and $50 million in net income for Q3 2025. Operationally, average production increased by 3% quarter-on-quarter to 43,953 boe/d in Q3, with a significant jump to 49,300 boe/d in October. This growth was fueled by the substantial increase in output from the LLA-32 block following a tuck-in acquisition, and successful near-field exploration at LLA-74. The remarkable 93% year-on-year increase in natural gas production also highlights a strategic diversification. Financially, Parex maintains a strong balance sheet, continues to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and employs hedging strategies to mitigate price risk, demonstrating a balanced approach to growth and investor value.

Assessing the market moving forward, Parex is well-positioned for a strong start to 2026, with its Q4 2025 production expected to exceed the higher end of its annual guidance. Its ongoing exploration, particularly the high-impact Guapo-1 well at VIM-1, holds the potential for future reserve additions and production growth, which would further stabilize regional energy supply. While analyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with some concerns regarding declining revenue and free cash flow growth, the company's strong technical indicators and positive earnings call sentiment suggest a favorable outlook, provided these operational gains prove sustainable. Parex's proactive risk management through crude oil hedges further instills confidence in its ability to navigate price volatility.

The significance and lasting impact of Parex's performance extend beyond its immediate financials. As a leading independent E&P company in Colombia, its sustained operational execution and disciplined capital allocation set a benchmark for peers in the region. In an era of increasing energy transition pressures and resource nationalism, Parex's ability to grow production and maintain profitability while returning capital to shareholders provides a model for how conventional energy producers can thrive by optimizing existing assets and pursuing targeted, efficient growth. This balanced approach is crucial for navigating unpredictable price swings and geopolitical uncertainties that define the modern energy landscape.

Investors should watch for several key indicators in the coming months. The preliminary results from the Guapo-1 exploration well at VIM-1, expected by year-end 2025, will be a critical determinant of future growth potential. Further, monitoring the company's progress in bringing additional production-adding wells online across LLA-32, Capachos, and Putumayo in Q4 2025 will be essential for gauging its momentum into 2026. Global crude oil price stability and the effectiveness of Parex's hedging strategies will directly influence profitability. Finally, continued analyst sentiment and any potential market rerating will depend on Parex's consistent delivery on operational promises and its ability to demonstrate sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth, addressing the concerns that currently temper its overall market perception.

These forces, in turn, fuel increasingly destructive hurricanes, some now so powerful that scientists have proposed adding a “Category 6” to the Saffir-Simpson scale to describe the extreme weather events that cause human suffering and death. Yet U.S. energy policy under the current administration has not merely favored fossil fuels; it has reverted to burning more fossil fuels to power the country, slowing the transition and worsening pollution’s toll.

Because the harm from pollution and climate change is slow, widespread, and diffuse, it’s easy for society to hide behind the mindset that “a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths are a statistic.”

While it’s difficult to assign individual harm to broad policy decisions, there’s no doubt that air pollution has tangible, immediate effects. Three years after a Pittsburgh coal-processing plant closed in 2016, researchers documented a 42% drop in local emergency cardiovascular admissions. Reducing fossil emissions directly improves public health in measurable ways.

Suniva tariff public harm extrapolations

An analysis by the Solar Energy Industries Association lets us consider how the 2017 Suniva tariffs, imposed after the company filed a Section 201 trade petition, had a human cost in their obstructing of solar deployment. From 2017 through 2021, the tariffs are estimated to have prevented 10.5 GW of solar capacity from being built. That capacity would have generated roughly 18 TWh of electricity in 2022.

With natural gas providing 39% of U.S. electricity and coal 20% that year, we can—very roughly—estimate that 7 TWh would have been replaced by gas and 3.6 TWh by coal.

Gas-fired power is estimated to kill about 2.82 people per TWh through air-pollution-related effects, while coal kills 24 per TWh. Applying these rates, the Suniva tariffs are estimated to have led to 19 deaths from gas generation and 86 from coal—a total of about 105 avoidable American deaths in 2022 alone. The number of Americans left with chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma likely reaches into the tens of thousands.

Solar module imports save lives

A more rigorous—and encouraging—analysis from researchers at the City University of New York found that solar panel imports into the United States displaced 305 TWh of fossil generation, avoided 178 million tons of CO2 emissions, and prevented 595 premature deaths between 2014 and 2022.

The paper, Imported solar photovoltaics contributed to health and climate benefits in the United States, showed that 78% of solar panels deployed during this time were imports. As utility-scale solar grew from “nearly zero” in 2010 to 3.4% of total U.S generation in 2022, those imported modules were critical.

Regional differences mattered. In Texas, one MWh of solar reduced gas generation by 0.70 MWh and coal by 0.31 MWh. In Florida, nearly all the displaced energy came from gas—0.97 MWh per MWh of solar.

Overall, imported solar panels generated $28 billion in combined health and climate benefits. Climate benefits made up 76% of that total, and air-pollution reductions the other 24%. On average, every kilowatt of imported solar produced $180 in health and climate benefits—about one-fifth of a system’s installation cost, separate from its energy value.

Strategy and consequences

While some would argue that it’s impossible to draw a straight line between a trade policy and an obituary, others—including this author—see a clear causal link. Modeling indicates that the Suniva tariffs worsened air quality and public health outcomes, resulting in roughly a hundred additional pollution-related deaths. Whether that figure is viewed as an estimate or an accusation, it reflects a policy failure with real human stakes.

Adding to the irony, the company that pushed hardest for those tariffs did not restart manufacturing until 2024, years after the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act reignited domestic production. Having already gone dark, Suniva leveraged the machinery of U.S. trade law to kneecap the industry.

The damage didn’t end there. New and expanded U.S. solar trade barriers continue to raise costs and slow deployment, undercutting the very decarbonization targets those policies claim to defend. Every delay in clean-energy buildout prolongs dependence on fuels that pollute and destabilize the climate. By contrast, imported solar modules over the past decade have accelerated emission reductions and delivered measurable—if diffuse—public-health and environmental gains.

If the United States intends to pursue energy dominance, it should do so through true abundance and evidence, not restriction and rhetoric. Tariffs slow the transition and prolong fossil dependence, while value-driven tax credits are already driving solar manufacturing and expanding domestic capacity across every link of the supply chain.

- Emissions trading, forest cover - China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.","China is the world's biggest emitter of planet-warning greenhouse gases but is also installing more renewable energy sources and putting more electric vehicles on its roads than any other country.

Ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil, here is a look at China's climate commitments:

- Emissions -

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

- Reduction targets -

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

But it did not set a baseline year from which to measure those reductions and experts say China needs to cut emissions by closer to 30 percent from 2023 levels to keep global temperatures from rising over 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

- Fossil fuels, EVs -

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

- Emissions trading, forest cover -

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

On a same-store basis, revenue was up 6% to $6.9 billion, while total same-store gross profit reached $1.2 billion, up 4%.
AutoNation’s BEV sales were up 40% in Q3, accounting for 10% of its new-vehicle sales in the quarter, according to Manley.
However, with the need to clear dealer lots, profit margins on EVs “have been terrible for some time,” Manley said.","Megadealer group AutoNation has reduced its inventory of electric vehicles, which suffer profit margins that CEO Mike Manley called “absolutely terrible” during a Q3 earnings call on Oct 23.

The company’s focus is now on a potential seasonal year-end increase in luxury car sales and consumer incentives.

“For the fourth quarter, we expect the mix of new unit sales to improve, including less battery electric vehicles and a higher percentage of premium luxury, reflecting seasonal strength during the holiday season,” AutoNation CFO Tom Szlosek said during the earnings call.

Overall, AutoNation reported net income of $215.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of 16% vs. the same period last year. On a same-store basis, revenue was up 6% to $6.9 billion, while total same-store gross profit reached $1.2 billion, up 4%.

Too much BEV stock hit gross profit

EV sales jumped higher in Q3 for AutoNation and for the industry in general, as consumers rushed to beat the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit. AutoNation’s BEV sales were up 40% in Q3, accounting for 10% of its new-vehicle sales in the quarter, according to Manley.

However, with the need to clear dealer lots, profit margins on EVs “have been terrible for some time,” Manley said. That helped drag down AutoNation’s average gross profit per new vehicle of all drive types to $2,290 for the quarter, down 18.8% from a year ago. Year over year net income was also down 6% to $477 million.

Now, without the tax break and the pull-ahead effect of all those third-quarter EVs sales, demand is expected to fall in Q4. In anticipation, AutoNation ended the third quarter with just 1,550 BEVs in stock, less than a 20-day supply at its current sales rate. The company’s EV inventory is down 55% compared to the end of 2024, Manley said.

Aiming to self-source used cars

Based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., AutoNation had 243 new-car dealerships in the U.S. market as of Dec. 31, 2024, plus 24 AutoNation USA used-only stores.

Like other publicly traded, new-vehicle chains, AutoNation said it is trying to avoid rising acquisition costs for used-car inventory by self-sourcing as many used vehicles as possible instead of buying them at auctions.

“Overall, industry supply of used vehicles remains tight. We continue to be competitive in securing our vehicle supply from our retail operations, including trade-ins, ‘We Buy Your Car’ services, loaner conversions, and lease returns. We source more than 90% of our vehicles from these channels,” Szlosek said in the conference call.

Year-end incentives are also likely for luxury brands, with the annual Lexus “December to Remember” promotion typically kicking off the holiday sales season, starting around Thanksgiving.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/txYZmuGHm5yIL5fDr0Zi4zzrBg17pqp74tJOJCl7FbY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9VU0RlYWxlcnNHZXR0eS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:43.204088

The substantial distributed generation capacity has contributed to minimum demand records as rooftop solar output reached 15GW during peak generation periods.
Customers participating in the Solar Sharer offer will need smart meter installations to access the free electricity periods.
The government plans to consult with Victoria and Western Australia about extending the Solar Sharer offer to their jurisdictions by 2027, potentially expanding the program’s coverage to additional households across the NEM.
This approach aims to ensure consumer choice while providing access to the benefits of Australia’s abundant rooftop solar generation for households across different housing types and ownership arrangements.","Under the terms of the offering, energy retailers will be required to grant customers free solar-derived electricity for “at least three hours in the middle of the day”.

Bowen described the Solar Sharer offer as ensuring “every last ray of sunshine was powering our homes” while enabling more Australians to participate in the country’s solar energy transition.

The programme targets households with smart meters who can shift their electricity consumption to coincide with the designated free power periods during midday hours, when solar generation reaches its peak output.

The policy responds to Australia’s unique position as a global leader in distributed solar deployment, with the country hosting over four million rooftop installations, according to government figures. This extensive residential solar infrastructure has created significant midday generation surpluses that often exceed local demand, particularly during optimal weather conditions.

Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) has achieved record-breaking renewable energy performance in recent months, with rooftop solar capacity reaching 26.8GW in the first half of 2025. The substantial distributed generation capacity has contributed to minimum demand records as rooftop solar output reached 15GW during peak generation periods.

The Solar Sharer programme aims to address the economic challenges created by this generation abundance. Excess solar production during midday periods has reduced wholesale electricity prices and diminished feed-in tariff rates for rooftop solar owners, creating economic pressure on the distributed solar sector.

Indeed, the new programme seeks to increase daytime electricity consumption by incentivising households to operate appliances during peak solar generation windows.

Customers participating in the Solar Sharer offer will need smart meter installations to access the free electricity periods. The initiative covers all household electricity usage during the designated three-hour windows, including air conditioning, washing machines, dryers and other high-consumption appliances.

The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) will oversee the Solar Sharer programme to ensure customers receive fair pricing outside the free power periods. The regulatory framework aims to prevent retailers from inflating standard electricity rates to offset the cost of providing free daytime power, maintaining consumer protection across all usage periods.

The programme’s initial rollout covers Default Market Offer regions (New South Wales, South Australia and south-east Queensland) where the Australian Energy Regulator sets benchmark electricity pricing.

The government plans to consult with Victoria and Western Australia about extending the Solar Sharer offer to their jurisdictions by 2027, potentially expanding the program’s coverage to additional households across the NEM.

The Solar Sharer initiative reflects broader trends in Australia’s electricity system transformation, where record-breaking surges in renewables and energy storage assets have fundamentally altered generation patterns and wholesale market dynamics. The programme represents a policy response to manage the integration challenges created by high renewable energy penetration.

Energy retailers will be required to offer Solar Sharer plans, but customers must actively opt into the program rather than being automatically enrolled.

How close to completion the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is.

17%

Increase in contracted data center capacity added this year.

Dominion Energy provides regulated electric service to about 3.6 million customers in Virginia and the Carolinas, and regulated natural gas service to about 500,000 customers in South Carolina. Its Contracted Energy segment operates the 2,098-MW Millstone nuclear power plant in Connecticut, various solar generation facilities and the Charybdis offshore wind installation vessel.

In the third quarter of 2025, Dominion’s regulated electric sales rose 3.3% year over year. Quarterly operating earnings grew to $921 million, up from $836 million in the third quarter of 2024.

Dominion’s 176-turbine, 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is about 66% complete, the utility company said Friday. The project, which will be the largest offshore wind farm by capacity in the U.S. once complete, is a 50-50 venture between Dominion and Stonepeak, an infrastructure investment firm that purchased its stake in the project in early 2024.

Dominion expects to finish onshore work and deliver the project’s first electrons to customers by the first quarter of 2026, executives said during an earnings conference call with analysts. Full completion remains on track for the end of 2026, though CEO Robert Blue said that installation of the final turbine towers could slip into early 2027 due to delays in commissioning Charybdis, Dominion’s turbine installation vessel.

Including an unused contingency of $206 million, total project costs stand at $11.2 billion, down about $15 million from last quarter, Blue said. According to its updated forecast, Dominion expects U.S. tariffs to increase the offshore wind project costs $690 million through 2026, with $218 million borne by Dominion and the remainder by Stonepeak.

Dominion now expects the levelized cost of electricity generated by the plant to come in at $84/MWh, up from $63/MWh in August due to expected lower revenue from renewable energy credits. That estimate is within the $80/MWh to $90/MWh range Dominion envisioned in its 2021 initial filing and would support a net monthly customer bill savings of 63 cents, it said.

On the call, Blue expressed confidence that “bipartisan support at all levels of government” would endure for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind after Virginia’s statewide elections this week.

“It’s the fastest way to get 2.6 GW on the grid that’s going to serve AI and technology companies, defense and security installations,” Blue said. “It’s critical to important infrastructure upgrades at the Oceana Naval Air Station. And if you stop it now, it causes energy inflation.”

Virginia data center boom continues

Dominion’s data center contracted capacity rose about 7 GW, or 17%, since December. Capacity with an electric service agreement rose from 8.8 GW to 9.8 GW while capacity with a construction letter of authorization jumped from 5.2 GW to 9 GW during the period.

Both project categories involve guaranteed payments to Dominion, even when a customer walks away from construction or fails to meet expected load levels.

Across its entire service territory, Blue said Dominion has received 17 GW of delivery point requests from data centers so far this year and more than 58 GW since 2020. It has “communicated firm rates” for more than 25 GW of capacity expected to energize through 2031, he added. The typical data center project takes four to seven years from delivery point request to meter hookup, he said.

“Our data center load just continues to grow, and the demand continues to grow, which is something considering that we have connected 450 data centers already and we’ve got more than 25% of our sales going to data centers in Virginia,” Blue said.

Dialing in an ‘all of the above’ resource strategy

Dominion executives on Friday detailed the utility’s “all of the above” resource strategy. The utility’s roughly $50 billion five-year capital investment plan includes a mix of transmission, thermal and renewable power projects, they said.

Notable regulatory and process milestones in the third quarter include submitting transmission project proposals to the PJM Interconnection in August; filing post-hearing briefs for the 1-GW Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a Virginia gas-fired peaker plant with four 250-MW turbines; submitting an application for 845 MW of solar and 145 MW of energy storage projects across its territory, part of what Blue said would be a planned “cadence roughly of a [gigawatt] of solar a year”; and filing its latest Virginia integrated resource plan.

Dominion said PJM’s transmission selections could come in early 2026. If approved by the Virginia State Corporation Commission, likely by the end of this year, the Chesterfield plant could begin construction next year and come online in 2029. Blue said Dominion’s size and long supplier relationships positioned it well to secure turbines and other long-lead equipment for gas and data center projects.

Measured caution on new nuclear

Dominion’s Virginia proposed IRP pushed back the date of a possible small modular reactor in the state by five years.

Blue cautioned against “[reading] too much into that” and reiterated his company’s memorandum of understanding with Amazon to explore an SMR at its North Anna nuclear power plant in southeastern Virginia. He described Virginia as “the most nuclear-friendly state in the country” thanks to strong policy support, existing civilian reactors and its naval nuclear supply chain.

But fiscal prudence dictates a measured approach to new nuclear investments, Blue added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/9Gz9V2FMNHt3xFPzBbSjNgb6b03EiS-0ZYNwFPae3Iw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DVk9XXzAzNDMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-04 13:07:06.293872

Education

Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features.

Experience

Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written.

An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day.

In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest. Her non-automotive work, covering such topics as travel, food and drink, rural living, fountain pen collecting, and celebrity interviews, has appeared in publications including Harrowsmith, Where New Orleans, Pen World, The Book for Men, Rural Delivery, and Gambit.

COP30 must push for scaled-up financing for adaptation that integrates climate risk and resilience into economic planning, and the adoption of meaningful indicators.
Addressing both adaptation and loss and damage is not just about climate action—it is a matter of climate, economic, and social justice.
COP30 must accelerate both the scale and alignment of where global climate finance is currently at, ensuring that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most.
Showcasing community-level resilience—including action on extreme heat and sustainable cooling in countries like India—that blends adaptation, resilience, and mitigation in tangible ways.","However, we should first acknowledge that 10 years onward with the Paris Agreement in place, the world has made real progress—from the 36.2 million jobs generated by clean energy globally (more than oil, gas, coal, and fossil-engine manufacturing combined) to the exponential growth of solar energy (now four times what was predicted in 2015). Yet the latest reports show we are still drifting off course from limiting global temperature increase to 1.5–2 degrees Celsius, with profound consequences for people and the planet.

To change course, we need both emergency brakes and acceleration—brakes on the forces driving deforestation and forest degradation, ocean acidification, and sea level rise and acceleration in actions, such as deploying clean energy, efficient cooling, early warning systems, accessible finance, and affordable insurance, while protecting lives and livelihoods. Scaling up investment in these solutions is essential for a safer, more resilient future.

This is why COP30 matters. It must move beyond headlines and targets to focus on turning commitments into action—strengthening the cycle of planning, implementation, and accountability created in Paris to raise ambition over time. As an “implementation COP,” the international community must recalibrate this multilateral process and center those who are most affected by strengthening our ability to decarbonize supply chains, adapt to the changing climate, and address rising losses and damages, along with ensuring that vulnerable countries and communities are no longer left behind.

The Brazilian COP30 presidency has signaled that this will be a COP that’s centered on climate adaptation and resilience—and rightly so. Rethinking resilience means building systems that can anticipate, absorb, and recover from shocks, in addition to sustaining progress toward a livable future. This focus could not be timelier. Amid geopolitical headwinds and more extreme climate events, COP30 must serve as a cornerstone for strengthening resilience—across economies, communities, and ecosystems alike—by:

Enhancing the ability of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to remain beacons of light in the midst of external shocks

Let us be clear here: While global cooperation may be strained, the Paris Agreement has nevertheless held firm—preventing the world from veering toward even greater 4–5°C warming trajectories. No country has followed the United States in leaving the accord. Global investment in renewables now doubles that of fossil fuels. Climate measures have increased sevenfold, with more than 80 percent of the global economy committed to net zero targets. Still, the pace and scale of action, along with the means of implementation—finance, capacity building, and technology transfer—remain far from sufficient. New tools and ideas are emerging to close this gap, from the International Court of Justice advisory opinion to innovative investment mechanisms, bolstered by the momentum from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Congress in Abu Dhabi.

Rallying the world to close the emissions and resilience gaps

COP30 must signal a truly collective response to both the emissions gap and the resilience gap—helping nations adapt to intensifying climate impacts while limiting losses to lives and livelihoods. This will require formal decisions and strong action from governments that accelerate implementation on the ground. Central to this effort is doubling down on untapped opportunities, including reducing emissions other than carbon dioxide, like methane or HFCs from refrigerants, and ensuring “just transitions”—moving away from fossil fuels in a way that protects workers, communities, and economies, in addition to reducing poverty and leaving no one behind.

Adapting, addressing loss and damage, and putting justice at the center

Adaptation efforts have long been underfunded and insufficient, leaving communities exposed to mounting climate impacts. COP30 must push for scaled-up financing for adaptation that integrates climate risk and resilience into economic planning, and the adoption of meaningful indicators. Yet even the best adaptation has limits, and unavoidable losses and damages are increasing, as seen in the recent devastation from Hurricane Melissa and other record-breaking events worldwide. Addressing both adaptation and loss and damage is not just about climate action—it is a matter of climate, economic, and social justice.

Ensuring that nature is part of the solution

Protecting and restoring forests, mangroves, and wetlands and reforming agriculture and food systems not only reduce emissions but also strengthen our resilience to climate impacts. They need to be integral to climate decision-making. In order to be on track to halt and reverse deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, the degradation in the Global North, which holds some of the most carbon-rich forests in the world, should receive the same level of scrutiny, transparency, and accountability as the tropics. This issue was elevated at the 2025 IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, through the adoption of an NRDC-led motion. The COP30 presidency’s anticipated launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Facility is a potentially positive step toward delivering further progress, but it requires more robust engagement of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and standards that capture all drivers of deforestation and forest degradation.

Mobilizing financial flows to those who need it

Finance remains the elephant in the room. COP30 must accelerate both the scale and alignment of where global climate finance is currently at, ensuring that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most. At COP29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, the international community committed to mobilizing at least $1.3 trillion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2035, with developed nations taking the lead in mobilizing at least $300 billion annually. COP30 is about engineering a major leap in both funding and delivery. Adaptation and resilience must receive a fair share while private and public flows are mobilized with transparency, accountability, and impact.

This is why NRDC will be with our partners in Belém this year (as well as in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo beforehand for other preconference dialogues and forums). Together, we aim to shape a COP30 package that drives forward a durable transition to a clean, low-carbon global economy and resilient future for the planet and its people. Our focus will be on four key thematic areas:

Catalyzing a finance step change, especially for adaptation and ensuring that the private and public sectors both work in concert to channel funds to the right kinds of efforts on the ground.

Holding governments accountable for the ambition and delivery of their 2035 climate plans, at a time when every fraction of a degree matters.

Showcasing community-level resilience—including action on extreme heat and sustainable cooling in countries like India—that blends adaptation, resilience, and mitigation in tangible ways.

Advancing equitable accountability for forest protection to preserve forests as critical carbon stores and sinks and tackle drivers of forest degradation and deforestation across both the Global North and Global South.

All of these efforts, in synergy with other multilateral processes—like the High Seas Treaty, the Montreal Protocol, the biodiversity and desertification conventions—are central to not only upholding multilateralism and global cooperation as a cornerstone of equitable global climate governance but also to meeting the human imperative of building a safer, healthier, and more prosperous society.

COP30 is a moment to mobilize all hands—Rio de Janeiro’s local leaders, São Paulo’s private sector, youth, women, faith-based communities, Indigenous and local communities, academics and engineers—to be, and continue to be, the changemakers turning the promise of the Paris Agreement into reality. It is also about ensuring the agreement remains a guiding beacon, providing the frameworks, space, and inspiration needed to catalyze transformative action for people and the planet.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/cop30-belem-brazil-RC294GA7KHOS.JPG?h=2e111cc1&itok=hvwr3_gN,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:38.993038

To ensure wind power projects are built and commissioned, the UK government holds annual auctions to incentivize renewable energy operators to invest in the nation’s wind power sector.
This year’s auction round budget will sit at around $1.2 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year.
It should be noted that this year’s auction round will allocate $236 million for earlier-stage floating wind technology, which was nonexistent in last year’s budget.
Europe has lofty ambitions for the expansion of wind power capacity on the continent","The UK has set itself an ambitious goal of decarbonization by the end of the decade. However, several industry analysts have noted that the latest auction round provides fewer subsidies for the wind power sector, which has raised concerns over the country’s ability to meet its self-imposed decarbonization goals. The world has seen the energy sector shift its attention away from the conventional oil and gas sector in favor of the untapped potential that the renewable sector has in abundance. While other nations opt for solar or nuclear power, the UK has a proclivity for wind power.

England is offering fewer public funds for the next round of wind power auctions

The aim would be to foster more international investment and not rely on government subsidies to boost the wind power sector in the United Kingdom. To ensure wind power projects are built and commissioned, the UK government holds annual auctions to incentivize renewable energy operators to invest in the nation’s wind power sector.

The UK guarantees a set purchasing price for wind power, which, without the government subsidies, operators may favor other markets. However, the latest round of auction documents details the UK’s plan to offer less cash to operators. The “contracts for difference” in the UK are essential to make wind power projects appear viable and financially stable for potential investors.

The UK’s next auction round will see significantly less “contracts for difference” funding

Documents released by the UK government note that this year’s auction round will see substantially less money being provided by the state. This year’s auction round budget will sit at around $1.2 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year. It should be noted that this year’s auction round will allocate $236 million for earlier-stage floating wind technology, which was nonexistent in last year’s budget.

“Our competitive new auction process will allow us to buy the right amount of clean power at the right price.” – British Minister for Energy Michael Shank

Industry experts have warned of the impact of the new round of auction’s budget

The UK has plans to decarbonize by the end of the decade and has selected wind power as the best and most practical driver to achieve this. However, market analysts have noted that if this year’s prices are anything like last year’s, the UK is in danger of not meeting its 2030 decarbonization target.

Pranav Menon, a senior researcher at Aurora Energy Research, has stated that the proposed funding of the UK’s wind power sector places the nation in danger of missing the mark for decarbonization. Mr Menon noted that the expected capacity is set to be around 4.9 GW if last year’s prices are repeated in 2025.

“This would set the government’s ambitious offshore wind capacity target to achieve CP2030 (clean power 2030) out of sight, as it requires at least seven to nine GW to be procured, which would require extremely competitive bids that are unlikely to materialise.” – Pranav Menon, a senior researcher at Aurora Energy Research

Europe’s offshore wind sector has been grappling with its growing dependence on the Chinese supply train, which raises concerns over national security among a litany of other worries.

Samsung SDI shares soared more than 8% on the news.

A deal would mark the latest push by Tesla to reduce reliance on China for key parts, fueled by tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

Tesla has signed deals with South Korean companies Samsung Electronics and LG Energy Solution to source chips and batteries in recent months.

Energy storage batteries have a similar chemistry to automotive batteries and are used to power facilities such as data centers.

South Korean battery makers are repurposing electric vehicle battery production lines to also produce energy storage systems as they are hit by the elimination of US subsidies.

Samsung SDI said in an earnings call in October that it has seen a big fall in automotive battery demand from joint venture partner Stellantis, and will tweak some of its production lines in the US state of Indiana to make energy storage batteries.

A source told Reuters that Tesla and Samsung SDI are discussing supplies of energy storage batteries, while another person said that the annual supply volume would be 10 GWh.

The South Korean newspaper Korea Economic Daily, which first reported the potential deal, said the three-year supply deal would be valued at more than 3 trillion won.

Tesla did not have an immediate comment. A Samsung SDI spokesperson said the deal and its details have not been finalised yet.

Tesla said in an earnings conference call in October that its energy storage business is seeing headwinds due to the increase in competition and tariffs. ""Currently, all sales procured are from China while we're still working on other alternatives,"" it had said.

The 2009 final rule — an obvious bureaucratic effort to gather information needed to implement various climate policies to reduce U.S. GHG emissions — cannot satisfy any plausible benefit/cost test. Even a U.S. net-zero policy achieved by 2050 would reduce global temperatures in 2100 by amounts either trivial or undetectable; the maximum under extreme assumptions would be 0.173°C, applying the Environmental Protection Agency climate model, while an estimate far more realistic would be 0.104°C. The U.S. GHG emissions that would be subject to reporting requirements, and subsequent regulation, under the 2009 final rule would be much smaller.

Experts at Texas-based IIR Energy, an energy market intelligence firm powered by Industrial Info Resources, indicate the trend as a milestone for Texas energy and technology industries. The firm’s research teams are observing how growth in data centers is transforming power usage, grid stability, and the economic landscape of the state.

The Texas Boom That Outpaced the Grid

Texas has become one of the hottest data center markets in the nation. IIR Energy estimates around $2.7 trillion in data center projects underway globally, with roughly $1 trillion in new capital spending invested in the United States in the last nine months. Much of this momentum is in Texas. Builders continue flocking to the state due to its mix of renewable energy, business-friendly tax incentives, and low-cost real estate.

Shane Mullins, IIR Energy’s Director of Global Power, explained how, in San Antonio, developers have already been informed that it will be 2032 before they can utilize another megawatt of power for growth. “It’s not holding up developers,” he said. “They’re just finding a way to do it another way.”

That resolve illustrates a larger truth: the digital economy is expanding faster than the infrastructure that supports it.

Behind the Meter: How Developers Are Adapting

To avoid delays on the grid, Texas developers are capitalizing on on-site generation systems to keep plans on track. The behind-the-meter strategy enables facilities to generate power independently, typically from natural gas-fired engines, small gas turbines, or fuel cells.

By building on-site power facilities, operators are becoming resilient and adaptable.

Mullins called this transition a revolution in how industry considers power. “Every data center is now a power project,” Mullins stated. “And every data center that’s not a power project is influencing the power industry.”

These developments bring technology and energy production closer together, with each new plant bringing stress as well as opportunity to the larger system.

A Reliability Crisis in the Making

Despite innovation, experts warn that Texas’s energy infrastructure is lagging behind. While renewable generation has grown rapidly, it cannot fully support AI’s constant power requirements.

Vice President of Power Industry Research at IIR Energy, Britt Burt, stated the imbalance is worse. “We’ve added a lot of wind, solar, and battery storage, but not much baseload generation—and that’s what we depend on every day to meet demand. The system hasn’t caught up,” he added.

While demand for electricity rises by up to two percent annually, reliability issues are accumulating nationwide. Texas, previously touted as energy independent, has become a benchmark for the consequences of digitalization outpacing infrastructure upgrades.

Coal-fired plants have postponed retirement to maintain pace with increasing load requirements, and wholesale prices have risen up to 800 percent in regional capacity auctions.

Reliable Data Matters

In this high-speed market that’s changing by the day, accurate information is critical. IIR Energy’s proprietary research approach enables its analysts to track projects from announcement to in-service, providing insight into developments that are actually happening and those that will fall short on grid constraints.

Executive Vice President of Marketing and Analytics at IIR Energy, Mike Bergen, noted that the value of the company lies in that level of verification. “We track projects through to completion,” he said. “So, at any given point in time, we can actually say how much of this $2 trillion market is actually approved and moving forward.”

This transparency gives confidence to energy traders, utilities, banks, and investors when making choices about where to invest and how to prepare for increasing demand.

In the end, the grid challenge in Texas is a national one: how to reconcile AI-driven innovation with sustainable, scalable energy supply. As Texas, the U.S., and beyond keep a close eye on the industry and data center progression, IIR Energy surfaces as more than a provider of numbers. They help determine where the next wave of opportunities and risks will land. Seeing those dynamics now will inform how Texas fuels the AI decade to come.",https://www.citybiz.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Matthew.png,N,,2025-11-04 12:12:15.524132

RESEARCHERS CREATE REVOLUTIONARY AI FABRIC THAT PREDICTS ROAD DAMAGE BEFORE IT HAPPENS

The road that powers your vehicle

The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University and Hutchinson. Together, they've installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.

So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car and bus — all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That's strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.

Charging ahead: Why it matters

If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.

For drivers, it could mean never having to worry about range anxiety again. Instead of hunting for the nearest charger, the highway itself could be your power source.

WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?

The roadblocks ahead

The big questions now are about cost and control. Who pays to install these power roads? How much will it cost to use them? Public-private partnerships may hold the key, but until those details are ironed out, large-scale rollout remains a challenge.

Still, with global momentum building, it's only a matter of time before dynamic wireless charging becomes part of everyday driving.

What this means for you

This innovation is not limited to Europe. In Detroit, Michigan, a public road on 14th Street already uses embedded charging coils that can send power to EVs as they move. In Indiana, Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation are building a quarter-mile highway section designed to charge electric vehicles, including heavy trucks, while they travel.

For drivers, this technology could make owning an EV easier and more practical. Your vehicle could recharge during normal trips without the need to stop, plug in or wait. That level of convenience could help expand EV adoption across the United States, lowering emissions and fuel costs for millions.

Kurt's key takeaways

Wireless charging roads are moving from concept to construction and showing real promise for a new era of electric travel. The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.

According to Enverus, capital costs for new natural gas power plants now average $2,200/kW to $3,000/kW.
Their competitiveness depends on the type of gas generation technology, which varies by efficiency, availability, ramp rate, cold startup cost and other factors.
Since then, the utility said its data center pipeline has shrunk by half — a positive development, said Wilmot from Enverus.
“This is a baby industry, and we are building and paying for infrastructure today for data centers that don’t yet exist,” he said.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Twenty-five years ago, a data center boom helped fuel a race to build gas-fired power plants, with the energy secretary, utilities, politicians and experts warning of blackouts and economic stagnation if the country didn’t meet surging demand for electricity.

By 2001, however, the dot com bubble had burst, the economy was in recession and the huge demand increase never materialized. Efficiency and productivity improved rapidly, and demand remained more or less level for the next two decades, leaving many utilities with excess capacity and ratepayers footing the bill.

Some analysts and industry sources see parallels between then and now. Once again, headlines are warning of imminent energy shortfalls due largely to the power needs of artificial intelligence. Leading figures in government and industry are promoting more firm generation, and particularly gas, as a matter of economic and national security.

“Can the same thing happen? Definitely,” said Eugene Kim, Wood Mackenzie’s Americas Gas Research team director. “The utilities and anyone planning for power demand is forecasting unprecedented and, in some cases, even exponential growth. Whether that materializes or not – huge degree of uncertainty.”

Gas investment reaches new heights

Investment firms, utilities, tech giants, energy companies and others are pouring billions into acquiring existing gas plants or developing new ones to serve data centers. Gas power merger and acquisition valuations have doubled since 2024, reaching up to $1.93 million/MW in some markets, according to energy analytics firm Enverus.

While there are echoes of the millennium today, there are a few important differences.

The first is that the U.S. is producing and consuming more gas than ever before — driven largely by the rise of fracking — with production concentrated in Texas and Louisiana to the south, and Pennsylvania and West Virginia farther north.

Secondly, as the U.S. became a gas-producing powerhouse, the gas and electric power sectors have become much more interdependent. In 2000, the electric power sector accounted for about 22% percent of U.S. gas consumption, while gas accounted foraround 16% of electricity produced, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

By 2023, the electric power sector accounted for about 40% of total U.S. natural gas consumption, and gas accounted for about 42% to 43% of utility-scale electricity generation, making it the single largest fuel source, the EIA says. Over the years, the role of gas has grown, largely displacing coal as the latter became uneconomical.

The third key difference is the rise of renewables and storage on a large scale. While gas is the dominant source of fuel for U.S. power generation, it makes up a small fraction of new generation coming online this year, and energy storage is taking a small but growing share of daily peak demand when the sun goes down. Utility-scale wind and solar account for 83% of FERC’s “high probability” additions through July 2028, while gas makes up about 16%.

There is some evidence that could change.

The outlook for renewables has dimmed since President Donald Trump came to office this year and largely made good on his promises to repeal tax credits, permits and other government support for wind and solar while throwing his weight behind fossil fuels.

Scott Wilmot, an energy analyst at Enverus, said before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, he would have said the quality and size of the renewable project pipeline was more than enough to meet projected energy demands. Now, he’s not so sure.

“The reality is the [levelized cost of electricity] for these renewable projects has gone up without those tax credits,” he said. “A lot of folks who are developing these projects are probably reconsidering a lot of their pipeline.”

The PJM interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, is fast tracking 11.8 GW of generation, mostly from gas. Gas also dominated MISO’s fast track interconnection review, accounting for 19 GW out of 26 GW. In ERCOT, gas went from 6.8% of the interconnection queue in August 2024 to 9.1% as of August 2025.

At the same time, major gas pipeline expansions are planned or proposed.

Amy Andryszak, president and CEO of the Interstate National Gas Association of America, said existing pipelines are currently running at capacity, and her organization’s members are reporting a “record number” of inquiries for new pipelines from potential customers.

“They indicate they have not seen this level of interest in building since around 2010 when the fracking boom drove interest in pipeline development,” Andryszak said in an emailed statement. “Many members are already announcing new or revived pipeline projects, and we expect many more will file for certificates at [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] over the next 18 months.”

FERC is expected to issue guidance soon on colocation rules, which could potentially make it easier to route gas directly to data centers and other large loads.

What would be the largest gas-fired power plant in the country is a 4.5 GW project being developed by Knighthead Capital Management at the former Homer City coal plant in Pennsylvania as part of a 3,200-acre data center campus.

Some developers say even without data centers, electricity demand is rising and gas, which is firm, dispatchable and proven, will be an important part of the energy mix for decades to come, especially as more coal generation retires.

Bilal Khan is an executive at Blackstone who oversaw the firm’s recent acquisition of the 620-MW natural gas power plant Hill Top Energy Center in Pennsylvania for about $1,600/kW. The state is part of PJM, which is already setting record capacity auction prices, making it an attractive market for producers. The grid operator has said that is due to supply and demand conditions, but its independent market monitor says data centers are the “primary reason” for the price surge.

Khan said that even putting aside data centers, he’s bullish on natural gas thanks to the other factors driving increased power demand, including manufacturing and electrification.

“We still need new power supply that’s reliable, consistent and affordable,” Khan said. “This moment is unique and in contrast to the last approximately 20 years when power demand was flat.”

A risky investment

Khan acknowledged, however, that new natural gas plants face significant obstacles. The backlog for new turbines, for example, can stretch up to seven years amid global competition for those and other components like transformers.

“There’s an equipment shortage, there’s a labor shortage and it’s more challenging to obtain all necessary permits,” Khan said.

And the cost of deploying new gas generation is rising fast.

According to Enverus, capital costs for new natural gas power plants now average $2,200/kW to $3,000/kW. An analysis by GridLab adds another $1,500/kW levelized for the 20-year cost of fuel and $500/kW for pipeline infrastructure, putting the cost of new gas generation at $4,000/kW to $4,500/kW.

Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon Energy, spent years working on natural gas projects alongside nuclear and renewables before transitioning to focus on renewables exclusively. He suggested there was a ceiling to how much gas could be built to meet near-term demand given the prices, pipeline constraints and interconnection queues.

“Tens of gigawatts of new generation from natural gas is likely at least five years away, if not more,” Smith said.

Changing market dynamics also mean new gas-powered generators face tighter conditions under which they would be economical to run, according to a recent report on thermal generation from Ascend Analytics.

Their competitiveness depends on the type of gas generation technology, which varies by efficiency, availability, ramp rate, cold startup cost and other factors. But overall, Ascend said, the value of gas assets will become increasingly concentrated in “narrow, infrequent windows of time,” increasing the importance of availability, secure fuel supply and strategically-scheduled preventative maintenance.

“In the face of rising electricity demand and declining capacity accreditation for renewables and storage, the need for dispatchable, long-duration capacity resources will persist. To meet this need, new gas capacity will be built,” it concluded. “However, investments in new gas should be made cautiously, prudently, and strategically. Thermal generation will remain a risky investment, with stranded asset risks not going away.”

Have utilities learned their lesson?

Against a backdrop of rising residential power bills, utilities and regulators say they are taking precautions to protect ratepayers from the possibility of a bubble.

NRG Energy’s vice president of regulatory affairs, Travis Kavulla, said past experience has formed the industry’s current approach in which competitive generators carry the risk of load forecasts – at least in deregulated markets.

“All of that has ramifications for the extent to which people are comfortable rapidly building out generation,” he said during a recent panel discussion hosted by the Heritage Foundation. “That’s why it’s so important for long-term offtake agreements to be formalized in this industry.”

Some regulators and utilities are moving to place more of the risk on hyperscalers by creating new rate classes for large loads. At least 30 states have proposed or approved large-load tariffs over the past several years to manage growth and protect existing ratepayers, according to a database from the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center and the Smart Electric Power Alliance.

“Whether those power plants or the gas pipeline go underutilized because that boom didn’t realize is yet to be determined.”

Eugene Kim

Wood Mackenzie’s Americas Gas Research team director

The Ohio Public Utilities Commission recently approved AEP Ohio’s plan to make data centers pay for at least 85% of the energy they request, even if they use less, to cover the cost of infrastructure. It also requires data centers to show they are financially viable and to pay an exit fee if their project is canceled or they can’t meet obligations.

Since then, the utility said its data center pipeline has shrunk by half — a positive development, said Wilmot from Enverus.

“We just can’t have absolutely unmitigated data center demand growth,” he said. “Otherwise, things are going to be very challenging for the ratepayer.”

Dominion Energy, which serves the area around Ashburn, Virginia – home to the highest concentration of data centers in the world — has proposed a similar tariff. Under its proposal, large load customers would be required to make a 14-year commitment to pay for the power they request regardless of how much they actually use.

Aaron Ruby, spokesperson for Dominion, said the utility is focused on making sure residential customers aren’t subsidizing the cost of infrastructure needed by data center customers and has yet to encounter delays as it pursues 5.9 GW of new gas generation.

He suggested, however, that there was little danger of overbuilding. In the last 20 years, he could only recall one example of Dominion developing infrastructure for a data center that fell through.

“Within a year or two, another data center customer emerged and fully utilized the infrastructure,” he said.

Others expressed skepticism.

Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar with Johns Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute, said it was still very early to know what effects AI will have on power consumption.

“This is a baby industry, and we are building and paying for infrastructure today for data centers that don’t yet exist,” he said. “We are making an investment to build out that grid infrastructure based on these very frothy assumptions.”

Kim, the Wood Mackenzie gas researcher, suggested that the power industry has matured since the last bubble burst.

Back then, the three dominant gas turbine manfacturers — GE Vernova, Mitsubishi and Seimens — were “burned significantly,” he said. “The utilities were burned significantly by overbuilding, and now they’re more cautious.”

Kim predicted gas generation will likely continue to increase due to coal retirements and growing demand for electricity, with or without data centers. Advanced manufacturing facilities require more energy. Summers are getting hotter as the climate changes, increasing demand for cooling, and larger renewable portfolios will require dispatchable generation that cannot currently be replaced by storage, he added.

But an economic slump, technological innovation, improved efficiency and any number of unforeseen factors could impact what is still a highly speculative growth scenario, he said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/B4vwrgP2vkfth1H5ATt36B1w0vSN4Fyof8jpHl4RtiI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ib282STVBMjU1Ny5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-04 11:02:37.617255

So this month, they’re hoping for fewer promises and more action.

Past pledges from nearly 200 nations have fallen far short and new plans submitted this year barely speed up pollution-fighting efforts, experts say. And if the numbers aren’t sobering enough for world leaders when they kick off the action Thursday, there’s the setting: Belem, a relatively poor city on the edge of a weakened Amazon.

Unlike past climate negotiations — and especially the one 10 years ago that forged the landmark Paris climate agreement — this annual U.N. conference isn’t primarily aimed at producing a grand deal or statement over its two weeks. Organizers and analysts frame this Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 — as the “implementation COP.”

“This is really going to be much more about what are we doing on the ground,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd the 2015 Paris agreement aimed at limiting warming.

Figueres and many of more than three dozen experts interviewed by The Associated Press said negotiators have already pinned down the goal. What’s needed now is more money and political will for countries to put decades of words and promises into action and policy to reduce heat-trapping gases and stop deforestation. Only that will put the brakes on global warming as it careens toward a level the world has agreed is too dangerous, they say.

Adapting to a warmer world and saving forests

In Belem, diplomats, activists, scientists and business leaders will discuss new national climate-fighting plans, the need to save trees that absorb carbon pollution, how communities can adapt to warming and how to financially help developing nations hit hardest by climate change.

Host Brazil will preside and set the agenda. For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil’s environment agency.

Those leaders arrive Thursday for a two-day pre-meeting summit to discuss ratcheting up the fight against climate change.

“Holding COP in the Amazon itself creates a new level of accountability. You can’t talk about climate solutions while standing on the land that’s absorbing the planet’s carbon and ignore the people who protect it,” said Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, Canada, and executive director of the nonprofit Indigenous Climate Action.

Top polluters won’t be at pre-summit

That high-level meeting is likely to be missing top leaders of the biggest carbon-polluting nations: China, the U.S. and India. They contribute about 52% of the world’s heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.

China is sending its deputy premier. The U.S. is mostly skipping this conference under President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic who’s begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement. Some U.S. cities and states are coming to show that they and businesses take climate change seriously, said former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy, who co-chairs a group called America Is All In.

Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. said it’s important world leaders understand the threat to countries like his: “Without the United States, without China, without India committing, we really have no hope.”

“We want to see action … particularly from the largest polluters,” Whipps said. “Our communities live on the front lines and we cannot afford more promises.”

Figueres said she hopes “because of the craziness in the United States that there is an expanded sense of, this is the moment to pull together.”

But Panama’s environment minister, Juan Carlos Navarro, told the AP he expects little from the talks. He said such meetings have become “a jet-setting orgy of bureaucrats who travel around the world with a tremendous carbon footprint and achieve nothing.”

Promising to cut more pollution or focusing on fulfilling pledges?

There’s already a divide on the nature of this meeting. Brazil is stressing implementation of past plans as well as what’s in new emissions-cutting plans submitted this year. But smaller island nations, such as Palau, and scientists are saying that’s not enough. It dooms Earth to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times, they said.

Palau and other island nations want negotiators to tell countries to be more ambitious in their new carbon pollution-cutting plans.

Implementing “mediocrity,” said Natural Resources Defense Council adaptation chief Adelle Thomas, “is not creating a future for vulnerable nations.”

But if nations do what they’ve already promised in past climate-fighting plans, it could trim an entire degree Celsius — 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit — from projected warming, said Ani Dasgupta, chief executive of World Resources Institute. Scientists agreed with the estimate. Dasgupta said negotiators have too long focused on big commitments instead of outcomes in the real economy, which he said is “the messier thing” that doesn’t get headlines.

“What we now need to do is deliver against what we have signed on to,” said scientist Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany.

Path to disaster or optimism?

“The challenge today is not whether we will phase out fossil fuels. The challenge today is will we be too late?” Rockstrom said. “We are heading towards catastrophic 3 degrees.”

Figueres, the former U.N. climate chief, agreed it looks bad. But she co-founded an a organization called Global Optimism and said she’s sure the world can do this.

“My optimism is not naive. I know what we’re up against,” she said. “But my optimism is about determination. It’s about we’re up against a really, really, really challenging threat here. And we don’t give up.”

Before you can put a new horse to work, you've got to train it.

Jackson Watford was learning to do just that on a mild, sunny morning last September at Elk River Livestock, a regenerative ranch about 30 minutes north of Steamboat Springs.

The 21-year-old led a pony named Seven out of the stables, towards the training corral, or round pen.

“He is the youngest one on the ranch,” Watford said of the young horse. “He hasn't been messed with much this summer. So, this will be his first time in the round pen.”

With time and training, Seven would be able to join the team of working horses used to manage the ranch's cattle and pastures.

Watford was in training, too. As a first-year apprentice on the ranch, this experience earned him credit towards an associate's degree in agriculture business management from North Carolina State University.

At the same time, Watford learned the ins and outs of regenerative ranching—a method of raising livestock that involves grazing cattle at high densities for very short periods of time on small sections of pasture. The technique is much more labor intensive than conventional ranching, which keeps cattle spread out on much larger pastures for extended periods. Proponents say the regenerative style is more aligned with the natural ecosystem of the grasslands and promotes soil health.

The work kept Watford busy all summer, moving electric fencing and cattle from pasture to pasture.

“We would move them every day or two, to get them onto new grass and allow this grass to rest,” Watford explained. “It's definitely more work, but I really enjoy it and I think it's worth it in the end of the day.”

Watford’s mentor, rancher Davey Baron, owns and operates Elk River Livestock. He’s been ranching in Northwest Colorado for about a decade and sees this regenerative approach as critical for keeping the ranch afloat in a hotter, drier climate.

“Hearing old timers talk, we used to get monsoons every day. Used to be so wet,” Baron said. “Now we're dry.”

In fact, after seeing the region change over the years, Baron believes that adapting to the warming climate is now an essential skill for ranchers.

“If you're not managing differently for dry times, then you're not doing it correctly,” he said.

As climate change intensifies, adaptation skills are increasingly part of career training for the next generation of farmers and ranchers.

Hands-on climate adaptation

Training new agricultural producers in the art of climate adaptation is the big idea behind that apprenticeship program, which is run by the Quivia Coalition, an agriculture and environment nonprofit operating throughout the Mountain West.

“It offers an opportunity, particularly for people who don't come from ranching and farming backgrounds to get a foot in the door in these careers,” said Leah Ricci, the Quivira Coalition’s agrarian program director.

Since the apprenticeship program was launched in 2009, more than 150 apprentices have graduated. About 80% of them go on to have careers in agriculture. The regenerative techniques they learn as apprentices shape their approach to the work.

“As we're entering increasingly long periods of drought and climate instability, young people going into these careers know that it's not really a choice anymore,” Ricci said. “They have to be using climate smart practices in order to have a financially sustainable business.”

Mentors are veteran farmers and ranchers with deep experience in regenerative techniques who feel called to pass their specialized knowledge forward to the next generation of agricultural producers. Many see the mentoring as a necessity – a way for them to cultivate the kind of workforce they want to tap.

“Some of them have talked with us about the challenge of finding labor who care about the same things and are excited about moving fence as often as they have to do to get the grazing outcomes that they want,” Ricci said.

Climate adaptation enters the classroom

These days, hands-on experiences like the Quivira Coalition’s apprenticeship complement what goes on in the classroom as climate adaptation becomes a bigger, more sophisticated part of the national agriculture curriculum.

“Agriculture producers have to address climate change,” said Travis Park, director for agricultural education with the National Council for Agricultural Education. “It's causing additional stresses on livestock. There are new diseases and pest pressures. So, they have to change their management practices (based) on the science end of agriculture.”

Education in climate adaptation doesn’t stop at regenerative practices. Agriculture students today learn things like how to use advanced technology—drones and artificial intelligence—to be smarter about their work. It’s a practice called enhanced precision agriculture. Farmers make use of granular data about soil type, historical yield rates and crop growth to apply only the right amount of pesticides and fertilizers with hyper precision, at the exact time and placement best suited for each crop. The approach helps farmers cut down on costly inputs and respond in real time to changing climate conditions.

“We want our students to understand the science of agriculture,” Park said. “And to understand the science of agriculture, we need to understand the science of climate change and make production decisions based on the science in both those areas.”

That science is now being taught to more than a million students enrolled in agriculture education programs at high schools and colleges across the country.

But for ranching apprentice Jackson Watford, it’s the hands-on experience learning regenerative techniques at Elk River Livestock that captured his imagination.

“I really learned a lot more being out here than I did two years in college,” Watford said. “Experiencing everything day to day, making mistakes, messing stuff up—I learn a lot better doing that than just sitting in a classroom.”

Miles from any classroom, in the training corral with the unschooled pony at Elk River, Watford was trying to get the animal used to following directions. His mentor, Davey Baron, stood by and coached, offering tips on the subtler details of horsemanship.

“You're not trying to force him into submission,” Baron counseled his apprentice. “You're trying to make him a tough, resilient thinker.”

It's what Baron is trying to do for the next generation of ranchers, too. After all, he said they'll need to be smart and nimble to stay ahead of a volatile climate.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/83ee55f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4192x2201+0+472/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F20%2F5b2c7e7c4e0aaa033fe54440f48b%2Fimg-2713-edit.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 11:03:42.892199

With Proposition 50, Newsom placed himself at the center of another potentially career-defining gamble before knowing how it would land.
Six out of 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times.
“We are talking about Proposition 50 on a nationwide scale,” Levinson said.
“And it’s really hard to talk about Proposition 50 without saying the words ‘Gov.","Gov. Gavin Newsom stepped to the microphone at the state Democratic headquarters in mid-August with the conviction of a man certain he was on the right side of history, bluntly saying California has a moral obligation to thwart President Trump’s attempt to tilt the balance of Congress.

Over the next 2½ months, Newsom became the public face of Proposition 50, a measure designed to help Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives by temporarily redrawing California’s congressional districts.

Newsom took that leap despite tepid support for a gerrymandering measure in early polls.

With Tuesday’s election, the fate of Proposition 50 arrives at a pivotal moment for Newsom, who last week acknowledged publicly that he’s weighing a 2028 presidential run. The outcome will test not only his political instincts but also his ability to deliver on a measure that has national attention fixed squarely on him.

From the outset, Newsom paired his conviction with caution.

“I’m mindful of the hard work ahead,” Newsom said in August, shortly after lawmakers placed Proposition 50 on the ballot.

It was familiar territory for a governor who has built a career on high-stakes political bets. As San Francisco mayor, his decision to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2004 made him a progressive icon. It also drew accusations he’d energized conservative turnout that year in the presidential election that ended with George W. Bush winning a second term.

As the state’s newly elected governor, he suspended the death penalty in 2019 despite voters having twice rejected measures to do so, calling it a costly and biased system that “fails to deliver justice” — a move that drew fury from law enforcement groups and victims’ families. His decision to take on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a 2023 prime-time debate hosted by Sean Hannity on Fox News was intended to showcase his command of policy and political agility, but instead fell flat amid an onslaught of insults.

With Proposition 50, Newsom placed himself at the center of another potentially career-defining gamble before knowing how it would land. Ahead of Tuesday’s special election, polling suggests he may have played his cards right. Six out of 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times.

“You know, not everybody would have done it,” veteran Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman said. “He saw the risk and he took it.”

If approved by voters, the ballot measure would redraw California’s congressional maps to favor Democrats beginning with the 2026 midterm elections in hopes of discounting Republican efforts to gerrymander more seats for themselves. California introduced the measure in response to Trump and his political team leaning on Republican-led states to redraw their district lines to help Republicans retain control of the House.

The balance of power in the closely divided House will determine whether Trump can advance his agenda during his final two years in office — or face an emboldened Democratic majority that could move to challenge, or even investigate, his administration.

And while critics of the governor see a power-craving politician chasing headlines and influence, supporters say this is classic Newsom: confident, risk-tolerant and willing to stand alone when he believes he’s right. He faced intense backlash from his political allies when he had conservative personality Charlie Kirk as his inaugural guest on his podcast this year, on which Newsom said he believed it was “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports. After Kirk was killed, Newsom regularly brought up that interview as a point of pride, noting the backlash he received from his own party over hosting a Trump ally.

In recent months Newsom struck a deal to stabilize struggling oil refineries, pushed cities to ban homeless encampments and proposed walking back healthcare coverage for undocumented immigrants — a series of moves that have tested his standing with progressives. Supporters say the moves show his pragmatic streak, while critics argue they reflect a shift to the center ahead of a possible presidential run.

“In so many ways, he is not a cautious politician,” said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School. “His brand is big, bold decisions.”

With Proposition 50, Newsom has cast the redistricting counterpunch as a moral imperative, arguing that Democrat-led states must “fight fire with fire,” even if it means pausing a state independent redistricting process largely considered the gold standard. The measure upends a system Californians overwhelmingly endorsed to keep politics out of the map-drawing process.

Levinson said Newsom’s profile has been rising along with the polling numbers for Proposition 50 as he has booked national television shows like ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and appeared in an ad in favor of the ballot measure with former President Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other prominent Democrats that ran during the World Series.

“We are talking about Proposition 50 on a nationwide scale,” Levinson said. “And it’s really hard to talk about Proposition 50 without saying the words ‘Gov. Newsom of California spearheading the effort to pass.’”

California Republicans have called the effort misguided, arguing that the retaliatory response creates a slippery slope that would erode the independent redistricting process California voters have chosen twice at the ballot box.

“When you fight fire with fire, the whole world burns,” said California Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), whose district is among those that would be overhauled under Proposition 50. “Newsom is trying to claim that Texas did a bad gerrymandering, but what California is doing is a good gerrymander because somehow it’s canceling it out … I just think gerrymandering is wrong. It’s wrong in Texas and it’s wrong in California.”

Kiley said Newsom never has been one to shy away from national attention “and for pursing explicitly partisan goals.”

“He’s certainly used this as an opportunity to do both of those things,” Kiley said.

Out of the gate, the redistricting plan had lackluster support. Then came the flood of ads by proponents peppered with talking points about Trump rigging the election.

Supporters of Proposition 50 took in more than four times the amount that opponents raised in recent weeks, according to campaign finance reports filed with the state by the three main committees campaigning about the measure. Supporters of Proposition 50 raised so much money that Newsom told them “you can stop donating.”

Political analysts said the redistricting fight has given Newsom what every ambitious politician craves: a narrative. It’s allowed him to cast himself as a defender of democracy while reenergizing donors. That message sharpened when Trump administration officials said they’d monitor polling sites in several California counties at the state GOP’s request, prompting Newsom to accuse the Trump administration of “voter intimidation.”

Republican strategist Rob Stutzman said the campaign gave Newsom something he’d struggled to find: “an authentic confrontation” with Trump that resonates beyond California.

“And I think it’s worked well for him nationally,” Stutzman said. “I think it’s been great for him in some ways, regardless of what happens, but if it does lose, it’ll hurt the brand that he can win and there will be a lot of disgruntled donors.”

While Newsom has framed the measure as good for the country, Stutzman said it’s clear that Proposition 50 has been particularly good for the governor.

“He’s used it for his own purposes very, very effectively,” Stutzman said. “If he becomes the [presidential] nominee, you could look back and say this was an important part of him getting there.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c23c70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5869x3081+0+459/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2F51%2F437d04d84f3c88727e19fcc4fe30%2F2231388676.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:32.118738

Portuguese utility EDP SA says the outlook for investing in US renewable energy has become significantly clearer, easing concerns that followed the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency.

“The situation has become much more stable,” Chief Executive Officer Miguel Stilwell de Andrade said on Tuesday in a Bloomberg Television interview in New York. “There was a lot of uncertainty, certainly at the beginning of the year, in terms of the policies. Now at least we have visibility, with the Big Beautiful Bill.”

The comments come after Trump’s attempts to stall offshore wind projects forced EDP and its Ocean Winds joint-venture partner Engie SA of France to announce impairments in February. Denmark’s Orsted A/S only recently won a court ruling to resume work on its nearly completed Rhode Island wind farm.

Since starting his second term in January, Trump has issued a series of orders against the offshore wind industry, including halting new seabed leases and blocking federal permits for existing ones. Executives had expected projects that were already fully permitted would be spared from the administration’s hostility toward offshore wind.

Shares of EDP Renovaveis SA — the listed renewables arm of EDP — lost almost a third of their value earlier this year, hitting the lowest since 2018 in April, before rebounding more than 50%. Parent company EDP SA has also rallied, climbing about 35% from a more than six-year low in early April.

EDP has already poured more than $20 billion into US wind and solar projects and continues to see North America, along with Europe, as a core growth region. The company pledged earlier this year to keep adding renewable capacity, though at a slower pace than previously planned.

“We need a stable legislative framework to be able to invest, and I think that’s what we’re looking for,” the CEO said.

On Trump’s tariffs, d’Andrade said most of EDP’s supply chain is now based in the US as the company turns to domestically-made products, citing a framework agreement with panel manufacturer First Solar Inc. The underlying cost to produce solar panels in the US is maybe two times what it would cost elsewhere, according to the CEO.

“It’s more expensive than if you import it, although nowadays with the uncertainty around tariffs we prefer to pay that premium but ensure a stable supply chain,” d’Andrade said.

“China’s updated NDC is a significant moment in our collective climate effort.

China’s NDC will deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at an unprecedented scale and help accelerate the transition by lowering the cost of clean technologies and driving innovation.

Today’s news is another signal that the future global economy will run on clean energy.

NDCs will be among the most important policy documents this century because they can accelerate economic transformation, driving more economic growth, jobs, affordable and secure energy, cleaner air, and better health.

China, like so many other countries, sees a clear national interest in building a cleaner, more prosperous future, with President Xi noting at the Secretary-General's recent climate summit that ""green and low-carbon transition is the trend of the time''.

Every day now, new NDCs are being submitted by economies around the world, and more are expected in the coming days.

In the past few weeks alone, we have also received new NDCs from: Indonesia, South Africa, Malaysia, Côte d’Ivoire, Mauritania, Zambia, and Cabo Verde, adding to those previously submitted.

Recent data shows how far we’ve come and how much further we still have to go. But I’m encouraged by President Xi’s remarks at the recent climate summit, and reflected fully in today NDC submission, committing both to emissions reduction targets and saying that China will be striving to do better.

President Xi, like so many leaders, recognizes that change is happening fast, sometimes even faster than governments can account for.

In that light, I hope that the NDCs we receive will be a floor, not a ceiling for ambition. And that every country sees it in its interest to go further and faster, to protect all their people from worsening climate disasters, and reap the vast human and economic benefits of stronger climate action.”",https://unfccc.int/themes/custom/unfccc/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-04 10:18:32.501376

The facility will include a system to reprocess and reuse spent fuel, minimizing the deadly waste produced by reactors, First American said in a statement Tuesday.
The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems.
Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.
“The waste actually gives you energy,” said Bill Stokes, the company’s founder and president.","Fission startup First American Nuclear Co. is developing a power plant, first using natural gas and then shifting to a reactor expected to run on fuel produced from its own nuclear waste.

The Indiana-based company expects to start delivering electricity in 2028 using gas, and then deploy its liquid-metal fast reactor by 2032, according to Chief Executive Officer Mike Reinboth. The facility will include a system to reprocess and reuse spent fuel, minimizing the deadly waste produced by reactors, First American said in a statement Tuesday.

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

“Data centers are driving the demand for power,” he said.

First American is designing a 240-megawatt liquid metal reactor that uses lead bismuth as a coolant. It’s the only company using this technology in the US, though it’s been used in Russian submarines for years.

The reprocessing system will be able to convert spent uranium from the plant into new fuel, making the plants cheaper to operate and eliminating the challenge posed by the toxic waste created by conventional reactors.

“The waste actually gives you energy,” said Bill Stokes, the company’s founder and president.

CMS Energy pumped $15,000 into Protect MI Free Speech, the committee formed to oppose the Michiganders for Money Out of Politics ballot initiative. The other $15,000 backing the opposition campaign came from health insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which would also be prohibited from making campaign contributions under the proposal.

The Michiganders for Money Out of Politics framework would ban regulated utilities like Consumers Energy from giving money to state officeholders and political party committees. The prohibition would also extend to corporations with state or local government contracts worth more than $250,000 annually, like Blue Cross Blue Shield. Under the framework, dark money 501(c)(4) nonprofits – including a prominent one affiliated with Consumers Energy – would be required to disclose pre-election ad spending.

Organizers aim to gather 356,958 signatures from Michigan voters by late February to ensure their proposal can be put to voters on the November 2026 ballot. The coalition pushing the proposal includes Clean Water Action, Climate Cabinet, Community Change Action, Detroit Action, Michigan League of Conservation Voters, Michigan United Action, MOSES Action, Progress Michigan, and Voters Not Politicians.

Utility influence is a key driver of ballot initiative

Consumers Energy and DTE Energy, Michigan’s two largest corporate monopoly utilities, are among the most influential political forces in the state. Through their Political Action Committees (PACs), the two utilities have reported more than $1.7 million in contributions to current elected officials across their political careers, according to an Energy and Policy Institute analysis of campaign finance reports.

The review found that 122 of 148 current state legislators – or 82 percent – have received utility PAC money. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer tops the list with $151,315 in utility PAC giving through October 2025. She appoints the regulators who oversee Michigan utilities, and who determine how much they can raise rates and how much they can profit. These proceedings have grown increasingly contentious in recent years as Consumers Energy and DTE Energy seek frequent rate increases while customers experience frequent outages, relative to other utilities in the region.

Earlier this year, Whitmer faced blowback for effectively ousting a well-respected regulator, Alessandra Carreon, and replacing her with Shaquila Myers, a political ally who pushed for utility priorities in her previous role as a top legislative aide.

After Whitmer, Republican Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt – a Republican gubernatorial candidate – is next in line with $142,825 in utility PAC contributions through October 2025. Like their peers in other states, the Michigan utility PACs have historically given to elected officials in both parties, often funneling the most to those in leadership positions who have the most sway in shaping the legislative agenda.

To date, legislative efforts to rein in Consumers Energy and DTE Energy have largely stalled out, including a bill that would’ve restricted their political spending without the ballot drive now underway. Utility PAC giving has coincided with pivotal votes on key energy bills, prompting environmental justice and clean energy advocates to blame inaction on utilities’ outsize influence in Lansing.

“While Michigan families continue to pay the highest rates in the Midwest for the worst service, DTE and Consumers are writing check after check to lawmakers helping their CEOs protect this broken status quo,” Bob Allison, deputy director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said earlier this year. “Michiganders of all political stripes chafe at our elected leaders being so blatantly influenced by the very utilities they, by law, are responsible for overseeing on behalf of us.”

Utilities channel millions of dollars more through dark money groups

Beyond the contributions made through their PACs, both Consumers Energy and DTE Energy have funded dark money 501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations that amplify their political giving, or their senior employees have led those groups. By using dark money groups, corporate interests can make donations, in secret, that exceed campaign finance limits. The groups also place ads designed to influence election outcomes.

These 501(c)(4) nonprofits – notoriously secretive, and designed to obscure how the money flows – would face greater scrutiny, and exposure, if the proposed ballot initiative passes. It would mandate disclosures of ad spending in the leadup to elections, commonly placed in service of utility-friendly candidates and their preferred policy outcomes.

While the utilities have insisted such nonprofits operate separately from them, their ties are clear.

One such dark money group, Citizens for Energizing Michigan’s Economy (CEME), has received over $43 million in contributions from Consumers Energy, whose executives and lobbyists sit on its board. CEME has contributed tens of millions of dollars to politically connected organizations over the past decade, while its spending on election season ads prompted a complaint filed with the Internal Revenue Service that questioned the legality of CEME’s activities.

Likewise, DTE Energy lobbyists and executives comprise the board of Michigan Energy First (MEF), a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that has pumped millions of dollars into funds affiliated with state officials and into advertising campaigns designed to influence state elections and policy decisions. Records daylighted in a criminal court case earlier this year showed a DTE Energy staffer was coordinating dark money donations on behalf of MEF using her DTE email account.

For those watching Michigan politics in recent years, the links are not surprising. After former Michigan House Energy Chair Gary Glenn, a Republican, took a hard line against Consumers Energy and DTE Energy priorities and profits in 2018, utility-affiliated dark money groups spent an estimated $1 million on a campaign to unseat him – a massive amount for a single legislative race.

Glenn lost, and with CEME in particular sitting on a multimillion-dollar war chest, Consumers Energy continues to loom large in state politics. Its most recent tax filing shows CEME was holding onto $12.7 million in assets as of December 2023 – a sizable war chest given typical spending in legislative races. MEF reported $7.6 million in assets at the end of 2023.

“By hanging my hide on the wall, utilities will intimidate even more legislators. Many legislators walk around scared of their own shadow when it comes to utility lobbyists,” Glenn told Midwest Energy News after his loss. “I am more disappointed in that than I have been about having lost the race — the fact that they’ll be able to intimidate other lawmakers by pointing to what they did in my race.”

Since then, both utilities’ dark money affiliates have continued to run ads during campaign season. They have also quietly given hefty sums to groups affiliated with sitting elected officials and political parties, including Whitmer and former House Speaker Joe Tate, who presided over the House as utility accountability bills languished in 2023.

“It essentially amounts to legal bribery,” State Rep. Dylan Wegela, a Democrat who has supported restricting utility campaign spending, previously told the Detroit News. “How else can you explain our lack of action on holding DTE accountable, especially, considering it’s one of the most popular and important issues?”

Protect MI Free Speech cash flowing to dark money lawyer

In addition to reporting five-figure contributions from CMS Energy and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the disclosure filed last week by Protect MI Free Speech also detailed its spending so far.

Nearly 90 percent of the $30,000 raised so far – $26,525 – went to Eric Doster, an attorney who helps run CEME and MEF, the dark money nonprofits linked to Consumers Energy and DTE Energy. This spending covers legal fees, according to the filing.

Doster is also legal counsel for the Michigan Economic Development Foundation, a separate nonprofit facing scrutiny recently. The organization uses donations from large corporations – including Consumers Energy and DTE Energy – to fund Whitmer’s overseas trade trips, an arrangement critics say promotes inappropriate coziness between Whitmer and big business interests. Those with board seats got access to Whitmer and high-profile staff, plus billions of dollars in state economic development incentives in recent years, the Detroit News reported.

Doster’s wife, Mary, is listed in the filing as the “designated record keeper” for Protect MI Free Speech, and she lists her address as the Ingham County home she and Eric Doster share. Mary Doster is a GOP insider who has helped run campaigns for Republican candidates and causes in Michigan.

In addition to the fees paid to Doster, Protect MI Free Speech reported another $2,385 on legal fees paid to Dykema Gossett, a law firm that represents utilities and other corporate interests in Michigan.

The next required disclosure from Protect MI Free Speech is due Feb. 2.

We don’t have to wait for any policy change coming down from the top before we start taking action.” Third Act calls its new campaign Simplify Solar.
Yet, a patchwork of state and local regulations adds time and expense to the process of installing home solar systems in the U.S.
This presents problems for people who want to install renewable energy, but whose only guide for how to navigate the process comes from solar companies themselves.
This would help counteract some Trump administration efforts to remove renewable energy incentives, while laying the groundwork for rapid growth of renewables when the national political environment shifts again.","This article was originally published on Waging Nonviolence.

“We have the groundwork in place to make solar power and renewable energy much more accessible than they are now,” celebrated climate activist Bill McKibben told people from all over the country on a Sept. 25 Zoom call.

The virtual gathering was organized by Third Act, a national organization of people over 60 confronting the climate crisis. It took place just days after a Third Act-coordinated nationwide day of action called Sun Day, which saw over 500 events in 49 states draw attention to renewable energy’s vast potential.

At a time when U.S. climate organizations are largely on the defensive, fighting the Trump administration’s rollbacks to climate action at the federal level, McKibben’s words underscored how Third Act has identified a rare opportunity to make real, short-term progress toward a clean energy future. The organization wants to remove local and state-level barriers that prevent people from harnessing the power of the sun.

“This is one area where we don’t have to wait,” said Third Act campaign strategist Jeremy Friedman. “You don’t have to wait for your state legislature to make things better, or for voters to throw out the politicians in Congress who repealed national climate legislation. We don’t have to wait for any policy change coming down from the top before we start taking action.”

Third Act calls its new campaign Simplify Solar. “It’s really more of a project than a single campaign,” Friedman said. “This is a decentralized effort, where volunteers will work at the local level to advance individual campaigns in their own communities.”

If successful, Simplify Solar could show how climate activists can still move the ball forward for clean energy, even at a time of unprecedented attacks on federal progress.

Removing barriers

“Solar is no longer ‘alternative’ energy,” said Deborah Moore, another Third Act strategist. “It’s really the best way to go.”

Solar energy is not only one of the cleanest forms of electricity, it’s also cheaper than energy from fossil fuels in much of the world, including large parts of the United States. Yet, a patchwork of state and local regulations adds time and expense to the process of installing home solar systems in the U.S. Many of these rules constitute unnecessary red tape that prevents people from powering their homes with clean, affordable energy.

By challenging governments to remove these barriers, Third Act activists believe they can help clear a real roadblock to the widespread adoption of clean energy — and there isn’t much the Trump administration can do about it. The organization’s first step is gathering on-the-ground information about current regulations.

Currently, there is no single, publicly accessible database about how different towns, cities and counties handle solar permitting. This presents problems for people who want to install renewable energy, but whose only guide for how to navigate the process comes from solar companies themselves.

“One of the barriers to the uptake of solar is poor information,” said Karen Gladding, a member of the coordinating committee for Third Act D.C. “And where do you go, except to a local installer? And then immediately you’re under pressure to sign a contract.”

This fall, Third Act is organizing a series of virtual trainings to help volunteers learn how to track down information about current policies pertaining to solar in their communities, then crowd source the information into a central database. This will provide a foundation for the next part of the project: persuading governments to remove unnecessary regulations.

“At the outset, we’re not treating city and county officials as targets who necessarily need to be pushed hard,” Friedman said. “Some may be allies waiting in the wings, who are ready to be invited into a partnership by our volunteers. A first step is to see what officials are already willing to work with us.”

Once activists identify where the rules for home solar need to be changed, and which lawmakers are receptive to helping, it will be time to put pressure on those decision makers who are more recalcitrant. This will likely involve some creative activism.

“I call it bureaucracy theater,” Friedman said. “We set up some desks along a sidewalk, complete with stacks of paper and a musty, white-wigged administrator behind the counter. Then, a volunteer playing the part of a beleaguered city resident goes from table to table, trying to get their solar permit approved and getting nowhere.”

Friedman said this kind of street theater is “a way to poke a little fun at the experience of navigating bureaucracy in the modern world.” The message is serious, though: Today, regulations governing rooftop solar aren’t just an inconvenience, but a genuine roadblock to progress on climate change.

“An exciting thing about this work is it’s something people can join from anywhere,” Friedman said. “Unlike so many other campaigns, you can find meaningful ways to participate whether you live in a red, blue or purple state.”

Spanning political divides

“Too often in politics, there’s an overwhelming focus on so-called purple states,” Friedman said. “This leaves people who don’t live in those states without many ways to contribute. Progressives in blue areas assume their state governments are already doing the right thing, while those in red states feel their representatives will never listen to them.”

The issues Simplify Solar seeks to tackle are less straightforward. For example, blue states may have some of the most burdensome regulations holding solar back.

“Up until now, one of the worst states in the country for putting solar on your roof has been New Jersey,” Friedman said. “They actually have more state incentives to make solar cheaper than many other states — but the difficulty of the permitting process makes it so solar is still more expensive in New Jersey than neighboring Pennsylvania. That’s wasted money people are being forced to pay for very little reward.”

A bill passed by the New Jersey legislature this year will help streamline the process for approving home solar installations, assuming it’s signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy. However, the difficulties solar advocates have encountered there until recently illustrates how barriers to renewables can arise in unlikely places.

Simplify Solar isn’t about complete deregulation.

“We need to ensure solar installations are safe,” Friedman said. “But once that’s taken care of, there doesn’t have to be a lot of additional government intervention.”

Renewable advocates in politically red states can also take action, sometimes at the local level. Red states often contain urban centers where progressive lawmakers may be receptive to climate activists’ message.

Beyond this, the fact that simplifying solar is about reducing government regulation suggests at least the potential for genuinely bipartisan solutions. This year, Utah — one of the most conservative states in the country — passed a “balcony solar bill,” allowing people to plug small solar systems directly into home electrical outlets without additional fees.

Simplify Solar’s state-level work is entering a quiet period, since most state legislatures meet mainly in the first half of the year. The project will use this time to collect more information about what state regulatory frameworks could most likely be improved.

“Going into January and February, we’ll know a lot more about where legislators are willing and interested in introducing better laws,” Friedman said.

Once state legislative sessions start, Third Act members expect to contact and meet with lawmakers, testify at legislative hearings and engage in more creative kinds of activism. These same types of action will be going on at the local level.

There’s reason to think the organization’s specific volunteer power base might be uniquely suited to push this momentum forward.

Acting now

“Third Actors are especially well positioned for this work, in some ways,” Friedman said. “Our volunteers are more likely to be homeowners than younger people. They’re more likely to have lived in one place for a long time, giving them a relationship with their town and local politics. Those who are retired also likely have flexible daytime hours for interacting with officials.”

Third Act was founded with the goal of marshalling the resources and creativity of people over 60 to tackle climate change. This makes it stand out from other climate groups that have tended to be led by young people, and which in some cases explicitly focus on engaging students.

Young activists will likely always play an important role in the climate movement. But few high school or college students have experience navigating local bureaucracies to make home improvements. Third Act’s volunteers are more likely to be familiar with these processes.

Of course, older people also bring other valuable life experiences to the table. “We have members who are retired city employees, who are former elected officials, and folks who’ve been lawyers,” Friedman says. “Now, they can draw on all those years of experience to inform their activism.”

There are many different ways for volunteers to plug into Third Act’s campaigns. “A lot of how people engage will depend on temperament and ability,” Friedman said. “We’ve got folks with mobility issues, for example, who maybe can’t go testify at City Hall, but who can do research from home on existing local solar policies and share what they find with others.”

If successful, this work will lead to improved accessibility of home renewable energy systems for people all over the United States. This would help counteract some Trump administration efforts to remove renewable energy incentives, while laying the groundwork for rapid growth of renewables when the national political environment shifts again.

“With climate change, of course, we’re up against a real timeline to prevent the crisis from worsening,” Friedman said. “What’s so appealing about this project is it’s an opportunity to cut costs for solar no one wanted to pay — and to do it right now.”

Background The PTC is a refundable tax credit designed to help eligible individuals and families afford health insurance purchased through the ACA marketplace.
Projections on the number of people who would become uninsured vary slightly, though they all point to a significant increase.
The authors note this figure is larger than prior-year estimates partly because marketplace enrollment in 2025 was substantially higher than expected.
Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said at an October 29 “Save the ACA” rally organized by the Economic Security Project that the “enhanced ACA tax credits made health insurance more affordable for families and more than 89,000 Minnesotans.","Enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits (PTCs) are set to expire at the end of 2025, and without congressional action, millions of Americans face sharply higher health insurance premiums and potential coverage loss, with significant consequences for household and federal budgets, according to stakeholders.

Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace face steep premium increases in 2026 as the enhanced PTCs are set to expire. The enhancements, which were enacted as part of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and later extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), will end unless Congress intervenes.

Background

The PTC is a refundable tax credit designed to help eligible individuals and families afford health insurance purchased through the ACA marketplace. As explained in a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, which was initially published earlier this year and last updated in September, the credit works by capping the amount a household is expected to contribute toward a “benchmark” silver-level health plan, with the government subsidy covering the rest.

Prior to 2021, eligibility was limited to households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), creating a “subsidy cliff” where a small income increase could make a family entirely ineligible for assistance. The ARPA and IRA enhancements temporarily eliminated this cliff by extending eligibility to those with incomes above 400% of the FPL and made the subsidies more generous overall.

These changes fueled record marketplace enrollment, which, according to a February 2025 explainer from the Commonwealth Fund, grew from 12 million people in 2021 to a record 24.2 million in 2025.

Rising Costs, Coverage Losses

If the enhancements expire, premiums for marketplace enrollees will rise sharply. A report published October 29 by Gideon Lukens and Elizabeth Zhang at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) projects that the amount the average enrollee pays will more than double. For example, a family of four making $130,000 (about 404% of the FPL) would see their monthly premium jump from $921 to $1,998 — an annual increase of about $12,900.

This “rate shock” is expected to push millions out of the insurance market. Projections on the number of people who would become uninsured vary slightly, though they all point to a significant increase. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in a June 2024 letter from Director Phillip Swagel to House Republican leaders, estimated that the number of uninsured people would rise by 3.8 million, on average, in each year over the 2026-2034 period.

Subsequent analyses showed a growing consensus around that number. The Commonwealth Fund’s Senior Scholar Sara Collins and Program Assistant Carson Richards projected that 4 million people would likely become uninsured. The Economic Security Project forecasted that 4.2 million people will lose coverage.

An analysis from the Urban Institute, authored in September by Senior Fellow Fredric Blavin and Principal Research Associate Michael Simpson, projects an even larger impact, with 4.8 million more adults becoming uninsured in 2026. The authors note this figure is larger than prior-year estimates partly because marketplace enrollment in 2025 was substantially higher than expected.

Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said at an October 29 “Save the ACA” rally organized by the Economic Security Project that the “enhanced ACA tax credits made health insurance more affordable for families and more than 89,000 Minnesotans. Their loss would mean skyrocketing premiums,” she said. “This will hit middle-class Americans, small business owners, farmers and people [aged] 55 and older, the hardest.”

Budget Forecast

Swagel had found that making the enhanced PTC permanent would increase the federal budget deficit by an estimated $335 billion over the 2025-2034 period. This net cost reflects a complex shift in coverage, including a projected 3.5 million decrease in employment-based coverage as some workers switch to more affordable marketplace options, he wrote last June.

The Urban Institute’s more current analysis highlights that allowing the credits to expire would create other economic pressures, even while avoiding direct federal spending. The report projects that the resulting increase in the uninsured population would lead to a $7.7 billion increase in the demand for uncompensated care in 2026.

This cost, the report claims, is not a federal budget line item but is instead absorbed by hospitals, physicians, and state and local governments, placing a financial strain on the broader health care system.

At last Wednesday’s rally, Jennifer Flynn Walker, co-director of campaigns for Popular Democracy in Action, told attendees outside the Capitol building, “Families are struggling to pay rent and keep their health care while [President Trump] demolishes the East Wing to build a $300 million ballroom for his billionaire friends, instead of reopening the government and fixing the health care crisis affecting millions of us.”

Congress should pass the Fix Our Forests Act before the end of the year to give communities and agencies the tools they need to address this challenge.","In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry advanced a bill to address the growing threat of wildfires. There is now broad consensus that the poor health of our forests are threatening communities, public health and emissions goals.

But, as the bipartisan, bicameral Fix Our Forests Act proves, we don’t simply have to accept this as our new normal.

Recent fire seasons have been devastating — burning millions of acres, destroying thousands of homes and putting lives at risk. The growing wildfire challenge is also threatening climate goals, as forest fires increasingly become a source of emissions.

In 2020, for example, one wildfire season in California produced twice the emissions that the state had reduced between 2003 and 2019 combined, effectively wiping out 16 years of progress. Similarly, Canada’s 2023 wildfires released more carbon in just a few months than Russia or Japan emits from all fossil fuel use in an entire year.

While climate change plays a role in wildfires increasing in size, severity and frequency, the main driver is decades of poor forest management, which has left forests dense, overgrown and unhealthy. Under these conditions, our forests become tinderboxes, ready to ignite at any moment. Restoring them to a healthy state is crucial for protecting both our communities and our environment.

Unfortunately, many critical projects needed to restore our forests get stalled in lengthy review processes and legal challenges, unable to break ground before the next catastrophic wildfire hits.

For example, it’s not uncommon for the Forest Service to propose a project and start the National Environmental Policy Act process, only for an uncontrolled wildfire to burn the area before the environmental review is complete. It’s not surprising considering the fact that it takes an average of nearly five years to simply start a prescribed fire project, and forest management projects face more litigation under the act than any other project type.

Still, not all news is bad — in at least one case, we may have learned a valuable lesson. Through the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, enacted in 2016, Congress established a categorical exclusion for forest thinning projects of up to 10,000 acres within the Lake Tahoe Basin.

This policy allowed the Forest Service to implement critical forest treatments quickly. When the Caldor Fire ignited in 2021 and ultimately burned over 220,000 acres, these treatments played a crucial role in protecting South Lake Tahoe, bringing the fire to the ground and enabling fire officials to bring it under control.

Now, through the Fix Our Forests Act, Congress is looking to extend this model to the nation’s highest-risk forests, expanding the size of forest health projects eligible for a categorical exclusion from 3,000 acres up to 10,000 acres. The proposal draws on successes such as the Lake Tahoe Basin, and even former Forest Service Chief Randy Moore has expressed support for efforts to expedite critical forest management projects.

On top of streamlining the review process for forest management projects in high-risk areas, the bill establishes a Fireshed Center to improve coordination across federal, state, tribal and local partners. It also supports community wildfire initiatives, including home hardening and local resilience planning, while investing in reseeding and reforestation capabilities to restore healthy forests post-wildfire.

In January, after the Los Angeles wildfires became the most costly in history, the House passed the Fix Our Forests Act with significant bipartisan support. Now, as the year comes to a close, the Senate has the chance to advance this bill and deliver real solutions for communities across the country.

Wildfires have long been a part of life in the U.S., especially in the West, but we don’t have to simply accept the growing threat they pose. Congress should pass the Fix Our Forests Act before the end of the year to give communities and agencies the tools they need to address this challenge. We cannot wait for another disaster to spur us to act.

The agreement is President Donald Trump’s latest move to influence the energy sector — namely, by giving the U.S. government equity in private ventures. The government would arrange financing and permits in return for a 20 percent stake in Westinghouse’s profits.

“They’re converting loan and grant programs into equity stakes,” said Brent Cebul, an associate professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania who researches political economy and business-state interaction. “That’s one way that we can think about this as both continuity with the Biden administration, but also an important precedent-setting disjuncture in terms of the equity stakes.”

As of October, the administration had taken stakes in five public companies, including semiconductor manufacturer Intel and rare earths miner MP Materials. Upon the Westinghouse announcement, ClearView Energy Partners said the “scale of the Trump Administration’s energy sector-directed industrial policy seems to be accelerating.”

“We would suggest the Administration may have identified Westinghouse as a possible ‘national champion’ within the U.S. power sector, which could influence the competitive landscape for domestic nuclear generation and energy operations writ large,” ClearView analysts wrote.

Jacopo Buongiorno, director of the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the deal indicates the government’s preference for Westinghouse as a purveyor of large, conventional nuclear reactors.

“It gives the perception that the government picked a winner, but it is the de facto winner in that category,” Buongiorno said.

Buongiorno noted that no other American nuclear firms are actively selling and building large reactors. While dozens of firms are looking to build midsize, small and micro reactors, he said, there are “other markets” for them.

“You have chemical plants; you have steel mills, concrete factories. They need heat and electricity, and maybe they need 100 megawatt equivalent of heat and 50 megawatt of electricity, or whatever it is,” Buongiorno said. “In that case, it doesn’t make any sense to put an AP1000. You put a small modular reactor.”

AP1000s produce roughly 1,000 megawatts of electricity, while small modular reactors generate anywhere from 12 MW to 300 MW. A typical Amazon data center consumes 300 to 500 MW.

Consulting firm Wood Mackenzie expects U.S. nuclear generation to grow 27 percent from 2035 to 2060 due largely to the proliferation of power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers. Many technology firms are turning specifically to nuclear to power their growing fleets in hopes that its low emissions will satisfy their sustainability goals without sacrificing reliability.

Westinghouse Electric’s owners, Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management, said in their announcement that the agreement with the U.S. government aims to boost the American nuclear industry, ensure energy sovereignty, support AI-driven data centers and potentially create thousands of jobs.

Under the new partnership, if the U.S. enters into agreements to build $80 billion of nuclear reactors, the government will receive 20 percent of profits “in excess of US$17.5 billion made by Westinghouse,” according to Cameco’s press release.

If the government makes a final investment decision by January 2029 and an initial public offering valuation for Westinghouse is expected at $30 billion or more, the government would be “entitled to require” an IPO. In that case, the U.S. would then have at least five years to purchase equity equal to 20 percent of Westinghouse’s value, after deducting the $17.5 billion.

Hazy details

The Trump administration’s pursuit of equity distinguishes its approach from previous instances of government ownership in private companies, such as during the New Deal and in the wake of World War II, Cebul said.

He also noted that in the 1980s and 1990s, states from Ohio to Arkansas set up public venture capital funds, pitching them as a way to create well-paying jobs.

In some instances, states reserved the right to participate in managerial decisions, Cebul said, but “I don’t know of any cases where the state actually stepped in to put their thumb on the scale.”

In the past, the U.S. government has also effectively created monopolies by awarding contracts to only one company. Cebul pointed to Boeing’s position in the aircraft industry and Lockheed Martin’s dominance in the defense sector as examples.

“Contracting is not the same thing as taking an equity stake, but it’s a distinction that is far more of a degree than a categorical difference,” Cebul said.

But much is still unknown about the deal with Westinghouse. Crucial details — such as sites, customers and builders — have not been publicly released.

“The announcement was very short on detail, and those details will have to be revealed soon for people to remain excited,” Buongiorno said.

ClearView analysts walked through the math of the IPO: At a $30 billion valuation, the agreement could let the government acquire a stake worth $6 billion by expending roughly $2.5 billion.

Funding sources aren’t specified. ClearView points to the Department of Energy’s loan-guarantee authority as a plausible tool to help arrange financing. The firm also highlights a new U.S.–Japan deal that sets aside up to $332 billion for critical energy infrastructure in the U.S., with a Japanese document sizing a Westinghouse provision at up to $100 billion.

ClearView estimated that $80 billion could support anywhere from 5 to 11 new reactors at 1 gigawatt each.

On its website, Westinghouse indicates that the new reactors could power more than AI: “Supporting America’s leadership in AI is a core use case, but the power produced will also meet broader increases in energy demand and bolster energy security.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/7d/92/57e0d7734844a2caf7d24af0f240/nuclear-plant-georgia-35574.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 10:04:58.126820

Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir said the current environmental governance system is “not fit for purpose and failing everyone”.

He described an “endless list” of examples of failed environmental governance, including Lough Neagh, the illegal dump site at Mobuoy, as well as nature decline, and air quality.

He urged MLAs for support as he asks the Stormont Executive to agree in principle to the establishment of an independent, environmental protection agency in Northern Ireland.

“Northern Ireland is a laggard in relation to the environment and, when I stand up and say that, and look to take action on that, I get vilified. Vilified because people are not prepared to take difficult decision,” he said.

“This is a point of decision for this place and people need to back me.”

Last month, a review of environmental governance in the region recommended independent regulation to include oversight of air and water quality, waste management, nature and biodiversity and the marine environment.

The panel noted the region’s environment is under “mounting stress”, with signals which “cannot be ignored”.

Mr Muir said this “critical issue cannot continue to be dodged”.

“I firmly believe that now is a pivotal moment for all of us, and that we should establish an independent environmental protection agency as recommended by the independent panel,” he said.

“We are witnessing more and more visible signs that our environment is struggling, and we need to take decisions now to change course.

“The costs of inaction are simply too great. We should look no further than Lough Neagh or the illegal dump at Mobuoy, which could cost hundreds of millions of pounds to resolve.

“Failed environmental governance and non compliance with environmental law results in huge costs to the public purse and, so, we must invest now in the longer term to make those savings.

“Inaction also leads to increasingly degraded eco systems, public health risks, impacts on people’s livelihoods and lost opportunities for sustainable growth.

“Without decisive reform, Northern Ireland will continue to fall behind in meeting its environmental obligations and the public will continue to pay the price in terms of quality of life and economic resilience.”

Daniel McCrossan, from the SDLP Opposition, pressed Mr Muir for a time scale on when the environmental protection agency will be active, pointing out the minister is two years into his post.

Mr Muir said once he has secured support in principle, then the process will move to the public consultation.

But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

READ MORE: Trump called climate change a ‘con job’ at the United Nations. Here are the facts and context

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States’ withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, Tuesday’s U.N. Environment Program’s Emissions Gap report says.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,” said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. “It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise.”

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.1 to 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer.

“We are making progress,” U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press.

“We have to go faster,” she added.

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.

The project — formally known as the Fairfield-Congress Railroad Transmission Line — has generated intense local pushback over the impact that the transmission line would have as it passes over homes, businesses and churches, suspended from giant steel monopoles. Utility officials have countered that the proposed alternatives, including burying the line underground, would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the project’s costs, which would be paid back by customers across Connecticut.

Last month, the Connecticut Siting Council voted 5-3 to reject the project, with several members reversing their previous positions of support.

“As the Council has repeatedly found, there is a strong public need for this Project, which will replace 60-year-old, deteriorated UI transmission infrastructure, which sits atop 100-year-old, [state] owned railroad catenaries,” the company said in a formal petition asking the Siting Council to reconsider its ruling.

Additionally, the petition argued that the council’s sudden reversal left company officials “with no guidance as to what, if any, issues the Council had with the proposed solution to the important public need the Project sought to address.”

While the request is unlikely to yield a different outcome, it is necessary for United Illuminating to exhaust its options before the Siting Council in order to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision.

The company gave further indication that it is pursing a legal appeal last month when its attorneys sent letters to members of the Siting Council, as well as local leaders in Bridgeport and Fairfield, advising them to preserve any documents or communications related to the project.

The letter, known as a “litigation hold,” often serves as a precursor to a formal lawsuit.

Officials in Fairfield and Bridgeport did not immediately offer comment Monday on UI’s latest request. A spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont’s office declined to comment.

The Fairfield-Congress transmission line was previously the subject of a lawsuit brought by officials in Bridgeport and Fairfield, along with other local critics, challenging the Siting Council’s decision to propose and approve an alternative plan that moved the proposed route of the transmission line from the south side of the Metro North railroad tracks to the north.

In April, a judge ruled that the council has overstepped its authority by modifying UI’s proposal with its own route.

The decision led the Siting Council to reconsider the original 7.3 mile route as proposed by UI in 2023. Over the next few months, the members of the council publicly wavered over their decision, holding a series of votes in which they went back and forth over whether to approve the project.

After a nonbinding straw vote was held in September in which a majority of the council indicated their support for the project, opponents declared the process “tainted” as a result of several members switching their positions from an earlier vote in June.

Those concerns evaporated, however, after the council switched positions again to reject UI’s proposal during the final and biding vote held on Oct. 16.

Instead, it is now the utility that is protesting the process. In its filing on Monday, the company stated that the Siting Council “acted illegally and arbitrarily in flipping its vote with absolutely no reasons provided.”

The transmission line is also of interest to communities outside of Bridgeport and Fairfield due to the construction costs that will be recouped from utility customers.

UI has estimated that the cost of building its proposed overhead transmission line will be around $300 million. That amount can be spread among the nearly 14 million electric customers in six states under rules established by the regional grid operator, ISO New England.

If the Siting Council forces those lines to be buried, however, the additional costs are borne by electric customers in Connecticut alone, according to ISO NE.

Burying the line could increase the costs of the project by up to $500 million, according to UI’s estimates. Critics, however, argue that the utility’s estimates are wildly inflated based on the costs of other recently completed underground transmission lines in the area.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80243/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6500-771x5781762271054.jpg?h=59e55433&itok=FimF9YnS,N,,2025-11-04 11:04:23.844490

Manufacturers are feeling the effects of more than $24 billion worth of renewable energy project cancellations this year.

The latest data, compiled by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker, shows $1.6 billion worth of cancellations in September after $7 billion in June alone. This affects major manufacturers and technology suppliers for electric vehicles, solar, wind, battery, storage and related components.

Among the most notable cancellations are major projects such as General Motors’ $4.3 billion plan to expand its electric pickup trucks facility in Michigan. The company recently reported a $1.6 billion impairment charge owing to the “termination of tax incentives for EV purchases,” referring to the $7,500 consumer credits which expired at the end of September.

Another major player, Toyota, canceled a $1.4 billion electric SUV facility in Indiana. In addition, Kore Power canceled plans for its $1.2 billion battery cell plant in Arizona after not receiving funds from an $850 million conditional U.S. Department of Energy loan.

All these project closures combined have affected an estimated 21,000 jobs this year, with more than 5,000 cuts in June and 3,000 in September.

These are not just temporary construction jobs, but long-term manufacturing positions to be filled once the facility becomes operational, said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2 and author of the Clean Jobs America report. These are “conservative numbers,” he added, because they exclude construction labor and many canceled projects never shared investment figures or job estimates when they were initially announced.

“The primary factor contributing to the billions of dollars in project cancellations this year is policy uncertainty caused by federal repeals,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.

Policy shift

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, rescinded several tax credits and incentive programs for renewable energy initiatives.

The new policy made many energy projects ineligible for incentives earlier offered by the Biden administration under the Inflation Reduction Act. This led projects that were built on and heavily dependent on this funding to be paused, postponed, canceled or moved offshore.

In September, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in grants for 223 projects across 16 states. The funding cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub, which could have created 200,000 jobs.

About $20 billion in renewable energy funding remained frozen as courts weighed whether the Trump administration can legally claw back funds already distributed through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar for All programs, said Fox Swim, senior solar industry researcher at Aurora Solar. Beneficiaries of the incentive programs filed suits against the U.S. EPA for terminating the program and a federal appeals court recently ruled that the funds can be taken back.

Elimination of EV tax credits, which made vehicles produced in the United States more affordable, could lead to a decline in sales and reduced investment in the sector, Timberlake said. Meanwhile, he said, “tax credits for batteries and geothermal will remain but are now riddled with complex new restrictions.”

There are also new foreign entities of concern restrictions for the 45X manufacturing tax credit, which was originally designed to encourage the domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components, including solar panels, wind parts, battery components, inverters and critical minerals. The restrictions will limit the ability of foreign companies to claim the tax credits and work on U.S.-based projects.

“This will make it harder to build new giga-factories and compete globally in battery, solar and wind manufacturing,” Timberlake said.

“In addition to these policy changes, the Trump administration’s imposing tariffs and barriers to clean energy deployment — for example, refusing to issue necessary permits — has complicated financing and building new projects, causing many projects to be canceled,” Orvis said.

Instead, the Trump administration is taking measures to promote the use of fossil fuels.

“The Trump administration has made no secret of its stance on renewable energy,” Swim said. “In its view, the U.S. power grid should rely primarily on coal, natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear.”

To enable this, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders early this year. The first, “Unleashing American Energy,” directs federal agencies to remove what it calls “unnecessary constraints” on domestic fossil fuel production and to review or rescind renewable energy incentives that “distort market competition.” The second, “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” aims to limit states’ authority to block or regulate fossil fuel infrastructure projects under environmental or climate-based criteria.

Experts say the new policies make it harder for renewable energy technology manufacturers to operate and expand. In many cases, manufacturers like GM and Toyota have shifted to fossil fuel-based projects in response to changes in government funding and incentives.

What’s next for the energy sector?

The canceled projects aren’t just affecting the involved companies, but also disincentivizing the entire energy sector, experts said.

“The uncertainty created by recent regulatory changes and political opposition will make companies more hesitant to commit future investments in the U.S. clean energy market,” Timberlake said.

Orvis said this could lead companies to prioritize countries with more favorable and stable policies.

Over the long term, Timberlake said this could result in “hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic growth, with global competitors gaining ground as the U.S. steps back from a leadership role in clean energy.”

In the short term, companies might accelerate plans to take advantage of 45Y and 48E tax credits that will expire by the end of 2027. But the long-term outlook is gloomier, according to Orvis, as hundreds more grants get canceled.

“Continued hostility towards clean energy deployment and manufacturing will almost certainly lead to further project cancellations,” he said.

The ripple effects will be felt much beyond the manufacturing industry as cancellations at this scale could lead to large electricity price increases, Timberlake said, adding that “much of the damage is already done” and it may be too late to reverse course.

“With energy demand surging due to AI, data centers and EV charging infrastructure, scaling back clean energy development will constrain supply, strain the grid and drive up prices for households and businesses alike,” he added. “In 2024, renewables accounted for more than 92% of new power generation — slowing or reversing that trend will leave the country paying more for less energy.”

He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front — especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules — cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again — leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

Regulation whiplash

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Key Takeaways

Trump’s deregulation push could cost drivers more. By weakening fuel efficiency and pollution rules, the administration is setting up consumers to spend more on gasoline and vehicle maintenance — the opposite of what Trump says he’s aiming for.

Automakers hate the whiplash. Constantly shifting climate rules — from Obama to Trump to Biden and back — have made it nearly impossible for car companies to plan, adding costs that get passed on to buyers.

Rolling back standards means locking in pricier, dirtier cars for longer. Energy analysts estimate households could spend an extra $310 billion on fuel by 2050 as efficiency progress stalls.

The US is falling behind. While Europe and China double down on electric vehicles, Trump’s policies discourage EV investment.

The big picture: Policies meant to “save money” are instead locking Americans into higher energy bills, costlier cars, and a slower transition to cleaner, cheaper technology.

Trump’s Transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect.

That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations — but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

How Trump’s policies are costing drivers more

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don’t have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance. Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won’t come out until 2030 — when someone else will be in the White House.

The US auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That’s why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond US shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the US and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.

Though car companies often grumble about the expenses and effort they have to expend when environmental regulations become stricter, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a much bigger nuisance. “These changes in regulations are really disruptive to the industry and are hurting our global economic competitiveness,” said Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. “It’s not only hurting in terms of setting us back with regard to decarbonization of the transportation sector, but the cost to consumers in the United States.”",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Vox_Cars_GettyImages-97219709.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:16.326766

Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.
According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation.
This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state's water fund during this year's legislative session.
Disclosure: Texas 2036, Texas Rural Water Association and Texas Water Foundation have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.","LUBBOCK — Two years ago, Texas voters overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Texas Water Fund with an initial $1 billion allotment to help the state get its water systems back on track. Since then, the state's leading water agency has allocated nearly a quarter of that money to rural towns, according to state data reviewed by The Texas Tribune.

More than 40 projects totaling nearly $223 million have been approved for fixing water storage tanks and water service lines, building new water wells, and improving drinking water systems, state data shows. That money, paired with money allocated for projects that prioritize creating new water supply through water conservation and water loss mitigation, a statewide public awareness program and more, means more than $735 million has been committed by the Texas Water Development Board.

The data, which the Tribune requested, comes on the eve of another election in which Texas lawmakers are asking voters to spend $20 billion in sales tax revenue over the next two decades to secure the state's water supply.

Texas' water supply has long been under duress. Critical infrastructure has aged beyond repair, causing it to fail. More people are moving to the Lone Star State every day, which has spurred water demand, especially in areas that are already running dry. And climate instability is compounding matters.

Proposition 4, the ballot question that would authorize spending $20 billion, is one of 17 constitutional amendments on this fall's ballot. Election Day is Tuesday. If it passes, at least 50% of the funds, and possibly more, would be used for creating new water supplies that expand the state's water portfolio, including projects involving desalination, water conservation, reuse, and aquifer storage. The other portion of the money would be used for water infrastructure needs. And there would be stronger legislative oversight by creating a committee to review how the board administers the fund.

Supporters of the proposition — including Gov. Greg Abbott, state lawmakers, and water advocacy groups — have argued the state needs the money to continue the work started in 2023. At the time, nearly 80% of voters approved what seemed like a good start to address the growing water needs that plagued every region of the state.

While the Texas Water Development Board is in the final stages of spending the first billion, some of those same supporters are calling for better tracking and transparency of how funds are being spent to ensure lawmakers and taxpayers are willing to make more money available in the future.

""There's going to be an option for a future Legislature to continue it or renew it,"" said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at Texas 2036. ""But in order for that to happen, there needs to be clear evidence that this funding stream has worked.""

Progress from the 2023 effort offers a look into the future if the $20 billion initiative is approved. In rural Texas specifically, the money has thrown a lifeline to communities struggling with inflation, supply chain issues and construction costs that make it impossible to make repairs on their own.

""This is not economically feasible otherwise,"" said Mary Alice Boehm-McKaughan, general counsel with the Texas Rural Water Association. ""These systems literally cannot afford to upgrade their system without access to these funds.""

The $1 billion tranche was more of a band-aid than a panacea, water experts said. At best, it helped clear a backlog of needs that had built up in recent years.

""That $1 billion injection was, in some ways, like if somebody has a wound and it's bleeding and you have to put a temporary stop on it,"" said Sarah Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation. ""All the programs are so oversubscribed that it's not like that was new money for new fun projects.""

Data obtained by the Tribune from the water board through a public records request shows the state has or will fund more than 40 projects. Most of those projects are in rural areas with fewer than 10,000 residents. Only six entities that serve a population between 10,001 and 150,000 residents were awarded grant dollars.

According to the data, these projects range from rehabbing water storage tanks and generators in the small town of Alba, in East Texas, and water service line and meter replacements in Benjamin, 130 miles east of Lubbock. The projects also include a new water well in Corrigan and Weimar, two towns with populations under 3,300 people, and drinking water system improvements in several towns, including Jefferson in far East Texas. Dozens of municipalities, including Matador and Paducah, two towns in the High Plains that both have less than 1,000 residents, were approved for water supply and distribution system improvements.

""Rural communities need this investment in critical infrastructure,"" said Kelty Garbee, executive director of Texas Rural Funders, a nonprofit that has championed the 2023 and 2025 constitutional amendments. ""Every dollar spent on water will deliver powerful results — repairing old systems, reducing waste, and keeping water affordable for Texas families and businesses.""

Clearer accounting wanted

There's rarely simple accounting in government. The $1 billion that voters approved in 2023 is no exception.

The water board received the money on Jan. 1, 2024, then took several months to plot a path with public input on how the money should be spent. In the summer of 2024, they put together a list of what programs they would like to make commitments to.

Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.

The board later solicited project applications from waste and wastewater systems in Texas. According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation. Of those forms, 46 received funding, all of which went toward water infrastructure needs.

About $45 million was allocated for entities with populations of 1,000 or less to receive 100% grant funding from the rural assistance fund. According to Boehm-McKaughan, the East Medina County Special Utility District was able to fix leaks in more than a mile of water line thanks to that grant money.

""The good news here is that the board is prudently and rationally executing its due diligence,"" Mazur said. ""And doing what it needs to do to get money out the door in an appropriate manner.""

The board does not have a clear indication on how funds have been spent so far on their website, or for what projects. This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state's water fund during this year's legislative session.

Perry Fowler, executive director of the Texas Water Infrastructure Network, said the water board is under a lot of pressure to get the money out, but it also must vet projects to ensure tax dollars are used correctly.

""There probably are ways they could help demonstrate how money is being spent and when and where a little better,"" Fowler said. ""But I don't think they're being irresponsible.""

Senate Bill 7, which spells out in part how the $20 billion for water is to be spent, will add more oversight and require the water board to report on how the state is providing financial assistance and the progress being made toward addressing water infrastructure challenges.

Mazur said that moving forward, it would be helpful to have a clear description of the benefits to the communities when projects are completed.

""I think it's going to be important for the board to start telling a story with these projects when they're completed and what the actual tangible benefit will be to the communities they serve,"" Mazur said.

Fowler agreed that more transparency is important. However, he said the public should be more concerned about the volume of projects the board is able to approve.

""As great as this billion is, and if we're going to get it every year, it's never going to be enough,"" Fowler said. ""We're probably going to have to have additional appropriations because what we're seeing is we're not able to meet the demand we have.""

A Texas 2036 report estimates the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure — an estimate that does not include money for projects that create new water supply.

By the water board's own estimates in the state's 2022 water plan, towns and cities could be on a path toward a severe shortage of water by 2030. This would happen if there are recurring, record-breaking drought conditions across the state, and if water entities and state leaders fail to put in place key strategies to secure water supplies.

""I don't think we're going to end up with a scenario where there's just money sitting around not being used,"" Schlessinger said. ""My gut says that $1 billion doesn’t get anywhere close to meeting the amount of project funding needs there are.""

The new policy made many energy projects ineligible for incentives earlier offered by the Biden administration under the Inflation Reduction Act.
“The Trump administration has made no secret of its stance on renewable energy,” Swim said.
Experts say the new policies make it harder for renewable energy technology manufacturers to operate and expand.
“Continued hostility towards clean energy deployment and manufacturing will almost certainly lead to further project cancellations,” he said.","Manufacturers are feeling the effects of more than $24 billion worth of renewable energy project cancellations this year.

The latest data, compiled by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker, shows $1.6 billion worth of cancellations in September after $7 billion in June alone. This affects major manufacturers and technology suppliers for electric vehicles, solar, wind, battery, storage and related components.

Among the most notable cancellations are major projects such as General Motors’ $4.3 billion plan to expand its electric pickup trucks facility in Michigan. The company recently reported a $1.6 billion impairment charge owing to the “termination of tax incentives for EV purchases,” referring to the $7,500 consumer credits which expired at the end of September.

Another major player, Toyota, canceled a $1.4 billion electric SUV facility in Indiana. In addition, Kore Power canceled plans for its $1.2 billion battery cell plant in Arizona after not receiving funds from an $850 million conditional U.S. Department of Energy loan.

All these project closures combined have affected an estimated 21,000 jobs this year, with more than 5,000 cuts in June and 3,000 in September.

These are not just temporary construction jobs, but long-term manufacturing positions to be filled once the facility becomes operational, said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2 and author of the Clean Jobs America report. These are “conservative numbers,” he added, because they exclude construction labor and many canceled projects never shared investment figures or job estimates when they were initially announced.

“The primary factor contributing to the billions of dollars in project cancellations this year is policy uncertainty caused by federal repeals,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.

Policy shift

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, rescinded several tax credits and incentive programs for renewable energy initiatives.

The new policy made many energy projects ineligible for incentives earlier offered by the Biden administration under the Inflation Reduction Act. This led projects that were built on and heavily dependent on this funding to be paused, postponed, canceled or moved offshore.

In September, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in grants for 223 projects across 16 states. The funding cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub, which could have created 200,000 jobs.

About $20 billion in renewable energy funding remained frozen as courts weighed whether the Trump administration can legally claw back funds already distributed through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar for All programs, said Fox Swim, senior solar industry researcher at Aurora Solar. Beneficiaries of the incentive programs filed suits against the U.S. EPA for terminating the program and a federal appeals court recently ruled that the funds can be taken back.

Elimination of EV tax credits, which made vehicles produced in the United States more affordable, could lead to a decline in sales and reduced investment in the sector, Timberlake said. Meanwhile, he said, “tax credits for batteries and geothermal will remain but are now riddled with complex new restrictions.”

There are also new foreign entities of concern restrictions for the 45X manufacturing tax credit, which was originally designed to encourage the domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components, including solar panels, wind parts, battery components, inverters and critical minerals. The restrictions will limit the ability of foreign companies to claim the tax credits and work on U.S.-based projects.

“This will make it harder to build new giga-factories and compete globally in battery, solar and wind manufacturing,” Timberlake said.

“In addition to these policy changes, the Trump administration’s imposing tariffs and barriers to clean energy deployment — for example, refusing to issue necessary permits — has complicated financing and building new projects, causing many projects to be canceled,” Orvis said.

Instead, the Trump administration is taking measures to promote the use of fossil fuels.

“The Trump administration has made no secret of its stance on renewable energy,” Swim said. “In its view, the U.S. power grid should rely primarily on coal, natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear.”

To enable this, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders early this year. The first, “Unleashing American Energy,” directs federal agencies to remove what it calls “unnecessary constraints” on domestic fossil fuel production and to review or rescind renewable energy incentives that “distort market competition.” The second, “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” aims to limit states’ authority to block or regulate fossil fuel infrastructure projects under environmental or climate-based criteria.

Experts say the new policies make it harder for renewable energy technology manufacturers to operate and expand. In many cases, manufacturers like GM and Toyota have shifted to fossil fuel-based projects in response to changes in government funding and incentives.

What’s next for the energy sector?

The canceled projects aren’t just affecting the involved companies, but also disincentivizing the entire energy sector, experts said.

“The uncertainty created by recent regulatory changes and political opposition will make companies more hesitant to commit future investments in the U.S. clean energy market,” Timberlake said.

Orvis said this could lead companies to prioritize countries with more favorable and stable policies.

Over the long term, Timberlake said this could result in “hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic growth, with global competitors gaining ground as the U.S. steps back from a leadership role in clean energy.”

In the short term, companies might accelerate plans to take advantage of 45Y and 48E tax credits that will expire by the end of 2027. But the long-term outlook is gloomier, according to Orvis, as hundreds more grants get canceled.

“Continued hostility towards clean energy deployment and manufacturing will almost certainly lead to further project cancellations,” he said.

The ripple effects will be felt much beyond the manufacturing industry as cancellations at this scale could lead to large electricity price increases, Timberlake said, adding that “much of the damage is already done” and it may be too late to reverse course.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gk1hbdP9NFoKPfUtYjgIuMD6_XpaStFGe3kSfBBPRCc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjM2NjI2MDU3X0VqV05ZbkMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:01.645306

New data from SEIA shows that the entire solar supply chain has been reshored and U.S. manufacturing capacity has grown across every segment of the solar and storage supply chain.

So far in 2025, 65 new or expanded solar and storage facilities have come online, totaling some $4.5 billion in private investment. However, SEIA points out that more than 100 factories and over $31 billion in the pipeline could be at risk if the Trump administration continues its attacks on solar energy.

This year, U.S. manufacturing capacity has increased across every major segment of the solar and storage supply chain, according to SEIA’s Solar & Storage Supply Chain Dashboard. As of October 2025, the United States has surpassed 60 gigawatts (GW) of domestic solar module production capacity, a 37 percent increase from December 2024.

Further, U.S. solar cell production capacity has more than tripled this year, rising from 1 GW to 3.2 GW. In addition, battery cell manufacturing for stationary electricity storage applications has risen to over 21 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

“This growth is a testament to the power of American innovation,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA, said. “We’re building factories, hiring American workers, and showing that solar energy means made-in-America energy.”

Also, U.S. manufacturing of inverters, which converts electricity produced by solar into usable power, has grown by nearly 50 percent since the end of last year, with capacity surging from 19 GW to 28 GW. Additionally, U.S. mounting system manufacturing has increased 14 percent and added 23 new factories.

However, Trump Administration policies, regulations, and trade actions which have contributed to industry uncertainty could stall this progress and reduce demand for the products made by American solar and storage manufacturers.

“We’re seeing strong growth today, but that momentum isn’t guaranteed. If the administration continues down this path, they risk driving investment overseas, stifling job creation, raising costs on consumers, and handing America’s manufacturing advantage to our competitors,” Hopper said. “This industry has proven what’s possible when businesses have the certainty to invest. If the administration does not reverse their harmful actions that have undermined market certainty, energy costs will rise even further, and the next wave of factories and jobs could be at risk.”",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1696361656.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 12:12:53.477044

MCCALLA — Mary Rosenboom is fed up.

Like 1.5 million other Alabamians, Rosenboom is forced to pay ever-increasing electricity prices set by Alabama Power and approved by the state’s Public Service Commission. Each month, Rosenboom forks over hundreds of dollars to the utility—and a massive hyperscale data center proposed near her home, she fears, will make the situation even worse.

Her electricity costs are already a huge financial burden. Rosenboom, who works as a sales professional, said she chooses not to run her air conditioner during much of the day to prevent an untenable power bill. Even that isn’t enough. Often, Rosenboom said she must turn to high-interest credit cards to keep the lights on.

“I’m robbing Peter to pay Paul,” she told Inside Climate News. “It makes me sick.”

Rosenboom’s plight isn’t unique.

Inside Climate News examined the 2024 federal filings of 100 of the largest electric utilities in the country.

None reported higher total residential electric bills, on average, than Alabama Power.

Because Alabama is one of the poorest states in the nation, that hits especially hard. Electricity customers here are among the most financially burdened in the nation, the U.S. Department of Energy found. And an analysis by think tank RMI showed that among households with extremely low incomes, Alabamians pay nearly a quarter of their earnings for electricity—the highest percentage in the country.

So why are power bills so high?

Experts point to lax regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which is charged with regulating Alabama Power and overseeing any large spending or rate increases proposed by the utility.

Robert Blanton, chair of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has been digging into the mechanisms that allow Alabama Power to earn record profits in such an impoverished state.

Ultimately, he said, there’s strong evidence that Alabama Power has effectively “captured” its regulator, the PSC. Academics use the concept of regulatory capture to describe a situation in which regulators are more beholden to the entities they are charged with regulating than the public they represent.

The commission conducts much of its regulation of Alabama Power behind closed doors, with little to no access for the public or outside interest groups. It has consistently granted Alabama Power unusually high profit margins. The company’s return on equity was 11 percent in 2023, according to a utility analysis by financial firm S&P Global.

That’s down slightly from the company’s historical average of around 13 percent, but still among the highest of any utility in the country. Nationwide, the average rate of return approved for electric utilities in 2024 rate cases was 9.74 percent, according to S&P.

“I don’t think there’s a single utility in the country that would be upset with an 11 percent earned ROE,” said Kent Chandler, former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, now a senior fellow in energy and environmental policy for the R Street Institute. “I mean, that’s like double what I know some utilities are actually earning.”

Meanwhile, Alabama Power and its parent, Southern Co., have boasted about their record profits. “Every quarter for 78 consecutive years, Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter,” the company said in a July press release.

In a statement, representatives for Alabama Power said the company’s rates were fair and its reliability was among the best in the nation. The company pointed to high per capita electricity usage in the state, the seventh-highest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the third-highest residential usage. The company said that its residential rate, not the total bill, is a more appropriate way to evaluate the company’s affordability.

“On those price-based measures—paired with our industry-leading reliability—Alabama Power’s residential service is fairly priced under PSC oversight,” the company said.

Alabama Power’s average residential rate last year was 16.77 cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than the national average of 16.48 cents and 35th highest out of 100 utilities examined by Inside Climate News.

But the national average includes places like Hawaii, Connecticut and Southern California, which are all among the top 10 states for median household income. Shipping fuel oil to Hawaii and wildfire prevention in California are also huge costs that don’t apply in Alabama.

Alabama Power’s combination of above-average rates with top-five usage yielded the highest total residential bills in the nation last year. Other states with similar or greater usage feature lower rates. One reason Alabama’s usage is so high: nearly 70 percent of Alabamians use electric heat, as opposed to natural gas, thanks in part to incentives offered by Alabama Power.

Louisiana, which has the highest per capita residential electricity use in the nation, has electric rates that averaged 11.64 cents/kWh in 2024, about 30 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rate. The average Alabama Power residential customer used 1,129 kWh of electricity per month last year, at a cost of about $189. A customer using the same amount of electricity in Louisiana would have paid $58 less every month. Those figures do not include state or local taxes, so the actual bills are even higher.

Average residential rates in the states bordering Alabama—Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida—are 15 to 25 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rates.

Alabama Power’s rates are also well above those of other providers in the state—46 percent higher than the average rate last year charged by Huntsville Utilities, which serves almost 200,000 residential customers in north Alabama.

The R Street Institute, the think tank where Chandler now works, gave Alabama an “F” in its ranking of electricity competition—how much choice consumers have about where their power comes from. No other state received such a bad grade.

The group only considered investor-owned utility companies in its rankings, and Alabama Power is the only such company in Alabama.

Alabama Power also charges about 16 percent more than Mississippi Power and about 8 percent more than Georgia Power, the other two utilities owned by its parent company, Southern Co.

The difference, at least in part, is that Alabama Power’s rates are driven up by the company’s ever-increasing profits.

The company reported a $1.4 billion profit in 2024, almost double the $712 million it earned in 2013, the year the PSC changed its formula for measuring Alabama Power’s profits. The company’s book value—its assets minus debt—more than doubled over that span, going from $5.5 billion to $13 billion.

Alabama Power said the increase in equity is driven by investments made to improve the system. “Growth in book equity primarily mirrors system investment—storm hardening, cyber and physical security, as well as transmission and distribution upgrades, along with other investments driven by reliability and compliance,” the company said.

Almost no public participation

In virtually all states with regulated utilities, rate cases force the company to justify its proposed increases in a public forum, providing sworn, expert testimony and allowing outside groups to challenge the projections and assertions made by the power company. Not in Alabama.

The PSC hasn’t conducted a formal rate case related to Alabama Power since 1982, more than four decades ago.

“There are no courtroom-style hearings on Alabama Power’s long-term energy planning or how those plans impact customers’ bills,” said Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Alabama office. “These types of proceedings are routine in other states. When the public can participate, we believe they’re better informed about how this process impacts their lives.”

Chandler, the former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said that while rate cases can be tedious, they are valuable to the public.

“One of the benefits of having rate cases is that you get a holistic look at a utility’s revenues and a utility’s costs,” Chandler said. “In my experience in Kentucky, consumers benefit from having periodic reviews by an objective regulator.”

And since regulated utilities earn profits on all their approved spending, the more they spend, the more they earn, he said.

“They have an incentive to over-invest,” Chandler said. “And if you never check things after the fact, then you’re just writing them a blank check.”

Wall Street has taken notice. A 2024 report by S&P Global put Alabama in a tier of its own atop the rankings in its State Regulatory Evaluations, examining the likelihood that state regulators might decrease or limit a utility’s profits. The report found no other state where a utility’s profits were as safe as in Alabama.

The last PSC commissioner to advocate for formal rate hearings for Alabama Power—Terry Dunn in 2013—was promptly voted out of office in the next election. Dunn, a self-described conservative Republican, faced a curious and largely anonymous campaign linking him to environmental groups.

Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, the former PSC president, described Dunn’s efforts to initiate formal reviews of Alabama Power as a “full frontal assault” by “extremist groups” and their “fancy San Francisco environmental lawyers.”

Dunn, who died last year, called the efforts “a smear campaign orchestrated against a Republican by fellow Republicans,” in a letter to the state party in 2013.

Later that year, about 10 people staged what many believe to be a faked environmental protest on the front steps of the PSC building. The protesters, wearing blue surgical masks and other items obscuring their identities, bore signs with slogans such as “Environmentalists [heart] Dunn,” and “Save the Warrior,” likely a reference to the Black Warrior River, which runs through Tuscaloosa. Representatives of environmental groups who were there to attend a meeting said they had no idea who the people were.

Ultimately, Dunn was defeated in the 2014 Republican primary by Chris “Chip” Beeker Jr., a cattle and catfish farm operator and former county commissioner in rural Greene County—a county whose largest employer was an Alabama Power plant. Beeker had help. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, whose lobbying firm represented Alabama Power’s parent company, organized a fundraiser for Beeker in 2013.

Beeker stepped down from the commission partway through his term last year, citing health issues. His son, Chris Beeker III, filled his seat after being appointed by Gov. Kay Ivey.

The PSC’s new president, Cynthia Lee Almond, has said transparency will be one of her priorities. But PSC staff would not make her or other commissioners available for an interview to discuss the absence of rate hearings or the public’s limited role in PSC affairs. Instead, the PSC’s press office provided written responses to questions.

When reporters reach out to the agency seeking information, the answers come with this warning:

“All verbal and/or written responses provided by the staff of the Alabama Public Service Commission (“APSC”) are for informational purposes only and may not be the subject of quotation(s) attributed to staff in any public medium without the express permission of the APSC.”

A profitable change

A turning point for Alabama Power’s profits came in 2013. That’s the year Alabama state regulators changed the way they measure Alabama Power’s returns, switching from the industry standard return on equity metric to a formula they created, called weighted retail return on common equity.

The weighted return rate rewards Alabama Power for having higher ratios of equity to debt. The idea was that by incentivizing company officials to carry a greater percentage of equity as opposed to debt, they would secure higher credit ratings and be able to borrow money under better terms, decreasing overall costs.

At the time, commissioners and the company said they expected electric rates to go down as a result.

“I will tell you as you see adjustments over the next few years, you are going to see a decrease,” then-PSC President Cavanaugh said.

That didn’t happen.

Instead, the company benefited from the change far more than its customers did.

Alabama Power’s electric rates have risen 45 percent across all customer groups since the novel rate formula went into effect. That’s far more than the national average, which increased 29 percent over the same span.

Meanwhile, the company’s profit nearly doubled, despite producing less electricity today than it did in 2013.

Since Alabama Power earns a return on all of its equity, having more power plants and infrastructure in place increases its profitability. The company also earns bonuses under the rate structure for maintaining positive credit ratings by financial agencies and for having a greater than 50 percent ratio of equity to debt.

The PSC, in a written statement, denied that its switch to weighted common equity was driving Alabama Power’s increased profitability.

“With regard to your analysis of public documents, which reflect the financial position of Alabama Power, please be advised there is no correlation between Alabama Power’s current financial position and the implementation of the weighted retail return on average common equality mechanism in 2013,” a commission representative told Inside Climate News.

Instead, the PSC said the increased net income was the result of Alabama Power’s “significant capital investments to modernize its systems,” which were approved by the PSC.

“If that’s not regulatory capture . . .”

Blanton, the political science professor at UAB, sees the absence of rate-making cases, the nation’s highest electricity rates and Alabama’s record profits as unmistakable signs that Alabama’s PSC has been captured by the company it regulates.

He points to three ways regulatory capture manifests itself in Alabama.

“One is campaign finance, the ability of the regulated industry to financially contribute towards the campaigns of regulatory bodies,” he said.

A 2024 analysis by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom, showed that of the states that elect the members of their utility regulator, Alabama tops the list of those receiving the most campaign finance cash from fossil fuel-linked interests.

Fifty-five percent of political donations to Alabama public service commissioners above $250 from 2013 to 2023 came from fossil-fuel interests, the analysis concluded.

“You don’t have to have a conspiratorial mindset to figure out that gives these donors leverage—if they’re the ones that are financing the campaigns of the people they’re supposed to be regulating,” Blanton said of such contributions.

Part of the problem, Blanton said, is that Alabama is one of 10 states that directly elects its utility commissioners. PSC commissioners say they don’t accept money directly from the utilities they regulate, but lax campaign finance laws provide ample opportunity for influencing regulators, Blanton said.

An examination of “information flows” in the state also points toward capture, he said. There’s a general opacity and complexity around the information involved and a relative dominance of the industry as the primary source for information for the regulators, according to Blanton.

The third aspect of regulatory capture is “cultural capture,” Blanton said, a concept that alludes to the extent to which industry and regulators share similar worldviews or perspectives.

“The key is whether or not regulators are likely to unquestioningly accept evidence and opinions put forth by the industry, and the extent to which regulators accept information from outside sources,” Blanton said.

Looking at these three lines of evidence, Blanton said there are some clear takeaways about where Alabama finds itself—captured.

“There’s no objective reason why Alabama should be an outlier. We’re not hotter than Texas. We don’t have worse conditions than Louisiana,” he said. “There’s just nothing that makes sense. … Any reasonable person, looking through the data, looking through the evidence, will say, ‘We have a situation that’s, if that’s not regulatory capture, I don’t know what is.’”

Data center angst

Inside Climate News interviewed more than a dozen Alabama Power customers for this story, and each shared the concerns voiced by Mary Rosenboom, the customer who lives near the proposed hyperscale data center—rising energy costs, a lack of transparency and fear about what the future may hold.

Rosenboom and others worry that construction and operation of power-hungry data centers will drive their electricity costs even higher.

“I know that’s what’s coming,” Rosenboom said. “And it’ll be us that foot the bill. It’s not good for the citizens. It’s good for Alabama Power’s pocketbook.”

Alabama Power and the PSC both insist that data center costs will not be passed on to other customers. But they also declined to say whether those agreements with data centers will be made public, making it impossible to verify those claims.

In a statement, a representative for the company said that it takes a “disciplined approach” to engaging with potential data center customers.

“We understand that budgets are tight, and affordability is central to our mission. That is why we work hard to connect customers with offerings like Budget Billing, payment plans, efficiency tools, and assistance programs,” the company’s response said.

Data centers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” the company said. “We work with the Alabama Public Service Commission to approve large-load customer contracts and any needed operational investments, ensuring a thorough process that validates needs and protects customers.”

Alabama Power declined to provide a list of planned data center projects and their anticipated electricity demand.

“Long-term capacity planning is reviewed with the PSC,” the company responded. “We don’t publish speculative load projections for individual customer classes or projects. Any major resource additions follow established processes to ensure reliability and fairness for all customers.”

Regulatory interactions involving Alabama Power and the PSC are often similarly opaque.

During depositions involving Alabama Power’s request to purchase a natural gas plant earlier this year, lawyers for environmental groups questioned company management about data centers and their anticipated loads.

The company’s representatives were often vague in their answers, though they did admit that data centers are the “primary driver” of increased load projections. When company lawyers did provide substantive information about specific load figures, their answers were redacted in PSC transcripts.

“I’ll say that some projects fall off of this list and some projects are added to this list and the net change is [redacted] megawatts,” Alabama Power forecasting manager Maria Burke said in a deposition. “They have a mixed answer because in the previous forecast I would say we only had [redacted] megawatts to data centers and in this forecast we have [redacted]. So the delta is [redacted].”

If built to capacity, a proposed data center campus in Bessemer, just southwest of Birmingham near Rosenboom’s home in McCalla, is expected to consume as much as 1,200 megawatts of electricity, running every hour, 24 hours a day, according to estimates provided to residents. That amount of energy is about 10 times the usage of all residences in nearby Birmingham or around 90 times the usage of all residences in Bessemer.

In one fell swoop, it could increase Alabama Power’s total demand across the state by around 10 percent.

“My power bill’s already not affordable,” said Brenda Small, who lives in a trailer park adjacent to the site of the proposed data center. “I had one bill that was $495. No one can afford that.”

Reliant on fossil fuels

Alabama Power’s electricity is not only expensive, it’s dirty and comes with a heavy environmental footprint.

The PSC has approved costly upgrades to old coal-fired power plants, allowing Alabama Power to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to delay their retirements by only a few years. The PSC greenlit massive natural gas additions in 2020, 2022 and 2025, making Alabama Power increasingly reliant on fossil fuels for decades to come and its customers vulnerable to price spikes in natural gas and supply shortages in times of heavy energy use.

Its coal-fired power plant near Birmingham, the James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant, has been the nation’s largest single source of greenhouse gases for nine years running. The company charges hefty fees to customers who install solar panels, smothering the small-scale renewable market. Alabama ranks second to last among states in energy efficiency efforts in a recent scorecard, and upgrades to its old and expensive coal plants seem destined to continue as electricity demand rises due to large data centers.

The company has also stuck to its guns on plans to leave nearly 77 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash in unlined ponds along Alabama’s rivers, leaching contaminants into the groundwater indefinitely, even as other utilities in the South have agreed to dig out some or all of their ash ponds.

And this environmental record, UAB’s Blanton said, has come under the watch of state regulators, who have minimized the effects of climate change and Alabama Power’s pollution.

A new profit formula review — with no public input

When adopting the 2013 profit formula, called Rate Stabilization and Equalization, or RSE, the commission agreed to review its performance every six years. The first review was conducted in 2019, with no changes made to the rate structure.

In its responses to Inside Climate News, the commission said the second review has already begun—with no public input—through a series of closed-door meetings with Alabama Power and the state attorney general’s office.

Whether outside experts or concerned members of the public will be provided an opportunity to weigh in on the review will only be decided after the commission’s staff has made its findings, the PSC statement said.

Tidwell, the Southern Environmental Law Center attorney, said public participation should be essential in utility regulation.

“Alabama Power customers who are impacted by the PSC’s decisions deserve to have a say in the process,” Tidwell said. “The Public Service Commission is tasked with ensuring that rates are just and reasonable not just for Alabama Power, but also for the public. … How can you protect customers’ best interests when there are almost no avenues for them to participate in the process?”

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015.","Brussels — The European Union is attempting to forge new climate goals on Tuesday before the U.N. climate talks in Brazil starting next week.

Ministers from across the 27-nation bloc are meeting in Brussels to try and get at least 15 to align their nationally-determined emissions targets in order to have a stronger negotiating position during the COP30 summit in Belém.

“We need to show to the world that we are leaders in climate change. We need to deliver adequate signals for investors. Today’s the day,"" Spanish climate minister Sara Aagesen said before the meeting.

The EU's long-held leadership of action on climate is under threat by domestic and international pressure.

Wildfires, heat waves, and floods have disrupted life across Europe, spurring calls for more climate action. But crises like Russia's war in Ukraine, and a newly volatile relationship with the United States, have increased political and economic pressure to curtail flagship environmental policies.

A recent weakening of a deforestation law by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, disturbed environmentalists. They worried that it signaled a deeper disenchantment with green priorities by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In February, she had announced an economic policy that some said eroded her 2019 Green Deal. But von der Leyen said in September that “the world can count on Europe’s climate leadership” and pledged that the EU is “on our way to climate neutrality” and would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040.

She has linked climate investment to sovreignty and defense, arguing that a self-reliant Europe can better face threats like disruptive tariffs or export controls, armed conflict and environmental disasters.

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some see climate regulations as shackling the economy, while others say Europe will either make and sell renewables or be forced to buy energy or green products from countries like China.

Wopke Hoekstra, the EU's climate commissioner, said that the bloc needed to “bridge climate action with competitiveness and industrial savviness, if you will, and independence that is going to be the name of the game in the years that we have ahead of us.”

“We’ll do our utmost to be successful, but it takes 27 to tango,” he said of the negotiations on Tuesday.

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals has rattled Europe, whose climate vision was in part forged in partnership with the Democratic administrations of U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Joseph Biden.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

The EU's commitments in Paris have driven investment in renewable energies and electric vehicles, often in cooperation and at odds with Chinese companies. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a height not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, according to the U.N. weather agency.

Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. The heat has been linked to more intense rains and floods, and the report predicts rainfall decline and more severe droughts in southern Europe.

“Today is about the level of ambition, and it’s about standing ground and not only sticking to talking the talk when it is easy, but also walking the walk when it becomes difficult,” Swedish climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari said in Brussels.

It’s no secret that Ford has postponed several new electric models, but it has done so to fast-track its revolutionary new platform, which does away with the traditional assembly line. In the new system, the rear, center and front sections of the vehicle are assembled on separate lines and then joined together toward the end. The company, which stands by its 2027 reveal deadline, says this new method saves a lot of money and makes manufacturing faster.

As for the batteries that will power the new Maverick-sized pickup, the entry-level version is poised to get LFP cells instead of the more traditional nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) type. LFP batteries are cheaper to make and can withstand full charging cycles more often, but they offer less energy density compared to a similarly-sized NMC pack. Whatever the chemistry, though, the carmaker made it clear that the batteries will run at 400 volts, and not 800 volts.

Ford hasn’t revealed exact numbers yet, but it mentioned that it’s aiming for a battery that’s 15% smaller than that of the Chinese-made BYD Atto electric crossover, which would mean a capacity of around 51 kilowatt-hours. That’s not a lot by modern standards, but if the company manages to keep the weight down, the secretive new EV could have just enough range for most people.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/W8qOvq/s1/a-teaser-of-ford-s-30-000-electric-pickup.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 08:57:40.844607

The electric-vehicle maker, which reports only global quarterly figures, delivered 4,078 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter.

Motor Intelligence‘s US estimates for the period totaled 2,793 units, based on monthly tallies of 890 in July, 993 in August and 910 in September.

This indicates that Lucid‘s total US deliveries for the third quarter would be at 2,793 vehicles. Last month, the brand reported 4,078 vehicles delivered globally during the same period.

October figures represent a 40% jump year over year, from 670 vehicles, and a slight 3% increase from September, by 25 units.

Sequential Growth Despite EV Credit Expiry

The numbers contradict the overall tendency of a sales slowdown after the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30.

After a new record with third quarter deliveries, Tesla saw its registrations tumble 31% sequentially and 24% year over year, according to the platform.

The Elon Musk-led company sold 40,650 vehicles in October, about 18,000 units below September.

Detroit automaker Ford lost 60% of electric vehicle sales from September to October, and 25% from a year ago.

Lucid and Rivian (whose registrations declined sequentially but increased year over year) were less affected by the expiration of the federal EV tax credit than other automakers.

Both companies offer vehicles that were priced above the program’s eligibility thresholds.

The Lucid Air starts at $70,900, exceeding the $55,000 cap for sedans, while the Gravity (in its Grand Touring trim, the only version available at the time) starts at $94,900, well above the $80,000 cap for trucks and SUVs.

Because these price caps did not apply to leased vehicles, both California-based EV makers relied on leasing to enable customers to benefit from the incentive.

Lucid Offers

In addition, Lucid started offering in 2023 a $7,500 credit on Lucid Air purchases through financing, to offset the lack of federal credit eligibility.

The offer has been extended after the federal credit expired, and has been renewed until November 30, according to its website.

The company also set a 0.99% APR on customers buying the sedan.

The company currently features several Gravity units in its inventory, across multiple US states. Prices start from $96,550.

According to Nick Twork, Lucid’s Head of Global Communications, the listings weren’t linked to demand but reflected efforts to assemble small batches around parts availability and align them with existing orders.

Production Ramp-up

The EV maker is targeting production of 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles in 2025, a target that was revised to include a lower-end in August.

Considering that Lucid produced 9,966 vehicles between January 1 and September 30, it must produce between 8,034 and 10,034 vehicles in the final three months of the year to stay within the guidance.

Production is ramping up, with a second shift having recently started operating in its Arizona plant, as exclusively reported by EV.

The company will disclose its third-quarter earnings results on Tuesday (November 4), after market close.

On Monday, Lucid’s stock closed 6.3% down at $16.64.",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lucid_Motors___GravityX1.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:32.593610

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

Article content

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

Article content

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

Happy Eco News reported that a team from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University has developed a cell that can convert more than 36% of LED light into energy. It's a fascinating breakthrough that could help to power electronics, sensors, and health monitors — negating the need for batteries in certain scenarios.

""The implications of this development go far beyond convenience. These solar panels can help reduce electronic waste by replacing batteries in millions of devices that would otherwise require frequent replacement or recharging,"" Happy Eco News' Cyrene Oraya Reyes wrote.

The team is working with perovskite, a promising material that can turn light into electricity with astounding efficiencies when incorporated into panels. But short lifespans have been a significant hurdle. Solar Magazine reported that perovskite panels can last a couple of years, compared to 30-plus years for common silicon panels.

The cells needed some molecular tuning, particularly in the bonding agents, to achieve suitable charge transport in the wide-bandgap units. Additives also bind with unwanted ions, helping with longevity issues, per Happy Eco News.

It's a ""promising passivation strategy for the development of high-performance"" indoor light catchers, the experts wrote in the study.

It's an interesting take on renewable energy, often characterized by large wind turbines and massive solar farms. But experts are working on devices that can make energy from low wind speeds and dim or indoor light. University College London is also working on cells that capture artificial illumination.

It's all helping to limit demand for electricity from dirty power sources that produce heat-trapping air pollution, linked by the American Lung Association to respiratory and other health risks.

All of our devices suck up loads of electricity. In fact, unplugging energy vampires, such as unused chargers, can save you $165 a year. Reducing the number of gadgets that need to be plugged in to begin with can solve much of the problem.

It's important because energy prices have been rising faster than inflation, according to NPR. Goldman Sachs expects the growth of data centers to suck up 165% more electricity by 2030, straining the grid.

Household solar is one of the best protections against uncontrollable rate hikes. The free solar energy can be stored in batteries, offering blackout protection, or sold back to the grid for a profit when part of a virtual power plant. EnergySage can help you compare quotes, find a timely installer, and lock in federal tax breaks before they expire. The resource can save you up to $10,000 on upfront costs.

In Taiwan, replacing batteries with light-based energy can also help limit environmental risks. When improperly disposed of, lithium-ion batteries are a toxic hazard, according to the University of Texas, Dallas.

Happy Eco News reported that the team still has some work to do to boost efficiency in low-lit settings, but the progress is promising.

The pair has, as of this month, become a trio, with Samsung SDI joining to help with the validation and development of the ASSB tech in the automotive sector.

To date, the latest milestone is the integration of Solid Power’s large-format pure ASSB cells into a BMW i7 technology test vehicle.

A solid state journey

Under the new agreement, Solid Power is set to supply sulphide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI.

After receiving the electrolytes, Samsung SDI aims to integrate these into the separator and/or the catholyte and use this to build cells – each case is subject to achievement of technical requirements.

Once the cells have been created, they will be evaluated based on performance parameters and requirements to be agreed between Samsung SDI and BMW.

“We are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries,” says John Van Scoter, President and CEO of Solid Power.

“Our solid electrolyte technology is designed for stability and conductivity and by working closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.”

The overall aim is to integrate ASSB cells into a next generation of evaluation vehicles.

Partnering for ASSB tech

The collaboration is changing the game of the automotive sector, especially since “the partners believe in the potential of genuine ASSB technology and the promise of higher energy density combined with increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials”, according to BMW in its press release.

As energy density increases, so can longer vehicle range, with the possibility of disregarding potential disadvantages when it comes to storage system weight.

""Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately lead to innovation in electric vehicles,"" says Stella Joo-Young Go, Executive Vice President of ASSB Commercialisation Team at Samsung SDI.

""Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercialising ASSB.""

Partnering for a decade

BMW and Solid Power have been cooperating since 2016 via an extended “Joint Development Agreement”, supporting BMW’s investment in Solid Power in May 2021 as part of its financing round.

At the end of 2022, BMW and Solid Power agreed to further deepen their partnership, allowing BMW to operate a solid-state cell prototype line at CMCC in Parsdorf – on the basis of a research and development licence and with Solid Power’s experience and expertise.

Since 2008, BMW has been building up competence in the battery cell technology field and since 2019, this has been pooled at BMW’s Battery Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in Munich.

Citing South Africa’s new Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM), the report describes a model Nigeria could adapt.
“SAREM exemplifies a comprehensive industrial policy framework aimed at localising renewable energy value chains, fostering inclusive economic growth, and facilitating a just energy transition,” the document explains.
Between 2014 and 2024, South Africa imported over R180 billion (about $10 billion) worth of renewable energy materials.
“SAREM aims to address this by promoting the establishment of industrial hubs and Special Economic Zones focused on renewable energy,” the report noted.","As the global energy transition accelerates, Africa, especially Nigeria, stands at a pivotal crossroads. The continent, long known for its wealth of natural resources, now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to convert that endowment into economic power, by building local industries for renewable energy and clean technologies.

A new report by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), “Fostering Industrial Hubs for Energy Transition Technologies in Africa”, highlights how Africa can harness this global shift to achieve inclusive industrialisation, job creation, and sustainable growth.

Drawing on lessons from G20 nations, the report outlined a roadmap for building energy-transition industrial hubs that can transform the continent’s economic landscape.

For Nigeria, the continent’s largest economy, the report signals both urgency and opportunity. With deliberate policy action, the country can transform from an importer of energy technologies into a regional producer, capturing value, creating jobs, and positioning itself at the heart of Africa’s clean energy future.

“Climate action and industrialisation must go hand in hand”

The SEforALL report situates Africa’s green industrialisation within a global context of shifting trade and technology. It noted that in 2024, G20 countries traded over $420 billion worth of solar modules, batteries, and electric vehicles, representing nearly 75 percent of global trade in these technologies.

However, the report warned that supply chains for these technologies remain highly concentrated. Over 90 percent of G20 imports of cobalt ores and concentrates came from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023, while 61 percent of graphite was sourced from China and 82 percent of lithium from Australia.

“The message is increasingly loud and clear,” the report stated. “Climate action and industrialisation must go hand in hand, requiring stronger collaboration to ensure that supply chains are diversified and benefits more equitably distributed.”

For Africa, this linkage between energy transition and industrialisation is both a challenge and an opening. As global powers seek to secure raw materials and manufacturing capacity, the continent can move beyond the “pit-to-port paradigm” of extraction to build industries that add value locally.

A $27 Billion Market Opportunity

According to SEforALL, Africa’s renewable energy ambitions already point to an emerging market of significant scale. “For Sub-Saharan Africa, total renewables capacity in the power sector is expected to triple to 165 GW by 2030, with nearly 40 GW of solar PV,” the report says.

This expansion represents “a $27 billion market opportunity in the solar PV sector alone between 2025 and 2030, including modules and balance of system components.” Demand for lithium-based batteries is also forecast to reach 10 GWh by 2030, generating a market opportunity of $10–15 billion annually.

The report observes that Africa imported more than $12 billion in finished energy-transition products between 2022 and 2024 — with South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya among the largest importers. “If current trends continue and domestic manufacturing capacities remain underdeveloped, import costs will escalate,” it warned.

SEforALL argued that this rising demand, coupled with strong resource endowments, creates a foundation for local manufacturing. “Strategically investing in tailored localisation strategies for energy-transition technologies is not only a socioeconomic opportunity, it is also a future-proofing strategy,” it concluded.

Building hubs for green manufacturing

The report called for the creation of industrialisation hubs for energy-transition technologies, combining national action with regional and international collaboration. It identifies three key domains of focus: industrial policy, infrastructure, and partnerships.

“Advancing industrialisation hubs in Africa for energy-transition technologies requires a coordinated, whole-of-government strategy,” it said. Such an approach should align ministries of trade, investment, mining, energy, and skills development around a shared industrial mission.

Citing South Africa’s new Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM), the report describes a model Nigeria could adapt. “SAREM exemplifies a comprehensive industrial policy framework aimed at localising renewable energy value chains, fostering inclusive economic growth, and facilitating a just energy transition,” the document explains.

Between 2014 and 2024, South Africa imported over R180 billion (about $10 billion) worth of renewable energy materials. “SAREM aims to address this by promoting the establishment of industrial hubs and Special Economic Zones focused on renewable energy,” the report noted. By 2030, the plan targets an addition of 5 GW per year of renewable capacity and over 25,000 jobs.

For Nigeria, a similar roadmap could be developed under its Energy Transition Plan to link domestic renewable targets with local production of solar modules, inverters, and battery storage systems.

“The manufacturing sector is critical for employment generation”

SEforALL underscores that industrialisation is key to inclusive development. “The manufacturing sector is particularly critical for employment generation, as well as economic transformation,” it says. Yet manufacturing value added in Sub-Saharan Africa has stagnated at about 11 percent of GDP for two decades.

By 2030, “half of all new entrants into the global labour force will come from Sub-Saharan Africa, requiring the creation of up to 15 million new jobs annually,” the report observes. Green manufacturing could absorb much of this workforce.

The employment potential of renewable manufacturing is especially strong in solar energy. SEforALL estimates nearly 4 million person-years of labour in solar PV manufacturing between 2024 and 2050 — equivalent to 146,000 full-time jobs annually.

It concluded: “Renewables manufacturing can support job creation objectives with over 146,000 jobs annually in solar PV assembly alone.”

Trade integration and value chain development

The SEforALL report highlights trade policy as a cornerstone of Africa’s green industrialisation. “Clean energy supply chains are deeply trade-dependent,” it notes. Strategic trade measures — including calibrated tariffs, regional trade integration, and investment incentives — can unlock domestic manufacturing potential.

The report calls for deeper implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to build regional value chains. “Africa needs both regional and intercontinental trade agreements to build market linkages for intermediate and finished goods,” it stressed.

Intra-African merchandise trade currently accounts for just 13.7 percent of total trade, compared to 22 percent in ASEAN and 58 percent in the European Union. According to SEforALL, “Every 10 percent increase in regional trade in intermediary products correlates with a nearly 4 percent increase in manufacturing employment.”

The report also underscores the need to reconcile global trade rules with the industrialisation goals of developing countries. “There is an urgent need to promote dialogue on reconciling international trade regulations with climate action, particularly in the context of industrialisation goals of developing countries,” it said.

Technology and research gaps

Access to clean technology and innovation capacity remains one of Africa’s biggest obstacles. SEforALL points out that G20 countries owned about 91 percent of all patents in environmental technologies filed between 2000 and 2021, with China, Japan, the United States, Korea, and Germany accounting for the bulk.

“The development of industrialisation hubs for minerals beneficiation and clean energy manufacturing requires access to technology, skilled labour, and innovation ecosystems,” the report stated.

It urges stronger North–South and South–South collaboration to bridge this technology gap. “The G20 could serve as a key forum to facilitate partnerships and engagement to address key barriers and strengthen technology access and local innovation systems in developing countries,” it added.

Skills and workforce development

The report emphasises that building green industries also requires human capital. “For the energy transition to contribute to employment in Africa, the workforce needs to be trained with adequate technical and non-technical skills and be ready to take the occupations that will be required,” it said.

It calls for targeted interventions in curriculum updates, industry–academia partnerships, and regional skills certification frameworks. “Governments play a pivotal role in creating an enabling environment for skills development,” SEforALL noted, adding that public funding for vocational training and workforce inclusion will be crucial.

A call to action

The SEforALL report concludes with a clear appeal: Africa must act now to align industrial policy, investment, and regional cooperation if it is to capture the economic gains of the clean energy transition.

“The opportunity for African countries to build domestic value chains for energy-transition technologies depends on several factors, including resource endowment, existing production capacities, soft and hard infrastructure, and an enabling policy and regulatory environment,” it stated.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/2021/11/Energy-transition-1.png,N,,2025-11-04 10:18:37.866139

“Projects like Acton show what it takes to responsibly bring clean energy to communities while addressing the challenges of building on historically contaminated land,” said Sean Harrington, DEI president and CEO of Distributed Energy Infrastructure. “By transforming a brownfield into a productive solar and storage site, we’re expanding access to renewable energy, strengthening the local grid and putting otherwise unusable land back to work.”

The site was originally home to a chemical processing plant owned by US company W. R. Grace, which produced commodities including sealants for rubber containers, latex products and resins, from 1954. However, in 1973, local residents complained about local air pollution around the plant, and testing from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1978 found that two local wells had been polluted, which the EPA attributed to the dumping of “effluent wastes” in lagoons in the area.

The EPA closed chemical processing at the site, and placed the area on the National Priorities List in 1983. In the years since, the site was added to the EPA Superfund, a list of polluted sites that are in need of rehabilitation, at the expense of either the original owners of the facility responsible for the pollution or the EPA itself.

Ministers from across the 27-nation bloc met in Brussels to try to get at least 15 to align their nationally determined emissions targets to have a stronger negotiating position during the Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 in Belem.

“We need to show to the world that we are leaders in climate change. We need to deliver adequate signals for investors. Today’s the day,” Spanish climate minister Sara Aagesen said before the meeting.

A draft proposal for an agreement on climate commitments seen by The Associated Press calls for loosening core climate regulations by giving priority to economic and energy security.

Climate ministers will discuss the proposal, which would allow nations to swap emissions between domestic economic sectors like manufacturing and agriculture. It also calls for larger allowances for EU nations to buy carbon credits outside the bloc.

The EU’s long-held leadership of action on climate is under threat by domestic and international pressure.

Wildfires, heat waves and floods have disrupted life across Europe, spurring calls for more climate action. But crises like Russia’s war in Ukraine, and a newly volatile relationship with the United States, have increased political and economic pressure to curtail flagship environmental policies.

A recent weakening of a deforestation law by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, upset environmentalists. They worried that it signaled a deeper disenchantment with green priorities by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In February, she had announced an economic policy that some said eroded her Green Deal, a plan aimed at making Europe the world’s first carbon-neutral continent.

But von der Leyen said in September that “the world can count on Europe’s climate leadership” and pledged that the EU is “on our way to climate neutrality” and would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040.

She has linked climate investment to sovereignty and defense, arguing that a self-reliant Europe can better face threats like disruptive tariffs or export controls, armed conflict and environmental disasters.

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some see climate regulations as shackling the economy, while others say Europe will either make and sell renewables or be forced to buy energy or green products from countries like China.

Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s climate commissioner, said that the bloc needed to “bridge climate action with competitiveness and industrial savviness, if you will, and independence that is going to be the name of the game in the years that we have ahead of us.”

“We’ll do our utmost to be successful, but it takes 27 to tango,” he said of the negotiations on Tuesday.

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals has rattled Europe, whose climate vision was in part forged in partnership with the Democratic administrations of former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

The EU’s commitments in Paris have driven investment in renewable energies and electric vehicles, often in cooperation and at odds with Chinese companies.

Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a height not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, according to the U.N. weather agency.

Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. The heat has been linked to more intense rains and floods, and the report predicts rainfall decline and more severe droughts in southern Europe.

Permitting the First 6 GW of an 11 GW Campus will Clear the Path for Fermi America to Build One of the Largest Clean Natural Gas Projects in the World

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, emphasized, ""Energy independence is not just an economic issue — it's a matter of national security. President Trump and Governor Abbott are men of action, and they expect the private sector to provide answers, not power points. At Fermi, we are proud to be building this campus in real time to meet the needs of the country.""

As Fermi America's clean natural gas project comes online, 6 GW of power demand will not have to be drawn from the U.S. grid — enough energy, on average, to power New York City. Instead, Fermi will utilize minimal grid power as it ramps up in the coming months, until the initial gas generators, which are already en route to the campus, are installed and online in 2026. The entire premise behind the 11 GW private HyperGrid campus being built on clean natural gas, nuclear, solar, and battery power is that the nation's grid cannot grow fast enough to keep pace with the AI race, nor should consumers be expected to foot the bill through rising utility rates to support the most successful companies in the world.

""Hardworking Americans are tired of watching electricity costs rise while the grid ages,"" added Toby Neugebauer, CEO and Co-Founder of Fermi America. ""At Fermi, our private grid model ensures that the growing demand for AI is met privately — freeing up power on the public utilities to serve homes, schools, hospitals, and small businesses as intended. Together with our partners, we're building one of the cleanest, most efficient power fleets in the world, driven by American innovation — without asking taxpayers to foot the energy bill for the world's largest, highest-margin companies.""

Fermi America plans to integrate zero emissions solar into its power supply plan and utilize the latest technology and hybrid cooling systems, ensuring protection of air quality and water conservation. Additionally, Fermi's air quality analysis shows that the project meets all federal and state air quality, odor and health effect standards, ensuring that air quality is protective of all Carson County residents.

Deep River Data, based in Alamance County, is interested in accessing gas from Butler Well No. 3, just south of U.S. Highway 421 near the Lee-Chatham county line, according to emails obtained under public records law.

Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.

“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.

Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.

Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.

Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.

Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.

Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.

“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”

Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.

“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”

Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.

Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”

The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.

The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.

The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”

The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”

Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.

“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.

The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.

The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.

“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.

Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.

Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.

Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.

Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.

Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.

It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.

Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.

Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.

Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.

HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.

Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.

“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.

“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”

Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry a?airs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.

Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.

Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On Oct. 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.

They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.

This measure passed the House earlier this year, but is still waiting for Senate approval.

“Hopefully they will pass it because I think that would also send really a fantastic message to the global economy that our state’s open for business,” Spuller said. “There’s no reason not to pass that. That would be on my wish list.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-102/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/adobestock-crypto-mining-44446865-scaled-1-1024x6761762254328.jpg?h=a7e7c04b&itok=ePSiQQbD,N,,2025-11-04 07:05:00.144867

Quarter-over-quarter, the deficit worsened due to a continued fall in sales, as US tax credit incentives for EV purchases ended in September.

Samsung SDI is putting energy storage system (ESS) sales at the heart of its turnaround strategy, particularly in the US. That said, in European Union (EU) markets, the company still intends to capitalise on an expected peak in demand for EVs towards the end of the year. Indeed, the company signed more than 110GWh of supply contracts with automotive manufacturers during the quarter.

South Korean battery makers chase FEOC advantage

US battery storage projects still qualify for investment tax credit (ITC) incentives. However, new provisions introduced with the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) budget reconciliation legislation mean developers receiving material assistance above a certain threshold from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) companies will be unable to avail of the capex subsidies.

FEOC restrictions will apply to Chinese, Iranian, Russian and North Korean entities, and of course, in the battery space, that effectively means China, given the industry’s heavy dependence on the East Asian powerhouse for everything from materials processing to finished products.

Rules introduced under the Biden Administration already awarded a domestic content bonus for ITC-eligible projects, and ultimately, the US government wants to see the market served overwhelmingly by products made domestically.

Samsung SDI’s fellow South Korean rival LG Energy Solution (LG ES) has announced an uplift in ESS battery sales that helped keep the company’s most recent quarter profitable, even as EV battery sales slumped for LG ES, too.

South Korean companies, which had already invested in EV battery lines in the US, now hold the cards with a first-mover advantage to supply the energy storage market by retooling those EV battery factories.

The difference between them is that LG ES has already got ESS battery cell production lines up and running in the US, at its factory in Holland, Michigan. These lithium iron phosphate (LFP) production lines were repurposed from producing nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells for electric vehicles.

LG ES aims to have 17GWh of annual production capacity across four lines in Michigan by the end of this year and 30GWh within the US by the end of next year, meaning that from a relative standing start, Samsung SDI plans to achieve a similar level of production much faster. SK On is pursuing a similar strategy of investing in US production of LFP cells.

Tesla deal reports, NCA cell production already underway

In September, at this year’s RE+, the biggest clean energy industry event in the US, Samsung SDI debuted two battery energy storage system (BESS) products it will make within the country, Samsung Battery Box 1.7 (SBB 1.7) and SBB 2.0.

Both are 20-foot containerised BESS solutions, but SBB 1.7 is a 6.14MWh high energy density system utilising nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA) battery cells and SBB 2.0 uses LFP cells. Although Samsung SDI did not offer a capacity for SBB 2.0 in launch materials, some sources speculated that it would hold a similar capacity to SBB 1.7.

SBB 1.7 will come onto the market sooner than its LFP counterpart. The company said in its results release that local production of NCA batteries already began last month at a factory in Indiana, through StarPlus Energy, a joint venture (JV) with auto OEM Stellantis.

Mass production of LFP batteries will begin this quarter. Samsung SDI highlighted its position in the market as the only non-Chinese manufacturer of prismatic LFP cells, which would mean its cells could be a simpler drop-in solution for system integrators used to working with Chinese suppliers.

Earnings improvement is expected in the fourth quarter, according to Samsung SDI, driven by growth in EV demand in Europe and ESS demand in the US.

This morning, newspaper The Korea Herald and news agency Reuters both reported that the company is in talks over a multi-year, multi-gigawatt-hour stationary energy storage battery supply deal with Tesla.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_7076.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 06:19:41.673920

This is the largest overseas commitment to India's green energy sector. The global firm also plans to establish a township and multiple hotels under its Leela brand.

New Delhi: Brookfield Asset Management is planning to invest $12 billion in Andhra Pradesh's renewable energy sector over the next three years, said people with knowledge of the matter, in what would be the largest overseas commitment in that sector for India.

The purse could grow as the global investment firm is looking to establish a township, as well as multiple hotels under its Leela brand, they said.

Brookfield, which is eyeing investments across the value chain in the green energy sector, is likely to invest in Indosol's integrated manufacturing facility and Navayuga's renewable energy portfolio, besides manufacturing and green hydrogen projects.

The commitment was made at a meeting of Andhra Pradesh IT and electronics minister Nara Lokesh and Brookfield asset management managing partners Nawal Saini, Ankur Gupta and Arpit Agrawal.

Live Events

Investments in realty, hospitality too

It follows a September meeting between Lokesh and Brookfield global president Connor Teskey in London.

Andhra Pradesh has received major investments in the renewable energy sector by the likes of Premier Energies and Renew Power. Apart from renewable energy, Brookfield is planning to invest in other sectors in the state. The investment in the satellite township, planned to be set up north of Vizag, has not been worked out yet, said the people cited.

“The number of Leela hotels has not been finalised,” said one of them. “But in the meeting, the broad contours of this have been agreed upon.”

The investments in the real estate and hospitality sector will be over and above the $12 billion pledged for clean energy. Brookfield aims to expand its India portfolio from $30 billion to $100 billion in various sectors by 2030. The Andhra government is likely to ink a deal with Brookfield at its partnership summit on November 14-15 in Vizag.

Permitting the First 6 GW of an 11 GW Campus will Clear the Path for Fermi America to Build One of the Largest Clean Natural Gas Projects in the World

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, emphasized, ""Energy independence is not just an economic issue — it's a matter of national security. President Trump and Governor Abbott are men of action, and they expect the private sector to provide answers, not power points. At Fermi, we are proud to be building this campus in real time to meet the needs of the country.""

As Fermi America's clean natural gas project comes online, 6 GW of power demand will not have to be drawn from the U.S. grid — enough energy, on average, to power New York City. Instead, Fermi will utilize minimal grid power as it ramps up in the coming months, until the initial gas generators, which are already en route to the campus, are installed and online in 2026. The entire premise behind the 11 GW private HyperGrid campus being built on clean natural gas, nuclear, solar, and battery power is that the nation's grid cannot grow fast enough to keep pace with the AI race, nor should consumers be expected to foot the bill through rising utility rates to support the most successful companies in the world.

""Hardworking Americans are tired of watching electricity costs rise while the grid ages,"" added Toby Neugebauer, CEO and Co-Founder of Fermi America. ""At Fermi, our private grid model ensures that the growing demand for AI is met privately — freeing up power on the public utilities to serve homes, schools, hospitals, and small businesses as intended. Together with our partners, we're building one of the cleanest, most efficient power fleets in the world, driven by American innovation — without asking taxpayers to foot the energy bill for the world's largest, highest-margin companies.""

Fermi America plans to integrate zero emissions solar into its power supply plan and utilize the latest technology and hybrid cooling systems, ensuring protection of air quality and water conservation. Additionally, Fermi's air quality analysis shows that the project meets all federal and state air quality, odor and health effect standards, ensuring that air quality is protective of all Carson County residents.

Although not specifically an environmental case, that outcome now has bearing on one of the largest environmental case categories being litigated in Trump’s second term.","In President Donald Trump’s first term, the federal courts helped put the brakes on his administration’s retreat on environmental protection.

Nine months into the second Trump term, the courts appear divided on whether to allow the administration’s far more aggressive dismantling of policy on climate change, clean energy and environmental justice.

In the 14 environmental policy cases so far in which there have been rulings on legal issues, the outcomes appear to be roughly even, with six clear wins for the Trump administration, five for the challengers and three mixed decisions, according to an Inside Climate News analysis. But in the Trump administration’s six victories, there’s an ominous sign: Three came when U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal overturned lower court rulings. That means that as of Nov. 4, all of the appeals court decisions in environmental cases have gone the president’s way.

The most important appellate panel—the Supreme Court—has yet to weigh in on any environmental cases from Trump’s second term. But emergency orders the high court has issued on other issues—education and health, for example—portend trouble for the many lawsuits over the Trump administration’s wholesale termination of environmental justice grants.

The case outcomes are a sign that the environmental law battles of Trump’s second term will be different from those of his first term. They are playing out in federal courts that he has shaped with 251 appointments (his nominees hold 28 percent of 870 judgeships on courts established under Article III of the Constitution). And in the years Trump was out of office, his judicial appointees helped transform the laws governing federal regulation, giving agency decision-makers less deference and narrowing the scope of their authority. The changes have emboldened Trump’s second-term team leaders, like Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, to push the envelope, including with a bid to rescind his agency’s authority to address climate change.

But all of the second-term court rulings so far have been on preliminary issues—mainly whether to put a hold on Trump administration actions while core case issues, such as constitutionality, are decided. Moreover, in the vast majority of environmental cases involving the Trump administration—24 out of 38—there have been no substantive rulings so far.

“It’s far too early to tell how they’ll go,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “The three where the courts have denied preliminary injunctions have gotten attention, but it’s only three” out of a much larger number of cases, he said. Gerrard compiled a list of environmental cases for Inside Climate News, based in part on the Sabin Center’s Climate Litigation Tracker.

Even if the second Trump administration is a more challenging legal environment, environmental advocates and Democratic state attorneys general are pushing forward with litigation, arguing that Zeldin and other Trump policymakers have overplayed their legal hand. And they maintain there’s reason to believe the courts ultimately will curb Trump rollbacks, especially on important regulatory issues, like the proposed repeal of the EPA’s endangerment finding on greenhouse gas emissions, that are yet to be finalized and litigated.

A Changed Legal Landscape

Records show challengers were successful in holding back many of the first Trump administration’s gambits to roll back environmental protection. One advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, says it sued the first Trump administration 163 times, winning nearly 90 percent of its cases. NRDC’s suits helped put a stop to the first Trump administration’s effort to restart the Keystone XL pipeline, to open areas of the Arctic and the Atlantic oceans to drilling and to eliminate energy efficiency standards.

The litigation tracker of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, which zeroed in on regulatory disputes, showed that 76 percent of 135 court cases over agency environment, energy and natural resources rules were decided against the Trump administration between 2017 and 2021. Courts in those cases, for example, determined that the Trump EPA failed to follow the law in its weakening of rules on the potent greenhouse gases known as HFCs, on its handling of toxic wastewater discharges from power plants and in its delay of rules on methane emissions from landfills.

The current array of environmental policy cases is quite different from the mix in Trump’s first term, reflecting how much policy he has sought to make through executive action, without resorting to the formal regulatory and deregulatory process. For example, there are four challenges related to Trump’s executive orders to halt offshore wind energy development before the courts—and in one of those cases, the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island succeeded in getting an injunction lifting Trump’s stop-work order and allowing it to resume construction.

Trump’s assertion of executive authority on renewables decision-making cuts both ways; the administration has been sued by two anti-wind-energy groups over its decision to allow another offshore project, Empire Wind, to proceed. A U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled on Oct. 23 in favor of the Trump administration, which is a win for Empire Wind.

A district judge in Washington state has blocked, for now, the Trump plan to suspend the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure charging network, known as NEVI. And a district judge in New York ruled that New York City’s new congestion pricing program should be allowed to go into effect while litigation over whether Trump has power to stop it proceeds.

Although the cases are varied, observers see common threads in the executive actions at issue.

“The theme that runs throughout is they’re doing everything they can to maximize both the supply of and the demand for fossil fuels,” Gerrard said.

In four cases, the Trump administration is directly challenging states’ authority to pursue their own climate policy. The Justice Department is seeking to overturn the climate “superfund” laws of Vermont and New York, and to block Michigan and Hawaii from suing fossil fuel companies to recover climate change costs, such as the expense of infrastructure to address sea level rise and to protect populations from extreme heat events. There have been no rulings in those cases so far.

One case that embodies the division among federal judges ruling on Trump environmental policy is the challenge to his siting of a migrant detention camp in the Everglades. The property known as “Alligator Alcatraz” is in the midst of wetlands that filter and store water for millions of Floridians, land that is sacred to Florida’s Miccosukee Tribe. A federal judge on Aug. 22, acting on a request by the tribe and environmentalists, ordered that the facility be dismantled and wound down. But in a 2-1 decision on Sept. 4, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily lifted that order, while the courts decide if an adequate environmental review was conducted. The two judges who sided with the Trump administration were among the six Trump appointees on the 12-judge 11th Circuit, which hears appeals throughout the Southeast.

The federal judicial system was designed to insulate judges from politics, requiring that appointees be confirmed by the Senate and be given lifetime appointments. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has vociferously defended the judiciary’s independence, declaring in 2018, “There are no Obama judges or Trump judges,” but “an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”

Nevertheless, legal scholars have documented the partisan shift in judicial philosophy on the Supreme Court, with its conservative majority bolstered by three Trump appointees. And litigants are increasingly choosing where they file challenges against the federal government based on the political leanings they perceive in the Circuit Courts of Appeal, according to data compiled by the Institute for Policy Integrity.

The 177 active U.S. Courts of Appeal judges are closely divided in terms of appointees of Republican (51 percent) and Democratic (49 percent) presidents overall. But there are stark regional differences, with Republican presidential appointees holding 91 percent of the seats on the 8th Circuit in the Mountain West, and Democratic appointees holding 100 percent of the judgeships in the 1st Circuit in New England.

In the federal trial courts, (known as district courts), usually the first step in the legal process, Democratic appointees hold 61 percent of the 626 active judgeships, compared to Republicans’ 39 percent. And some decisions by Republican-appointed district judges have gone against the Trump administration. For example, Revolution Wind won its injunction from U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., an appointee of President Ronald Reagan.

And U.S. District Judge William Young in Massachusetts, another Reagan appointee, issued an order in June blocking the Trump administration’s cancellation of 2,100 National Institutes of Health grants. The Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court and got an emergency order to reverse Young’s decision. Although not specifically an environmental case, that outcome now has bearing on one of the largest environmental case categories being litigated in Trump’s second term. The Trump administration is arguing, and a number of judges are agreeing, that the district courts have no jurisdiction over challenges to his administration’s termination of billions of dollars of grants, mostly for disadvantaged communities.

A Grenade From the Shadow Docket

At least nine lawsuits are underway over the Trump administration’s termination of the green bank and environmental justice and clean energy grants that Congress authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The grant cancellations are erasing one of President Joe Biden’s most important climate initiatives.

Grantees scored early wins, with federal judges in Maryland, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. ordering funds released while the legal challenges are heard. “EPA contends that it has authority to thumb its nose at Congress and refuse to comply with its directives,” wrote U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson, a Biden appointee, in deciding the Maryland case. The cases raise serious constitutional issues as well as statutory ones—in the South Carolina case, for example, the issue of whether grantees had been illegally targeted because of their viewpoints in violation of the First Amendment.

But since June, environmental grantees have seen a slew of defeats. The shift came after a divided Supreme Court issued two emergency orders favoring the Trump administration in its cancellation of education and NIH grants. A 5-4 majority of the high court backed the Trump administration’s view that such lawsuits were simple breach-of-contract matters that should be decided in a specialized venue, the Court of Federal Claims.

The rulings were consequential. The Claims Court only has the power to award money to grantees, not to reinstate terminated programs or decide on the big legal issues that the grantees have raised. For example, it has no authority to rule on charges that the Trump administration acted unconstitutionally or violated laws such as the Administrative Procedures Act, which is meant to protect citizens from “arbitrary and capricious” government actions. Ten of the 16 active judges on the Claims Court were appointed by Trump.

And because the Supreme Court took these cases from its emergency docket—its “shadow” docket, as critics call it—the big legal issues were barely aired. “Barebones briefing, no argument, and scarce time for reflection,” said Justice Elena Kagan in her dissent in the education grants case, chiding the majority from making new law from the emergency docket, as the court has done increasingly in recent years. Another dissenter, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, called the majority’s ruling on the education grant terminations “equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate,” and in the NIH case, she lamented that “a half paragraph of reasoning” was justifying cutting off millions of dollars for life-saving biomedical research, and had the potential to derail other grantees raising similar claims.

The Court, she said, “lobs this grenade without evaluating Congress’s intent or the profound legal and practical consequences” and is “sending plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.”

In three environmental grants cases so far—two in the appeals courts and one in the Washington, D.C. district court—judges have followed the Supreme Court majority’s reasoning, saying the cases likely belong in the Claims Court. The rulings have stymied efforts to save one of Biden’s largest climate programs, the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This so-called “green bank” was designed to act as a revolving fund, providing low-interest loans to give disadvantaged communities access to financing for renewable energy and efficiency upgrades. Initially seeking to claw back $20 billion of the fund, the EPA’s Zeldin leveled allegations of corruption against the recipients and the Biden administration. A lower court judge said the EPA had not offered any evidence of wrongdoing, and ruled that the funds should be released, before she was overturned by a 2-1 vote of a panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The two judges who sided with Zeldin were Trump appointees.

Now, some grantees are trying to be proactive in anticipation that judges will move their complaints to the Claims Court. On Oct. 15, a coalition of states launched a two-pronged legal attack against Zeldin’s August cancellation of the remaining portion of the green bank fund, the $7 billion Solar for All program, by filing lawsuits simultaneously in the district court and the Claims Court. The move puts a large environmental grant program in line to be the first adjudicated in the Claims Court. The Solar for All case could become an early indicator of what kind of money damages, interest and attorneys fees the United States Treasury may be forced to pay because of the Trump administration’s wholesale termination of grant programs.

For now, most climate and environmental justice grant recipients have been denied access to their funds. But the grantees believe the Supreme Court has offered a narrow window of opportunity to have their legal issues heard. Roberts sided with the liberal justices in ruling that challenges to the grants’ terminations should not be funneled to the Claims Court. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett provided a crucial swing vote in the NIH grant ruling; joined by Roberts and the three liberal justices, Barrett said the plaintiffs could still challenge the Trump administration’s internal agency guidance determining which grants were cancelled.

Jackson expressed doubt as to whether Barrett’s compromise provided any meaningful opportunity for the grantees to have their claims heard: “It splits review of the grant terminations from review of the grant termination policy—thereby preserving the mirage of judicial review while eliminating its purpose: to remedy harms,” Jackson wrote in her dissent.

Nevertheless, arguments were heard in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 23 seeking to revive the South Carolina case and its claims that the Trump administration had acted unconstitutionally.

Counting on Judicial Independence

To affirm the value of pushing back against Trump in the courts, some environmental advocates can point to wins they obtained just by filing lawsuits that brought to light the impact of Trump administration actions. After the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York filed suit, the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May restored climate-smart agriculture information it had purged from its website. (Among the pages that were missing for a time were those that helped farmers access billions of dollars in support for conservation practices.)

And after the Environmental Defense Fund filed a lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Energy disbanded a committee of five well-known climate science deniers it had assembled to produce a controversial review of climate science. EDF argued that the creation of such a secret committee was a clear violation of the transparency and fairness mandates in the 53-year-old Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Trump administration has argued that the case is moot now that the committee is disbanded, but EDF is continuing the litigation.

“If the administration had followed federal law, full records of the deliberations and meetings of the climate working group would have been made available,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the EDF. “We believe that the American people are entitled to those records, and we are going to continue to press for them.”

Asked if she was concerned about whether the federal courts, with so many Trump appointees, would serve as an effective check on Trump in his second term, Patton expressed confidence in the system. “Our experience has been that there are courts and judges that are stewards of the rule of law and operate with the highest degree of integrity,” she said. “And I think everyone should ask that of our judiciary and our judicial system. It’s vital for our constitutional democracy.”

The most important challenges to Trump’s environmental rollbacks will come when federal agencies finalize their deregulatory proposals, including EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s pledge to wipe 31 pollution rules from the books.

A key case to watch will be the inevitable legal challenge to Zeldin’s planned repeal of the EPA’s 16-year-old finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, the foundation on which all of the EPA’s other climate rules are based. Zeldin’s proposal leans heavily on a series of decisions that the Supreme Court has delivered in the past three years that limit an agency’s authority to act without explicit direction from Congress, especially in matters of great economic significance: the court’s so-called “major questions doctrine.”

“We can no longer rely on statutory silence or ambiguity to expand our regulatory power,” the EPA said in its proposal.

Climate action advocates will argue it was the Supreme Court itself that ruled in its landmark 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA case that greenhouse gases fit the definition of “pollutant” under the Clean Air Act, and directed the EPA to lay out its reasoning for or against regulation grounded in the language of that law. In the wake of that ruling, the Supreme Court rejected bids to overturn the endangerment finding, and ruled to limit state actions on climate change specifically because the EPA has the governing authority over climate regulation. But the five justices who decided the case for Massachusetts are dead or retired. Three of the dissenters, Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, remain on the court, along with three Trump appointees who have voted for limited EPA power on climate change.

Nevertheless, if the Supreme Court were to now agree with the Trump administration’s view that the EPA never had the authority to act on climate under the Clean Air Act, it could unravel all of the case law on the subject since the Massachusetts decision.

“They’re betting that they can get the current six-member majority to say, ‘We don’t care about Massachusetts, and frankly, we don’t care about the three other climate decisions we made that built on and accepted Massachusetts,’” said David Doniger, senior attorney and climate and energy strategist for NRDC. “They’re betting the court is just going to bless the Trump administration doing whatever it wants and I don’t think that kind of lawlessness is going to prevail.”

The EPA has received more than 568,000 public comments on its endangerment finding repeal proposal, and the law is clear that the agency must provide a “reasoned response” to any substantive comments. In fact, the Supreme Court last year blocked the Biden administration cross-state air pollution rule from taking effect, ruling that his EPA had failed to adequately address public comments.

All eyes will be on whether the Supreme Court holds the Trump EPA to the same standard.

“I count on the independence of the courts,” Doniger said. “We’re all counting on that for so much.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2205531023-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 05:57:52.595409

DTE has been insistent that power rates will not go up because of the data center.

In a filing Monday, the utility company outlined how the proposed data center — backed by a real estate development company tied to billionaire megadonor Stephen Ross' Related Companies and tech companies Oracle and ChatGPT maker OpenAI — would reduce costs despite using as much energy as is needed to power more than 1 million average American homes.

Exactly how much households could save is unclear, in part, because DTE cannot lower utility rates without going through the Michigan Public Service Commission, the state's energy regulator.

Michigan Public Service commissioners, who will decide whether the project moves forward, are focused on ensuring the plan protects DTE ratepayers if the data center developer doesn’t follow through on its plans for using power.

“I think the commission’s focus here is really ensuring that customers, existing customers, aren’t ultimately left paying for or subsidizing this (data center) customer,” MPSC Chair Dan Scripps said.

DTE has been insistent that power rates will not go up because of the data center. That's partly because of a Michigan law prohibiting residential users from shouldering the costs of data centers and partly because the sprawling facility planned for Saline Township will pay for a higher chunk of DTE's overall fixed costs.

The deal between DTE and the joint-venture data center calls for regulator approval by Dec. 5, although when the commission takes up the case is beyond the control of DTE and the company. Scripps said the commission will not take the case up this week.

“We need to carefully review the proposal and make sure the modeling is correct, the cost assumptions are correct, that the actual pledges the customer is going to be responsible for … are well documented,” Scripps said. “We have a fair amount of work ahead of us.”

It's also up to the commission to decide whether the deal is approved without public hearings. Commissioners are allowed to rule on such cases without a notice or public hearings if there are no added costs to consumers, but the commission can open the case for broader feedback at its discretion.

The project has been met with pushback since its inception. Related Digital previously sued Saline Township over officials' initial decision to oppose its rezoning, but the town board eventually allowed the project to move forward in lieu of a court battle.

Environmental groups are still figuring out how they will respond to DTE’s proposal, said Bryan Smigielski, Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Michigan campaign organizer. The groups intervened in Consumers Energy’s request to build a framework for contracts it drafts with data centers and have advocated for renewable energy and ratepayer protections.

“Anything that could have a big impact on our energy system should be a contested case,” he said. “If it’s going to impact health or climate targets or people’s bills, I would expect that.”

Climate impact

Environmental advocates have warned that building a new data center of this scale could pressure utilities to continue relying on fossil fuels to save money and meet energy needs.

Scripps said DTE proposed using batteries in what's called an energy storage system to store more power from its existing sources — such as renewables or baseload coal, natural gas or nuclear power — in order to serve the data center’s initial electricity needs. That could lead to the utility firing up fossil fuel-based power sources more often to charge the batteries.

""What are the batteries going to be charged from?"" said Daniel Abrams, senior associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center. ""If it's 1.4 gigawatts of energy storage — it's one thing if they're charged by the Monroe Coal Plant, and it's another thing if they're charged by solar. So we want to make sure that we're not prolonging the life of DTE's fossil fleet through the use of this storage resource.""

Legislation adopted in 2023 under the then-Democratic-led Michigan Legislature imposed a 100% clean energy standard for utilities by 2040. It also shifted power from local governments to the state to authorize large-scale wind and solar projects so the projects could move forward at a quicker pace.

In his testimony to the MPSC, DTE Director of Renewable Energy Planning and Strategy Kevin Bilyeu said the company’s renewable power target will increase by approximately 30.5% with the addition of the new data center.

The amount of power it would have to develop to serve the data center varies depending on the source of that renewable power and the number of renewable energy credits DTE puts toward the effort. To completely serve the data center with solar power, the utility would have to build 3.2 gigawatts of solar arrays, Bilyeu said. If the company used all of its expected renewable energy credits on this project, it would only have to build 443 megawatts of renewable power, he said in his testimony.

But Bilyeu said DTE’s renewable power strategy will allow it to meet renewable portfolio standards even with the addition of the data center.

""Bringing on new data center load of this magnitude actually creates affordability — and therefore headroom — to comply with the state’s clean energy targets,"" DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said in an email. ""DTE's contract with the data center will by itself lead to the near-term deployment of enough battery storage in Michigan to satisfy the requirements of the state’s energy storage mandate.""

DTE will evaluate its renewable energy development plan during its next integrated resource planning process, which starts next year.

Smigielski questioned DTE’s statements that the utility has excess capacity it could use to serve a hyperscale data center that demands 1.4 gigawatts of power. Utilities have to deal with variations in demand, so they need excess capacity in order to supply their customers on the hottest days of summer when energy demand peaks.

If DTE starts pumping out as much electricity as it possibly can every day, then it would have to build additional power to satisfy its customers on peak demand days, Smigielski said.

Smigielski also pointed to DTE executives’ previous statements that the company is in discussions with multiple large data center customers, all of whom would increase demand for electricity.

“There’s simply no way that can not require additional generation,” he said.

The units would be co-located at an existing Constellation generation facility.
Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 megawatts of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.","BALTIMORE (Nov. 4, 2025) — Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG) today announced a long-range proposal to invest in up to 5,800 megawatts of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland to meet rising demand for electricity, lower utility bills and usher in the next generation of clean and lower-carbon energy resources to power the state’s economic growth. The proposal offers Maryland leaders a menu of options so they can make informed decisions about how to power the state’s economy and address climate change in the most cost-effective way for generations to come.

To meet the state’s near-term needs, Constellation submitted battery storage and gas generation proposals to the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) on October 31 as part of a state program to fast-track permits for large-scale energy projects. These projects would by themselves cover more than 5 percent of the state’s peak load with battery storage and increase total power generation capacity about 10 percent, representing billions of dollars of private-sector investment in Maryland energy infrastructure.

""Constellation hopes to be a thought partner as Governor Moore and other policymakers consider the state’s many choices. For example, while there is a good deal of consensus on the need for battery storage, the future of natural gas in our state is less clear. Some Maryland stakeholders support new natural gas development, including the pipeline work that would be needed, while others oppose it even if that means building transmission lines and importing electricity from natural gas-rich states like Pennsylvania. We believe that natural gas generation should be an option, but there are pros and cons to consider and, quite naturally, we do not want to build what our state does not want. Therefore, our plan presents natural gas generation as one of a number of options, with an explanation of the utility work that will be needed to secure this option.

""What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation. The historic agreement reached by Maryland and Constellation this September paves the way for extending the life of the Conowingo Dam for another 50 years, providing clean energy for hundreds of thousands of families for generations, while also investing $340 million to preserve wildlife and this beautiful watershed that we all enjoy. Likewise, Constellation has extended the lives of our wind assets for another 20 years, and we are working with willing customers to support the relicensing of the Calvert Cliffs clean nuclear plant.

""Finally, we are excited to work with Governor Moore, other state policymakers, and all Maryland stakeholders to investigate the development of new nuclear power in our state just as dozens of states across America are doing today. Importantly, all our investments have been and will be done without any cost to Maryland families and businesses. We are not now and never will be a monopoly that seeks guaranteed profits. We are a company that competes for its opportunities just like all our hardworking customers do — every single day. We rely on the talent and ingenuity of our Maryland team of power generation experts to make prudent investments, understanding that we will bear 100% of the risks of any cost overruns, delays or bad decisions that sometimes plague utility investments. That is the way it should be because the privilege to serve our customers and earn profits should be won, not guaranteed. Maryland is our home state and Constellation looks forward to continuing to offer competitive and innovative solutions to our state to create a prosperous and brighter future for Maryland families and businesses.""

The full plan starts with more than 1,500 megawatts of fast-track projects that could help address near-term needs, including:

State-of-the-art battery storage: Constellation is offering up to 800 megawatts of battery storage capacity that can release electricity to the grid quickly during times of peak demand, maintaining a stable power supply on the hottest days and coldest nights.

Investments in natural gas-powered generation: More than 700 megawatts (six units) of existing gas-fired power generators that could be rapidly deployed in Maryland and later converted to operate on carbon-free hydrogen fuel to reduce emissions. The units would be co-located at an existing Constellation generation facility. Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 megawatts of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.

Longer term, the company has proposed potential investments in up to 4,000 megawatts of new and existing nuclear projects that, with customer support, could power the state’s economy with clean energy well into the next century, including:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Center: Relicensing the state’s only nuclear plant to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 megawatts of clean generation that serves more than 1.3 million homes. Absent the license extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036, respectively.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10 percent, or 190 megawatts, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 megawatts of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output and creating enough clean generation to power future economic growth.

If fully realized, nearly 70 percent of the combined near- and long-term investments would be in clean, emissions-free energy resources and would increase the share of energy Maryland gets from clean resources from just over 50 percent today to about 70 percent once all the projects come online, supporting the state’s ambitious climate goals.

In addition to investments in new generation, Constellation is leading the way to make better use of the energy resources already available in the region by working with large businesses to lower their consumption during peak times, helping to free up capacity for new energy users, relieve strain on the grid and lower overall costs. Constellation plans to make these ""demand response"" programs more impactful by using AI and American ingenuity to create a 1,000 megawatt ""virtual power plant"" on the regional grid — the equivalent of a new nuclear reactor.

Constellation could bring all — or any combination — of these new projects forward to meet Maryland’s energy generation needs at the lowest possible cost to consumers, provided we have clear direction and enabling legislation from Maryland’s policymakers. Local utilities also have a critical role to play by supporting faster connections to the grid and ensuring we have the necessary infrastructure to deliver fuel to new gas-fired generation.

By adopting this approach, Maryland can preserve the benefits it has received over the past 20 years by being part of PJM, the grid operator serving Maryland, 12 other states and the District of Columbia. In PJM states, power generators like Constellation compete to provide the lowest cost generation resources across the region with no guarantee of earning a profit on their investments. As a result, the cost of power generation in PJM — the part of the bill that is not regulated by the state and is paid for with private investment – has remained flat for more than 15 years, even factoring in recent increases in generation capacity charges resulting from higher electricity demand. By contrast, studies have shown that utility spending on poles and wires — which earn a guaranteed rate of return that is charged to every business and household — is largely responsible for recent increases in utility bills across the country, including in Maryland.

With power demand projected to rise further in PJM states over the next five years, Constellation has proposed reforms that would make the competitive market work even more effectively for Maryland consumers. The company has joined with technology companies and other energy suppliers on policies that would speed investment in new generation and lower costs while minimizing risk to utility ratepayers. These policies would improve PJM’s method of forecasting electricity use, increase use of demand response programs that reduce energy use on the grid at times of peak demand, and help spur further investment in new power sources. You can find a complete list of those proposals here.

Central to the West Terre Haute facility's low-carbon profile is the implementation of Honeywell’s carbon capture solution.
Once fully operational in 2028, the modernized facility is projected to churn out 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer each year.
Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, emphasized the dual benefits of the partnership.
“By utilizing Honeywell technology, we are paving the way for cleaner fertilizer production in the United States,” Williams added.","Honeywell today announced a landmark agreement with Wabash Valley Resources, LLC (WVR) to integrate its industry-leading carbon capture technologies into a project that will revive and modernize an idled gasification facility in West Terre Haute, Indiana. The ambitious initiative aims to produce hydrogen and ammonia fertilizer with a significantly reduced carbon footprint, addressing national priorities for food security and energy dominance.

The project, one of the first in the U.S. to produce low-carbon intensity hydrogen and ammonia, received a substantial boost from the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), which secured a $1.559 billion loan for WVR. This funding was granted through a program focused on maximizing the utilization of domestic energy infrastructure in agricultural sectors.

Central to the West Terre Haute facility's low-carbon profile is the implementation of Honeywell’s carbon capture solution. This technology is engineered to capture and permanently store nearly 1.65 million tons of CO2 annually underground. This sequestration effort is equivalent to the carbon absorbed by over 1.65 million acres of U.S. forests in a year, marking a significant environmental achievement for the industrial sector.

Once fully operational in 2028, the modernized facility is projected to churn out 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer each year. This scaling of domestic production is expected to be a game-changer for American agriculture, aiming to replace half the imported supply for farmers across the critical Corn Belt, including in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. By reducing reliance on foreign imports, WVR hopes to exert downward pressure on fertilizer prices, directly benefiting farmers.

Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, emphasized the dual benefits of the partnership. “As energy demand increases, Honeywell's carbon capture technologies help customers like Wabash Valley Resources optimize operations and reduce emissions to help boost the domestic production of important inputs like ammonia to support American agriculture,” West stated.

Dan Williams, CEO of Wabash Valley Resources, echoed this sentiment, stating the facility’s goals are to strengthen America's fertilizer supply chain and advance cleaner production methods. “By utilizing Honeywell technology, we are paving the way for cleaner fertilizer production in the United States,” Williams added.

The engineering and design of the facility are being handled by SAMSUNG E&A, a total solutions provider for the global energy industry. This collaboration leverages an existing joint endeavor between Honeywell and SAMSUNG E&A to market Honeywell’s advanced solvent carbon capture (ASCC) technology, demonstrating a shared commitment to global decarbonization efforts.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-04 05:57:59.641860

In last week’s announcement, the federal agency decided the state’s air quality improvement measures still fulfill the Clean Air Act, even without the home energy audits.","The Environmental Protection Agency announced last Wednesday that Alaska’s revised plan to improve air quality in the Fairbanks and North Pole is good to go.

The new — and final — state roadmap eliminates a Biden-era regulation that would’ve required people in the area to get an energy rating before selling their homes, and Alaska’s Department of Environmental Conservation is now in the process of repealing the requirement from the state’s administrative code. The regulation was set to take effect at the beginning of next year.

The EPA’s decision may mark the end of a yearslong policy tug-of-war – but only if the remaining methods to clean up the air succeed.

Energy audits removed

Scientists and state officials have repeatedly said smoke from wood stoves contributes the most to the Fairbanks area’s notoriously poor wintertime air quality. Energy audits aim to collect information on homes’ energy efficiency and heating systems, like wood stoves, then compile that data and give residences a rating.

But local realtors and elected officials argued that requiring them in the nonattainment area as part of the plan would’ve been a mistake. Heather Ferguson, a real estate agent and the legislative chair for the Greater Fairbanks Board of Realtors, said she’s glad federal and state officials are dropping the regulation.

“The energy rating itself is not doing anything to improve the air quality,” she said. “It was a data grab on … like the biggest thing a consumer can own.”

Ferguson also said paying for the mandated energy ratings would’ve burdened home sellers, and that the limited availability of energy raters would’ve created a bottleneck in the local housing market. According to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, there are currently four qualified energy raters in the Fairbanks North Star Borough.

“It was going to cripple our real estate market until we got more auditors,” Ferguson said.

Air quality plan gets final approval

The state’s federally-required plan to improve Fairbanks air quality has undergone multiple iterations and a fair amount of turbulence since 2009. That’s when the feds first determined that the amount of harmful particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less, or PM2.5, was exceeding federal standards in Fairbanks and North Pole air.

In 2019, the nonattainment area was reclassified from “moderate” to “serious.” The finding forced the State of Alaska to develop a new blueprint for how to fix the problem, called the Serious Implementation Plan (SIP).

In 2023, as part of the problem’s more recent history, the EPA decided some portions of the SIP weren’t good enough. That triggered a penalty called a conformity freeze, which has since been limiting how local and state transportation officials can use federal funds for infrastructure projects in the nonattainment area.

The state DEC then spent more than a year seeking to address the EPA’s concerns, and in early January, soon before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the administration under then-President Joe Biden proposed approving a revised version of the state plan.

The next month, after the public comment period on that proposed approval had ended, both the Fairbanks City Council and Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly passed resolutions urging federal officials to reconsider the mandated energy audits, which had been introduced in the SIP as a “compromise” with the EPA following the 2023 disapproval. The EPA under Trump then reopened public comment on the plan this March, citing local pushback to the home energy rating regulation.

In last week’s announcement, the federal agency decided the state’s air quality improvement measures still fulfill the Clean Air Act, even without the home energy audits. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said “Alaskans shouldn’t have to sacrifice their way of life to protect human health and the environment,” and that the state’s plan “proves that both goals are achievable.”

But Patrice Lee, a Fairbanks resident and spokesperson for the group Citizens for Clean Air, thinks Zeldin is wrong.

“To sacrifice human health and the environment is a recipe for destroying lifestyle,” she said in a prepared statement. “Nothing puts a damper on lifestyle like not being able to breathe, or heart problems.”

In response to follow-up questions, Lee also said the plan doesn’t have enough teeth, and that repealing the audits just weakens it further.

“It’s voluntary whether or not you change out your wood stove. It’s voluntary now whether or not you tell a buyer what the status of the home heating system is that they’re potentially going to purchase,” she said. “Everything is voluntary.”

What’s next

Though the EPA has approved the plan, Fairbanks air quality still must get in line with federal standards by the end of 2027, and Lee said she’s not convinced that’ll happen.

According to state data, the monitoring site at Hurst Road in North Pole continues to register the worst air quality in the area. PM2.5 levels there dropped significantly between 2012 and 2018, but they’ve since stayed pretty stagnant, and the levels are still roughly double federal maximums for the pollutant.

In the approved plan, the state said that 2027 reflects reaching attainment “as expeditiously as practicable.” State Division of Air Quality Director Jason Olds said by email Monday that if the Fairbanks area still has too much PM2.5 in its air at that time, the EPA would make a “finding of failure,” and the state would have to amend the plan yet again.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/488eb64/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F2e%2F737362824af4aa8fc4ca3c9fa536%2Fstovepipedb.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:21.456544

The company reached a strategic partnership with Woodside Energy (WDS) under which it will invest in the 16.5 Mtpa (2.5 Bcf/d) Louisiana LNG project. WMB will acquire a 10% interest in Louisiana LNG and has committed to a 1.5 Mtpa (~200 MMcf/d) offtake obligation.

Under the deal announced Oct. 22, Williams will also acquire an 80% ownership stake and become operator of Driftwood Pipeline. The company will assume responsibility for construction of Driftwood Line 200, a 3+ Bcf/d header line extending from Lake Charles to the Gillis hub. At Gillis, Driftwood Line 200 will connect with WMB’s Transcontinental and Louisiana Energy Gateway (LEG), as well as several other pipelines. In total, WMB expects to invest $1.9B under the agreement.

The deal with Williams gives Woodside much-needed counterparty backing for Louisiana LNG. WDS in late April announced a $17.5B project FID, despite having only one customer (a 1 Mtpa sales and purchase agreement with Uniper) at the time. WDS in April sold a 40% stake in the project to Stonepeak for $5.7B.

Along with the Woodside announcement, WMB and GEP Haynesville II reached an agreement with JERA to sell 100% of their respective interests in the South Mansfield upstream assets in DeSoto Parish, LA. The properties produce more than 500 MMcf/d currently, and the deal includes a plan to develop ~200 undeveloped locations to grow production to over 1 Bcf/d. JERA is one of the largest buyers of US LNG, with a total of 5.5 Mtpa contracted between five LNG projects (see table).

This is just the latest in a string of Haynesville land grabs by Japanese companies in an effort to ensure security of supply. Last year, Tokyo Gas bought Rockcliff Energy for $2.7B, and Mitsubishi reportedly was in talks to buy Aethon Energy Management earlier this year. Mitsui has been among the companies active in the exploratory Western Haynesville, alongside Comstock Resources (CRK) and Aethon. Expand Energy (EXE) also recently committed to the emerging play, acquiring 75,000+ net acres in the region for $178MM.

All of this buzz around the Haynesville is for good reason. East Daley Analytics’ current balanced forecast in the Macro Supply & Demand Report sees nearly 4 Bcf/d of ArkLaTex production growth in 2026. While this amount of growth is ambitious based on current producer guidance, we expect a step change in gas demand from new LNG facilities and data centers will put serious upward pressure on gas prices next year. Among leading gas basins, the Haynesville has demonstrated a unique ability to respond quickly to changing fundamentals. See our upcoming Dirty Little Secrets publication for in-depth analysis of the full range of possibilities next year and beyond. – Oren Pilant Tickers: CRK, EXE, WDS, WMB.

Market Implications

The expiration of the federal tax credit has had a profound impact on EV sales across the board. Ford CEO Jim Farley suggested that the EV market share could fall to around 5% from the 10-12% recorded in September. This projection comes despite the US EV sales reaching a record 438,487 units in the third quarter, up 40.7% from the previous quarter.

Bright Spot: Hybrid Sales

While pure EV sales have taken a hit, there's a silver lining for some manufacturers. Hyundai, for instance, reported a 41% year-over-year increase in hybrid sales. This boost helped the company's total electrified sales increase by 8%, despite the 57% drop in pure EV sales.

Industry Outlook

Industry analysts described the decline as expected, given the expiration of the federal tax credit. The sudden drop in sales highlights the significant role government incentives play in driving EV adoption. As the market adjusts to this new reality, it remains to be seen how automakers will adapt their strategies to maintain growth in the EV sector.

The dramatic shift in EV sales underscores the volatility of the emerging electric vehicle market and the impact of policy changes on consumer behavior. As the industry navigates these challenges, the coming months will be crucial in determining the long-term trajectory of EV adoption in the United States.

The summit was organized by C40, a network of mayors from big cities that has pushed to be included in decisions on how to combat global warming and adapt to its effects.

Selwyn Hart, the U.N. special adviser and assistant secretary-general for climate change, said at the opening that mayors are on the front lines of the climate crisis.

“In the midst of all the geopolitical tensions and divisions, it is truly amazing and inspirational to see what is happening in this room and on the ground in your cities,” Hart said, adding that local leaders are needed “more than ever” as the world enters the second decade of implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

Ana Toni, Brazil’s climate change chief and CEO of COP30, said meeting those goals would only be possible by engaging mayors. “It is you, mayors, who have to make very hard decisions in daily life, together with people,” Toni said.

Criticism of Trump and administration policies

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals seemed to loom large at the mayors’ summit.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said mayors have “long been climate doers, while too many nations and states have been the climate delayers or, indeed, climate deniers.” Now, he added, the challenge has moved beyond a battle against climate denial.

“Now, it is an existential fight between the climate wreckers and climate defenders,” Khan said. “Among the wreckers is the president of the United States of America, someone who stood up at the U.N. only a matter of weeks ago and called the climate crisis a scam.”

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego drew applause from the audience after saying she was bringing “good news from the United States” and asked fellow American city leaders to raise their hands.

“We have 50 cities from the U.S. that are here, all committed to ambitious climate action. So, while our national government goes backward, these cities go forward,” Gallego said.

Gallego addressed how extreme heat is affecting her city, which has repeatedly broken temperature records in recent years. “This year, we hit 118 degrees — nearly 48 Celsius — not once, but twice,” the mayor said.

She then introduced the city’s plan to plant trees and install shade structures, develop pilot cool-surface technology, and offer heat-relief training to first responders, such as paramedics handling heat emergencies.

Scientists say that 4 billion people, about half the world’s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.

The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross. Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, C40 co-chair and former mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital, said that extreme heat stands now as the deadliest weather related disaster and contributed to an estimated 489,000 deaths each year.

“And the economic consequences are staggering. Global extreme heat is projected to cause $2.4 trillion dollars of loss productity by 2030, as it becomes too dangerous for working outdoors,” she said, mentioning businesses like construction and agriculture.

Cooling cities down

On Monday, the C40 mayors launched a global coalition to prepare cities for a hotter future through an effort called the Cool Cities Accelerator.

A coalition of 33 cities — including Austin, Texas; Boston, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Freetown, Sierra Leone, London, Nairobi, Kenya; Phoenix, Paris and Singapore — has pledged to collaborate, share best practices and report progress on emergency measures such as strengthening early warning systems and ensuring access to cooling projects.

Within five years, cities aim to improve building standards, expand urban tree cover and shade, and future-proof critical infrastructure.

The Accelerator has implementation support from ClimateWorks Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Z Zurich Foundation and Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Rockefeller Foundation is also contributing just under $1 million to help cities launch the effort.

Cities will report back every two years on progress toward protecting residents from heat, said Emilia Carrera, the foundation’s director of health. Key metrics will include the establishment of cooling centers, the design of cooler urban spaces and updated building codes.

“Mayors see these challenges very closely,” Carrera said. “They have a fresher perspective and an ability to respond more quickly.”

Hannah Machado, an urbanist and climate researcher in the City +2°C Program at the Center for Urban Studies at Insper Research Institute in Sao Paulo, said cities have a long way to go to adapt to the changing climate.

“Especially because the effects of extreme climate events are felt in cities,” she said.

Cities, however, have reduced emissions faster than national governments, according to the C40 group. The group’s cities said they have cut emissions five times faster than the global average.

“In this year of major geopolitical shifts, that’s an understatement, city leadership has become even more important,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s former climate minister who also served at the U.N. as the chair of the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments.

Several years ago, before nonprofit solar incentives existed, Mitchell worked hard to get his Reform Jewish temple in Los Angeles to install solar panels.

Yosef Abramowitz is Nobel Prize-nominated entrepreneur and activist and serves on the board of the Jewish Solar Challenge.","According to an annual study of U.S. nonprofits, 47% of respondents said they do not have the adequate funds to execute their programs and services in 2025 and 50% are concerned about their current financial situation. Yet many organizations overlook one of the most effective ways to cut overhead — a solution that’s literally on the roof over their heads: switching to solar power.

Aside from salaries, the cost of energy to power lights, heating, cooling and refrigeration is the highest operational expense for many synagogues, JCC’s and other Jewish nonprofits. Every dollar spent on power is a dollar that could otherwise support services and expand programming. While the upfront cost of installing solar panels may seem daunting, it pays for itself over time by reducing energy bills year after year.

And there’s no better time than now to make the switch. The Inflation Reduction Act included unprecedented federal solar incentives for nonprofits, houses of worship and schools. While those tax credits sunset at the end of the year, you shouldn’t let that stop your nonprofit from embracing what is now the cheapest form of energy available.

Several years ago, before nonprofit solar incentives existed, Mitchell worked hard to get his Reform Jewish temple in Los Angeles to install solar panels. He was surprised to find the process so challenging, but the money folks at nonprofits tend to plan in five-year cycles and it often takes five to 10 years for the energy savings generated by solar panels to offset the upfront costs.

His solution was to create the Jewish Solar Challenge, which shortens the payback period by offering direct matching grants to Jewish nonprofits willing to install solar and implement other sustainability measures. The results have been transformative, benefiting both the environment and the bottom line of the nonprofits we’ve supported.

In the past three years, the Jewish Solar Challenge has helped synagogues, schools, Hillels and Jewish camps add $2 million worth of solar panels, preventing 1,272 metric tons of CO? emissions and saving grantees nearly $500,000 in annual electricity costs. And the impact has even gone global: The installation of solar panels on one Jewish community center in Tikvah, Uganda, provided the community’s first consistent source of power for Shabbat — which the community had previously conducted in the dark.

As part of the grant application process, organizations must explain how they will advance long-term sustainability goals within their communities. Installing solar becomes a catalyst for other environmental initiatives, sparking conversations about stewardship and inspiring individuals to consider how they can reduce their own carbon footprint.

Judaism teaches its adherents to be strong stewards of the Earth, so going solar is mission-aligned. Many nonprofit donors also want their grantees to adopt more sustainable practices, but there’s also a pragmatic financial reason for all Jewish nonprofits and their funders to opt for harnessing the power of the sun: Even without federal incentives, solar power is now the cheapest form of energy, with installation costs plummeting. Today’s panels cost less than half what they did in 2010, while producing nearly twice as much energy.

Solar panels build critical financial resilience, stabilizing budgets and protecting programs as philanthropy dollars fluctuate. For funders, few investments deliver such concrete, long-term results: a one-time grant lowers costs for decades, all while multiplying impact.

The bottom line is clear: Even as incentives phase out, solar remains the most responsible energy choice – both morally and fiscally. Philanthropy has a role to play in accelerating this transition, whether by funding solar projects directly, championing sustainability among grantees or modeling the shift themselves.

Act now to capture the best deal, but if you miss this window, remember: The sun keeps shining, and solar will continue to pay dividends — for your budget, your Jewish community and the planet.

This isn’t the first time Newport has tried to turn over a new leaf.

“We want to plant trees [for] shade,” said Josh Tunning, a municipal specialist with Newport.
“We had a slogan back then on the shirts, ‘A new leaf for life,’ and I think the leaf has turned into a bunch of leaves,” Ferrara said.","For the second year in a row, Newport is planting a massive amount of trees. The city aims to add 1,000 to its west side by 2028 to address inequity in its tree canopy cover.

Only 10-12% of the western areas in Newport are covered by trees, compared to 24-54% in other neighborhoods, according to ReNewport, a community development nonprofit. People there also experience higher levels of heat stress, poor air quality and lower life expectancy.

The city hopes by planting more trees, more residents will have access to the benefits they provide, like shade, improved health and even increased property values.

This isn’t the first time Newport has tried to turn over a new leaf.

Newport cleans up, plants trees to showcase change in the 1980s

Saratoga Street, which runs through the center of Newport, is lined with trees. They tower over nearby houses and cast shadows that reach across the road on sunny days.

Tom Ferrara remembers four decades ago when the trees were just saplings starting to take root where abandoned railroad tracks used to be.

“I'm sitting here looking at how big that tree is,” Ferrara said. “This is some of the last trees we planted.”

He was a city commissioner in the 1980s, part of a reform government working to clean up Newport and get rid of its 'Sin City' reputation.

“What we did behind the scenes — getting rid of gambling and all that kind of stuff — nobody saw that other than the people that used to come over here and do it,” Ferrara said. “So, we wanted to show something visible.”

Then-city manager Dennis Phelan started asking businesses along Monmouth Street if they wanted to buy a tree. Most got on board.

City crews cut up concrete sidewalks and filled them with dirt. Then on weekends, Phelan, Ferrara and a host of volunteers would get in the dirt and plant the trees.

“It was amazing, especially in the spring when they started to bloom,” Ferrara said. “Green on Monmouth Street? Come on. Other than the facades of the buildings, there was no vegetation out there. It felt good.”

Ferrara estimates, in all, the city planted more than 100 trees along Monmouth, York, Second and Saratoga Streets.

Branching out

Back then, trees were mostly being planted to beautify the city. Kate McElwain lived in the Gateway neighborhood and volunteered with both city and east side neighborhood tree plantings.

“We planted the 800 block of Maple. Of course, we put all Maples on there, which was kind of a mistake because if a certain disease comes, it's going to kill all the trees on the block,” McElwain said.

So far, they're standing tall.

McElwain says in time, people began to understand the role trees could play in their city in a different way. Research on the urban heat island effect shows the concrete-filled west side can be 10 to 20 degrees hotter than the tree-lined east side.

When McEllwain moved to the west side of Newport about a decade ago and felt the heat herself, she knew something had to be done. She and a group of neighbors banded together.

“Every year we did a tree planting,” McEllwain said. “It didn't matter... even if it was five or six trees, even if it was 10 trees. Every year, we put a couple trees in the ground.”

A new tree planting effort takes root

That laid the groundwork for today. The city of Newport got behind the west side residents' tree planting movement and, in 2023, it got a major boost from the federal government: a $1 million dollar grant to plant 1,000 trees.

Cities from New Orleans to Nashville also received federal dollars through the Inflation Reduction Act for similar efforts.

“We want to plant trees [for] shade,” said Josh Tunning, a municipal specialist with Newport. “It's better for our air quality. In an urban area like this, it helps the water runoff... It helps calm traffic. But, too, it just brings some vibrancy to the neighborhood. People want to be outside more when there's trees.”

This March, the Trump administration clawed back that money. Tunning says that’s not stopping the city from planting trees.

“We could wait around and complain about things not getting done, point the finger. Or we can get to know our neighbors, build friendships, build community, and say, ‘You know what, we're just going to work together and get this done,’ ” Tunning said.

The city's moving forward with help from state grants, private donations, and volunteers who give up their Saturday mornings to dig holes and put trees in the ground, just like in the 80s.

Back on Saratoga Street, former city commissioner Ferrara admires the trees he helped plant decades ago.

“We had a slogan back then on the shirts, ‘A new leaf for life,’ and I think the leaf has turned into a bunch of leaves,” Ferrara said. “We're growing, and we're continuing to grow, continuing to improve.”

He says he's proud to have seen Newport change over the years, one tree at a time.

Because of this, forecasts for EV sales over the next several years have been cut in half compared to what they were a year ago.

The average new car purchase price in the U.S. is roughly $48,000.This is somewhat uninformative considering that there are still some new cars that cost less than $20,000 and while others are priced in six figures. Regardless, electric cars are generally perceived as being more expensive than gas-powered vehicles. This is to some extent true, although it is often difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison. In any event, any intrinsic manufacturing cost advantages of gas cars are shrinking away.

Nonetheless, the situation has unquestionably damaged the electric car market. Manufacturers are employing various strategies to soften the blow, for example offering $7,500 credits on leases obtained through their separate leasing subsidiaries who purchased the cars before the expiration of the credit. At least 17 states offer tax credits for EV purchases, and some are increasing those credits. New York’s EV tax credit is $2,000.

Combining energy and water management could help slash both energy and water losses and reduce costs.
There is emerging evidence that water conservation programmes can, in some cases, deliver even more energy savings than programmes that focus on energy efficiency alone.","The world has a water problem and industry can be part of the solution. Half the world’s population experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, with poorer communities worst affected, threatening livelihoods, health and economic output. Industry could help address these scarcity issues by reducing their own water use and increasing energy efficiency.

Globally, the industrial sector is the second biggest user of freshwater after agriculture, accounting for just under 20% of freshwater withdrawals while simultaneously being the largest user of energy, accounting for almost 40% of the world’s total annual energy consumption.

While water and energy are often managed as separate resources in industry, adopting an integrated approach that combines energy and water management can improve energy efficiency and reduce water losses. Efficiency measures that lead to water and energy savings can lower water and energy bills, create jobs, lower emissions and reduce risks related to water scarcity. Many synergies emerge from an integrated view of energy and water management.

Water is essential for almost every aspect of supplying energy. Water is used in energy extraction and transformation for process cooling and other operational needs, and it is also used for the transportation of fuels and energy goods. On average, the global energy sector withdraws around 0.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) of freshwater for each 1 EJ of energy demand. By reducing energy use, water is saved too.

There are many inefficiencies in energy use in the industry sector. A recent analysis of the manufacturing sector in the United States, shows that just under 50% of all energy used onsite for manufacturing is lost. Globally, increased uptake of energy management and of AI-enabled savings in industry could result in 28% less energy being used to produce the same unit of value added in 2035. Considering the average volume of water needed to supply energy, this energy demand reduction would correspond to roughly 17 bcm less freshwater being withdrawn – that’s the same amount of water all municipalities in Sub-Saharan Africa used in 2020.

Globally, about 30% of freshwater is wasted due to leaks and inefficient use. This leads to more energy being used to extract, treat and transport larger volumes of water. In some countries, average losses in water supply and treatment systems reach 60%. Water users are also responsible for substantial losses. Analysis by Thames Water in the UK indicates that more than 25% of the water supplied to business customers could be lost due to leaks on premises. Some industrial sectors experience water losses as high as 50% due to leaks, outdated equipment, and inefficient practices.

Water leaks and inefficient use also lead to higher costs. Electricity costs typically account for 25–40% of a water treatment plant’s operational expense. Energy costs constitute almost 50% of the operating expenditures of desalination plants. Many industries, such as the semiconductor, pharmaceutical and food and beverage industry rely heavily on ultrapure water (UPW), which comes at an even higher energy cost for treatment (4 - 18 times more when compared to drinking water).

Combining energy and water management could help slash both energy and water losses and reduce costs. Integrated approaches, combined with better data, can provide a full assessment of costs and benefits of efficiency measures, including upstream and downstream impacts. Integrated energy and water audits, for example, could save companies time and money. Also, industry can often use water that has lower quality and is available on-site, such as process water or treated wastewater, reducing freshwater demand and saving on energy costs associated with water transportation.

There is emerging evidence that water conservation programmes can, in some cases, deliver even more energy savings than programmes that focus on energy efficiency alone. Implementation of water audits and recommended measures at industrial sites have been shown to deliver water savings in the range of 10-50% with additional savings of up to 20% in reduced costs for energy and water treatment chemicals.

A comprehensive analysis of water and energy use by the manufacturing sector in the United States indicates that investing in water efficiency is ten times more cost effective than investing in alternative water supply, and could result in water usage reduction of 60%.",https://iea.imgix.net/08b4c27b-c7ca-4236-86a4-6633fc2db551/shutterstock_2688869573_Integratedenergyandwatermanagementwillboostsavingsinindustr.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=min&h=600&q=80&rect=0%2C117%2C800%2C400&w=1200,N,,2025-11-04 05:19:24.049581

Campbell Generating Plant across electricity ratepayers in the multi-state Midwest power grid, the company said in its filing.
A spokesperson for Consumers said the company is continuing to comply with federal orders and is prepared to continue operating the plant.
""Every coal plant emits massive quantities of sulfur dioxide and mercury and lead.
The U.S. Energy Department Department of Energy has said there's a risk of an electricity shortage if the coal plant shuts down.","Running a coal-fired power plant near Lake Michigan, which the Trump administration has ordered Consumers Energy to keep operating despite the company's plans to shut it down at the end of May, cost $80 million through September 30, the company said in a recent filing with federal regulators.

Consumers plans to spread the cost of operating the J.H. Campbell Generating Plant across electricity ratepayers in the multi-state Midwest power grid, the company said in its filing.

A spokesperson for Consumers said the company is continuing to comply with federal orders and is prepared to continue operating the plant. The company said it plans to file a request later this year with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover the costs of keeping the plant running.

Sanjay Narayan, an attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said emergency orders, like the one keeping the Campbell plant open, create a lot of uncertainty around the future because there is no long-term plan in place. “Each emergency order lasts 90 days, but it can be renewed, and the administration has already renewed it once,” he said.

“One consequence of not being able to plan is that you can’t make the best choices because you can’t reliably control what’s going to happen,” Narayan said. “And that’s going to cost people money.”

Coal: a dirty energy source

Narayan said coal is dirtier, more expensive, and less efficient than other energy sources like solar, battery, and wind power.

""Every coal plant emits massive quantities of sulfur dioxide and mercury and lead. They are among the dirtiest industrial facilities,"" and the Campbell plant is one of many aging coal plants in the country that is unable to compete economically with more modern forms of generation, Narayan said.

Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer with the environmental group the Sierra Club, said Consumers was moving towards more advanced technologies and an evolving electricity grid, which contributed to the company's decision to close the plant, but the Trump administration had other ideas.

The U.S. Energy Department Department of Energy has said there's a risk of an electricity shortage if the coal plant shuts down. Consumers and the Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, have both said their plans account for energy demands.

Smigielski said the emergency order was also motivated by a desire to provide energy for data center development for big tech and AI companies.

In a statement, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that “maintaining access to affordable, reliable, and secure power is always our top priority.”

The cost

Consumers has said its plan to end coal power generation, led by shutting down the Campbell power plant, was going to “save customers an estimated $600 million through 2040,” in addition to providing an array of environmental benefits.

Smigielski added that sulfur dioxide emissions from coal plants are tied to a wide range of health problems, including asthma attacks, heart disease, neurological damage, early onset dementia, and death, according to Smigielski.

“We don’t have a need for it in the community,” Smigielski said. “So all of its emissions, all of its costs … there’s not a lot of upside. It’s hard to name who’s actually winning from keeping it online.”

Smigielski added that he has received many complaints from Michigan residents. “They have said loud and clear that they do not want to pay for dirty energy generation. People that are already spending over 6% of their income on energy bills don’t have extra money to fund a coal plant we don’t need.”

“At the end of the day, these costs are going to be borne by the public, not Consumers,” Narayan said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9b7836f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/558x293+0+62/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffe%2F66%2Fe1c887c8413ea1670a6b5a7ff371%2Fcampbell-plant.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 05:19:28.299503

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

The history of environmental policy in the United States highlights the intersection between science and legislation and their combined ability to confront complex environmental issues.","In recent years, the United States has faced rising concerns regarding climate change. Communities across the country have noted an increase in wildfires, heat waves and powerful hurricanes. These challenges have spurred debate among legislators, scientists and community members about how to maintain human livelihood while addressing issues such as biodiversity loss and pollution.

Origins of environmental policy in the United States

Environmental science in government policy has roots dating back to the mid-20th century. Americans began to have conversations about protecting the environment in the ’60s. Concerns about pollution, major oil spills and the Cuyahoga River’s spontaneous combustion heightened public awareness.

The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 was the first national legislation concerning air pollution which aimed to “provide research and technical assistance relating to air pollution control.”

However, that 1955 legislation dealt only with monitoring and research. The first legislation concerning the control and regulation of air pollution did not come until the Clean Air Act of 1963, which led to the establishment of a federal program in conjunction with the U.S. Public Health Service. The 1967 Air Quality Act later placed primary responsibility for air pollution problems on state and local governments, though “the federal government could step in if the state failed to adequately act on its own.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established in December 1970, following congressional approval of a reorganization plan proposed by former President Richard Nixon. Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 not only contained guidelines for the establishment of the EPA but also the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This allowed for a more coordinated and effective response to environmental issues than previous initiatives.

One significant piece of legislation was the Clean Air Act of 1970, later amended in 1977 and 1990, which regulates air emissions from stationary and mobile sources. The act establishes a national right to safe air, preventing polluting industries from simply relocating to more rural areas.

Some of the earliest research conducted by the EPA involved studying photochemical reactions of emitted chemicals, which led to further research on the correlation between ozone concentration and health effects. Over the following decades, research confirmed a clear link between ozone levels and adverse health outcomes.

Particulate matter, or soot, was also studied — generated from vehicles, industry, wildfires and “other combustion-related sources.” This led the EPA to issue the first air quality standards for fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, in 1997.

In response to evolving air quality standards, EPA researchers implemented Federal Reference Methods and Federal Equivalent Methods to measure air quality more accurately.

Plans and enforcement

The federal government sets national air quality standards, but state and tribal governments must enact and enforce those standards themselves. Each state can set stricter standards for emission sources than those required at the federal level.

One goal of the EPA was to set and achieve National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal criteria air pollutants: nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone and lead. This could be achieved through state implementation plans by enforcing pollutant standards within each state.

A typical state implementation plan generally contains three main components: state-adopted control measures such as statutes and regulations; “non-regulatory” components or additional provisions required by the EPA; and plans for maintenance and enforcement. The EPA collaborates closely with state and local agencies throughout the development of these plans. Once a state implementation plan, or a portion of it, receives EPA approval, its control measures become federally enforceable.

If a state agency fails to submit an acceptable plan — or if the EPA disapproves the submission — the agency is required to establish a Federal Implementation Plan to ensure compliance with national air quality standards.

Current issues and actions

While significant improvements in air quality followed the Clean Air Act and its amendments, environmental challenges persist. In the late ’90s, transitions in climate cycles — coupled with ongoing changes in temperature, drought and snowmelt — likely contributed to conditions fueling more frequent and intense wildfires across parts of the United States.

Wildfire smoke is now one of the largest and fastest-growing sources of air pollution in the country, serving as the leading source of particulate pollution (PM2.5) in the western United States. It accounts for roughly 50–75% of annual PM2.5 emission and contains the same pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act.

In 2007, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA determined that greenhouse gases are regulated under the Clean Air Act, giving the EPA authority to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This decision significantly expanded the agency’s authority beyond traditional air pollution to include climate change mitigation.

Following the decision, the EPA introduced several initiatives, including the Clean Power Plan, which established a national carbon dioxide emissions performance rate for power plants.

While fossil fuels will continue to be an important source for the nation’s energy, the Clean Power Plan ensures that power plants operate in a more efficient and climate-friendly manner.

The history of environmental policy in the United States highlights the intersection between science and legislation and their combined ability to confront complex environmental issues. Despite ongoing challenges, the foundational decades of research and policy enactment provide hope for a sustainable future.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ttd/5fbff6d3-d9e6-4759-8127-38ada98a43ad.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&dpr=2&ar=16%3A9&fit=crop&crop=faces,N,,2025-11-04 05:57:56.610674

The deal would cover about 10 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate battery cells a year, starting as early as 2026, generating an estimated 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion won in annual revenue for Samsung SDI.
“Securing a major client like Tesla in the fast-growing ESS market marks a significant milestone for Samsung SDI,” said Lee Ho-geun, a car engineering professor at Daeduk University.
“A long-term partnership will enhance its credibility and help expand its complete ESS solution lineup, including products such as the Samsung Battery Box in the US.” Tesla’s pivot toward Korean suppliers follows its effort to diversify away from Chinese battery maker CATL, which had supplied most of its cost-effective ESS battery cells.
Amid this expansion, Tesla’s deepening partnerships with Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution are expected to cement Korea’s position as a key supplier in energy storage.","Samsung SDI is reportedly in final talks with Tesla to supply around 3 trillion won ($2.1 billion) worth of energy storage system battery cells, signaling the US electric vehicle giant’s growing reliance on Korean battery makers amid Washington’s push to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains.

According to industry sources and media reports Tuesday, Tesla’s ESS division executives visited Korea last week and reached near-final terms with Samsung SDI on a multiyear supply contract. The deal would cover about 10 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate battery cells a year, starting as early as 2026, generating an estimated 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion won in annual revenue for Samsung SDI.

The Korean battery maker is expected to produce the cells at its joint venture with Stellantis in Indiana, converting part of the facility’s existing EV battery lines into ESS-dedicated production for North American clients, including Tesla.

“The reported deal likely involves cell-level supply for Tesla’s Megapack assembly lines in California,” an industry source said. “Tesla is expected to integrate the cells into its own Megapack ESS products.”

Samsung SDI’s domestic rival LG Energy Solution, which signed a contract in July to supply Tesla with 20 GWh of LFP ESS battery cells annually, is reportedly negotiating to raise that volume by 50 percent to 30 GWh. If both deals proceed, the combined Korean supply of cells to Tesla could reach 40 GWh per year.

Following reports of the potential deal, Samsung SDI’s share price jumped to a 52-week high of 354,500 won early Tuesday before easing to 335,500 won, up 2.6 percent at the closing bell. The company later confirmed discussions were ongoing but said “no details have been finalized.”

Industry observers say the potential Tesla contract would give Samsung SDI a much-needed boost after recent financial headwinds. In the third quarter, the company’s revenue fell 22.5 percent on-year to 3.5 trillion won, and it swung to an operating loss of 591.3 billion won.

Unlike LG Energy Solution and SK On, which operate independent plants in the US, Samsung SDI currently relies on its joint venture with Stellantis for North American output. Reports indicate the Indiana plant’s utilization rate remains below 50 percent due to the EV market downturn.

“Securing a major client like Tesla in the fast-growing ESS market marks a significant milestone for Samsung SDI,” said Lee Ho-geun, a car engineering professor at Daeduk University. “A long-term partnership will enhance its credibility and help expand its complete ESS solution lineup, including products such as the Samsung Battery Box in the US.”

Tesla’s pivot toward Korean suppliers follows its effort to diversify away from Chinese battery maker CATL, which had supplied most of its cost-effective ESS battery cells. After the US imposed tariffs of around 60 percent on Chinese batteries, Tesla accelerated sourcing from non-Chinese partners and began limited in-house LFP cell production in Nevada.

The Nevada plant, with an annual capacity of 10 GWh, incorporates CATL’s design and equipment but will cover only a fraction of Tesla’s ESS needs. The company plans to scale total annual ESS capacity to 100 GWh within three years — meaning its current 50 GWh supply from in-house and Korean partners still meets only half that target.

“With US tariffs factored in, Korean-made LFP cells could achieve cost parity or even a price advantage over Chinese supplies,” another industry insider said.

According to Mordor Intelligence, the US ESS market’s installed capacity is projected to grow from 49.5 GW this year to 131.8 GW by 2030, representing an annual average growth rate of 21.6 percent.

Amid this expansion, Tesla’s deepening partnerships with Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution are expected to cement Korea’s position as a key supplier in energy storage.

These efforts are designed to build a robust talent pipeline and attract advanced nuclear supply chain investments, reinforcing Virginia’s role as a regional hub for nuclear innovation.63","Strategy 1: Build public trust and acceptance

Public acceptance and community support are critical aspects of nuclear energy projects. Some residents may be nervous about living near nuclear energy sites because of historical concerns surrounding safety and waste disposal.11 Rather than dismissing risk perception, addressing uncertainties proactively and communicating risks appropriately, while building public trust in regulators and organizations involved in nuclear energy development, can lead to a better understanding of the risks and merits of nuclear energy.12 State regulators, nuclear energy developers, and technical experts can help earn trust through proactive, authentic, and continuous community engagement throughout the project life cycle.

Reflecting Deloitte’s “Infrastructure for Good” approach, building public trust requires more than outreach—it demands authentic, ongoing engagement that puts people and communities at the center. As highlighted in Deloitte’s “Community Engagement for Good” framework, “putting people at the center of infrastructure decision-making” is essential. By identifying, engaging, and collaborating with local organizations early and creating joint solutions, project leaders can ensure that nuclear initiatives are designed not just for energy needs but for lasting community prosperity.

Action 1a: Identify and engage local organizations

Community organizations, environmental groups, and interested public influencers could be engaged early and visibly on substantive issues. Illinois’ Climate and Equitable Jobs Act13 requires community-benefit considerations and workforce-transition plans for the relevant areas before permits are issued. Every proposed nuclear site would convene a local stakeholder committee empowered to monitor environmental baselines and negotiate benefit packages (for example, tax stabilization, job training, air-quality monitoring). Measures such as regular town hall meetings and an online document portal—tactics used effectively by the Washington State Department of Ecology to involve residents in decisions regarding nuclear waste cleanup at the Hanford Site14—can give residents a meaningful voice and surface potential issues early, enabling developers to address issues, increasing the probability that well-designed nuclear projects proceed on time and on budget. In Kentucky, communities can self-identify as nuclear-ready communities, signaling that they have undertaken formal consultations with their citizens regarding hosting part of the nuclear supply chain and its citizens have agreed to engage industry.15 This streamlines the community engagement process, creates an initial down-selected list of viable sites for nuclear development, and starts the process from a mutually agreeable position.

Identifying and engaging local communities depends on a well-developed outreach strategy. Any project outreach can include a variety of community members in feedback solicitation and enable the accessibility of engagement meetings. As described in Deloitte’s framework for trusted communication,16 an effective outreach strategy taps into the three elements of trust: competency, humanity, and integrity. In the context of nuclear energy projects, an effective communication strategy, designed to build trust with communities, could include these key elements:

Competency: Developers and regulators can show that they fully understand all aspects of nuclear energy and how to mitigate risks in its use.

Humanity: State governments can show community members that they make decisions with genuine empathy and care for their constituents, and that they acknowledge and take into account residents’ concerns into the decision-making process.

Integrity: States and nuclear energy industry players can be transparent with local communities, providing clear insight into challenges and the development process.

Action 1b: Design feedback mechanisms to continually solicit and respond to the public

Community trust cannot be built without state representatives, legislators, regulators, energy developers, and utilities actively responding to community concerns, feedback, and desires. Mechanisms to solicit community feedback can exist throughout the nuclear energy project life cycle and result in tangible changes that community members recognize. Industry players involved in the siting and design processes of nuclear energy development can use public input gained early in the project to see that these designs and the location of sites are aligned with public values to minimize opposition to licensing processes. Community concerns can be addressed and reflected in the iterative design review process, thereby building public trust in regulators, developers, and other industry players.17 Additionally, mechanisms such as advisory boards, town halls, door-to-door campaigns, and other continual feedback mechanisms can enable these players to continually receive and respond to feedback.

Project leaders should consider being willing to dedicate the resources needed to both listen and respond to local communities, for example, with an agile, specialized team. States can create a “rapid response” team that anticipates communication needs and forms proactive plans at each step of the decision-making process. Assigning a proactive team to address nuclear energy communications would enable continual responses to the public throughout the licensing, siting, construction, and operation of the project, further building trust for nuclear energy advancement.

Strategy 2: Conduct comprehensive energy planning

Small modular reactors and advanced nuclear plants can deliver consistent, around-the-clock baseload electricity. For example, a single SMR can power approximately 300,000 homes, providing the grid stability needed to support both residential and industrial growth.18 Reliability is essential for energy-intensive sectors, such as advanced manufacturing, critical infrastructure and data centers, whose energy usage could triple by 2028.19 In these sectors, even brief power disruptions can have significant economic or social consequences. States can estimate where sufficient demand will exist to site possible nuclear energy assets and enable interconnection with the grid. By integrating advanced nuclear into their energy mix, states can help safeguard against fuel price volatility, reduce dependence on imported commodities, and enable a stable supply of electricity in the face of rising demand.

For instance, France's power supply is more reliable than many European countries due to its heavy reliance on nuclear power, which provides a stable, clean baseload, generating about 70% of its electricity with a fleet of 56 reactors.20 Thanks to its nuclear fleet, France’s electricity grid maintains a legal standard limiting supply interruptions to less than three hours per year—one of the most reliable levels in Europe.21 Nuclear energy enables consistent output, enabling France to maintain energy security and export surplus electricity, earning the country more than €3 billion per year from export activity.22

Action 2a: Perform energy strategy planning and modeling

To effectively integrate advanced nuclear technologies into their energy mix, states can develop a comprehensive energy strategy plan that aligns nuclear deployment with long-term energy goals, grid reliability needs, and decarbonization targets. This plan can begin with a holistic assessment of current and projected electricity demand, identifying high-demand regions like data centers or industrial hubs where SMRs’ consistent baseload power can provide maximum value. States can consider incorporating stakeholder input from utilities, industry, universities, and communities to prioritize energy security, and cost-effectiveness. By mapping existing infrastructure, such as transmission lines and retired generation sites, and forecasting future grid needs, the plan can pinpoint optimal advanced nuclear plants locations and integration strategies.

This strategic framework can set the stage for advanced modeling studies to demonstrate how nuclear energy can strengthen grid resilience, complement renewables, and support economic growth while minimizing risks and costs. States can leverage three key types of modeling studies to inform advanced nuclear buildout and deployment:

Strategic demand forecast modeling employs sophisticated forecasting tools to analyze future electricity demand, informing the optimal integration of nuclear energy into the grid to enable sufficient capacity, reliability, and alignment with long-term energy goals.

Economic viability and dispatch optimization modeling assesses the economic competitiveness of advanced nuclear plants by analyzing operational costs, fuel expenses, and maintenance alongside their integration with other grid-connected assets like solar and wind. This analysis optimizes dispatch strategies to minimize costs, maximize efficiency, and enable cost-effective energy delivery to consumers.

Transmission grid integration assesses the grid's physical limitations and identifies optimal locations. This analysis determines necessary transmission upgrades, enables efficient power delivery, enhances grid stability, and quantifies the impact of nuclear power on load balancing, decarbonization, and overall infrastructure needs, guiding strategic deployment decisions.

Action 2b: Guide strategic site assessment and regional collaboration

Comprehensive due diligence studies can help to evaluate the technical, economic, and environmental viability of advanced nuclear energy deployment. These studies could consider site-specific factors, such as seismic risks, water resources, and proximity to high-demand sectors, while leveraging opportunities to repurpose retired power generation sites with existing infrastructure and a skilled workforce. Rigorous cost-benefit analyses, including decarbonization impacts, operational costs, and community support, are essential for informed decision-making and expedited project timelines. Wyoming's TerraPower project in Kemmerer exemplifies the benefits of this approach. The project team evaluated factors such as local community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the ability to obtain a license from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and access to existing infrastructure and the needs of the grid.23 By combining rigorous site evaluations, technology assessments, and regional cooperation, states can accelerate advanced nuclear energy deployment, minimize disruptions, and maximize economic and environmental benefits.

Action 2c: Strengthen energy security and emergency response frameworks

Nuclear power can maintain electricity supply during most extreme weather events, including hurricanes, extreme heat or cold, at times when other energy sources may experience disruptions.24 Between 2010 and 2020, lost generation due to weather-related events in the US nuclear fleet was less than 0.1%. Nuclear plants can deliver steady baseload power even when fuel supplies, supply chains, or portions of the grid are compromised, helping maintain critical services during disasters.25 Building on this strength, states can leverage tools and resources from the US Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER), and the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) to prepare or strengthen energy security plans.26 These plans can incorporate the advanced tools CESER has developed in collaboration with industry and the national laboratories to address a spectrum of threats, including natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, operational incidents, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could have an impact on nuclear operations or grid stability. The Council of State Governments and the National Emergency Management Association can also contribute to sharing effective strategies across states, ensuring alignment with national standards like those set by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.27 For example, North Carolina developed an Energy Security Plan in alignment with CESER’s frameworks, and provided a strategic roadmap to assess energy supply risks, strengthen security, and enable rapid recovery, offering a model for states to safeguard nuclear energy deployments, and deliver reliable, affordable energy.28

With the growing digitalization of energy infrastructure, cybersecurity has become a critical pillar of emergency preparedness for nuclear deployments. Advanced nuclear plants rely on advanced control systems and grid interconnections that are vulnerable to cyber threats, including ransomware or targeted attacks on critical infrastructure. States can work with CESER’s Cybersecurity for the Operational Technology Environment program to implement robust cybersecurity standards, conduct regular threat assessments, and develop incident response protocols tailored to advanced nuclear facilities.29

In addition to providing resilient power, advanced nuclear plants incorporate safety enhancements that further reinforce emergency preparedness. Advanced nuclear designs include passive safety systems, like passive cooling, that do not require operator action or external electricity to prevent overheating, even in the most severe scenarios.30 By integrating these advanced nuclear energy innovations into emergency planning, while proactively managing physical and cyber risks, states can safeguard nuclear operations, maintain grid stability, and build lasting public trust in nuclear energy’s role as an anchor of energy security and resilience.

Strategy 3: Create regulatory structures and incentives

The technology behind small modular and other advanced reactors is progressing rapidly, creating potential economic opportunities for states. For states that plan to incorporate nuclear power into their future energy portfolio, the real test in the coming years is whether policy frameworks can keep pace. Long, sequential reviews and permitting processes, uncertain cost-recovery rules, and weak price signals can add years and billions of dollars to a project’s timeline, while every gigawatt that does reach the finish line can support thousands of well-paid, qualified jobs and sustained economic growth. Early state-level initiatives, from Illinois’s Zero Emission Credit program31 to the fast-tracked permits in Tennessee,32 Wyoming,33 and Virginia,34 illustrate how legislatures, utility commissions, and economic-development agencies can coordinate their levers to create a more favorable environment for future nuclear projects and pave the way for a markedly more profitable industry, aligned with long-term energy goals.

The following policy actions—drawn from emerging state experience—offer a practical playbook for turning nuclear ambition into investible reality:

Action 3a: Streamline permitting and regulatory processes

Long, fragmented approval timelines are one of the biggest cost drivers in nuclear development. Even after a company secures a federal license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it often still needs separate state and local signoffs for land use, water rights, transmission interconnection, tax treatment, and environmental reviews.35 Because these processes typically run in sequence and vary from county to county, developers could finance multiyear “dead zones” with no revenue in sight, which can add hundreds of millions of dollars in interest expense and deter would-be investors. States control virtually every other permit on the critical path, so their ability to synchronize and accelerate those reviews is central to making projects viable.

A traditional reactor can spend almost a decade in preconstruction limbo. One-stop approaches in Idaho36 and Wyoming37 for mining and carbon-capture projects demonstrate that faster does not have to mean looser; there can be concurrent reviews, clear timetables and direction on the steps, and early engagement with local communities.

Action 3b: Attract investment and secure cost recovery

Securing investment for a new reactor begins well before concrete is poured and most of the bill comes due long before a single kilowatt-hour is sold. The first hurdle is therefore to de-risk the up-front phase so developers can raise the billions required to break ground; the second is to assure investors that their initial investment will be repaid while the plant is still under construction.

States are tackling the front-end challenge by pairing predictable, guaranteed minimum revenue with public-sector credit enhancements. For example, Illinois established a pioneer Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) program in 2016 to provide financial support to at-risk nuclear power plants.38 Under this program, utilities are required to purchase ZECs at a fixed price, creating a stable revenue stream for nuclear operators. This mechanism helped ensure the continued operation of the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants, demonstrating how guaranteed revenue can de-risk investment and attract the necessary capital for nuclear energy projects.39 Some banks in Connecticut and New York have gone a step further, layering in subordinated loans and loan guarantees that cover roughly 15% of the total cost. By absorbing first losses, they crowd in senior lenders who may otherwise price the risk too high.40 Indiana now authorizes 40-year securitized bonds whose maturities match a reactor’s economic life,41 while the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems consortium in the Mountain West uses take-or-pay contracts in which each of its dozens of city-owned utilities agrees to pay for its share of the plant’s output whether it ends up taking the power or not, so all participants share the risks and rewards together.42 Together, these tools could narrow or eliminate the equity gap that typically stops first-of-a-kind builds at the drawing board.

Because first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear projects lack a proven cost track record, several states have adopted conditional financial incentives to help manage project risk, while aiming to limit the effects on ratepayers. These include grants or tax credits that are contingent on qualifying activities, such as research, development, or construction, as well as cost-recovery provisions that allow utilities to recoup development expenses during the early stages of a project. For example, Virginia enacted legislation that allows utilities to recover up to 80% of their advanced nuclear development costs—such as engineering, licensing, and site permitting—on a current basis from ratepayers, providing early-stage financial certainty and helping to de-risk investment in first-of-a-kind nuclear projects.43 Similarly, Indiana enacted a tax credit equal to 20% of qualified investments made in manufacturing small modular nuclear reactors in the state and specified that tax credits can be carried forward.44 At the federal level, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) has utilized a milestone-based funding approach, releasing funds in phases as projects achieve specific technical and regulatory milestones.45 States could potentially implement similar milestone-based support mechanisms, which would encourage innovation and promote the investment of public funds in projects that demonstrate measurable progress and risk reduction.

Once the funding is in place, the focus can move to bridging the period between breaking ground and the moment the plant starts producing electricity and earning revenue. Construction-work-in-progress accounting (CWIP) enables utilities to place verified expenditures into the rate base as they occur, turning sunk costs into billable assets and preserving investment-grade credit.46 Florida employs a similar statute,47 and more than 10 other states now authorize some form of advanced-nuclear cost recovery, typically reinforced by prudency audits and performance-based true-up accounting that align shareholder returns with on-time, on-budget delivery.48

When revenue certainty, first-of-a-kind risk mitigations, subordinated public capital, long-term bonds, and balanced cost-recovery mechanisms operate in concert, they can help turn nuclear energy from a speculative gamble into a financeable infrastructure play, attracting cheaper capital, anchoring local supply chains, and accelerating the clean-energy transition.

Action 3c: Modernize market design to reward clean firm power

Most wholesale markets pay primarily for the next kilowatt-hour of energy, not for its multiple attributes, such as zero carbon, on-demand availability, and voltage support, that keep the lights on when solar production fades and gas prices spike. This focus can discourage investment in resources like advanced nuclear that, despite operating 24/7 with minimal emissions, requires long-term revenue certainty to secure financing. Because states set integrated-resource planning rules, oversee utility cost recovery, and influence regional market tariffs, they hold some of the levers to broaden compensation from the cheapest electrons now to the highest system value in the long run.

In multiple states, policy shifts are beginning to reflect that broader view. Washington State’s Clean Energy Transformation Act explicitly designates nuclear as a clean-firm asset that can satisfy utilities’ decarbonization mandates, providing a profitable compliance pathway.49 Illinois50 and New Jersey51 have extended their Zero-Emission Credit programs to prospective builds, turning avoided carbon into a predictable revenue stream rather than a retrospective subsidy. The California Public Utilities Commission is currently considering a staff proposal for technology-neutral, round-the-clock capacity solicitations that would enable nuclear to compete directly against combinations of renewables, storage, and demand response on the basis of reliability-adjusted cost.52 Industry analyses help back the economic case: Electricity markets with remuneration mechanisms such as capacity markets or contracts for difference, which recognize the contribution of nuclear energy to system reliability and resilience, are essential for supporting new nuclear investments, especially as grids incorporate higher shares of variable renewable energy.53

Action 3d: Collaborate regionally to amplify impact beyond state borders

Advanced reactors are capital-intensive assets designed to serve regional rather than strictly local demand. Stand-alone utility load forecasts and competitive market structures may not provide sufficient market signals to incentivize the development of a large nuclear reactor, especially in mid- and smaller sized markets, indicating the need for collaboration or shared investment approaches among utilities. Fragmented state rules on siting, cost recovery, and transmission planning often compound the problem by forcing every project to negotiate a unique regulatory maze. The result is chronic under-subscription: Developers struggle to line up enough credit-worthy offtakers, while states pursuing go-it-alone strategies miss out on economies of scale and may leave federal incentives on the table. Because states control zoning, resource-planning mandates, and most retail-rate design, they are uniquely positioned to convene multi-jurisdictional coalitions that pool demand, standardize criteria, and unlock shared infrastructure.

For example, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s study of multistate cost allocation for new transmission54 illustrates how coordinated planning can lower unit costs and shorten schedules. By agreeing on common siting parameters and synchronized procurement, member states create a single, reliable market rather than a patchwork of small bets. In April 2025, the governors of Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on nuclear energy development.55 This tri-state agreement focuses on multiple topics, including aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment, jointly navigating regulatory and environmental, and coordinating infrastructure development. A report published by the Southeast Nuclear Advisory Council shows the potential payoff for regional collaboration. In the Southeastern US region alone, the nuclear industry generates nearly $43 billion in annual economic impact, supports more than 152,000 jobs, and contributes $13.7 billion in labor income and $3.7 billion in annual tax revenues across five states. Interstate collaboration is key to achieving these outcomes, as it enables states to pool resources, harmonize workforce development initiatives, and coordinate supply chains—ensuring a steady pipeline of skilled talent and robust technical support for advanced nuclear projects.56 By working together, states can streamline regulatory processes, accelerate technology deployment, and may attract greater private investment, ultimately maximizing the economic and innovation benefits of advanced nuclear energy for the entire region.

Together, these four actions form a practical playbook that moves from siting and licensing through financing, revenue certainty and regional collaboration can help convert nuclear energy from a perceived high-risk gamble into a competitive advantage for economic development.

Strategy 4: Develop the workforce and supply chain

Advanced nuclear energy presents a significant opportunity for states to develop a new skilled and diverse workforce. The deployment of advanced nuclear energy and exploration of fusion technologies will increase the demand for talent in areas like construction, operations, manufacturing, and supply chain management. Achieving the US target to quadruple US nuclear capacity from 100 GW to 400 GW by 2050 will require a dramatic workforce expansion.57 According to the US Department of Energy, in 2024, approximately 100,000 workers supported the operation of nearly 100 GW of nuclear capacity.58 By 2050, an estimated 375,000 additional workers will be needed—100,000 for ongoing operations and 275,000 for construction and manufacturing.59 This potential surge in demand spans a wide range of skill sets, from engineers and reactor operators to welders, electricians, project managers, and supply chain specialists. States can position themselves as leaders in nuclear innovation by ensuring they have a workforce trained in advanced technologies and supported by local supply chains. By focusing on localizing the nuclear supply chain and using state-level incentives, states can meet the demand for nuclear energy while also promoting economic growth and creating career opportunities for their residents.

Action 4a: Scale the workforce for nuclear energy development

The potential rapid expansion of advanced nuclear power could create workforce opportunities for states. To realize the full potential of this sector, states can take a proactive approach to developing a robust, skilled, and varied talent pipeline—one that spans technical and nontechnical roles across construction, operations, manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain management.

Advanced nuclear energy projects may face significant workforce challenges, particularly because of shortages in critical skilled trades and specialized expertise required for building, operating, and maintaining advanced nuclear technology. To address these gaps, states can take proactive steps such as identifying and tracking constrained trades and critical skill shortages, offering financial incentives to attract and upskill workers, and establishing regional education and training programs in partnership with industry, labor unions, and educational institutions. Additionally, broadening recruitment and outreach initiatives to include non-traditional talent such as local unions, technical schools, high schools, adjacent industries, veterans, and former industry workers can be beneficial to building a robust nuclear workforce.

Action 4b: Identify and address potential workforce gaps

States can move beyond general workforce expansion and directly address specific gaps in skills and labor availability. This requires a data-driven, collaborative approach to workforce planning and development.

States could proactively:

Map current and future needs: Conduct comprehensive assessments to identify critical skill shortages and forecast future workforce requirements for advanced nuclear energy projects. Evaluate whether robust, granular data systems and tracking capabilities exist to identify workforce-related gaps. Additionally, assess whether existing workforce development institutions have the expertise and resources to address the unique labor demands of nuclear energy.

Leverage data and partnerships: Use labor market analytics and collaborate with industry, labor unions, and educational institutions to align training programs with real-time needs. Facilitate coordination among workforce development agencies, economic development authorities, and industry partners to maintain an up-to-date understanding of evolving skill requirements and respond quickly to changing market signals.

Targeted upskilling and reskilling: Develop and fund specialized training, apprenticeships, and certification programs for high-demand roles in nuclear construction, operations, and supply chain.

Expand talent pools: Launch outreach initiatives to attract workers from adjacent industries, Navy veterans with nuclear training, and local communities.

Monitor and adapt: Establish mechanisms to track progress, measure outcomes, and adjust strategies as workforce needs evolve.

Pennsylvania has leveraged its existing nuclear infrastructure to attract major private-sector investment. In partnership with Amazon, the state facilitated the development of data centers adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna nuclear facility. Amazon has committed to investing at least $20 billion in Pennsylvania to build multiple high-tech cloud computing and AI campuses, creating at least 1,250 high-paying tech jobs and thousands of construction roles, the largest private investment in Pennsylvania history.60 The initiative includes partnerships with local schools and workforce organizations for training and STEM education, while the state will invest $10 million in workforce development to support the further growth of that industry in the state.61

States can work to develop a skilled and diverse workforce for the nuclear sector through input and output economic modeling, strategic workforce development, and advising effective incentives and recruitment. By fostering collaboration and creating nuclear-specific technical education pathways and apprenticeships, states can attract the talent needed for successful nuclear energy deployment and operation.

Action 4c: Localize and lead the nuclear supply chain

Deploying advanced nuclear energy plants, as well as fusion technologies hinges on establishing robust, localized supply chains, robust inventories, and component redundancies for critical components such as reactor vessels, cooling systems, specialized valves, advanced fuels, and unique control systems. This positions states to become first-movers in a competitive global market. States can achieve this by investing strategically in nuclear manufacturing capabilities, fostering innovation through state-funded research and development grants, and creating economic zones to attract different types of manufacturers with tax incentives, infrastructure support, and streamlined permitting processes. Key actions include launching specialized training programs at community colleges and vocational schools to build a skilled manufacturing workforce, forging strong partnerships with domestic and international suppliers to enable a resilient supply network, and coordinating regional efforts to establish advanced manufacturing hubs that align supply chain strategies with national energy goals. States can also collaborate with industry stakeholders to share information and analyze supply chain vulnerabilities, with a special focus on identifying risks and gaps related to the most critical components in the nuclear value chain. This localized approach not only supports nuclear energy deployment but also drives economic diversification, generates high-skill jobs, and reduces potential reliance on foreign supply chains.

Virginia’s 2023 nuclear innovation package demonstrates the power that state-level incentives can have in driving workforce and economic development.62 By awarding competitive grants to support workforce development, research, and education, they established partnerships between the state’s universities, community colleges, and industry leaders. These efforts are designed to build a robust talent pipeline and attract advanced nuclear supply chain investments, reinforcing Virginia’s role as a regional hub for nuclear innovation.63",https://media.deloitte.com/is/image/null:1200-x-627,N,,2025-11-04 03:58:52.386659

The reversal has been swift.

In total, 1.1GW of renewable energy projects were selected for an LTESA.

The Stubbo Solar project will generate approximately 1,000GWh of electricity annually and features nearly one million solar PV modules across the site, which will continue to support grazing activities underneath and between the solar arrays in the form of agrivoltaics.

Readers of PV Tech will likely be aware that Acen Australia committed to recycling one million modules from the 400MW solar PV power plant last week, making Stubbo Solar the first large-scale project to earn certification from the Circular PV Alliance.

ACEN Australia managing director David Pollington hailed the project’s completion, stating that its development started “long before” the policy frameworks now shaping Australia’s renewable energy landscape were in place.

“As the market evolves, costs are rising, delivery conditions are changing rapidly, and market dynamics are shifting – these pressures are real, and they reinforce the importance of partnership between government and industry to ensure policy settings remain responsive, effective and investment-ready,” Pollington added.

Acen Australia began construction of the 400MW PV project in 2023, with the facility now amongst the largest solar projects built in Australia.

Stubbo Solar includes provision for a future 200MW/800MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), positioning the site to provide firming capacity as the electricity grid transitions to higher renewable energy penetration.

The battery component will enhance the project’s ability to provide dispatchable renewable energy during periods when solar generation is unavailable.

The project’s financing structure demonstrates the scale of ACEN Australia’s renewable energy development program. ACEN Australia completed AU$750 million debt financing for 1.3GW of renewables, supporting multiple projects across the company’s development pipeline. The financing package enables the company to simultaneously advance construction on several large-scale renewable energy facilities.

The project generated approximately 400 jobs during the construction period. The facility connects to TransGrid’s high-voltage transmission network, enabling efficient delivery of renewable energy to population centres across the National Electricity Market (NEM).

Stubbo Solar’s completion demonstrates the effectiveness of LTESA arrangements in providing investment certainty for large-scale renewable energy projects. The 20-year agreement structure provides revenue stability, supporting project financing while ensuring a long-term renewable energy supply for the electricity system.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Stubbo-Solar-project-in-New-SOuth-Wales-Ausralia-Image-Acen-Australia.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 02:17:45.673271

Emissions

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

Technology Roadmap Through 2050 Industry projections indicate near-zero emissions ironmaking technology could capture 35-45% of global steel production by 2050, representing a complete transformation of the industry.","The steel industry stands at the forefront of a revolutionary transformation with near-zero emissions ironmaking technology, which promises to eliminate over 95% of carbon dioxide emissions from traditional steel production. This groundbreaking approach replaces coal-dependent blast furnaces with hydrogen-powered systems, fundamentally altering how iron ore transforms into metallic iron. Furthermore, this technological shift represents a critical component of the global energy transition strategy, addressing one of the most carbon-intensive industrial processes.

The technology centres on replacing carbon-based reducing agents with hydrogen gas, fundamentally altering the chemical reactions that transform iron ore into metallic iron. This shift eliminates the primary source of CO2 emissions in steelmaking while maintaining product quality and production efficiency.

Core Technology Components

Modern near-zero emissions ironmaking relies on three interconnected technological systems working in harmony. Hydrogen-based direct reduction reactors serve as the primary processing units, where iron ore undergoes chemical transformation using hydrogen as the reducing agent. Electric smelting furnaces powered by renewable energy sources handle the final melting and refining stages.

Advanced gas recycling mechanisms capture and reprocess hydrogen throughout the system, maximising resource utilisation while minimising environmental impact. These integrated systems operate at lower temperatures than traditional blast furnaces, typically between 800-900°C, which reduces energy consumption while achieving superior environmental performance.

Environmental Impact Comparison

Production Method CO2 Emissions per Ton Primary Energy Source Water Byproduct Traditional Blast Furnace 2.1-2.3 tons CO2 Coal and coke Minimal Near-Zero Hydrogen Process 0.05-0.1 tons CO2 Renewable hydrogen Water vapour only Improvement Factor 20-45x reduction 100% fossil-free potential Zero harmful emissions

How Does Hydrogen-Based Direct Reduction Transform Iron Production?

Hydrogen direct reduction fundamentally reimagines the metallurgical processes that have defined steelmaking for centuries. Instead of carbon monoxide from coal combustion, this technology employs hydrogen gas that reacts directly with iron oxides at controlled temperatures and pressures.

The process follows the chemical equation: Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂ → 2Fe + 3H₂O, producing only water vapour as a byproduct. This reaction eliminates carbon dioxide emissions entirely at the reduction stage, representing the most significant environmental advancement in steel production technology.

Chemical Process Breakdown

The hydrogen reduction process occurs in multiple stages, each optimised for maximum efficiency. Iron ore particles are exposed to hydrogen-rich atmospheres where oxygen atoms bond with hydrogen rather than remaining with iron. The resulting metallic iron maintains the same structural properties as traditionally produced material while requiring approximately 30% less energy per ton.

Temperature control proves critical throughout the process, with precise management ensuring complete reduction while preventing unwanted side reactions. However, modern process technologies enable advanced monitoring systems that track gas composition, temperature gradients, and reaction progress in real-time.

Fluidised Bed Reactor Innovation

Revolutionary fluidised bed reactor (FBR) technology allows fine iron ore particles to react directly with hydrogen without requiring expensive pelletisation processes. This innovation reduces capital investment requirements by eliminating pelletising plants, which traditionally consume 3-5% of total steelmaking energy.

""Fluidised bed systems can process iron ore fines with particle sizes as small as 0.1mm, expanding the range of suitable raw materials and reducing preprocessing costs significantly.""

The fluidised bed design creates optimal contact between hydrogen gas and ore particles, achieving reduction rates 40-60% faster than conventional shaft furnace systems. This acceleration translates to smaller reactor footprints and reduced capital costs for new facilities.

What Role Do Electric Smelting Furnaces Play in Clean Steel Production?

Electric smelting furnaces (ESF) represent the final transformation stage in near-zero emissions steel production, where hydrogen-reduced iron undergoes melting and chemical refinement using electricity rather than fossil fuel combustion. These systems achieve temperatures exceeding 1600°C through electric arc or induction heating methods.

Renewable Energy Integration

When powered by renewable electricity sources including solar, wind, and hydroelectric generation, ESF systems achieve complete decarbonisation of the smelting stage. This integration requires sophisticated energy management systems capable of handling variable renewable power supply while maintaining consistent steel production quality.

Grid integration technologies including battery storage and demand response systems enable steel plants to operate efficiently with intermittent renewable energy sources. In addition, some facilities achieve 90% renewable energy utilisation through strategic scheduling and energy storage deployment, aligning with broader sustainability transformation initiatives across the manufacturing sector.

Operational Advantages Over Traditional Methods

Electric smelting furnaces offer several operational benefits compared to traditional blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace combinations:

Precise temperature control enabling consistent product quality

Rapid startup and shutdown capabilities supporting flexible operations

Reduced maintenance requirements due to fewer moving components

Lower emissions of particulates and sulfur compounds

This year’s COP30 in Belém, Brazil, will offer an opportunity for reflection and course-correction pertaining to previous announcements and commitments.

The United States has withdrawn from multiple key climate finance and mitigation pledges since COP29, leaving major gaps in funding and progress.

Regulatory frameworks for carbon markets and methane mitigation are advancing, even as nations fall short of meeting these goals.

Each year at the United Nations (U.N.) climate change summit, formally known as the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), countries from all over the world—alongside companies, non-governmental organizations, and subnational governments—convene to set new climate goals while building on past commitments to confront the climate crisis.

While the expectation is that these commitments will result in measurable action, there is no guarantee as it is challenging for countries to ultimately hold each other accountable. This year’s COP30 in Belém, Brazil, will offer an opportunity for reflection and course-correction pertaining to previous announcements and commitments. In November 2024, COP29 resulted in numerous advancements, such as the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance (NCQG) as well as the finalization of technical guidance for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which is related to carbon markets. There were also developments related to previous agreements like the Loss and Damage Fund and Global Methane Pledge. This article will summarize where these key efforts stand.

New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance

After lengthy negotiations, COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded with countries agreeing on an updated climate finance commitment to support developing countries’ climate action plans. The NCQG consists of core financing of $300 billion annually through 2035 from developed countries, with an additional call for $1.3 trillion per year, primarily from private financing. The NCQG is a key part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, with Article 9 stating that “developed country parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country parties.” COP29’s NCQG expands both quantitatively and qualitatively on the first climate finance goal of $100 billion per year, established at COP15 in 2009. The new goal specifies transparency guidelines and improved access arrangements, in addition to outlining channels for disbursement and different financial instruments that can be used. Despite the expanded financing, many countries and observers have expressed that NCQG is not ambitious enough, as it represents merely a fraction of developing countries’ climate finance needs. According to Carbon Brief, developing countries' climate finance needs are already predicted to reach $200 billion a year by 2030 even without additional efforts, indicating that the latest NCQG is inadequate to address the larger, growing need for climate funding. By some estimates, developing countries need $2.7 trillion annually by 2030 to meet their climate goals.

After COP29, negotiators, experts, and stakeholders gathered in summer 2025 at the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) in Seville, Spain, to address financing challenges related to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. This event marked the first time the FfD process was meaningfully connected to UNFCCC decisions. The resulting document, the Seville Commitment, called for resources to support the NCQG and other UNFCCC decisions.

Meanwhile, the United States has made dramatic cuts to its climate finance portfolio since COP29. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which had historically provided about one-third of all U.S. climate finance (including $3 billion in 2023), has been shuttered. Though some of its operations have been moved to the State Department, much of them have been canceled. Due to significant budget cuts in 2025, 150 climate and clean energy contracts and grants worth $1.2 billion have been terminated. The United States also withdrew its commitment of $4 billion for the Green Climate Fund, which provides climate-related grants and loans to developing countries. These cuts directly impact the NCQG target of raising $300 billion from developed countries every year.

The U.N. Environmental Programme’s (UNEP’s) Adaptation Gap Report 2025, issued in October 2025, found that the NCQG-–which covers both mitigation and adaptation—will not be achieved unless adaptation financing is dramatically increased. The report underscores the drastic gap in adaptation funding for developing countries, noting that wealthy countries are not upholding their commitments. They promised $40 billion annually by 2025 in adaptation aid but provided only $28 billion in 2022 and $26 billion in 2023 with limited signs of a turnaround. And the $40 billion goal is in any case completely insufficient compared to the $365 billion per year in adaptation funding that developing countries need according to the United Nations. The report does highlight that countries have made progress on closing the planning and implementation gap, with 172 countries now having a national climate adaptation plan.

Ahead of COP30, the COP29 and COP30 presidencies jointly announced the Baku to Belém Roadmap to $1.3 Trillion to support NCQG implementation. In April, the Ministry of Finance of Brazil (the country presiding over COP30) identified five priority areas to support the roadmap: multilateral development bank reform, the expansion of concessional finance and climate funds, improvements to domestic capacity to attract sustainable investments, the development of innovative financial instruments for private capital mobilization, and improved regulatory frameworks for climate finance. The two presidencies issued an initial working plan in May 2025, with June updates highlighting further consultations and engagement opportunities. COP30 will facilitate further discussion on how to implement and ensure accountability and transparency of the NCQG.

Loss and Damage Fund

Stakeholders at COP29 signed key agreements to fully operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund, which was launched at COP27 to address permanent climate change harms in developing countries. At the signing ceremony, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev declared that funding would flow in 2025. “This is an important win for vulnerable communities,” he said. “It is the result of years of work.”

In April, the U.N. Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage met in Barbados to discuss strategies to roll out funding. The workplan, named the Barbados Implementation Modalities, will provide $250 million between 2025 and 2026 to developing countries to respond to climate losses and damages, with 50% of the Fund’s capital going to small island states and the least developed countries. Participating countries have pledged around $760 million to the Fund, but have only paid $321 million so far. The United States pulled out of the board of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage in March 2025, raising doubts as to whether its pledged $17.5 million will be fulfilled. The Fund’s $760 million commitment is still well shy of the $400 billion needed to fully cover developing countries’ permanent climate costs, according to the Loss and Damage Collaboration.

COP29 marked progress on the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 as countries agreed on international standards for a centralized carbon market, in addition to a mechanism for updating the standards. Carbon markets are trading systems through which countries may buy or sell units of permitted greenhouse gas emissions (“carbon credits”) in an effort to meet their emission reduction targets. The centralized standards agreed upon at COP29 are intended to direct resources to developing countries, save up to $250 billion per year when implementing national climate plans, and vastly accelerate climate plan implementation.

Since COP29, the European Union has proposed reintroducing international carbon credits to help meet its 2040 climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90% relative to 1990 levels. The proposal would allow the European Union to use these international credits starting in 2036 to meet up to 3% of its 2040 climate target, provided they meet ""robust and high integrity"" criteria and align with Article 6. Indonesia also announced that it will allow international trade in carbon credits to resume after its 2021 moratorium. Prior to the moratorium, Indonesia was one of the largest suppliers of carbon credits to the international market. This new decree aims to attract foreign investment and advance Indonesia’s 2060 zero-emissions climate target.

The governments in Kenya, Singapore, and the United Kingdom have also launched and expanded plans this year for their respective countries' carbon credit regulations. Looking to COP30, the three countries announced the Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets, a government-led initiative designed to boost voluntary demand for carbon credits.

Global Methane Pledge

Announced at COP26, the Global Methane Pledge aims to reduce anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels. The United States, Azerbaijan (the COP29 presidency), and China led a summit at COP29 on reducing global methane and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions to make further progress toward the pledge’s goal. In 2024, 159 countries, along with the European Union, signed the pledge (however, membership alone does not signal action). According to the International Energy Agency, current methane policies and regulations are projected to reduce emissions by around 25% by 2030, falling short of the goal.

The Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) has been a significant part of the U.S. commitment to the Global Methane Pledge goal, providing up to $1.36 billion to reduce U.S. methane emissions through monitoring, detection, measurement, and quantification. However, with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L.119-21), $150 million dedicated to helping companies and communities cut emissions has been rescinded, and the program’s 2024 Waste Emissions Charge for polluters has been delayed until 2034. MERP’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which aims to increase transparency and accountability for oil and natural gas facilities, is also being reconsidered as of October 2025.

Meanwhile, a number of other countries have announced plans to reduce their methane emissions. In 2024, the European Union announced its regulation on the reduction of methane emissions in the energy sector, which targets methane emissions from fossil fuel operations. China issued a new air pollution standard, the Coalbed Methane (Coal Mine Gas) Emission Standard, which requires coal mine operators to capture gas with an 8% or higher methane concentration and a flow rate of at least 10 cubic meters per minute. Kazakhstan has also made headway on reducing methane emissions by announcing a commitment at COP29 to develop methane regulations in the fossil fuel sector as well as upholding fines on companies violating flaring regulations. In the private sector, the U.N. Environmental Programme’s International Methane Emissions Observatory reported that over 150 energy companies—representing 42% of global oil and gas production—are improving their methane reporting.

Other notable updates

COP26 in 2021 saw the launch of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs), an initiative by wealthier nations to help fund clean energy transitions in coal-dependent developing nations. Since then, the program has mobilized $50 billion in pledges from the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan (among others) to be directed to energy transitions in South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Senegal. This year, the United States withdrew from JETP, leaving the remaining funder countries to fill in the gaps.

COP27’s Early Warnings for All Action Plan (EW4ALL) called for targeted investments of $3.1 billion between 2023 and 2027 to improve disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, preparedness and response, and communication of early warnings for every person on Earth. EW4All National Consultative Workshops were held in The Gambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Belize, and Guyana in 2025 to advance this goal. The U.N. Development Programme announced a five-year project starting in 2025 to improve multi-hazard early warning systems for the most vulnerable communities in Antigua and Barbuda, Cambodia, Chad, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Fiji, and Somalia.

COP29 marked the first COP that included tourism in its action agenda, with talks culminating in the COP29 Declaration on Enhanced Action in Tourism signed by over 70 countries, including the United States. This declaration builds on momentum from COP26’s Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism. On World Tourism Day in September 2025, global leaders, industry experts, and community leaders met in Malaysia at the World Tourism Conference, which was themed “Tourism and Sustainable Transformation.” The event highlighted talks about driving sustainable tourism forward.

Trump said Monday that Virginia voters should back “Republicans up and down the ballot” in an effort to make the state more affordable.
Despite throwing barbs at Spanberger, Trump avoided key opportunities to endorse Earle-Sears by name.
On a call for Ciattarelli, Trump was effusive in praising the former Assembly member and business owner who he said loves the state and is fighting for lower costs.
“Mikie Sherrill will send New Jersey Jersey into a death spiral,” the president said.","TOTOWA, N.J. (AP) — New Jersey Republicans are trying to ride the coattails of Donald Trump’s 2024 electoral momentum, with gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli courting voters in a key — and traditionally Democratic — stronghold that contributed to the president’s gains in the state.

Ciattarelli and Virginia candidate Winsome Earle-Sears are crisscrossing their respective states, while Trump spoke at telephone rallies with voters later Monday. This comes after their opponents, U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, campaigned over the weekend alongside former President Barack Obama.

It’s a delicate balance for Republicans, who want to catch some of Trump’s electoral energy by drawing infrequently voting conservatives to the polls while not dismissing concerns about increasing costs. Democrats are urging voters to see the off-year election as a referendum on Trump’s economic policies and his efforts to expand his power.

Trump said Monday that Virginia voters should back “Republicans up and down the ballot” in an effort to make the state more affordable. “Republicans will bring back everything that you want,” he said at the virtual town hall alongside Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Still, the president was seemingly hesitant to assert himself in the race. Despite throwing barbs at Spanberger, Trump avoided key opportunities to endorse Earle-Sears by name. The lieutenant governor did not speak during the call.

On a call for Ciattarelli, Trump was effusive in praising the former Assembly member and business owner who he said loves the state and is fighting for lower costs.

“Mikie Sherrill will send New Jersey Jersey into a death spiral,” the president said.

Ciattarelli paid a visit to a crowded Irish bar in Passaic County, one of the traditionally blue areas that highlighted Trump’s strength in 2024. It’s also a county where the Department of Justice is set to send poll watchers.

At the bar, a reporter pointed out the president’s absence on the campaign trail and asked Ciattarelli: Is Trump a “liability” to him? The candidate was also asked to respond to attacks from his opponent that he would not stand up to the Republican president.

“New Jerseyans know who I am. I will fiercely defend the 9 million citizens of this state every day,” Ciattarelli said.

The stop featured a surprise appearance of the candidate’s son, Army Capt. Jake Ciattarelli, who flew in from Kuwait and showed up in uniform. Defense Department regulations impose broad restrictions on troops participating in partisan activity, especially in uniform, in an effort to maintain the military’s historically apolitical role in American society.

Sherrill, the Democratic opponent, spoke in Morristown, where her first campaign for Congress in 2018 got its start. She tried to cast the contest in New Jersey in clear national terms.

“It’s going to be up to the next governor to take on the federal administration to claw back as much money as possible and have them in court if they refuse to run programs that they should be running for the people of New Jersey,” Sherrill said. She has seized on the Trump administration’s decision to abruptly freeze funding for a project on the Hudson River to replace the aging rail tunnels that connect New Jersey to New York City.

In Virginia, Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin was knocking on doors for Spanberger and other Democrats. He said he felt confident that Democrats’ focus on affordability would pay off on Tuesday.

Martin said he felt the diverse array of candidates, from Spanberger and Sherrill to Zohran Mamdani, the party’s New York City mayoral candidate, did well because they put the economy at the forefront of their campaigns.

“People are going to vote their pocketbook issues, their kitchen table issues, their own family anxieties about their future, before any other issue they care about,” Martin told The Associated Press.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/11/6909512d3501a1.98989418.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 00:58:31.684255

We were the state that put the world on wheels and powered a great American century. That legacy of leadership, building and innovation is precisely what the Michigan House of Representatives voted to reclaim last week by passing House Bills 4124-4129, a bipartisan package designed to cement Michigan’s place at the center of the Great American Nuclear Renaissance.

Nuclear energy is the essential foundation for a secure and independent energy future. It operates 24/7, keeping our hospitals running, our manufacturing lines moving and our homes heated, regardless of the weather. By paving the way for next-generation reactors, we’re ensuring our grid is robust, reliable and ready for the demands of tomorrow.

But this bill package is more than just an energy policy; it’s a comprehensive blueprint for economic leadership and job creation. We are building a complete ecosystem right here in Michigan.

Investing in our people: We are establishing higher education grants to help colleges, universities and trade schools create and expand specialized training programs in nuclear and hydrogen technologies. This ensures high school graduates have a direct, affordable path to high-paying, skilled-trade careers, keeping our best and brightest right here in Michigan.

Attracting and retaining talent: The package creates a workforce attraction and retention scholarship program, offering grants and credits to graduates who commit to working at a nuclear or hydrogen facility in Michigan for at least three years. This is a deliberate strategy to grow our technical workforce and compete with neighboring states for talent.

Incentivizing innovation: We are introducing research and development tax credits to spur the design and development of next-generation reactor technology. We’re also implementing a production tax credit to reward companies that commit to manufacturing, refining and deploying that technology in our great state. We want them to build the future of energy in a state that knows how to build things.

This successful vote in the House reflects a powerful coalition — business groups, labor unions, academics, utilities and even environmental organizations — all united behind a single, shared vision. The momentum is undeniable. With the historic restart of Palisades already underway, and this comprehensive policy framework advancing, the world is watching Michigan.

We’ve cleared the House. Now, it’s up to the Michigan Senate to act swiftly to pass this essential, bipartisan package. Let’s send this to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's desk and show the nation that Michigan is still the state that innovates, leads and is ready to define the future of American energy.

When green turns geopolitical The green transition is no longer just an environmental project.
The green transition is no longer a story about carbon.
The United States now treats access to nickel, cobalt and rare earths as a matter of national security.","The global transition to clean energy is often treated as an unquestioned moral good. Electric cars line up in glossy advertisements as symbols of virtue — the modern expression of a world finally learning to live within its limits. To drive electric is supposed to represent being on the right side of history.

But moral certainty can be a dangerous comfort. Decarbonising the planet is an ethical imperative, but how we pursue it matters no less than why. The green transition is not a single act of redemption; it is a vast material process, and like every process it leaves marks on the world.

The quest to save the planet from the consequences of one resource is, quietly, being fuelled by another. Let me explain what I mean.

The hidden weight of clean energy

Cars are responsible for roughly 15 per cent of global carbon emissions, and electrification is central to the effort to decarbonise transport. Yet electric cars, for all their climate promise, come with a far larger appetite for raw materials.

An electric car is, in essence, a moving assemblage of the Earth’s most precious elements. Beneath the clean surface of its design lies a complex web of extraction: nickel, cobalt, lithium, graphite — each mined from landscapes that pay their own hidden price. On average, building an electric car requires several times more raw minerals than a petrol car. And as the world races toward electrification, the demand for these materials is set to multiply many times over in the next two decades.

This points to an uncomfortable truth: the clean-energy transition is, in material terms, one of the most resource-intensive undertakings in human history. And these minerals are not evenly distributed across the planet.

In effect, the world’s decarbonisation effort depends on a handful of regions that bear the environmental and human burden of extraction — places where clean energy’s promise looks very different from its marketing. The transition that aims to reduce carbon in the atmosphere risks increasing pollution, inequality and vulnerability elsewhere.

Cobalt is largely mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where artisanal miners — many of them children — dig by hand in dangerous conditions, feeding a global supply chain that is often opaque. Nickel increasingly comes from Indonesia, where the high-pressure acid leaching process used to extract it generates toxic waste and large greenhouse emissions if powered by coal.

Lithium is drawn from brine fields in Chile’s Atacama Desert, where water use has sparked tension with local Indigenous communities and ecologists. Graphite, though abundant, is overwhelmingly refined in China, which has introduced new export controls, and has turned processing into a strategic chokepoint.

For many of these countries, the irony is painful. They supply the world with the minerals essential for the clean-energy transition, yet they see little of the wealth it generates.

The Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance, produces almost three-quarters of the world’s cobalt, but earns a fraction of the profits once the metal leaves its borders to be refined elsewhere. Indonesia, despite its vast nickel reserves, relies heavily on foreign investment and technology for processing — a dependence that often limits local economic returns and deepens environmental risk.

This imbalance reveals an old pattern in a new disguise. Nations rich in natural resources, yet poor in processing capacity, are forced to sell their raw materials cheaply, while wealthier economies capture the high-value stages of the supply chain.

The energy transition may be green, but it is not automatically fair. Without deliberate reforms, it risks repeating the same colonial logic: extraction in the Global South to sustain consumption in the North.

When green turns geopolitical

The green transition is no longer just an environmental project. It has become an enormous industry — and with trillions of dollars at stake, a geopolitical one. The minerals that power the clean-energy economy are now instruments of national strategy, quietly replacing oil as the currency of global influence.

The green transition is no longer a story about carbon. It’s a story about power. The United States now treats access to nickel, cobalt and rare earths as a matter of national security. China, which dominates their refining, has tightened export controls in quiet assertion of its leverage. Europe is legislating self-sufficiency. The technologies designed to stabilise the climate are now reshaping the world’s balance of power. The green race is, increasingly, a minerals race.

What began as a moral and environmental imperative has become a geopolitical chessboard. And that shift raises a deeper question: if the pursuit of a cleaner planet reproduces the same extractive patterns and rivalries that scarred the last century, have we really changed course?

Who pays the price of progress?

As demand climbs, attention is shifting from land to the ocean floor — one of the last resource frontiers we barely understand. Across the Pacific, especially in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawai‘i and Mexico, the seabed is scattered with potato-sized polymetallic nodules rich in nickel, cobalt and manganese: exactly the metals modern batteries need.

Why look offshore at all? Because nodules offer high metal concentrations without digging pits or clearing forests. But the trade-offs are different, not smaller. Collecting nodules with seabed vehicles can crush slow-growing organisms, generate sediment plumes that spread far beyond the mining track, and disturb carbon-rich layers that have been stable for millennia.

Governance is racing to catch up. The International Seabed Authority is still finalising a mining code to govern commercial extraction in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Several state-sponsored contractors and private consortia are positioning themselves to apply once rules are in place, while a number of countries and scientific bodies have called for caution or moratoria until ecological risks are better understood.

The stakes are not only environmental. Many of the likely operational areas lie within or adjacent to the interests of small Pacific Island states that depend on healthy oceans yet have limited leverage in global supply chains.

In plain terms: the same pressures that once mapped oil politics onto deserts and coastlines are beginning to map battery-metal politics onto the deep ocean.

The ethics of the green future are complex

The clean-energy transition will not be judged only by how fast it cuts emissions, but by how fairly it shares its costs. The next phase of climate policy must reckon not just with carbon, but with conscience.

We already know the mechanics: smaller cars, better recycling, cleaner supply chains. But policies that treat the planet as an engineering problem miss something deeper. The transition is also a social contract — one that links the comfort of a driver in Melbourne to the safety of a miner in Kolwezi or a fisherman in Sulawesi. The true test of climate policy is whether it narrows those moral distances or deepens them.

This will demand more than technological optimism. It will require transparency about where materials come from and under what conditions, trade agreements that value environmental standards as much as efficiency, and public subsidies that reward restraint rather than excess. A future of heavier, more luxurious electric SUVs, powered by ever-larger batteries, would be a moral paradox dressed as progress.

Governments can set rules, but markets respond to demand — and that means us. The green industry will happily sell a car whose battery contains “dirty nickel”, if consumers remain content to drive it. If we truly care about sustainability, we must also care about the unseen human and environmental costs behind it, and demand better.

That means asking harder questions before we buy, supporting companies that source responsibly, and accepting that cleaner supply chains may cost more. Real change will not come from guilt, but from insistence — insisting that the technologies of the future are built on the ethics of the present.

Ethical consumption cannot be passive, and it may not be cheap either. If we care about clean energy, we must also be prepared to say so with our wallets and votes.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b2551142aac41a4bfedbe6b7d58895cc?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2250&cropW=4000&xPos=0&yPos=234&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-04 00:01:27.611312

The Louisiana Environmental Action Network filed suit Friday against Atalco Gramercy LLC in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The company operates the Atlantic Alumina facility that straddles the border of St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes on the west bank of the Mississippi River.

The 17-page pleading is based largely on pollution discharges state inspectors discovered during a series of visits to the facility beginning last year. The Illuminator detailed the extent of the pollution and its impact in a series of reports this year. The reports shed light on the high concentrations of toxic metals found in water and soil samples collected from the polluted areas. Much of the information was unknown to neighboring residents and local leaders.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has cited the facility for dozens of violations stemming from breaches in the levees surrounding the facility’s “red mud” waste containment lakes and numerous wastewater discharges into the river that exceeded permitted limits.

Atalco did not respond Monday to a request for comment.

The lawsuit cites many of the regulatory violations in a 606-page inspection report the Department of Environmental Quality began in September 2024 and completed in March. It also includes violations LDEQ inspectors discovered in subsequent visits to the facility in May and June.

Runoff from Atalco alumina refinery into Mississippi River raises environmental concerns

“In the aggregate, this litany of violations demonstrates that Defendant’s lack of care for the proper operation of the Facility has been reckless and with egregious disregard for the environmental and human impacts of its mismanagement,” the lawsuit states.

The Louisiana Environmental Action Network is asking the federal court to award an unspecified amount in civil penalties and legal fees and to declare Atalco’s unpermitted actions as violations of the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The group is also asking for an injunction to prevent further violations and require Atalco to install appropriate treatment technology at the facility.

Atalco refines bauxite, a rust-colored rock containing raw metals, at the refinery into alumina, turning it into an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum.

Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States, making itthe nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock.

For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Atalco stores the waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud containing highly corrosive and toxic chemicals, in large containment ponds surrounded by 50-feet-high levees.

In August 2024, federal inspectors discovered breaches in some of Atalco’s levees in which the toxic slurry formed erosion channels and flowed offsite into public areas. State inspectors then discovered several more levee breaches in the subsequent months. Atalco made repairs to its levees but inspectors found new erosion channels during a follow-up visit in May.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5C5A8788-scaled-e1762215226969-2048x1232.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:03:50.174455

The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on Trump’s unprecedented use of an emergency powers law to slap broad-based tariffs on imports from Canada and other major trading partners.

On social media Trump has called it “THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE EVER” and repeatedly claimed that the Ontario government’s anti-tariff ad campaign featuring an address by the late Ronald Reagan was an attempt to interfere with the case.

Many billions of dollars are at stake. If the administration loses in the Supreme Court, it may have to return tariffs paid by importers since the spring and will forgo a source of revenue that Trump has claimed is making America rich again.

Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit in Washington, D.C., says the stakes are also high for the functioning of U.S. democracy and for the Supreme Court.

“They have so far in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs,” Wydra said in an interview with CBC News. “From a separation-of-powers, constitutional standpoint, the question is huge.”

Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress has the power to tax or tariff, unless it passes a law that gives the president that authority.

Trump used a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy broad-based tariffs over a pair of what he declared to be national emergencies: the cross-border trafficking of fentanyl (for tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China) and the deep trade deficits the U.S. has with dozens of countries around the world (what Trump called his “Liberation Day” tariffs).

What the case hinges on

Whether IEEPA gives the president the legal authority to impose tariffs in this way and for those reasons is the fundamental issue before the court.

The case does not test the long-established power of a president to impose tariffs sector by sector, as Trump has done with imports of steel, aluminum and automobiles, to protect specific U.S. industries.

More than 40 organizations, individuals and interest groups have submitted “friends of the court” briefs ahead of Wednesday’s hearing in an effort to sway the justices.

Nearly all of those submissions, also known as amicus briefs, urge the court to rule that Trump’s use of IEEPA is illegal.

The list of those who’ve submitted legal briefs opposing the tariffs crosses a wide range of ideology, geography and profession, including some high-profile names:

Carla Hills, the former U.S. trade representative and lead negotiator of NAFTA in the George Bush administration.

Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, whose name is on a brief from a group of academics.

Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who served as successive chairs of the Federal Reserve Board from 2006 to 2018, are among the signatories of a brief from economists.

There are also friend of the court submissions from:

A group of small businesses in Florida who say they’ve been ‘grievously harmed by the illegal tariffs.”

Another group of import-dependent small companies led by a clothing business called Princess Awesome.

The owner of a small vineyard in Oregon whose lawyers say he believes empowering the president to impose tariffs in this way would be “the most evident unconstitutional transfer of legislative authority in his lifetime.”

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation, saying the tariffs “will ultimately hurt, not help, the economy.”

The submissions by the Trump administration’s legal team paint a completely different picture.

The tariffs “are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders,” says the main submission to the court from Solicitor General John Sauer on behalf of the Department of Justice.

Sauer says that IEEPA empowers the president with “a broad range of tools” to address international emergencies, and tariffs should not be excluded as an option.

His predecessors have used its powers to levy sanctions on enemy regimes, to ban transactions with groups that are deemed terrorist organizations or to freeze the assets of designated transnational criminal organizations.

Wydra says neither the long-running trade deficits nor the cross-border fentanyl trafficking are actually the kind of “unusual and extraordinary” threats that give the administration the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.

“Even if they did, they don’t have the power to enact tariffs this big. And even if they had that authority, they don’t have the authority to enact tariffs for an indefinite period of time,” she said.

Trump said last month that he might attend the oral arguments, but ruled it out Sunday night.

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.
CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground.
More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December.
Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.","California is halting its landmark electric bike voucher program with no announcement and millions of dollars still in the bank, and transit advocates are frustrated that the money appears to be going to a program geared toward electric cars instead.

The Electric Bicycle Incentive Program offered up to $2,000 to lower-income Californians to purchase e-bikes beginning last year. In a statement, the California Air Resources Board said only that it has redirected the funds toward another program “due to state budget constraints.”

“This is a recent outcome of legislative direction, and we have just started informing program partners,” CARB spokesperson Joe DeAnda said in an email, adding that it’s possible funding could be allocated for the program in future years.

But Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike), said she was told in mid-October that CARB would shift the program’s remaining funds to Clean Cars 4 All, a similar incentive program for electric vehicles.

While she said she felt the conversation was meant to be private, she expected it would be followed by a more formal announcement from the agency.

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.

According to Ramsey, about $17 million — more than half of the $30 million that’s been allocated to the e-bike program since its inception in 2022 — is set to go to the program for electric vehicles.

She said she was told that the funds were reallocated based on direction from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office to use any available CARB funding to continue supporting electric vehicle purchases as the federal government does away with its own incentives.

The Trump administration’s controversial “Big Beautiful Bill” passed in July ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 toward electric vehicle purchases.

“I think that’s really unfortunate that we’re responding to the current federal situation by limiting Californians’ ability to get really the cheapest and most economical, sustainable transportation option, instead of sort of doubling down and saying, ‘We have this really low-cost option that opens trips up for more people, and then we also have this other option for people who need cars,’” Ramsey said.

CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground. It wasn’t until 2024 that the agency began issuing $1,750 vouchers for a range of approved bikes to people whose annual household income fell under 300% of the federal poverty line. An additional $250 was available to applicants who met further income criteria.

The program was designed to expand access to an affordable transportation model, especially for non-drivers and people with limited mobility.

While it was heralded initially as an ambitious, and significant, step toward clean transportation, it also invited widespread criticism after a slow rollout, multiple pushed-back application timelines and two state investigations into Pedal Ahead, the nonprofit chosen to administer the vouchers.

Applicants also expressed frustration over technical issues with the application process once it got underway.

While the state’s electric vehicle incentive program has a rolling application process, the e-bike voucher program, by contrast, requires people to log onto the website at a prescribed time, click the application portal at just the right moment and enter their information under a time crunch.

“I found it a little bit surprising that the same entity would have two similar voucher programs run completely different ways … when they had an existing program that was already working, that was distributing a large amount of money as well,” Ramsey said.

More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December. A second drop in May yielded a similar interest level.

“There were a lot of challenges. I don’t think anyone will tell you different,” Ramsey said.

Still, she said, at least some of the technology and availability frustrations the program spurred were also a sign of its value.

“The program was successful in showing that if you give people the opportunity to get an e-bike in an affordable manner, that they will take that opportunity and they will use e-bikes,” Ramsey told KQED.

Future drops were expected incrementally as long as funding was available. DeAnda said a third application round had been planned for next year before funds were redirected.

Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.

“Such a popular program shouldn’t be ended,” said Christopher White, the executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. “It should be operated well and fully funded because it promises to transform the mobility habits of tens of thousands of Californians to be more sustainable, far safer, [and it’s] far less expensive for the individuals to operate their new vehicles.

Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.

“It definitely gives the sense that CARB knows that this is the wrong direction to be moving in, to keep it so quiet,” he said.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/240823-ValenciaTelegraphBikeLanes-33-BL_qed-1020x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 19:18:04.470596

In addition, the economic value of a given increment of renewable energy depends on what else is going on.
The adminstration’s argument that wind and solar power are essentially useless because they’re not dispatchable on demand is wrong.
If you keep doing it anyway, the only way to make use of your extra solar power is to add batteries, which add costs.
And the administration should drop its fossil-fuel identity politics and let the private sector keep building wind and solar facilities.","AMERICAN energy policy is currently locked in a fierce battle between people who say renewables will make electricity less expensive and people who say they won’t.

You’d think there would be a reasonably clear answer to this question, but this a case where both sides have it wrong.

Environmentalists, citing the falling costs of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels, tend to agree with Bill McKibben that “power from the sun and wind is now the cheapest power in the world.”

Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Chris Wright says that renewables “raise the system cost of electricity” because they are only intermittently available, and President Donald Trump’s administration is doing everything in its power to block their deployment.

In fact, the best answer to the question of how renewables affect retail electricity prices is unsatisfying: It depends.

As a new report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory makes clear, the extremely varied geography of the United States means that the cost per megawatt of generation is extremely variable.

In addition, the economic value of a given increment of renewable energy depends on what else is going on.

The adminstration’s argument that wind and solar power are essentially useless because they’re not dispatchable on demand is wrong.

For starters, batteries – which turn any source of electricity into a dispatchable one – are getting better all the time.

But beyond that, non-dispatchable power is useful because it complements other sources of power.

A renewables-heavy electricity grid might function better, for example, with gas-fired plants that ramp up and down according to how hard the wind is blowing.

The presence of wind turbines would still dramatically reduce gas consumption and therefore generation costs.

At the same time, environmentalists like to use metrics like the “levelised cost of energy,” which make renewables look cheaper than they really are.

It’s fine to look at how many megawatts a given solar array generates over the course of a year and calculate that this adds up to a low cost per megawatt.

But you still have to consider the cost of keeping the system up and running when the sun isn’t shining.

Value deflation

The big problem here is the concept of “value deflation.” When you start adding renewables to a previous all-fossil grid, they are extremely valuable.

You can use every electron your new solar panels generate, and save money by burning less coal, oil and gas.

As you add more, the price of daytime electricity falls. But that means that adding even more solar panels becomes less attractive.

If you keep doing it anyway, the only way to make use of your extra solar power is to add batteries, which add costs.

And while gently ramping your fossil fuel usage up and down to save fuel during times of high renewable generation is cost-effective, at a certain point you find yourself bearing high costs to maintain extensive amounts of backup infrastructure.

This is where a critical distinction drawn by the Lawrence report comes in.

In many states, mostly red ones like South Dakota and Texas, there are no policies in place to encourage renewable adoption, but the falling cost of wind and solar infrastructure has led to large investments that have lowered costs.

But other states, mostly blue ones, have adopted “renewable portfolio standard” policies designed to force utilities to increase their reliance on renewables regardless of whether it makes economic sense.

These policies raise costs.

It’s an awkward quirk of political fate that most of the states with the best geographic fundamentals for wind and solar growth happen to be politically conservative states on the Great Plains.

Conversely, the Northeast is politically progressive but not especially windy or sunny.

What’s more, renewables take up a lot of space, and northeastern voters tend to be reluctant to cut down forests or take up green space to build utility-scale renewable projects.

Misguided policies

The result is some very misguided policies, such as Maine’s now-eliminated programe to subsidise rooftop solar generation.

Because roofs are small and rooftop solar installations are labour-intensive, they are not very cost-effective compared to larger renewable projects.

Maine is also just not a very good place for solar power, as it’s not very sunny and is so far north that there is huge seasonal variation in the hours of daylight.

But geography isn’t everything. California has plenty of sunshine, and a non-coerced market would lead to plenty of renewable use.

But that wasn’t good enough for California policymakers, who’ve insisted on pushing the envelope on regulatory mandates, which have contributed to rising costs.

On some level, this debate is both unsurprising and inevitable.

Renewables emit less pollution than oil and gas, so environmentalists are willing to pay some economic cost to accelerate their adoption.

This is a tough sell for voters, though, so proponents of renewable energy are left with two discordant arguments: On the one hand, they say, renewables will reduce costs. On the other, they say that they are worth adopting even when they aren’t cost-effective.

None of this, however, comes close to justifying the Trump administration’s anti-renewable zeal.

In many places that neither mandate nor discourage renewable growth, renewables are growing rapidly in ways that reduce costs.

The price of batteries is steadily falling, meaning the amount of renewables the grid can efficiently absorb is growing. What’s more, electricity demand is now rising after a generation of stagnation, which means concerns about value deflation are much less pressing.

Environmentalists should admit that their preferred agenda of maximum feasible decarbonisation costs money compared to just letting markets and technology work.

And the administration should drop its fossil-fuel identity politics and let the private sector keep building wind and solar facilities. — Bloomberg

That framing assumes the transition will mean less: less energy, less growth, and a steady decline in fossil fuel use. But this rhetoric is, as Ambassador Anthony Agotha put it at last week’s Berlin Climate Security Conference, a “false choice.”

The reality is far more complex — and far more uneven across countries and regions. The question isn’t whether the transition will happen, but whether it will happen everywhere, in time, and in ways that foster stability and economic opportunity.

Building Partnerships to Unlock Economic Opportunities

For many low- and middle-income countries, the challenge isn’t a lack of climate ambition — it’s a lack of energy access. Globally, there are about 750 million people who still lack steady and reliable electricity.

Nowhere is this more evident than in sub-Saharan Africa, where about half of the population — an estimated 600 million people — lack access to electricity. Now, consider the pace of growing demand in the region, whose population is projected to nearly double by 2050, from 1.3 billion to 2.1 billion. In Somalia, for example, where only 50% of the population currently has access to electricity (just 24% in rural areas), the population is expected to double from 19.7 to 38 million people over the same period.

For many low-income countries, the “energy transition” is not about decarbonization — it’s about unlocking enduring economic development opportunities by providing power to homes, businesses, schools, and hospitals. But expanding energy infrastructure while lowering emissions will require financial, technological, and political partnerships that prioritize energy access by de-risking investment and localizing clean energy technologies and jobs. Without partnerships that provide an on-ramp for countries to simultaneously grow their economies and expand access, the global transition will stall.

Flipping the Narrative on Decline

Discussions of climate ambition are often framed as being in tension with energy and economic security. But fossil fuel dependence — with its price volatility, supply disruptions, and concentrated control — is rarely the picture of stability.

The question is not whether countries can balance climate ambition with energy security — it’s whether they can afford not to. Done right (recognizing that there is a lot packed into those two small words), the energy transition can be a pathway to stronger economies, more stable societies, and more secure futures.

The economics of clean energy are shifting fast. In 2024, renewables met 83% of global increases in electricity demand, according to Ember, with solar generation up 33% and wind up 7%. Yet the benefits are not evenly distributed. China and India were largely responsible for those increases. The International Energy Agency reports that only 15% of global clean energy investment — about $2 trillion annually — has gone to the Global South (excluding China). Meeting global targets will require that share to rise five- to seven-fold by 2030, reaching $1.7 trillion per year.

Meanwhile, the economic toll of climate inaction is already staggering. Between 2014 and 2024, nearly 4,000 extreme weather events affected 1.6 billion people and cost the global economy an estimated $2 trillion. In just the past two years, global economic damages reached $451 billion — a 19% increase over the previous eight years. In some countries, a single disaster can erase more than a year of GDP.

Last year, in the United States alone, 27 weather and climate disasters led to the deaths of 568 people and cost more than $1 billion in damages, collectively totaling $182.7 billion — about 20% of the Department of Defense’s budget for that year.

In fragile and conflict-affected states, the consequences are even more devastating. In 2023, torrential rains from Storm Daniel — made 50% worse by climate change, according to research — caused two dams to burst in Libya, killing nearly 6,000 people. Years of underinvestment in water infrastructure and near-total dependence on oil exports left Libya’s economy both highly exposed and poorly equipped to adapt.

The assumption that the energy transition will mean a simple, linear decline in fossil fuel use is misleading. Global energy demand continues to rise, but again, the drivers of that demand vary widely. In industrialized countries, AI is driving an increase in power-hungry data centers. But for poorer countries — those least responsible for climate change — energy access remains essential to development and industrialization. For many of those countries, fossil fuels are a necessary part of the equation. The question, then, is not if they are used, but how — with what technologies, under what rules, and with what accountability. Framing the transition exclusively around fossil fuel decline risks alienating the very countries that must be part of it. A better narrative is one centered on diversification, modernization, and energy security — not scarcity.

Pathway Dependency

The success of the global transition depends on what the largest economies (and largest greenhouse gas emitters) do — and how consistently they do it. Last April, acting assistant secretary of international affairs at the U.S. Energy Department, Tommy Joyce, said that net-zero policies put the US at a disadvantage compared to China. “…There are no wind turbines without concessions to or coercion from China,” he said.

China’s control over critical minerals and clean energy supply chains gives it enormous leverage, but it didn’t get there on its own. China’s accelerated economic growth presented an existential challenge to global ambitions to rein in global warming. The first decade of the 2000s was marked by significant cooperation between the U.S. and China, including a US-China Clean Energy Research Center. But while China adopted large-scale, industrial policies to solidify its leadership on renewable energy and elevate its role on the global stage, policy vacillations and inconsistencies in the U.S. have created structural disadvantages that hobble U.S. innovation, industry, and market access.

And while climate ambition has grown since the 2015 Paris Agreement, global emissions have not yet begun to decline. Much of the growth comes from emerging economies that still lack the means to transition quickly. Africa, for example, holds 60% of the world’s best solar potential yet receives less than 2% of global clean energy investment.

The energy transition is not a zero-sum game. It is an opportunity — to expand access, build economies, and ensure a more secure and sustainable future. Getting there requires reframing the conversation from one of limits to one of possibility, grounded in partnerships and a broader and longer-term perspective.",https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_1719187151.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:03:38.915052

In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How We Got Here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world—especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars—especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric Vehicles Are Cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An Opportunity for Cleaner Electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions—it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built—and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A Virtuous—or Vicious—Cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector—eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes—is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition—it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn’t just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors—power generation and transportation—while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

John Ketchum, NextEra chairman, president and CEO, said that the company expects to return the 615-MW Duane Arnold nuclear power plant in Iowa to service by early 2029 or possibly in the fourth quarter of 2028 — earlier than some analysts had expected.

On Oct. 27, the company announced it had signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with Google to reopen the plant, which stopped operating in 2020. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval.

In addition to reopening Duane Arnold, a second deal with Google will enable the companies to explore building new, advanced nuclear generation in the U.S., Ketchum said. The company continues to speak with other large tech companies and data center operators about potential deals, he added.

NextEra could also “optimize” its 1,185-MW Point Beach nuclear plant in Wisconsin and its 1,250-MW Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire, according to Ketchum.

Those plants and Duane Arnold could accommodate about 6 GW of small modular reactors, he said.

Renewables and storage backlog grows

NextEra is well positioned to serve hyperscale tech companies who may be required to bring their own generation if they want to interconnect to the grid, Ketchum said. It can attract customers initially with the rapid deployment of renewable resources and energy storage — the company signed contracts for 1.9 GW of battery storage in the third quarter — and follow up later with gas generation, Ketchum said. The company also has the ability to build transmission and new natural gas lines to serve data center campuses, he said.

At the same time, NextEra plans to renegotiate a growing number of power purchase agreements on existing assets for higher prices as those contracts begin to expire, Ketchum said.

“Returns have [never] been higher than I’ve ever seen them in this industry,” he said. “It’s just supply and demand. It’s that simple. There’s a lot of demand out there, and there’s just not as much supply to match it. And so that’s commanding premiums in the market and high and attractive returns.”

Its NextEra Energy Resources, or NEER, subsidiary added 3 GW of renewables and storage to its project backlog in the third quarter, including 1.9 GW of battery storage, 800 MW of solar and 300 MW of repowering existing projects, the company said.

The additions brought the company’s total backlog of renewables to 29.6 GW, net 1.7 GW of projects that were placed into service and 900 MW that were removed from the queue due to permitting and other delays.

Ketchum said he expects all or most of the delayed 900 MW to return to the backlog at a later date.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6rVR7glnFAZJf9g0kadNiQzGXjppdVlq6Rki6_6pqQs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9IQ0VfQnJvbmNvUGxhaW5zSUktMi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-03 18:19:02.908902

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn’t easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2431/files/2025/01/carbon-capture-pipelines-generic.png,N,,2025-11-03 22:17:18.079838

Schneider Electric Canada is implementing a strategy to promote low-carbon fuels through technological partnerships with domestic industries. The company is leveraging its experience in Denmark, where its automated solutions power the world’s first commercial e-methanol facility, to demonstrate the industrial viability of this model in Canada.

A proven model for new alliances

The Kassø facility in Denmark produces up to 42,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually using renewable electricity from a 304-megawatt solar park and captured biogenic carbon dioxide. The industrial site is fully automated with Schneider Electric technologies and operates through an integrated digital platform combining energy management, automation, and industrial software.

Based on this experience, Schneider Electric Canada aims to expand the approach through partnerships with energy producers, industrial operators, and technology suppliers across Canada. The objective is to support these players in transitioning to low-emission operations while securing energy and operational performance.

Technologies supporting joint projects

The company highlights a suite of technologies including Modicon M580 programmable logic controllers, Altivar Process low-voltage drives, and Trihal dry-type transformers. These solutions are interconnected via the AVEVA System platform, enabling centralised facility management and real-time resource optimisation.

This system allows for the creation of Unified Operations Centres (UOC), capable of coordinating multiple industrial sites with remote control and enhanced energy performance. These tools support the deployment of joint projects, notably in refining, chemicals, or heavy transport.

Tiny plastics, big problems: How states can address plastic pellet pollution

Microplastics are a rising health concern around the world, with rising levels found not only in our environment but also in our bodies. One of the main forms of microplastics entering our environment are plastic pellets, a pre-production microplastic that serves as the building block for all the plastic we use in our daily lives.

Unfortunately, plastic pellets are dumped or spilled in our waterways at incredibly high rates – with more than 10 trillion pellets entering our oceans annually.

Join Environment America and PIRG at our upcoming webinar, “Tiny plastics, big problems: How states can address plastic pellet pollution,” to learn more about plastic pellet pollution and ideas for how we can work together to tackle this environmental and public health threat.

Literally burning that money.” — Michelle Solomon, Energy Innovation Last week’s funding announcement advances Trump’s commitment to restore U.S. energy dominance, the official press release read.
The decline of coal energy is due to rising coal prices and the proven cost-effectiveness of alternative energy sources, including solar, wind and natural gas, said Solomon.
“Their pro fossil fuel agenda is intent on keeping deadly and expensive coal plants alive while Americans foot the bill and suffer the public health damage,” Drupp added.
But the reliability of coal plants may be overstated.","The U.S. Department of Energy has announced up to $100 million in federal funding for projects modernizing the nation’s remaining coal plants, nearly half of which were slated to close by 2030.

The investment, a fraction of what would be needed for a comprehensive upgrade, is unlikely to make coal power more affordable, energy experts and anti-coal advocates say.

On Friday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the Notice of Funding Opportunity, calling for applications to design, implement, or test refurbishments and retrofit systems that allow coal plants to “operate more efficiently, reliably, and affordably.”

The announcement outlined three key areas for development projects: advanced wastewater management systems, systems that enable plants to switch between coal and natural gas, and advanced “co-firing” systems that allow simultaneous combustion of both fuel types.

The funding comes just a month after the department announced $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” America’s coal industry.

That investment already included $350 million to recommission closed coal power plants or modernize plants and $100 million for the three development areas outlined in Friday’s announcement. The DOE did not respond to questions about why additional funds were announced just a month later.

Trump’s investments in coal are a drop in the bucket of what would realistically be needed to revamp the plants, said Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy research firm based in San Francisco.

“Those types of retrofits for a single plant can cost hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Solomon. “To do that for every plant in the coal fleet, you’re looking at billions of dollars. And you’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”

In April, following Trump’s “Beautiful Clean Coal” executive order, the Department of Energy rolled out a series of actions intended to reinvigorate American coal production. The department reinstated the National Coal Council as a federal advisory committee, offered long-term financing for coal infrastructure, designated coal as a critical material and mineral and ended a moratorium prohibiting new coal mining leases on federal land.

“You’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”

— Michelle Solomon, Energy Innovation

Last week’s funding announcement advances Trump’s commitment to restore U.S. energy dominance, the official press release read.

“For years, the Biden and Obama administrations relentlessly targeted America’s coal industry and workers, resulting in the closure of reliable power plants and higher electricity costs,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the report. “Thankfully, President Trump has ended the war on American coal and is restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

Yet Trump’s attempt to save coal from the brink is unlikely to succeed.

In 2001, coal made up half of the electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the United States. Today, it accounts for less than a fifth of generated power; the decline reflects the changing energy landscape.

The decline of coal energy is due to rising coal prices and the proven cost-effectiveness of alternative energy sources, including solar, wind and natural gas, said Solomon.

Analysis by Energy Innovation found that coal prices increased 28 percent between 2021 and 2024, while inflation rose only 6 percent in that time.

At 99 percent of U.S. coal plants—209 out of 210—it would be cheaper to replace energy with new wind and solar than to keep them operating, a 2023 Energy Innovation analysis found.

The Sierra Club has led the charge to close power plants in the U.S. through their decades-long “Beyond Coal” campaign. The new coal funding is “just the latest Trump administration action that harms people and the planet,” Sierra Club climate policy director Patrick Drupp wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News.

“Their pro fossil fuel agenda is intent on keeping deadly and expensive coal plants alive while Americans foot the bill and suffer the public health damage,” Drupp added.

Trump’s emergency orders to keep operating multiple coal plants slated for retirement have cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars in the last year alone.

A 90-day emergency order requiring continued operation of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan has generated an additional $80 million in costs since May. The company has said that it will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest, in accordance with the cost-collection process set by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Trump has repeatedly argued that coal is critical to improving the reliability of the American energy grid amid surging power demand. But the reliability of coal plants may be overstated.

Between 2013 and 2024, forced-outage rates (excluding planned outages for maintenance) for coal exceeded those for other major sources of electricity, including gas, nuclear and hydroelectric power, according to a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.

Most coal plants in the U.S. were built before 1990. Keeping those plants running as they age requires more and more money, leading utilities to schedule retirement dates for nearly half of all plants.

Solomon uses the analogy of car ownership to explain the decline of coal energy in the U.S. “If you have a car that has 250,000 miles on it, very little is going to bring that car back to new,” she said. “You can only do so much when the infrastructure is that old.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1240947794-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:22.657156

KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — On Wednesday, Nov. 5, at 6 p.m. ET, Ridgeline Voices and Tennessee residents will hold a rally in front of the Tennessee Valley Authority’s headquarters to protest the start of Ridgeline pipeline construction.

Enbridge-owned East Tennessee Natural Gas is starting construction on the 122-mile long Ridgeline pipeline for the TVA. Ridgeline would bring methane gas to TVA’s planned Kingston gas plant, and endanger hundreds of streams and waterways along its route. Instead of handing our money to a multibillion-dollar corporation with a record of environmental damage and explosions along other pipeline routes, these groups will call on the public utility to stop this dangerous pipeline and invest in clean energy.

WHAT: Rally to protest the start of Ridgeline Pipeline construction

WHEN: Wednesday, Nov. 5, 2025, 6 p.m. ET

WHERE: Outside of TVA Headquarters in downtown Knoxville (across from Bill Lyons Pavilion in Market Square, Knoxville, TN 37902)

WHO: Ridgeline Voices, a community group opposing the Ridgeline Pipeline; Tennessee residents impacted by the project; and allies with SAGE TN, Third Act TN, American Indian Movement Indian Territory Tennessee, the Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices and more.

This rally aims to correct the record by demonstrating that Tennessee residents do not want this pipeline or the rest of TVA’s gas buildout. The event will include speakers, giant puppets and music.

The expansion comes four years after the initial solar plant installation in 2021, and allows the plant to now generate more than 3 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, which is enough to power around 300 homes.

“This project represents another important investment in the cleaner, more efficient future we’re building across Bendix,” said Luis Quiñones, Bendix environmental and sustainability engineer. “It reflects our continued commitment to renewable energy, to our community, and to doing what’s right for the environment.”

By utilizing solar power, the BDC will avoid about 1,145 tons of CO₂ emissions each year, reducing the company’s dependence on the regional power grid, lowering site energy costs, stabilizing energy expenses, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

The solar panels cover pollinator-friendly vegetation that attracts bees, butterflies, and other species, all while enriching the soil and aiding stormwater absorption.

The site includes a one-for-one replacement commitment for any trees cut down during construction.

“Integrating biodiversity into industrial projects is one of the most meaningful ways we can multiply our positive impact,” said Quiñones. “This installation doesn’t just generate power – it regenerates the land it sits on.”

With more than 400 employees, Huntington is home to one of Bendix’s largest manufacturing, assembly, and distribution sites – and one of its greenest.

“This project shows what’s possible when engineering and environmental stewardship work hand in hand,” said Quiñones. “It’s a model we’re proud to keep moving forward.”",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/11/Bendix-Huntington-Solar-2025.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:45.704630

Denver-based Vantage Data Centers on Thursday announced it has partnered with the Wisconsin Building Trades Council to build the Lighthouse data center campus in Port Washington.

In October, Vantage revealed that Oracle and OpenAI were the investors for an artificial intelligence data center campus west of Interstate 43, which will have four data center buildings built on 500 acres and use more than a gigawatt of electricity. Through LLCs, Vantage bought around 2,000 acres of farmland north of the city of Port Washington.

Oracle and OpenAI partnered to invest $500 billion and add 10 gigawatts of capacity to AI-focused data centers across the country.

The partnership with WBTC will require a “peak workforce of more than 4,000 skilled construction workers over a three-year period,” Vantage officials said. The developer will rely on local union labor “to the fullest extent possible,” they added. Further details of the deal weren’t shared.

Vantage officials said construction will begin “very soon” and is expected to be completed in 2028. In addition to 4,000 construction jobs, officials said the facility will create more than 1,000 long-term jobs.

“This pledge recognizes the importance of building complex digital infrastructure with the best skilled professionals who deliver projects safely, on time and to the highest quality standards,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, in a statement. “We are excited to start working on this project, which represents a historic opportunity for Wisconsin workers to complete apprenticeships, support their families and invest in their communities.”

“Wisconsin has one of the most skilled and highly trained workforces in the country, and agreements like this prove it,” said Dan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building and Construction Trades Council, in a statement. “Every job created here means another opportunity for our local tradespeople to showcase their expertise and build careers right at home. When we invest in Wisconsin workers, we invest in Wisconsin’s future.”

“Vantage is proud to partner with Wisconsin’s union workers to build a once-in-a-generation, sustainable data center campus in Port Washington. We look forward to collaborating with local officials, the community and the Governor to break ground on this project with union support,” said Simon Casey, chief delivery officer of North America at Vantage Data Centers in a statement. “This is part of our ongoing commitment to the local economy and community, all while positioning Wisconsin as a leader in sustainable digital infrastructure.”

Vantage Data Centers officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company will invest $175 million in infrastructure improvements in the facility area, including new water and sewer systems, and Port Washington will reimburse the company through a proposed tax incremental financing district.

The city council is scheduled to meet Nov. 4 to review the district plan, which will need final approval from the Joint Review Board. The board will likely meet later in November.

Vantage operates 39 data center campuses across five continents, according to its website.

While the department put forth the new general permit in 2020, a string of legal challenges have kept the permit from taking effect.
Under Roos’ final decision, concentrated animal feeding operations cannot apply their waste to land as fertilizer in January, February and the first two weeks of March.
Roos also approved a ban on feeding operations giving away animal waste during the winter months.
“Now it’s time for the [feeding operations] to step up, be good neighbors, and stop the endless legal wrangling.","After meeting in August to hear arguments on updates to how the state permits large-scale animal feeding operations, Phil Roos, the director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy issued his final opinion Wednesday, laying out new terms for how the state permits livestock facilities.

Clean water advocates have applauded the new requirements, while agricultural industry representatives have begun exploring legal options to challenge Roose’s decision.

While the department put forth the new general permit in 2020, a string of legal challenges have kept the permit from taking effect. EGLE is required to issue new permits every five years, leaving the state to operate under the conditions of its 2015 permit for the past decade.

According to a 2024 report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which argued in favor of stricter permit requirements, the 290 confined animal feeding operations in the state produce 62.7 million pounds of waste daily, with many dairy and hog farms storing liquid waste in lagoons, which third parties apply to crop fields as fertilizer.

This waste can carry contaminants like E.Coli, phosphorus and nitrates, leading to harmful algal blooms in nearby waterways and polluting nearby drinking water.

In his decision, Roos agreed with EGLE attorneys’ recommendations to reinstate a ban spreading animal waste on snow-covered ground that was previously stripped from the permit by an administrative law judge. Under Roos’ final decision, concentrated animal feeding operations cannot apply their waste to land as fertilizer in January, February and the first two weeks of March.

The judge’s decision to remove this provision was not based on science or the department’s mandate to ensure compliance with water quality standards, but rather “convenience to farmers,” Roos said.

Roos also approved a ban on feeding operations giving away animal waste during the winter months.

Roos’ determination also permits EGLE to impose site-specific regulations for industrial feeding operations in watersheds that do not meet the state’s water quality standards, and individualized ground water monitoring requirements.

He also modified the 2020 permit’s date of issuance for the permit to expire five years from his Oct. 29, 2025 final decision.

While the decision did not adopt every recommendation put forth by EGLE and the many environmental advocacy groups who sought tighter protections, the decision was hailed by many of the intervenors as a step in the right direction for water quality.

“The legal and administrative challenges to this commonsense permit have wasted five years, during which [these feeding operations] were allowed to keep polluting Michigan’s waters,” Katie Garvey, a senior attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a statement. “Now it’s time for the [feeding operations] to step up, be good neighbors, and stop the endless legal wrangling. EGLE must now take swift action to implement the new [concentrated animal feeding operation] water permit.”

Megan Tinsley, the water policy director for the Michigan Environmental Council similarly called for a quick implementation of the permit’s new provisions, noting that more rivers and streams are impaired each year while water bodies cannot be used for their designated uses, like swimming.

“Our waters inspired the motto ‘Pure Michigan’ and support a $13.9 billion outdoor recreation economy,” Tinsley said. “EGLE must quickly implement the provisions in this long-overdue permit to prevent further degradation.”

However, the Michigan Farm Bureau, which has led the opposition to the permit changes, is already examining their legal options.

In an article published by Michigan Farm News, an official publication of the bureau, Laura Campbell, the group’s senior conservation and regulatory relations specialist, said Roos’s decisions would hinder farmers’ ability to provide nutrients and meet crop needs, while placing them under complex new requirements that will incur additional costs.

Both Campbell and Allison Eicher, assistant general counsel for the group, said Michigan Farm Bureau would be meeting with other industry groups and farmers to determine their next steps, with Campbell noting an appeal of the decision could be in the cards.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-170046503-700x383-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:25.525394

Holding all current Democratic seats isn’t a given.
Vance’s tie-breaking vote would give the Republicans control.
The Democrats are likely to pick up House seats, but will they pick up enough of them to matter?
They also disagree about Maine: Cook thinks it’s likely Democratic but Sabato thinks it only leans that way.","Here’s what things look like now, but a lot could change.

We’re now one year from Election Day. Because of polarization, environmental policy is closely tied to political party. The outcome of the election will shape environmental policy. If the Republicans maintain control of Congress, Trump will be relatively unchecked. Democratic control of the House or the Senate would prevent further rollbacks from Congress and would put the brakes on some of Trump’s anti-environmental efforts.

My observations are based on two well-established political websites, Cook and Sabato. Given all that’s happening, the situation will surely shift in the next year, but here’s what things look like right now.

Will the Democrats Take the Senate?

The “out-party” typically does well in off-year elections, but the Senate map is tough for the Democrats. Republicans currently hold 53 seats and the Vice-Presidency, so Democrats need to hold all of their current seats and pick up four more for control. Holding all current Democratic seats isn’t a given. Sabato and Cook both rate Michigan and Georgia as toss-ups at this point.

Picking up four new seats wouldn’t be easy. The best two shots are North Carolina and Maine (now considered toss-ups.). Ohio is next, rated by lean Republican by Cook and Sabato. After that, you’re into states that are rated “likely Republican”: Iowa and Texas. Democrats would have to carry one of those, and will need some strong tailwinds to do so.

However, even without flipping control, closing the gap in the Senate could still make a big difference. For instance, if the Democrats win North Carolina, Maine, and Ohio, then the Senate would be tied. Vance’s tie-breaking vote would give the Republicans control. But Lisa Murkowski would then be an essential vote for Republicans, and she’s a maverick who could play a role like Manchin did for Democrats under Biden.

Will the Democrats Win the House?

Gerrymandering will make a big different next November, since Republicans are trying to eliminate competitive seats in their states and Democrats are retaliating in their own states. Cook sees 17 and Sabato sees 18 toss-up House races. In Cook’s count, Democrats need to keep all their own toss-up seats and pick up 6 GOP seats to win control, Republicans only need to win only 2 toss-up races. Sabato sees 13 toss-ups, but fewer Democratic seats that category. This results in more of a level playing field, with Democrats needing to win 7 of the 12 toss-up races in seats currently held by Republicans, while Republicans only need 5. Either way, Republicans have at least a slight edge.

This edge is a tribute to the success of Republican gerrymandering in eliminating competitive districts. (I’m simplifying things – there are also a bunch of “Lean” districts, and wins in those districts would provide a cushion for either party in the toss-up races.) If Prop 50 passes in California, which is now expected, that would make the prospects more balanced between the parties.

The Democrats have two big advantages going into the race. The first is the long history of out-party success in off-year elections. The second is that turnout in those elections is lower than in presidential elections, and Democrats now have strong support from the affluent, educated voters who have the highest turnout. Trump won with the support of people who don’t usually vote but turned out for him. It may be hard to duplicate that when he’s not on the ballot.

Candidate quality will make a difference in these close races. But the biggest factor will be the nation’s political mood. Will Trump be seen as successful (even if some supporters don’t like him that much)? Or will there be a huge backlash? That may turn on the state of the economy as much as anything. The Democrats are likely to pick up House seats, but will they pick up enough of them to matter?

What About the Statehouses?

Governors are important players in state climate policy. Sabato and Cook agree that the races in Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin are toss-ups; New Jersey leans or is likely Democratic, and both Kansas and Iowa lean Republican. Cook thinks Georgia and Nevada are toss-ups; Sabato thinks they lean Republican. They also disagree about Maine: Cook thinks it’s likely Democratic but Sabato thinks it only leans that way.

I suspect that the outcomes will be driven partly by candidate quality and partly by whether there’s a national wave (although governor’s races seem slightly less nationalized than House race or Senate races).

Obviously, it’s early days. The Democrats will need to get some luster back on their brand and see some tarnishing of Trump’s if they’re to prevail. Otherwise, it will be more of the same in Congress until 2028.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Midterm2026-blog.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:18:47.710576

Michigan has been working to counter actions taken by Trump and other Republican officials that would deal a blow to the state’s clean energy efforts.
In 2024, Michigan was awarded $156 million in Solar for All funding for 13 pilot projects around the state.","Michigan’s clean energy future has faced major setbacks, with companies scaling back projects and laying off workers due to federal policy changes and funding cuts made by President Donald Trump’s administration.

According to new reporting from Climate Power, a national public relations and advocacy organization dedicated to climate justice, 158,000 clean energy jobs across the country have been canceled or delayed since Trump entered his second term. Michigan accounts for over 6,000 of those jobs, including the 1,200 workers General Motors announced in late October would be laid off at an electric vehicle plant in Detroit.

“Donald Trump’s policies are singlehandedly engineering a collapse of manufacturing projects in Michigan,” Climate Power communications director Alex Glass said in a statement. “On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs and lower costs – instead, he’s leaving Americans with higher utility bills and pink slips. Michigan Republicans will have to answer to voters for why they’ve co-signed an agenda that is sending American manufacturing jobs overseas and making daily life unaffordable.”

Michigan has been aggressive in its push toward clean energy in recent years, even setting a goal of reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2040. According to Climate Power, Michigan was the No. 1 state in the nation in 2024 in its number of clean energy projects: From 2022-2024, the state announced 74 projects totaling over 26,000 jobs and roughly $27 billion in federal funding.

That progress has been disrupted under Trump, who has long been critical of the country’s climate policies and the development of clean energy technology. He’s made false claims that climate change is a hoax and that wind turbines cause cancer. Since taking office again in January, Trump has unsuccessfully attempted to pause funding awarded to climate groups through President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and signed an executive order to boost coal production.

Michigan has been working to counter actions taken by Trump and other Republican officials that would deal a blow to the state’s clean energy efforts.

Most recently, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced in a press release on Oct. 17 that the state had joined officials of 22 other states in suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for what they charge was their illegal ending of the Solar for All program, a $7 billion initiative aimed at lowering energy costs for low-income households.

In 2024, Michigan was awarded $156 million in Solar for All funding for 13 pilot projects around the state. The attorney general’s office says in the press release that the loss of federal funding has halted these projects and “denied disadvantaged communities across Michigan the benefits the program was designed to deliver.”

“The Trump Administration’s decision to illegally rescind congressionally approved grants – funds that were already being put to work in our communities – is unlawful and deeply harmful to residents across Michigan and the country,” Nessel said. “We’ve seen this playbook from the White House before. The administration has tried to pull the same stunt by canceling congressionally mandated programs, and we stopped them then. We plan to do the same now to ensure the Trump Administration cannot unlawfully strip away these important investments that lower energy costs and make clean energy more accessible to Michigan families.”",https://michiganindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SolarPanelsDetroit_23109645366259.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:01:57.766323

Email address Thank you!

With the first month of sales reports coming in post-tax-credit, U.S. EV sales have taken an absolute drubbing. The highly publicized end of EV subsidies had the precise effect analysts predicted, encouraging sales in the final months of its availability (and likely leaving demand depressed for months to come). Even in cases where brands stepped in with their own incentives, the sales have essentially vanished, and as automakers flex away from electric models to ICE vehicles in the coming, we expect the segment to stay relatively cool.

Bear in mind that not all automakers report their sales figures monthly anymore, so we won’t have a clearer picture of what’s happening industry-wide until January (after Q4/full-year sales are announced). Here’s a preliminary look:

Hyundai – Ioniq 5 sales took an absolute beating, dropping more than 60% compared to a year ago. Total Ioniq 5 sales are still up nearly 25% for 2025, so it’s not all bad news there. Ioniq 6 sales were down 52% in October and remain down 4% for the year; worse than that, it was only moving in triple-digit monthly volumes to begin with. Hyundai’s sold fewer than 10,000 of the sedans this year. Hyundai sold nearly as many Ioniq 9s as it did Ioniq 6s, but that’s not saying a whole lot…

Kia – EV6 sales likewise dropped by two-thirds compared to last October, as did sales of the three-row EV9. EV6 sales have declined by a third in 2025 overall, going the opposite direction of the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Kia doesn’t break down Niro sales by powertrain, but the smaller crossover was up by 75% last month despite a lingering full-year sales deficit.

Honda – It should come as no surprise that the Prologue took it on the chin in October (down 80% to just over 800 units). That was still better than the (now dead) Acura ZDX, which recorded just 25 sales last month (down from 1,200 a year ago).

Subaru -It may surprise you to learn that Subaru was generally on pace to match its 2024 total of just over 10,000 Solterras sold in 2025, but that came to a screeching halt in October. Subaru sold just 13 of the EVs last month.

Short version: It’s a bloodbath. It likely won’t stay this ugly long-term, but we’re not expecting any big surprises from the segment any time soon. A lot of pent-up demand was just satisfied by EVs being discounted while the credit was still good, so even in cases where prices haven’t changed all that much, it stands to reason that the automakers were spending more to move metal while the feds were still picking up the tab for the discounts.

The end result may not have changed all that much for the customer, but a whole lot of potential profit evaporated overnight, and automakers would rather focus on selling models that won’t lose them money outright.

We’ll keep our eyes peeled for any other big news on the EV sales front; in the meantime, if you’re hunting for a leftover, your favorite brand might be in the mood to deal just to get it off the lot. Can’t hurt to try.

Synthetic graphite is essential not only for EV batteries, but also for semiconductors, grid-scale electrical storage, nuclear reactors, defence systems, and steel production.","Vianode, a Norwegian producer of advanced battery materials, announced that its first large-scale production facility for low-emission synthetic anode graphite will be developed in Ontario, Canada. Synthetic graphite is an essential component in lithium-ion batteries and is critical for a range of defence and industrial applications. Vianode’s production facility was featured as part of Canada’s leadership in the G7 Critical Minerals Production Alliance and will contribute to the diversification of resilient, domestic supply chains that use this critical mineral.

The project is structured as a phased, multi‑billion‑dollar investment, starting with an initial investment of over CAD 2 billion. Over time, planned expansions will bring total capacity to as much as 150,000 tons annually, supporting a secure North American supply chain for critical minerals that power strategic industries.

“North American supply chains are heavily reliant on graphite sourced from China for lithium-ion batteries, defence technologies, nuclear technology and more. A large-scale facility in Ontario delivering high-performance anode graphite solutions will provide Canada with domestic capacity that will make supply chains more resilient. This scalable project is a key building block that aligns with recent shifts in trade policy and supports our ambition to be a leading and trusted supplier for G7 supply chains,” says Burkhard Straube, CEO of Vianode.

“Canada is proud to support Vianode in advancing critical mineral development that aligns with our national priorities and international commitments, and proud they chose Canada for North America’s first large-scale low-emission synthetic graphite production facility. Through the Critical Minerals Production Alliance, we are working with trusted partners to deploy sovereign tools, mobilize investments and financing, and secure offtake arrangements to accelerate the development of secure, resilient critical minerals supply chains. These minerals will power the clean energy transition, strengthen our defence and manufacturing capabilities, and position Canada as a trusted supplier to our allies,” says the Honourable Tim Hogdson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

“Canada’s support for Vianode reflects our commitment to responsible resource development and international collaboration. By advancing projects that align with the goals of the Critical Minerals Production Alliance, we are helping to build resilient supply chains, drive innovation, and bolster Canada’s position as a trusted global partner in the continued development of more clean energy and advanced manufacturing,” adds Claude Guay, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

Synthetic graphite is essential not only for EV batteries, but also for semiconductors, grid-scale electrical storage, nuclear reactors, defence systems, and steel production. As demand accelerates globally, supply chain security is a pressing issue.

Vianode’s planned facility will establish a resilient and sustainable battery supply chain in North America and enhance the region’s access to strategic materials, in addition to creating around 300 highly skilled jobs in the initial phase and up to 1000 at full capacity.

Ontario was chosen after an extensive selection and due diligence process. A front-end engineering design (FEED) study has been conducted, and ground preparation works are under way to enable start of production in 2028.

“Canada and Vianode are a perfect match. Ontario is home to major manufacturing hubs, with access to world-class infrastructure and a low-carbon electricity grid. The province has all the characteristics we are looking for. During our North American selection process, I have seen first-hand a strong shared commitment to closing the strategic gaps in the critical minerals supply chain and creating jobs that will strengthen Canada’s economic resilience,” says Emanuele Tricca, Vianode’s Managing Director in Canada.

Vianode has produced synthetic anode graphite at its industrial pilot facility in Kristiansand, Norway since 2021, and in 2024, the company started operations at the world’s most sustainable synthetic anode graphite plant Via ONE at Herøya, Norway. Vianode recently launched the first high-performance anode graphite solution based on recycled materials, as part of its next-generation material series.

The agency posted changes on the individual websites of the Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and Office of Land and Emergency Management.

In an email, spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said the changes “will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,” a reference to the administration’s slogan for its EPA agenda.

The agency, meanwhile, “continues to work through the reorganization process for the remaining program offices and will provide updates as they become available,” Hirsch added.

She didn’t respond to followup requests for more detail on the reorganization’s expected benefits and whether employee layoffs — technically known as reductions in force — will accompany any of the three reorganizations.

POLITICO’s E&E News reported last week that EPA was poised to unveil new structures for the air and solid waste offices. The potential impact of the enforcement office makeover left one retired agency official scratching his head.

“It doesn’t look like it did anything dramatic, but it’s hard to tell without more detail,” Larry Starfield, who served as the enforcement office’s principal deputy assistant administrator, said in an interview.

A new organizational chart for the land office shows a pared-down Office of Land and Emergency Management, down from 10 suboffices to five. The Superfund, federal facilities and emergency response offices have been condensed into one — the Office of Superfund and Emergency Management — and gone are the stand-alone offices dedicated to communications, management and staffing.

OLEM’s other flagship programs, including Brownfield grants, resource conservation and regulating underground storage tanks, saw few changes to their organizational structures. While Trump administration officials have voiced intentions to expedite hazardous waste cleanups with fewer resources, it is still not clear how the redesign will impact daily functions.

For the air office, however, the changes loom as the most significant since implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

Gone are the Office of Atmospheric Protection, which handled most of EPA’s climate work, and the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), which set national limits for smog, soot and other common pollutants and write regulations for power plants and other industries.

To varying degrees, the standards office’s responsibilities will now be divvied out among the newly created Office of Clean Air Programs and the Office of State Air Partnerships.

“Overall, I can’t say this is a bad thing for OAQPS as the functions all still seem to be there,” Chet Wayland, a retired senior air manager, told E&E News in a text message after reviewing the new structure. “But the reality of what each of those branches gets tasked to actually work on will be interesting.”

Wayland saw no evidence of greenhouse gas or climate initiatives surviving in the new structure.

Meanwhile, Energy Star, the energy efficiency rating program for appliances, has been moved from the now defunct Office of Atmospheric Protection to the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air.

What’s next for Energy Star?

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s plan to abolish Energy Star provoked opposition from both industry and environmentalists. The New York Times on Saturday reported that Zeldin is reconsidering. But Hirsch said Monday that “no final decision has been made at this time.”

It’s unclear how much economic activity is generated by Energy Star, as it “does not preclude the purchase or sales of any product,” Hirsch said.

“The Trump EPA is committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and a program that essentially is a government-sponsored advertising scheme doesn’t seem like a good use of hard-working Americans’ money,” she said.

Two people familiar with internal operations said the fate of the program remains uncertain.

“I think [EPA] realized it’s a little more complicated … given how many industries use it,” said a person granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on internal deliberations.

“It doesn’t seem like they’ve made any decision,” the person said.

Unlike the Department of Energy’s mandatory efficiency rules, Energy Star is voluntary. EPA sets standards that businesses can choose to meet and verify independently before displaying the program’s blue label on appliances, buildings and homes.

Energy Start supporters say federal data shows that the program saves consumers and businesses more than $40 billion a year — an amount higher than its annual appropriations.

More than 1,000 companies, cities and organizations sent a letter to EPA in April urging support for Energy Star, which they called “among the most successful public-private partnerships in U.S. history.”

Zeldin has called for privatizing the program, telling lawmakers in May it requires “a big taxpayer-funded staff.”

The restructurings unveiled Monday arrived about two weeks after EPA announced comparable reorganizations of its chemical safety and research wings. Throughout the process, agency leaders have provided little information on staffing or the potential effects on the agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment.

The restructurings are all part of an agencywide retrenchment that Zeldin announced this spring in the course of a downsizing drive predicted to save more than $300 million this fiscal year and cut EPA’s workforce to levels close to those found during the Reagan administration.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/b4/aa/8513fcea441ba7747d29070ee854/epa-17823.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:01:32.972127

On the finance front, leaders set a target last year to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually from all international sources for developing countries' climate action by 2035.
As for climate resilience, the 2021 ""Glasgow pledge"" to double adaptation finance expires this year, and countries must decide on a new goal at COP30.
This work provided key input to the Baku-to-Belém Roadmap and was an important step toward better integrating finance ministers, who are key to scaling up climate finance, into international climate talks.","While the impacts of climate change are becoming ever-clearer, so too are the benefits of action.

The shift toward technologies like renewable energy and electric vehicles is already cleaning the air and preventing deaths from pollution. Countries investing in greener development models are creating millions of new jobs in areas like power and manufacturing. Clean energy is lowering electricity costs and bringing power to those without.

Yet this transition is not happening nearly fast enough to prevent increasingly dangerous climate impacts, and progress remains uneven. As some countries forge ahead on low-carbon development, others are pulling back. Meanwhile, the cost of climate change continues to rise: Extreme weather caused over $300 billion in damages last year alone.

What we need now is a step change. The world must move from setting targets to delivering them. The upcoming UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil is a prime opportunity to do so.

WRI experts have laid out four key areas where COP30 can put the world on track for a safer, more prosperous future:

Deliver robust national climate commitments, using detailed global and country plans to close the gap in climate action.

Transform the global financial system so that all forms of finance (public and private, domestic and international) support the transition to green, inclusive, resilient economies. Ensure that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most.

Step up climate resilience by recognizing that investing in adaptation means investing in growth, security and development; by delivering an ambitious new adaptation finance goal; and by setting clear, measurable indicators for tracking progress.

Protect nature, reform food systems and advance Indigenous land rights: three key elements for tackling the interconnected climate and nature crises together.

So, what must COP30 achieve in these areas and beyond to be considered a success? Here's what our experts are looking for:

Embrace Climate Action as an Economic Strategy

Right now, we face many headwinds for climate action and multilateralism. The U.S. has stepped back, and there are similar discussions of slowing down in parts of Europe. But that's not the whole story. Across the 50 countries WRI works in, what we see on the ground is that progress is happening.

All of the leaders I speak to from developing countries see this transition as their best economic opportunity, not as a burden. This is especially true in large middle-income countries. China and India are driving record renewable deployment, especially solar. Economic growth driven by clean energy is now even more of a motivator than climate. As COP host, Brazil is also showing how an economy rooted in forest protection, rather than destruction, can create over $8 billion in additional GDP and more than 300,000 new jobs in the Amazon region by 2050. For these countries, economic prosperity, energy security and decarbonization are essentially the same thing, driving the momentum we're seeing today.

There's a geopolitical realignment of climate leadership taking place. These middle-income countries played a key role in shaping the outcome [at COP29 in 2024] in Baku. With their large populations, substantial emissions and significant stores of biodiversity, they will continue to play an outsized role in determining the success of the global transition for people, nature and climate. We are watching closely to see what form their leadership will take at COP30.

Accelerate Action on National Climate Commitments, Finance and Adaptation

Melanie Robinson, Global Climate, Economics and Finance Director, WRI

All countries are due to deliver new national climate plans (known as ""nationally determined contributions,"" or ""NDCs"") this year. Sixty-five countries had formally submitted NDCs as of Oct. 27 — and the current plans fall far short of what's needed to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. Several major emitters are still expected to put forward plans ahead of or during COP30, which could help. But a substantial gap remains.

In Belém, leaders must agree on a decisive global response to address this shortfall. This includes: 1) reaffirming the 1.5 degree C goal and developing an ""Ambition Framework"" which sets out how to close the gap to achieve it; 2) accelerating sector-specific strategies to cut emissions from areas like energy and transport before 2030, reflecting the outcomes of the 2023 Global Stocktake on climate action; and 3) clarifying pathways to achieve countries' net-zero goals, particularly through updated long-term strategies.

On the finance front, leaders set a target last year to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually from all international sources for developing countries' climate action by 2035. The forthcoming Baku-to-Belém Roadmap will lay out pragmatic strategies to achieve this goal, showing how countries can get all sources working together as a system to deliver finance for the transition at scale. At COP30, countries must demonstrate how they will turn this plan into action. One promising development to look for is the unveiling of ""country platforms"": various country-led approaches that aim to align all sources of finance behind countries' climate and development plans, policy reforms and investment pipelines.

As for climate resilience, the 2021 ""Glasgow pledge"" to double adaptation finance expires this year, and countries must decide on a new goal at COP30. Some developing countries are calling for a needs-based target while others are calling to triple adaptation finance by 2030. Our own forthcoming analysis shows that a tripling is achievable by 2035, but it would take increases across all sources (including multilateral development banks' funds for the poorest, bilateral funds, new sources of concessional finance, and more private finance being mobilized), and finance working better as a system.

COP30 also offers an opportunity to adopt a set of progress indicators under the Global Goal on Adaptation. This will create a common language to track resilience-building efforts and the support needed. Done right, this can help put resilience at the heart of countries', communities' and corporates' core economic, development and business planning.

Strengthen Pledges that Align Action on Climate and Nature

Mariana Oliveira, Director of Forests and Land Use, WRI Brasil

We won't meet our climate goals — not on mitigation, not on adaptation — if forests and ecosystems aren't part of the plan. The science is clear that protecting and restoring nature and transforming food systems are powerful tools to cut emissions, build resilience and reduce climate impacts. The challenge? Mobilizing the resources to scale these solutions.

One initiative to watch at COP30 is the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that will be launched by the Brazilian government. This bold proposal offers predictable, performance-based payments to countries that keep their forests standing, moving away from dependence on philanthropy. Brazil has already pledged $1 billion to the fund, and other countries, such as the U.K., Colombia, Norway and Indonesia, have expressed their support for it. But for the TFFF to work, it needs at least $25 billion to be announced during COP. Whether developed countries will step up is a key question.

Countries should also deliver a strong package to bolster Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' land tenure rights and increase funding to them. While these communities are some of the world's most effective forest stewards, their territories are under constant and increasing threats, and many lack legal rights to the lands they manage. COP30 can help by delivering an improved Forest Tenure Pledge 2.0 and ensuring that Indigenous Peoples and local communities receive at least 20% of funding from the TFFF.

Equally essential is unlocking investments in sustainable agriculture and land restoration. One development to watch is the launch of the RAIZ (Resilient Agriculture Investment for Net-Zero Land Degradation) initiative. This proposes innovative financial mechanisms to fund the restoration of up to 250 million hectares of degraded land by 2050 — while at the same time increasing global food production.

Alongside RAIZ, complementary initiatives already underway in Brazil (such as the National Productive Forests Program and the Action Plan for Deforestation Prevention and Control in the Amazon) underscore the country's emerging leadership in integrating action on climate, nature and food systems. Advancing this cohesive agenda more broadly can help ensure that COP30 delivers not only on climate ambition, but also on resilience, equity and shared prosperity.

Under Brazil's Leadership, Make This the 'COP of Implementation'

Karen Silverwood-Cope, Climate Director, WRI Brasil

In its role as COP president, Brazil is bringing a clear and ambitious vision to COP30: to make Belém the ""COP of Implementation."" The Presidency's central challenge is to turn promises into real-world action — bridging divides between developed and developing countries, ambition and equity, mitigation and adaptation. The Brazilian Presidency has outlined three priorities that began to be articulated and implemented in 2024 and will culminate in Brazil's COP Presidency by the end of 2026.

First, Brazil has been working to align climate and economic priorities over the last year through convenings like the G20 and BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa] summit, putting finance at the heart of international climate talks. Brazil also launched the COP30 Circle of Finance Ministers, bringing together representatives from 37 countries who developed concrete recommendations on concessional finance, multilateral bank reform, country investment platforms and regulatory frameworks to unlock capital flows. This work provided key input to the Baku-to-Belém Roadmap and was an important step toward better integrating finance ministers, who are key to scaling up climate finance, into international climate talks.

Second, Brazil is redefining regional leadership, rooted in cooperation between emerging economies. For example, the Rio Declaration at the recent BRICS summit signaled a readiness among emerging economies to lead a resilient, low-carbon transition — from green bonds and tropical forest protection to new trade and carbon accounting initiatives.

Finally, Brazil's presidency is working to weave together the broader web of actors that drive progress outside of formal COP negotiations. It aims to deliver an ""Action Agenda"" that can better align all actors behind various climate commitments and processes (like the Global Stocktake, NDCs and long-term strategies), promoting transparency and accountability in climate action.

Other key deliverables to watch for at COP30 under Brazil's leadership include progress on the Just Transition Work Programme and the Gender Action Plan and the development of indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation.

Wes Moore in April.

The Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club, the Center for Progressive Reform, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Earthjustice, Elders Climate Action Maryland, Environment Maryland Research and Policy Center, Maryland League of Conservation Voters and Maryland PIRG Foundation sent a letter encouraging the PSC to move quickly to acquire storage and to prioritize storage connected to solar energy projects.

“The Next Generation Energy Act wisely requires the state to expand energy storage capacity and renewable buildout and we encourage the legislature, Gov.

Approving clean energy and storage projects ahead of the January deadline will enable Maryland to benefit from expiring federal tax credits and help drive electricity prices down. In light of expiring tax credits, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine and Oregon have moved to expedite similar processes and Maryland advocates are calling for the state to follow suit.

“Pairing battery storage with solar power is a win-win for energy customers and the planet,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director for Chesapeake Climate Action Network. “This technology is the best way to move forward in the clean energy transition and reduce peak load demands on the grid.”

The parties also maintain that the partnership will facilitate the growth and future of the American nuclear power industry and the supporting supply chain.

As part of the partnership, at least $80 billion of nuclear reactors will be constructed using Westinghouse technology.

“Our highly successful partnership with Brookfield as owners of Westinghouse will be further strengthened through this collaboration with the U.S. Government,” said Tim Gitzel, CEO of Cameco. “We expect this new partnership to support the global growth opportunities for both Westinghouse’s and Cameco’s nuclear products, services and technologies, adding significant long-term value for our stakeholders and enhancing energy, national and climate security around the world. As a strategic partner, Cameco is a secure and reliable western-based supplier of the uranium fuel needed to support the civilian deployment and long-term reliable operation of Westinghouse’s technology in the U.S. and globally.”

The partnership also contains profit sharing mechanisms that provide for all parties once certain thresholds are met.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, President Trumps’ recent executive orders granted the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

According to a report by S&P Global, datacenter grid power demand is expected to rise 22% in 2025 alone and nearly triple by 2030. After decades of relatively flat electricity usage in the United States, datacenters are expected to draw vast amounts of power, creating demand strain on the grid.

“When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid – and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy, Meta.

The two Louisiana projects are expected to generate over $100 million in lifetime state and local tax revenue and create jobs in rural areas during project construction. About 300 jobs are expected to be created during peak construction.

The program, which has had bipartisan support for more than three decades, was targeted by Trump as part of his reckless and revenge-driven war on clean energy.

“Donald Trump promised to lower costs – and instead, his energy policy is sending costs through the roof and making appliances more expensive. It’s no wonder his policies are also deeply unpopular with everyone from business leaders to fellow Republicans. Eliminating this program will suck money out of Americans’ wallets and create even more uncertainty for businesses already reeling from Trump’s tariffs,” said Climate Power senior advisor Alex Witt. “American families are already struggling to pay their bills – and instead of offering relief, Trump is trying to do everything he can to make life even more expensive.”

The New York Times: E.P.A. Retreats From Plans to End the Energy Star Program

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has quietly retreated from plans to eliminate Energy Star, a popular program whose iconic blue labels help consumers to choose energy efficient dishwashers, refrigerators and other home appliances.

In a rare shift, Mr. Zeldin is reconsidering his announcement from May that he would end the program, which triggered intense pushback from business leaders and congressional Republicans, according to four people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Shortly after Mr. Zeldin said he would eliminate Energy Star, the E.P.A. renewed four contracts with ICF, a consulting firm that helps administer the program, according to federal records. One contract was renewed through September of 2030. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

Brigit Hirsch, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in email that “no final decision has been made at this time” on whether to keep Energy Star…

“It is unclear what the economic activity generated by the Energy Star program is versus what the economic activity would be without this program,” Ms. Hirsch said, adding that “the Trump E.P.A. is committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

Since its creation in 1992, Energy Star has helped households and businesses save more than $40 billion annually in energy bills, according to a 2023 federal report. The E.P.A. has spent a fraction of that amount — about $32 million — to run the program each year.

Mr. Zeldin is weighing options for keeping Energy Star in some form, although a final decision has not been made and could be delayed by the government shutdown, said the four people briefed on the matter.

One option is transferring staff and funding for Energy Star to the Energy Department, which already plays a small role in running the program, the people said. Another is requiring appliance manufacturers to pay fees that would help cover the cost of the initiative.

Either choice would represent an unusual reversal for the E.P.A. In their zeal to terminate what President Trump has called the “green new scam,” agency officials have scrapped several other policies that even their allies in the oil, automotive and utility industries were not clamoring to reverse.

Regardless of what Mr. Zeldin decides, many E.P.A. employees who work on Energy Star have quit, retired or taken a buyout package since Mr. Trump took office. Other workers in the program have been furloughed as part of the government shutdown or reassigned as part of an agencywide reorganization…

“Energy Star is a hugely successful, voluntary program and the Energy Star logo is probably one of the most well-known logos in the country, if not the world,” said Francis Dietz, vice president of public affairs at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group.

But for years, Mr. Trump has railed against efficiency standards for home appliances, saying in April that more efficient shower heads did not spray enough water on his “beautiful hair.” Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, has also pushed the E.P.A. to slash what he sees as wasteful green spending.

Yet on Capitol Hill, Energy Star has attracted rare bipartisan support, with lawmakers in both parties saying the program lowers energy costs at a time of rising electricity prices nationwide.

“I know that my constituents like knowing what the energy usage is of a particular appliance so that they can factor that into their buying decisions,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told CNN in May.

Ms. Collins declined to comment on Energy Star when asked by a reporter on Wednesday. In July, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees bucked Mr. Trump by proposing to provide level funding for the program for the next fiscal year.

The wrangling over Energy Star’s fate began in early May, when E.P.A. managers announced during an internal staff meeting that the program would grind to a halt.

“The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,” a manager told employees during the meeting, according to a recording of the remarks reviewed by The New York Times.

During a congressional hearing two weeks later, Mr. Zeldin claimed that Energy Star was “not a statutory obligation set by Congress” and that “this program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government.” In fact, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the E.P.A. and the Energy Department to run the program. (The E.P.A. officials who helped Mr. Zeldin prepare for the hearing were not aware of this mandate, according to two people familiar with the matter.)

The pushback was swift and intense.

The following month, in June, a coalition of industry groups wrote in a letter to congressional leaders that they would “strongly support continuation” of the program. The groups represented a range of businesses, including appliance manufacturers, chemical companies, home builders, retail stores and even bakery owners and hot tub distributors.

Appliance manufacturers and retail stores in particular like Energy Star because it helps sales. Around 90 percent of Americans recognize the program’s logo and many see it as a trustworthy way to identify efficient products, surveys have shown.

“We’re very supportive of the program remaining in the federal government,” said Jill Notini, a spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, one of the groups that signed the letter…",https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-Image_Climate-Power.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:04:01.454672

The partnership between the departments of Defense and Commerce and Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies seeks to enable 10,000 metric tons of magnet production in the U.S. each year.

Vulcan Elements said in a press release it will be able to build and operate a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S.

Company chief of staff Jonah Glick-Unterman told The Hill in an email that the magnets in question can be used for virtually all electronic devices: satellites, robotics, drones, electric motors, hard disk drives and nearly all defense systems.

Under the deal, the military will provide Vulcan Elements with a $620 million loan from its Office of Strategic Capital, while an additional $50 million will come from the Department of Commerce under the CHIPS and Science Act.

The Office of Strategic Capital will also give ReElement Technologies an $80 billion loan to expand its recycling and processing operation.

The press release states the Commerce Department will get $50 million worth of equity in Vulcan Elements while the Pentagon will get “warrants” in both Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies.

Stock warrants would give the government the right to purchase a stock at a certain price. It’s not entirely clear how big a stake in the companies the government will seek to take, and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to questions from The Hill.

The Trump administration has been focused on shoring up its supplies of minerals and particularly rare-earth elements, seeking to use them in military applications in particular.

It has also sought to take a share of several companies it provides funding to, including in the minerals sector.

The magnets in question are neodymium iron boron magnets, with neodymium considered to be a rare-earth element. Such minerals are not necessarily rare, but are often found in small deposits on the Earth’s surface and can therefore be uneconomic to mine.

For this reason, we recommend that Congress begin by creating a Commission on Policy Evaluation, modeled on the successful Commission on Evidence-Based Policy Making.","In principle, there is a long-standing and broad bipartisan consensus in favor of robust ex-post evaluation of federal environmental policy. Proponents of ex-post evaluation note its many possible benefits—these include identifying (and eliminating) ineffective programs; improving the quality of ex-ante analysis; and facilitating regulatory experimentation. In reality, a number of political, institutional, and cultural barriers have blocked the emergence of any consistent practice of ex-post review. These barriers have persisted for decades, through administrations of both political parties and during periods of both united and divided government. They arise from consistent features of the administrative state, rather than the temporary politics of any particular moment. Overcoming them will likely require sustained reforms efforts.

Based in part on a series of interviews with senior government officials with decades of experience in environmental policymaking, this report identifies a set of ten interrelated barriers that have inhibited the development of a robust practice of environmental policy evaluation at federal agencies. These barriers are partially the result of political dynamics, but they also arise from agency institutional constraints, incentives, and cultures. Our research identifies the following leading barriers to ex-post evaluation:

Many agencies lack dedicated funding to carry out ex-post evaluation.

Agencies have highly constrained agenda space, making it difficult to prioritize ex-post evaluation.

Agencies face adverse political incentives to engage in self-scrutiny that may open them to political attacks.

Although agency personnel often have essential domain knowledge, they may lack the expertise to carry out rigorous ex-post analyses.

Agencies may lack (or believe they lack) legislative authority to carry out certain types of ex-post review.

It is often not clear how agencies should integrate the results of ex-post evaluation into decisionmaking, given that major regulatory decisions are rare.

The self-evaluations of agencies, even if carried out in good faith, may not be perceived as trustworthy by relevant stakeholders.

Ex-post evaluation often raises difficult questions of causal inference that agencies may be ill-positioned to address.

It is often difficult for agencies to collect the data needed to engage in ex-post evaluation.

Many agencies have not developed a culture of evaluation.

Given the identified barriers, we propose a suite of potential reforms for Congress to consider. These proposals are based on prior experience with ex-post review, analogous efforts within and outside the government, or suggestions that interviewees raised. We offer options at different levels of ambition, recognizing that enthusiasm to dedicate substantial congressional effort to the project of improving ex-post evaluation may vary. These levels of ambition can also be understood as scaling with time, so that more ambitious proposals, while perhaps unrealistic in the short term, may be more plausible over longer time horizons.

At the lowest level of ambition, Congress could use the appropriations process to direct funds to environmental policy evaluation. So as not to interfere with agency operations, and to avoid the impression that policy evaluation necessarily comes at the expense of programmatic goals, such funds should be made as additions to agency budgets, rather than as reallocations of existing resources. Appropriations directed to ex-post review would, most obviously, address the barrier of a lack of dedicated funds. Such appropriations would also require agencies to prioritize, to at least some degree, ex-post evaluation, regardless of their limited agenda space. Additional funding would also facilitate the acquisition of expertise as needed.

At a similar level of ambition, Congress could contemplate small-bore reforms that could ease the process of ex-post evaluation. For example, the Paperwork Reduction Act places procedural and substantive limits on agencies’ ability to collect data—a core prerequisite of ex-post evaluation. Given limited agency resources and competing priorities, these burdens act as additional roadblocks that can sap momentum from evaluation efforts. Targeted reforms to the Paperwork Reduction Act could reduce these burdens while still ensuring that the core purposes of the Act are protected. Efforts to identify other similar facilitating reforms may be warranted.

At a higher level of ambition, Congress could create legal requirements for agencies to engage in policy evaluation, either of specific programs or more broadly. The most extensive ex-post analysis of environmental policy making that has been carried out to date was prompted by section 812 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In response to this congressional directive, the Environmental Protection Agency developed considerable expertise and dedicated significant resources to estimating the costs and benefits of air quality policies. Similar mandates could be effective, especially if coupled with additional funding and facilitating reforms. Legislative mandates would require agencies to devote at least some of their finite agenda space to ex-post evaluation, and, based on prior experience, would likely result in agencies accessing the expertise needed to carry out these evaluations in a rigorous fashion. Mandates would also clarify that agencies have authority to carry out ex-post evaluations.

A further measure at a similar level of ambition would be the creation of a specialized group of policy evaluation experts, within the Executive Office of the President, tasked with coordinating and facilitating ex-post evaluation efforts. Ideally, such a Policy Evaluation Group (PEG) would operate across a wide range of agencies (not only those with environmental portfolios), would be structured to be as politically neutral as possible, and would serve a supporting, rather than overseeing, role. The primary function of the PEG would be to provide human resources and expertise for agencies that are interested in engaging in policy evaluations. In this way, it would address issues of funding and expertise. A reform along these lines could also help increase the perceived trustworthiness of ex-post evaluations, given that outside experts would be part of the team that designed and implemented the analyses.

A more ambitious step that Congress could take would be the creation of a National Institute for Policy Evaluation and Review (NIPER), modeled on other scientific funding institutes. This new agency would fund collaborations between academic institutions and government agencies to engage in large-scale policy evaluations designed to identify and address key areas of uncertainty across a range of policymaking domains. Environmental policies would be one of several portfolios that could be overseen by a funding agency of this kind, which could also support research in areas such as education and criminal justice. A NIPER-like entity would have considerable potential to address most of the barriers to ex-post evaluation.

Finally, Congress could contemplate deeper statutory reforms designed to encourage agencies to integrate the results from ex-post evaluations into regulatory decisionmaking. Ex-post evaluations are only useful if they provide information that serves as an input into agency decisionmaking. However, the laborious rulemaking process, which includes litigation and the attendant risk of judicial invalidation of agency decisions, means that agencies are not well-poised to update rules based on new information. Recent moves by the US Supreme Court to reduce agency discretion has further constrained the ability of agencies to act on the information from ex-post evaluations. Congress may wish to contemplate legislation to ensure that the process of judicial review does not interfere unduly with flexible and responsive agency decisionmaking.

Reforms of some significant ambition are likely needed to address barriers that, for decades, have inhibited ex-post evaluation. But such reforms require considerable study and coalition building before they would become politically feasible. For this reason, we recommend that Congress begin by creating a Commission on Policy Evaluation, modeled on the successful Commission on Evidence-Based Policy Making. This new Commission would be charged with studying policy evaluation across the federal government, examining state and comparative analogies, and consulting with experts to generate a set of concrete recommendations for additional congressional action. The Commission would help generate the knowledge base necessary to support well-informed congressional action and could also act as a forum for bipartisan coalition building.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2447977967.width-600.png,N,,2025-11-03 19:04:54.330101

Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.

“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.

Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.

Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines, and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.

Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.

Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.

Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.

“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”

Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.

“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”

Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.

Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”

The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.

The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.

The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”

The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”

Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.

“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.

The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.

The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.

“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.

Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.

Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.

Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.

Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.

Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.

It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.

Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.

Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.

Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.

HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.

Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.

“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.

“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”

Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry aﬀairs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.

Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.

Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On October 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.

They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.

This measure passed the House earlier this year, but is still waiting for Senate approval.

“Hopefully they will pass it because I think that would also send really a fantastic message to the global economy that our state’s open for business,” Spuller said. “There’s no reason not to pass that. That would be on my wish list.”",https://www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design.png,N,,2025-11-03 17:02:05.627399

She said locations may have to change if some of the 2024 awardees are no longer interested in hosting an EV charging station.
You know, our goal is still to maximize coverage, reliability and accessibility to EV charging across the state,"" she said.
He said he would like to see Indiana use that funding to address concerns about the charging program that advocates have raised over the years.
Abdul-Rahman said having EV chargers could also reduce emissions in those communities.","The state is moving forward with its plans to place electric vehicle chargers along Indiana's interstates. The Indiana Department of Transportation paused the federally-funded program in February while awaiting new guidance from the Trump administration.

The goal of the program is to reduce the fear that EV travelers will run out of battery life before reaching a charging station. The Trump administration originally sought to rescind funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, but changed course after facing lawsuits.

Among other things, the new guidance no longer requires chargers to be placed every 50 miles and within one mile of an interchange or major corridor.

Natalie Garrett with INDOT said this will help get chargers installed more quickly — potentially in places with less access. She said locations may have to change if some of the 2024 awardees are no longer interested in hosting an EV charging station.

""I think overall, improved flexibility is a benefit. You know, our goal is still to maximize coverage, reliability and accessibility to EV charging across the state,"" she said.

Garrett said the process ""streamlined and simplified"" Indiana's plan. States also no longer have to address several things under the new guidance, including ""consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.""

David Konisky is a professor at the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University in Bloomington. He said the new guidance is not ideal, but getting more chargers on the road is the most important thing at this early stage — and the gaps in coverage could be filled in later.

""Right now across the United States and here in Indiana, they're just not enough of these fast chargers — what were called 'level three chargers' — to really facilitate the driving of electric vehicles, especially on long trips,"" Konisky said.

The guidance was also stripped of references to diversity initiatives. Indiana is no longer required to engage with minority and women-owned businesses or make sure chargers benefit disadvantaged communities.

Jorden Giger is the assistant director of project outreach for the nonprofit Black Sun Light Sustainability.

""There's going to have to be intentional organizing, you know, on the part of organizations like ours, minority business associations to be able to connect diverse businesses to the opportunities,"" he said.

Giger said 10 percent of the NEVI funding is set aside for technical assistance for states. He said he would like to see Indiana use that funding to address concerns about the charging program that advocates have raised over the years.

The new guidance also encourages the chargers to be located ""at retail locations with onsite amenities that could provide safe locations and restrooms."" The Federal Highway Administration doesn't spell out what it means by ""safe locations.""

Denise Abdul-Rahman is Black Sun Light Sustainability's CEO and founder. She is also the state chair for environmental climate justice for the NAACP of Indiana.

""So just wondering what that will mean to make sure that communities that aren't invested in — and may be considered unsafe areas — can still benefit from these economic investments and all of the benefits that come with that,"" Abdul-Rahman said.

People looking to charge their EVs may spend money food or shopping while they wait for a charge. Abdul-Rahman said having EV chargers could also reduce emissions in those communities.

Garrett said INDOT is still going to take the public feedback it received about the Charging the Crossroads program into account as it moves forward.

Black Sun Light Sustainability will hold an event to connect INDOT with diverse contractors on Friday, Dec. 12 at The Nest Event Center in Indianapolis from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

He started a popular video series called “What the Code Won’t Tell You.” He highlighted the frustrating situations faced by independent shops.

The Las Vegas Convention Center during Industry Week is typically alive with the roar of muscle cars and the smell of high-octane fuel, but Jeff noticed that the exhibit areas were instead filled with silent, humming displays of onboard diagnostics, telematics and computer-driven systems.

At one booth, a representative for a new in-car network — labeled a digital “nervous system” — proudly explained how its technology would restrict access to vehicle data, reserving it exclusively for licensed, factory-certified technicians.

A chill went down Jeff’s spine. This was about more than diagnostics; it was about locking independent service and repair shops out of the system entirely. A simple wrench, he realized, would no longer fix a software glitch. This wasn’t just a change in technology; it was a technological chokehold on his livelihood.

An Alliance of the Unlikely

Jeff remembered that one of his customers had been struggling with a recurring electrical issue in a new vehicle, a problem his scanners simply could not diagnose. He called a friend at the dealership, who sheepishly admitted the new diagnostic software was proprietary and not shared. Frustrated and at a dead end, Jeff posted his problem on LinkedIn, Facebook and YouTube.

Eleanor Vance works for the Federal Bureau of Automotive Regulation. For years, her job has involved drafting and enforcing rules for safety, emissions and fuel efficiency. But as she walked through the exhibits, she recognized that the data-driven revolution was more than making cars safer and greener — it was a power grab for control.

Eleanor was searching for examples of technological barriers hindering automotive shops while she toured the convention center exhibits. Her search led her to the same forum where Jeff had been. Intrigued, she sent him a private message introducing herself.

Jeff was skeptical but desperate enough to agree to a video call. Eleanor listened intently as Jeff explained his predicament. She explained her own concerns about the industry’s direction. An unlikely alliance between Jeff and Eleanor resulted, united by the need to preserve an open market.

The Regulator’s Revelation

Eleanor saw the booth presentations, watching as automakers built digital fences around their vehicles’ information. She spoke with a supplier whose frustration was obvious. The supplier complained that without access to proprietary codes, obtaining parts was almost impossible.

Coincidently, she overheard a conversation between Jeff and a younger technician — a moment that reinforced her growing concern. They discussed how independent technicians were losing business to dealerships because they could not access the same proprietary information.

Eleanor realized the government’s role had to evolve. Regulations designed for a world of replacement parts were now obsolete. She envisioned a future where independent shops like Jeff’s would become relics.

A monopoly on repair would mean higher costs and fewer choices for consumers. She began to formulate a plan to protect auto shops. Energized by the growing “Right to Repair” movement, she listened to a gathering of independent shops and repair advocates.

Their strategy was simple but spirited: focus on what AI could not yet do. They would specialize in the “ghosts in the machine” — the problems that were too complex or obscure to solve.

The Lawmaking Battle

Eleanor began drafting legislation, dubbed the “Automotive Data Access and Repair Act.” It was not an easy sell; lobbyists from major manufacturers began contacting her office. They argued that providing proprietary data would compromise safety and intellectual property, claiming independent shops were not prepared for complex repairs and that only factory-certified technicians could perform them.

Meanwhile, Jeff became the public face of a movement. He started a popular video series called “What the Code Won’t Tell You.” He highlighted the frustrating situations faced by independent shops. His simple and heartfelt videos gained a massive online following, showing a knowledgeable technician forced to turn away customers simply because of a digital lock. This grassroots support, fueled by frustrated consumers, provided Eleanor with the public pressure she needed.

The turning point came during a congressional hearing. Jeff testified about the problem, showing a video of a car that was towed to his shop. He then displayed the incomprehensible code from the vehicle’s onboard computer.

“This,” he said, holding up a small, worn-out wrench, “used to be the tool for understanding. Now, this is what we have.” He held up his generic scanner, which could only read surface-level problems. “The dealerships have the full book. We just have the cover.”

Jeff’s shop became a case study for the success of a new model. His team, now certified “AI-Assisted Technicians,” used artificial intelligence to analyze sensor data and predict part failures before they occurred, offering initiative-taking maintenance. They were no longer just fixing vehicles; they were preventing breakdowns from happening, building long-term relationships with customers.

The government’s role had shifted from a clumsy regulator to a nimble facilitator, fostering an environment where innovation and human ingenuity could coexist. Artificial Intelligence became a job-enhancer, not a job-killer, and the independent shop became more essential than ever.

Epilogue

Jeff’s shop flourished. With the new regulations, he was able to invest in advanced training and software, and his team became specialists in the very technologies that had once threatened to put him out of business. He even partnered with a local community college, creating a pipeline to train the next generation of technicians.

Takeaway:

This automotive service and repair tale is not a story of death but one of evolution and resilience. While the rise of EVs and computer driven systems presents significant challenges, it also creates new opportunities.

For savvy managers that embrace new technologies, diversify their services, and invest in their workforce, the future is still positive. Meanwhile, auto shops that do not adapt will face increasing pressure from market trends and competitors.

There is no single “Federal Bureau of Automotive Regulation,” but the primary federal agencies that regulate the automotive industry are the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) setting Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Other relevant agencies include the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) for commercial vehicles and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for consumer protection in auto sales.

Transitioning our energy supply from finite resources like coal, oil and gas to infinitely renewable sources, like solar power, isn’t some uppity environmentalist principle — it’s an inevitability.","The Environmental Protection Agency is joining the fight against climate change — on the side of climate change — and it’s costing you money.

This August, citing governmental “self-dealing and conflicts of interest,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin terminated the $7 billion “Solar for All” program, denying state environmental regulatory agencies funds that would have been used to install rooftop solar power systems in low-income communities. $156 million within this program had been allocated to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, which had already initiated implementation plans.

Last week, North Carolina, along with 21 other states, sued the EPA for terminating the Solar for All program, arguing that the EPA did not have the authority to rescind these funds that had already been appropriated by Congress.

Zeldin’s vision of the EPA is of an agency that “will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars” dedicated to its “core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of ‘climate equity.’” Does the health of low-income communities and their environment not count? Trussed up in cost-cutting, corruption-culling rhetoric, the EPA’s choice is nothing more than a capitulation to the oil and gas industry.

Solar power is far from unprofitable. If Solar for All had been implemented, N.C. DEQ anticipated helping more than 12,000 households install solar panels, saving North Carolinians an average of $400 on monthly utility bills. The installation process would have created about 140 jobs, concentrated in rural parts of our state, which would encourage economic development.

But Solar for All wouldn’t just have saved money, it could have saved lives. According to N.C. DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson, providing communities with solar power would improve North Carolina’s resiliency to natural disasters. Solar panels would give households and businesses access to independent power sources, so during catastrophes like Hurricane Helene, critical emergency services could be kept running if the main power grid fails. Not only would quotidian utility bills be cheaper, but in times of crisis, lives could be saved. Calling aid to North Carolinians' “frivolous climate equity spending” is more than plain mean — it violates the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment.

The lawsuit against the EPA illustrates a broader struggle against federal attempts to appease corporate interests at the expense of Americans. In September, Zeldin announced the EPA’s plan to deregulate the fossil fuel industry in favor of “beautiful clean coal.” America is the fourth-largest global producer of coal. People depend on this industry for economic stability. But coal is finite, and the industry is in decline. Far from “clean,” coal is one of the dirtiest energy sources: It worsens climate change by emitting carbon dioxide, causes air pollution, creates coal ash contamination, produces acid rain and much more. The cost of cleaning up these externalities far outweighs the short-term profit of mining, but short-term profits seem to be the only thing with which Zeldin and the other 40 Trump administration picks with direct ties to the oil, gas and coal industries are concerned.

We will run out of coal. Transitioning our energy supply from finite resources like coal, oil and gas to infinitely renewable sources, like solar power, isn’t some uppity environmentalist principle — it’s an inevitability. “The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead,” wrote economistJohn Maynard Keynes, but even Keynes would agree that a bit of long-term planning is necessary for when we run out of the resource that powers society. The EPA’s choice to abandon the transition to renewable energy and instead deregulate and subsidize “beautiful clean coal” reflects short-term, profit-seeking nihilism that will only harm Americans — be it their pockets or their health — in the long-run.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/21604d47-6aba-4030-851b-8c60c67df408.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Cedges&ar=16%3A9,N,,2025-11-03 15:20:35.705928

This ensures households and businesses can plan, invest, and save without the threat of new capital gains taxes being enacted in the future.
By banning both capital gains taxes and occupation taxes on securities, Propositions 2 and 6 will create the regulatory certainty that will allow capital markets to thrive in Texas.","When it comes to protecting taxpayers and ensuring people keep as much of their hard-earned money as possible, Texas usually leads the way. With no state income tax on individuals or corporations, investment is flocking to the Lone Star State and boosting industries throughout the state’s economy.

This November, Texas voters will decide on two pro-taxpayer ballot measures that would bolster the state’s reputation as the best place to do business in the country by prohibiting taxes on capital gains and financial transactions. Together, Propositions 2 and 6 will safeguard financial security, promote investment, and maintain a business-friendly climate that supports growth and innovation.

Proposition 2 would prohibit the state of Texas from imposing a tax on realized or unrealized capital gains of individuals, estates, and trusts. Capital gains taxes apply to profits from investments like stocks, real estate, or other assets. Since Texas does not currently levy a state-wide capital gains tax, Proposition 2 acts as a preventative measure that ties the hands of lawmakers who would try to raise taxes. This ensures households and businesses can plan, invest, and save without the threat of new capital gains taxes being enacted in the future.

Proposition 6 builds on this by banning taxes on securities transactions, like stock trades, and blocking occupation taxes on those working in the securities industry, including banks, brokers, and dealers. Like Proposition 2, it preemptively blocks tax hikes and creates certainty for investors and businesses, ensuring routine investment activity isn’t subject to unpredictable levies. Together, these measures create a stable tax environment that supports entrepreneurship and cements Texas’s reputation as a state that is open for business.

A quick survey of the state’s tax system illustrates why these two ballot measures are especially important for taxpayers. Texas relies primarily on sales and property taxes to fund government operations. Local governments, including school districts, counties, and cities, collect property taxes to pay for public services. By banning the imposition of capital gains and securities taxes in the future, Propositions 2 and 6 shield taxpayers from new financial burdens and prevent the gradual expansion of the state’s tax base.

A simple, predictable tax system is a cornerstone of a thriving economy. Businesses make decisions on where to expand their operations based on local tax climate, regulatory certainty, and the ability to reinvest profits without interference. By enshrining these safeguards into state law, Texas signals to entrepreneurs and investors alike that it values long-term capital formation and innovation. This ensures Texas maintains a competitive edge over other states that may be raising taxes or adopting more aggressive regulatory policies.

Other states’ missteps demonstrate why Propositions 2 and 6 are so important for taxpayers. Proposals for financial transaction taxes in New York and New Jersey during the COVID-19 pandemic alarmed investors and jeopardized retirement accounts, even prompting discussions about moving the Nasdaq stock exchange to another state. Although both states ultimately abandoned those taxes, the episode illustrates the harm spendthrift lawmakers can do without adequate legal constraints on their powers.

The planned Texas Stock Exchange, backed by BlackRock and Citadel Securities, illustrates how the state is increasingly becoming a major player in the financial sector to better compete with states like New York and Illinois. By banning both capital gains taxes and occupation taxes on securities, Propositions 2 and 6 will create the regulatory certainty that will allow capital markets to thrive in Texas. Moreover, preempting these taxes ensures that a Texas-based stock exchange can flourish, attracting both capital and financial talent to the state.

Financial firms have already begun fleeing jurisdictions with heavy-handed tax and regulatory policies for more welcoming destinations. From 2019 to 2023, nearly 160 Wall Street firms moved their headquarters out of New York, taking approximately $1 trillion in assets under management with them. Capital is highly mobile, and states must be careful to craft business climates that actually reward risk-taking and entrepreneurship rather than drive it away.

These measures also protect taxpayers by promoting sound governance. By taking the option of new taxes off the table, lawmakers will be incentivized to manage existing resources more prudently, rather than seeking additional revenue through new levies. This approach will, in turn, encourage more responsible spending and enhance predictability for households and businesses alike.

Texas voters should carefully weigh the long-term fiscal implications of Propositions 2 and 6. These measures are more than technical tax reforms, they are a thoughtful decision about the kind of economy Texas wants to foster. Should voters approve them, Texas will maintain a competitive edge over high-tax states like New York and California all while putting the interests of taxpayers first.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2019/10/texas-state-capitol-4066441-1920.jpg?v=20191028111800,N,,2025-11-03 20:59:46.485395

The plant, operated by eVAC Magnetics LLC, is designed to produce neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt permanent magnets. The facility received federal support through a $111.9 million Qualified Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit and a Defense Production Act Title III grant.

The project expands U.S. manufacturing capacity for rare-earth magnets. Asia, especially China, currently supplies most of the global market. The Sumter County site will employ about 300 full-time workers. It will begin commercial production in early 2026.

eVAC Magnetics is part of Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co. KG (VAC Group), a Germany-based producer of magnetic materials with facilities in Europe. The South Carolina operation will serve industrial and defense markets in North America.

Supply of high-purity rare-earth oxides

On November 3, 2025, Ucore Rare Metals Inc. signed an agreement with VAC and eVAC Magnetics. The deal strengthens North America’s rare-earth supply chain. The companies will connect Ucore’s refining sites in Louisiana and Ontario with eVAC’s magnet plant in South Carolina. Ucore will supply high-purity rare-earth oxides. eVAC will use them to produce permanent magnets for industrial and defense markets.

The partnership builds a regional production network and reduces reliance on Asian imports. It supports demand from electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. Executives say the plan creates one of the few closed-loop supply chains in North America.

Completion of the South Carolina facility adds momentum to U.S. efforts to expand critical-mineral production. Public and private investments continue to boost domestic refining and manufacturing capacity. Together, they reflect the nation’s shift toward electrification and cleaner energy technologies.

The platform’s NDC Tracker, launched at COP29, provides a snapshot of progress on the new round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Countries were due to submit their updated NDCs, which map out national climate ambitions through 2035, in February 2025. As of today, 67 countries—representing 36% of global emissions—have submitted a new NDC, while 130 countries have yet to submit one. So far, this latest round boosts the emission reductions from the 2020 NDCs by 1.9 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, equal to the annual emissions from roughly 500 coal-fired power plants.

NDC Breakdown: Notably missing from the new NDC submissions are China and the EU. China, the world’s largest emitter, foreshadowed its NDC at the September 2025 UN General Assembly meeting, promising to peak emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. Meanwhile, the EU, the world’s fourth-largest emitter, shared in September that its upcoming NDC is expected to include a 66.25-72.5% cut in emissions by 2035 and a net emissions reduction of 90% by 2040, both compared to 1990 levels.

Update on Global Stocktake Progress: A new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the COP30 Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance assesses global progress following the first global stocktake, which was agreed to at COP28. The resulting UAE Consensus established a goal to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency efforts by 2030. The report finds that two years later, energy efficiency modifications in buildings have been nominal and renewable energy growth has fallen short—despite record-breaking renewable energy capacity being added to grids around the world.

Climate Action off the Rails: Last week, WRI’s Systems Change Lab published the State of Climate Action 2025. The annual report uses 45 indicators to assess global progress on meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F). The Systems Change Lab determined that, of the 45 indicators, 29 are “well off-track,” six are moving in the right direction but falling behind, five are going in the wrong direction completely, and there are insufficient data for the rest.

Granary of Solutions: Each year, the COP Presidency appoints a high-level climate champion responsible for advancing the “Action Agenda” around COP. The Action Agenda is designed to connect the negotiations to real-world, on-the-ground climate work. This year, it has six themes and 30 objectives, as well as a “Granary of Solutions” that provides case studies of “existing solutions [that] accelerate and scale up impact in alignment with the global stocktake and the goals of the Paris Agreement.” There is an open call for engagement, solutions, and input. In alignment with the Action Agenda, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy has created its own Granary of Solutions to highlight U.S. businesses leading the way on greenhouse gas emissions reductions at home and abroad.

About Stella Vita

Self-sufficient design: Stella Vita is built to be a self-sustaining ""house on wheels,"" using solar energy to power itself and its internal systems.

Travel and living: The solar panels on its roof provide enough energy for both driving and living, including cooking, running a fridge, and charging devices.

Pop-up roof: When parked, the roof slides up to provide standing room, and additional solar panels fold out to double the solar surface area for more efficient charging.

Aerodynamic shape: While driving, the roof collapses to create a more aerodynamic, teardrop shape that minimizes air resistance.

Range: On a sunny day, Stella Vita can travel approximately 730 km (about 453 miles) without needing to charge at a station.

Demonstration trip: The student team completed an 1,800+ mile road trip from the Netherlands to Tarifa, Spain, to demonstrate its capabilities

""Stella and its successors Stella Lux, Stella Vie and Stella Era are a series of solar racing family cars, built for the World Solar Challenge in Australia, sofar winning its Cruiser Class all four times it was held – in 2013, 2015, 2017 and in 2019. Stella is considered the world’s first solar-powered family car and was given the 'Best Technology Development' Award at the 8th annual Crunchies in San Francisco in 2015.

""Being the only competing vehicle with a license plate, the road registration of Stella contributed to the winning score in the races. The vehicles are designed and built by ""Solar Team Eindhoven"" (STE) — some 26 students of different faculties of the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands. The group have set up a non-profit foundation to promote their concepts for practical solar vehicles for adoption on a broader scale."" (Wikipedia)

""Stella won the inaugural edition of the new for 2013, Michelin-sponsored Cruiser Class of the WSC, completing the 3,022 kilometres (1,878 mi) race distance in 40 hours and 14 minutes, at an average speed of 75 kilometres per hour (47 mph), while typically carrying three occupants, for a total of 9,093 occupant kilometres (5,651 passenger miles).

""The Stella is a very boxy, but low-built car. With only 1.15 metres (45 in) height, and its two large doors opening upwards, it is as tricky to get in and out of as a super-sportscar. However, once inside, reviewers found it surprisingly comfortable.

""The whole of the top of the car is covered in solar panels, and the rear slopes down to create a teardrop shape to reduce air resistance. The car weighs only 388 kilograms (855 lb) thanks to being constructed largely out of carbon-fiber, reinforced by welded aluminium tubing."" (Wikipedia)

Our Self-sustaining House On Wheels

""Stella Vita is our Self-Sustaining House On Wheels. A mobile home wherein you can live and work while travelling on the energy of the sun. Stella Vita generates energy through its solar panels on the roof and uses this energy for both driving and living,"" the Stella Vita official website says.

""Stella Vita generates enough solar energy to drive, shower, watch TV, charge your laptop and make coffee. You are completely self-sustaining and independent. Hereby, you are free to go wherever you want, without harming the environment.""

""It is fully equipped with living essentials including a double bed, sofa, kitchen area and a bathroom with a shower, sink and toilet. It can fit two people, who can drive, cook breakfast and watch television using just the vehicle’s solar-charged battery, according to its creators – 22 students at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands,"" the CNN reports.

""The vehicle can typically travel up to 600 kilometers (373 miles) on its 60-kWh battery when fully charged, even at night and when it is cloudy.

""On a day when the sun is shining throughout, its range increases by an extra 130 kilometers (81 miles). The team drove approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) between each destination, at a top speed of 120 kilometers (75 miles) per hour.""

""A group of 22 coeds working under the name Solar Team Eindhoven has just unveiled Stella Vita, the world’s first entirely solar-powered camper, according to Ars Technica,"" the Robb Report says.

""The vehicle features a pop-up roof lined with solar panels that the students claim produce enough electricity to travel over 450 miles in a single day.

""The Stella Vita, which the team calls a self-sustaining “house on wheels,” features a teardrop design that slopes dramatically in the rear. It’s not the most aesthetically pleasing of designs, but the long roof provides plenty of surface area for solar panels.""

""The vehicle has a pop-up roof lined with solar panels that is said to generate enough electricity to cover 730 kilometers in a day.

Stella Vita is described as a self-sustainable motor home. It features a design with a sloping roof to increase the surface area of ​​the solar panels,"" the Telegrafi says.

""Two separate towers below the roofline protrude from either side of the vehicle, effectively doubling the surface area of ​​the solar panels to 17.5 square meters. Inside there is a small cooking area with a solar-powered fridge, as well as a toilet, a sofa and a full-sized bed with space for two adults.

""It was created by a group of 22 students from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, working under the name Solar Team Eindhoven.""

""The world's first fully self-sufficient 'house on wheels' - designed and developed by students from Eindhoven University of Technology - will arrive in Tarifa, the southernmost tip of Spain, on Friday. This means that Solar Team Eindhoven has reached the final destination of its tour from the Netherlands to Spain on energy from the sun. The student team organised the trip to show the future of sustainable mobility with their self-built green campervan,"" the Eindhoven University of Technology says.

""In one and a half years, Solar Team Eindhoven designed and built Stella Vita, as the futuristic-looking vehicle is called. The solar vehicle has a roof that slides up electrically when standing still, giving you a standing height of 2.5 metres.

""This makes it easy to stand inside to cook, sleep or work. Additional solar panels fold out when the roof is up, doubling the solar surface area to a whopping 17.5 square metres.""

Docket ID No: EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0186

Introduction

Business Roundtable appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reconsider and remove program obligations for most source categories under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and suspend program obligations for other sources until reporting year 2034.

Business Roundtable remains concerned by the growing risks from global climate change, including significant economic risks (e.g., technological and market shifts and regulatory and policy risks). Business Roundtable member companies are leading by example, developing and deploying ambitious emissions reduction plans, and exporting innovative technologies that will help lower emissions in the United States and globally, while simultaneously spurring innovation, manufacturing and economic growth. Business Roundtable looks forward to helping advance policies that leverage U.S. leadership, competitiveness and innovation to mitigate the impacts of global climate change while growing our economy.

Business Roundtable welcomes the Administration’s commitment to addressing burdensome regulations, including paperwork and reporting burdens. However, we are concerned that a sudden change to the current program could result in piecemeal, duplicative, incomplete and more burdensome greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting obligations for U.S. companies that also disadvantage them globally. We urge EPA to carefully consider options that would allow the GHGRP reporting framework to continue so that it is not inadvertently recreated at an even greater expense to U.S. business in a scattershot, non-uniform way via other state and foreign governmental avenues. We also urge the agency to hear from stakeholders directly and indirectly affected by the agency’s actions and take the necessary steps to coordinate across federal agencies that would also face impacts from the proposal.

GHGRP Data is a Critical Tool for Various Reporting, Disclosure and Compliance Obligations

The GHGRP provides standardized, facility-level emissions data that U.S. companies have relied on for effective regulatory enforcement, tax credit administration, international trade compliance and voluntary disclosures. The proposed changes risk fragmenting emissions reporting across the U.S. economy, introducing regulatory uncertainty and upending an existing process for international trade compliance, particularly for U.S. exports. The comprehensive data set that GHGRP provides, including current emissions levels and historical trends, is also important for helping to prevent ill-informed policies from being adopted.

GHGRP data is central to the administration of the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).2 Under current IRS rules, CO₂ injected into secure geologic storage qualifies only if verified under Subpart RR with an EPA-approved monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) plan. Removing this pathway would potentially jeopardize sequestration projects, create regulatory uncertainty and chill investment. This would undermine the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that preserved 45Q and increased the value of the credit in some circumstances. At a minimum, elimination of GHGRP will require the IRS to amend its regulations to require new monitoring, reporting and verification protocols—prior to EPA finalizing this rule. Timing is of the essence to ensure the left hand is aware of the right hand’s actions, such that a gap between changes does not undermine investments in major infrastructure projects, including projects based on 45Q credits that taxpayers are relying on in the 2025 tax year.

Other credits such as 45V (clean hydrogen), 40B (sustainable aviation fuel), 45Z (clean fuel production credit) and 48C (advanced energy projects credit) rely on emissions factors from Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model,3 which uses this federally verified GHGRP data as a key input. It is unclear how this data can be replicated in a cost effective or timely way should EPA remove GHGRP obligations, thus creating uncertainty for past, current and future investment decisions relying on these credits. Again, if EPA were to move forward with a final rule that prevents companies from utilizing GHGRP data to claim inextricably linked federal tax credits, Business Roundtable would encourage ample time be afforded to stakeholder engagement to build consensus with private businesses that have relied on U.S. tax policies enacted and sustained with bipartisan support in Congress, which could be abruptly undermined if EPA does not engage across government agencies, particularly with the Department of Treasury in this instance.

Elimination of GHGRP Likely Will Result in Piecemeal Reporting Obligations That Are Incompatible, Incomplete and More Expensive

GHGRP provides a trusted dataset used by state regulators and private companies. If GHGRP obligations were to cease, some states can be expected to step into the void and promulgate their own data collection and reporting obligations. These new requirements, adopted on a piecemeal state-level basis, are at significant risk of becoming inconsistent, creating a cumbersome, balkanized and more expensive reporting obligation for companies subject to the requirements than if the current GHGRP were to continue as is.

EPA estimates the total cost of reporting to be $303 million per year, with subpart W reporting accounting for $256 million of the annual costs.4 Under EPA’s proposed rule, subpart W companies would be relieved of their reporting obligations until 2034.

Companies that are subject to GHGRP have made the necessary investments to monitor emissions, and capture and report the required data. One-time hardware and software investments and employee training necessary to be able to report the data required by GHGRP far exceed on-going costs associated with the program. While on-going reporting costs are not inconsequential, we would expect them to be significantly less than the costs that would be incurred by businesses if they are required to recreate and comply with differing monitoring and reporting obligations likely to emerge at the state and international level if GHGRP were to end. This fragmented reporting system would in turn result in higher costs and less data consistency than if the current GHGRP was left in place. Simply put, the result of the repeal of the GHGRP will be to impose costs that are likely to far exceed the estimated savings associated with repealing the current program in exchange for a sub-optimal, inconsistent, fragmented reporting system.

U.S. Competitiveness in Foreign Markets Would be Undermined

U.S. exports of energy-intensive products would be disadvantaged under the proposed rule. Data transparency provides the backbone of the U.S. competitive position on energy dominance. Credible and verified GHGRP data is vital for U.S. competitiveness in global markets, especially with the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), low carbon fuel (LCF) and methane regulations. Without federally verified GHGRP data, U.S. exporters may face default emissions penalties, higher compliance costs and loss of market access. The United States is Europe’s largest Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplier and a major oil exporter to these markets. Moreover, without the GHGRP data to demonstrate our manufacturing emissions profile, the United States may end up with a higher default value under CBAM, thereby undermining U.S. competitiveness in Europe. The net result of eliminating GHGRP could inadvertently harm U.S. competitiveness by weakening exports and run counter to the President’s “Energy Dominance” agenda.

EPA Should Maintain GHGRP as a Voluntary Program if it Determines the Clean Air Act (CAA) Cannot Legally Support a Mandatory Program

In its proposal, EPA indicated that it “considered the alternative of transitioning the GHGRP from mandatory to voluntary reporting” but ultimately rejected this option because it “could also result in submittal of incomplete or piecemeal reports, and the verification and accuracy of the data submitted would be limited.”5 EPA also concludes that “maintaining continuous or intermittent reporting under any of these source categories, including voluntary reporting, is inconsistent with CAA section 114 (emphasis added).”6

Business Roundtable believes EPA’s authority to administer a voluntary program is consistent with section 114. CAA section 114 allows EPA to collect emissions information for GHGs as the CAA contains an underlying statutory purpose to reduce “air pollutants” that can potentially be regulated under the CAA. EPA recently acknowledged its authority to regulate GHGs under the CAA, even if it declines to exercise such authority in the proposed rescission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding (“’Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate’” GHG emissions,7 quoting the Supreme Court’s decision in AEP v. Connecticut “The critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.”).8

Business Roundtable maintains that EPA has the legal authority to regulate GHG emissions if it makes the requisite findings and closely hews any regulatory response to the limitations of the Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts v. EPA9 the Court determined that GHGs are covered by the CAA’s section 302(g) definition of “air pollutant,” and that therefore EPA can impose regulations of GHG emissions once the EPA makes the requisite findings under the CAA. Neither UARG v. EPA10 nor West Virginia v. EPA,11 two cases that struck down EPA’s expansive claims of authority to regulated GHGs, disturbed this central finding.

Although EPA asserts that “since 2011 [the EPA] has not used most of the information collected to carry out other provisions under the CAA”12, EPA can potentially use this information for regulation of GHGs. GHGRP supplies the data necessary for informed decision-making for deciding whether, when and how to regulate GHGs. Accordingly, we believe EPA retains the authority to regulate GHGs and as a corollary, to allow voluntary data collection efforts to inform the agency’s future regulatory efforts.

If EPA is concerned about incomplete data, it may still establish minimum standards for voluntary participation, and we encourage it to do so if it chooses to maintain a voluntary program.

EPA has experience with voluntary programs, including programs directly associated with greenhouse gas emissions.13 Retaining GHGRP as a voluntary program should not be unduly burdensome, nor is it inconsistent with EPA’s legal views regarding the limitations of section 114. Moreover, retention of GHGRP in some form will avoid the multiple rulemakings, inconsistent reporting obligations and international trade and regulatory uncertainty that will result if GHGRP is repealed.

Business Roundtable remains committed to working with the Administration to provide the certainty and predictability that American businesses need to thrive and compete, including by ensuring access to reliable, affordable energy.

SM Energy’s net income for Q3 fell despite an increase in oil production

Shares of SM Energy (SM) and Civitas Resources (CIVI) were trading higher in premarket on Monday, after the energy companies announced a merger agreement.

$12.8 Billion Combined Entity

SM Energy and Civitas Resources announced an all-stock transaction to create a combined oil and gas company with an enterprise value of about $12.8 billion. The merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Under the deal, Civitas shareholders will receive 1.45 shares of SM Energy common stock for each Civitas share. SM Energy shareholders will own around 48% of the combined entity, while Civitas stockholders will own approximately 52%.

The merger combines an asset base of approximately 823,000 net acres, which includes the Permian Basin in the southern US. The basin is known for its rich petroleum and natural gas deposits.

The combined firm is expected to generate over $1.4 billion in free cash flow in 2025 and achieve an annual production value of $200 million, potentially rising to $300 million. The transaction is projected to be immediately accretive to key per-share metrics.

“This merger combines two premier operators and establishes a company with transformative scale in the highest-return U.S. shale basins. By combining two complementary portfolios, we expect to unlock significant free cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate stockholder returns, and position us for sustainable growth through every cycle,” said Beth McDonald, President and Chief Operating Officer of SM Energy.

SM’s Q3 Results

Earlier in the day, SM Energy posted its Q3 results. Production in the third quarter totaled 19.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Total daily production rose 26% while oil output jumped 47%. Net income for the quarter was $155.1 million, compared with $240.5 million a year earlier. The decline in earnings was mainly due to lower realized prices, reduced derivative gains, and higher depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expenses.

What Are Stocktwits Users Saying?

The news of the merger prompted a shift in retail sentiment to ‘bullish’ from ‘neutral’ for both companies on Stocktwits.

SM Energy shares were up 2.9% at $21.5, while Civitas’ stock shot up 4.8% to $30.2.

Both stocks have been under heavy selling pressure this year, with CIVI’s stock declining 38.3% and SM’s shares tanking more than 47%.

The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University, and Hutchinson. Together, they’ve installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.

So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car, and bus-all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW, and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That’s strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.

Charging ahead: Why it matters

If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.

For drivers, it could mean never having to worry about range anxiety again. Instead of hunting for the nearest charger, the highway itself could be your power source.

The roadblocks ahead

The big questions now are about cost and control. Who pays to install these power roads? How much will it cost to use them? Public-private partnerships may hold the key, but until those details are ironed out, large-scale rollout remains a challenge.

Still, with global momentum building, it’s only a matter of time before dynamic wireless charging becomes part of everyday driving.

What this means for you

This innovation is not limited to Europe. In Detroit, Michigan, a public road on 14th Street already uses embedded charging coils that can send power to EVs as they move. In Indiana, Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation are building a quarter-mile highway section designed to charge electric vehicles, including heavy trucks, while they travel.

For drivers, this technology could make owning an EV easier and more practical. Your vehicle could recharge during normal trips without the need to stop, plug in, or wait. That level of convenience could help expand EV adoption across the United States, lowering emissions and fuel costs for millions.

Kurt’s key takeaways

Wireless charging roads are moving from concept to construction and showing real promise for a new era of electric travel. The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute, and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration, and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.

Various states are considering mid-decade redistricting, and parties are disputing issues of voting technology, mail-in ballots, and noncitizens on the voting rolls. Despite what the presence of these debates in each election cycle might imply, America has dramatically improved its election system over the past few decades. Issues remain, but understanding them requires a look at the problems we have already resolved.

For many Americans, our current focus on election administration began 25 years ago, during the 2000 Bush versus Gore election, when the country got an education in election administration. This look behind the curtain of running elections was not pretty. The long recount process, court challenges, and political posturing revealed ballot design issues, inconsistent vote-counting standards, and questions about registration and overseas voters. It also unleashed a cacophony of conflicting information from various federal and state courts, local and state election administrators, and other public officials. Before 2000, average Americans thought little about these matters, and even the fields of election law and political science had mostly ignored the running of elections as a subject of study.

The good news, however, is that in the intervening 25 years, the way we run elections has changed dramatically for the better. Florida was not the only state that had imperfect election administration in 2000. A long recount to decide the presidency in many other states would have revealed similar issues. But to Florida’s credit, a sustained process of reform and improvement has now made it one of the model states for election administration.

In the aftermath of Bush v. Gore, Congress passed the bipartisan Help America Vote Act (HAVA). While impactful, this act was not a perfect piece of legislation, nor is it the sole reason for the dramatic changes we have seen since. But its passage—a substantial and truly bipartisan piece of legislation that emerged from a hotly disputed presidential election, roiled by a weeks-long recount and polarizing Supreme Court decision—was a feat that is hard to imagine today.

Among other things, HAVA provided billions of dollars to upgrade election technology (the first federal money ever spent on election administration), designed a process to develop voting technology standards for manufacturers, required states to upgrade their voter registration systems, and gave voters safeguards such as provisional ballots and error-checking mechanisms.

Tackling Voting Tech

The first area where American elections have seen dramatic improvement is in voting technology. In the 2000 election, a variety of election technologies proliferated. Infamously, punch card machines required the voter to punch out a perforated hole next to their candidate of choice. The resulting “hanging chads,” in which the ballot hole was not made cleanly and the paper chad hung on to the hole, and “pregnant chads,” in which a dimple was made but the ballot paper was not penetrated, came into the common lexicon during the recount. More troubling were the varying counting standards to deal with these anomalies and the potential deterioration of ballots in the counting process.

Other older technologies were banned, like lever machines, in which a voter would indicate their candidate of choice by moving levers on the wall of a physically imposing machine with a mechanically operated privacy curtain. The technology was loved by some voters, but in the end, the machines had no backup record of a vote, and the physical mechanisms were subject to breakage, sometimes unbeknownst to the voter and election officials, potentially losing votes not recorded properly.

The biggest changes to voting technology were initiated by HAVA, which essentially banned all voting technologies but two: scanning devices, similar to the machines that scan the results of multiple-choice tests on paper, and direct recording devices, which require an input on a screen like an ATM. The act provided billions of dollars for state and local jurisdictions to purchase new machines, often replacing years-old technologies.

But voting technology development took an unexpected turn after many of the initial systems were purchased and deployed. Critics in the voting world and the computer science community expressed concerns about the direct recording devices. In particular, they worried that, with only a touch screen entry, there was no paper record that voters could see and election officials could ultimately count, recount, and audit.

After the initial burst of purchases of these direct recording devices, the calls for a paper trail or paper backup won the day. These direct recording devices were either retrofitted to include a paper record that the voter could see or abandoned altogether in favor of scanning devices, in which a paper ballot is created, scanned by a machine, and retained. Today, the vast majority of votes cast (over 90 percent) have a paper record, and the remaining legacy direct-recording devices are likely on their way out in the next few years.

HAVA also initiated a process by which the testing and certification of voting technology could be improved. In 2000, voting technology standards were in a much less developed and formalized state. Some states had standards, and professional election administration associations made valiant efforts to develop standards. But HAVA created the US Election Assistance Commission—which, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and advisers from across the country, develops voluntary standards. Many states use these standards in whole or in part.

These improvements have led to tangible results. After the 2000 election, experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and California Institute of Technology looked at the existing infrastructure and found it was losing many votes due to errors. Millions of ballots were thrown out due to “overvoting,” in which a voter selects two candidates for a race. Many others were potentially lost in “undervotes,” or ballot lines left blank or with marks that the voting technology did not pick up. Today, with the improvement of voting technology and HAVA’s requirement for systems that catch overvotes and sometimes identify undervotes, millions of ballots that would not have been counted before 2000 are successfully cast.

There are still issues with voting technology, and there is room for vigilance in looking for flaws in current technology and developing even better systems in the future. But we now have a country with many more ballots counted, improved standards and testing, and a paper backup for nearly all ballots.

Revamping Voter Registration

Beyond the voting technology itself, the way we register voters has matured substantially in recent decades. In 2000, only seven states had statewide, computerized voter registration systems. HAVA mandated that all states move toward these systems, and today, all states have since met this objective.

This improved infrastructure means that states can better keep their rolls accurate and up-to-date. The systems may also allow states to have a live connection to the voter registration database, facilitating services like check-in at polling locations. And it allows for the possibilities of vote centers, allowing voters to choose a location in their county to vote early, alleviating long lines on Election Day.

There are still many issues with voter registration, including how we perform voter list maintenance, the ways we register voters, and how we identify noncitizens on voting rolls. There is also no formal way to share data across states, even though some states do so voluntarily. But the leap forward since 2000 has been dramatic, and the computerization of our lists sets the stage for potential future improvements in all these areas.

Bolstering Mail-Ins Ballots and Early Voting

A development not directly related to the 2000 election is the growing adoption of voting by mail and early voting in person at polling sites.

In 2000, we were near the beginning of a trend toward greater mail-in and early voting in person—a trend that has only accelerated in ensuing years. In 2000, approximately 10 percent of the country voted by mail, and another 4 percent voted early at polling places. This was up from the pattern that prevailed for most of the second half of the 20th century, when less than 5 percent of voters cast absentee ballots and we had no measures of the small amounts of early voting at polling places. States in the West, starting with California, introduced no-excuse absentee voting in 1978. Two decades later, Oregon was the first state to adopt 100 percent mail-in voting. In the 1990s, Texas and Tennessee started some of the first early-voting programs at polling places at scale.

Since the 2000 election, the numbers for mail-in voting and early voting in person have continued to rise. By 2016, about 41 percent of voters voted before Election Day, including 24 percent by mail and 17 percent early in person. Then, in 2020, during the global pandemic, the numbers for voting by mail rose dramatically. Over 40 percent voted by mail and over 25 percent voted early in person.

It was not until 2024 that we saw something of a return to non-pandemic trends. Voting on Election Day was barely the most common form of voting. Early in-person voting saw a strong rise, and mail-in voting dropped from 2020 levels but still showed an increase over 2016 levels. We are a country now where the three modes of voting are relatively comparable.

Recognizing Progress

These dramatic changes have supporters and critics. Especially in 2000, the issue of voting by mail became much more polarized, with Democrats seeing it as their preferred mode of voting and Republicans expressing significant distrust. These views have receded from their 2000 high points, but the differences are still noticeable.

But if we look below the national numbers to the states’, we see a great variety of arrangements. A number of states, especially in the West, now have significant numbers of mail-in voting. Some Southern states, notably Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, have moved to a regime with high levels of early voting in person and small amounts of mail-in voting. And many others have a mix of methods.

As we go to the polls this November, and debate over election administration swirls around us, it is imperative to recognize how modern voting technology, improved registration systems, and the expansion of new modes of voting have sharpened elections across our nation. There is always room to grow, but continuing to improve our election system begins with recognizing how we have already done so.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-2.07.40 PM.png,N,,2025-11-03 20:59:58.641532

Experts in energy and energy policy discussed the environmental ramifications during the 2025 Vanderbilt AI Symposium.

In a panel titled AI Energy Appetite: Environmental Impacts and Governance, Ethan Thorpe, BA’24, a fellow at Vanderbilt Law’s Private Climate Governance Lab, moderated a discussion between Vanderbilt Law Professor Michael Vandenberg, Dr. Leslie Abrahams, and Dr. Jonathan Gilligan.

Thorpe kicked off the session by stressing the importance of the subject on a national and international level.

“AI and the infrastructure that it powers have quickly become the inspiration for trillions of dollars in investment,” he said.

Panelists offered an overview of the energy implications of AI. According to Abrahams, AI energy consumption is expected to jump from 4.5% of total U.S. electricity demand in 2023 to as much as 12% by 2028, an increase that represents the current demand of Texas or California.

“It was always the plan [to expand energy infrastructure]… (but) this expansion is happening a lot faster than anyone expected,” Abrahams said. “It’s also happening in a greater scale, so it’s having a regional impact.”

Vandenberg emphasized a few challenges with the expansion of AI-related energy use and demand.

“Electric utilities and others have an incentive to overpredict electricity demand in the future; if we overbuild, then we get a return on our investments,” Vandenberg said. “The challenge is that we are building [the] power supply in a way that provides electricity that we can use to meet our very highest demands. So, one of the interesting things is not how much total energy we are using, it’s when we are using it, what are those characteristics, and how can we shift those a little bit?”

The conversation then shifted to a discussion on what it means to invest in new and evolving energy expansion technology that may not pay off in the future. Gilligan explained how this uncertainty applies to both the quantity of energy needed and the way that the utilities are going to build out their infrastructure. He noted a prevailing statistic offered by OpenAI that a query conducted by a large language model takes 1/10th of a Watt hour.

“Open AI says they serve about a billion queries a day. If that 10th of a Watt hour per query number is right, that comes to about 100 million watt hours per day; divide that by 24 hours, and you need to come to about 5 million watts that it would take to serve the global demands for Open AI — that’s 5% of a typical power plant,” Gilligan said. “We would not be needing to build out power if these energy consumption estimates that people want to give us were even remotely true.”

Gilligan also discussed the type of energy that utilities will rely on for expansion. If they turn to fossil fuels and gas, it could have disastrous consequences for the environment; if they turn to renewable alternatives, the positive impact could be momentous. The direction should be aided by monetary incentives, Gilligan said, since opening fossil fuel and coal plants is more expensive than renewable alternatives in terms of opening and shutting down.

“[The] huge growth of energy needed could potentially be beneficial in improving the nation’s energy infrastructure, which is sadly out of date and vulnerable,” Gillian said. “We could be building our capacity to transmit large amounts of energy from wind turbines and solar panels — and that would be a real benefit.”

Lastly, the conversation shifted to private governance of AI — the idea that private organizations are filling gaps in climate adaptation, mitigation, and other environmental issues that you would typically see governments filling. This is seen in terms of energy and AI structures through company contracting requirements outlining a specific portion of renewable sources or a limit on emissions.

“Because of this contracting phenomenon, we’ve seen that 80% of the largest 10 firms in seven global sectors are already imposing environmental requirements on their supplies,” Vandenberg said. “This will begin to kick in as it relates to AI, if those employers get attributed to the cost of the environmental impact of their employees’ AI use.”",https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-sub/wp-content/uploads/sites/281/2025/09/04130339/alternate-topper-headers.png,N,,2025-11-03 14:19:30.446989

The economy is a hot topic this year, with concerns about inflation, tariffs, unemployment, and interest rates dominating the news. And banks and other financial institutions are coping with those issues and many more.

What are the concerns? And what is South Carolina doing better than other states.

Integrated Media Publishing hosted a roundtable discussion over Zoom with three leaders in the world of banking on Sept. 16, 2025. We asked those questions and more, and three financial experts shared their insights.

Here are excerpts from that conversation, edited for brevity and clarity.

The participants were:

Richard Bhola, member, Scott and Company

Tom Coker, senior vice president, commercial banker, United Community

Devin Green, chief operating officer, The Capital Corporation

Integrated Media Publishing Editor David Dykes moderated the discussion.

Question: Good morning, everyone. I want to welcome everybody to Integrated Media's Banking and Finance Roundtable, another in our series of monthly discussions on topics of importance to the business community, to the state of South Carolina, and to our regions as a whole. We'd like to thank Scott and Company for sponsoring this roundtable. I want to start off with a general question, just talking about the broader economy. What are your thoughts on where the economy is right now. There’s a big rate consideration this week. Talk about the broader economy and how it impacts the financial industry. Richard, we'll start with you.

Richard Bhola, member, Scott and Company: I think there's a macroeconomic impact in the capital markets and then the impact on banking and financial services. I'll let Tom answer the banking and financial services piece. I do know we see from an audit perspective, as rates change, obviously, that affects everyone. Mortgage rates have gone up, and everyone's in a holding pattern as to what to do next. And so you see a lot of banks trying to figure out what new offerings do they need to make in order to keep up with those changes. I know I saw a lot of higher interest rates on deposits, and a lot of the smaller community banks that I look at are a little bit slow to respond to that, which resulted in some cash constraints, affecting their own growth. I think the interest rate obviously has a big impact on the financial industry and the broader economy. And then I think the way financial institutions and financial industry respond to some of those changes, things like the tariffs have a pretty significant impact in the broader economy, whether it continues to grow or it stays the same or it shrinks.

Question: Tom, what does your crystal ball tell you?

Tom Coker, senior vice president, commercial banker, United Community: I wish I had one. But from our side at the bank, we see that the economy has been plugging along this year. Growth remains positive, but we are seeing it start to slow down a little bit. Unemployment ticking up a little bit last month, and inflation do remain concerns for us as it's managing through tariffs for both businesses and consumers. The good news is, here in the Upstate, we do remain a little bit stronger, probably than the national economy, with a lot of folks moving to the Upstate. I saw a number yesterday that Upstate unemployment was 4.2, which was better than the 4.3 national number. So I think there are a lot of positive things going for us here in the Upstate with business growth and population growth that is going to help support and help drive the economy for us locally in the Upstate and across the Southeast. But nationally, economically, macro level, we see growth as being positive, but starting to slow down a little bit. Within the financial industry, we saw rate cuts last year drove some improving loan demand this year. And we do think from talking to a lot of our clients, both locally and across the bank, that if we do see some rate cuts … then that's going to continue to drive some people breaking ground on projects and expansions in their businesses. So we think rate cuts will be helpful, both to the broader economy and to the banking industry.

Q. What do you think this portends for the M&A market and clients that you're talking to?

Devin Green, chief operating officer, The Capital Corporation: It's interesting. We look for … leading and lagging indicators. And I'm biased because of the lens I look through, but one of the leading indicators we look at is M&A activity. Private equity guys and strategic buyers, they have different hold philosophies and timelines, but direction, not perfection. If you're a private equity buyer, you're looking at making a five-year investment in a business, in an industry, in a market. And we watch that activity pretty closely. If it's a robust activity, than that signals some things for us, and the contrary does. So we are seeing quite a lot of activity. … Private equity buyers, if you stratify the market, obviously, there's sections in the market where they are putting their pencils down. But for the most part, the activity has continued to stay quite strong. We find that quite encouraging. They are making five-year bets. They are not slowing down and making five-year bets. They are moving to certain markets and industries to do that. But there's a lot of smart people out there putting money to work, and the activity continues to be at a very high rate. One other thing, just not to get too technical, but there's something called an overhang. It's a fancy word of saying how much money is private equity raised that hasn't found a home for yet. They haven't allocated it to the companies they've bought. It's somewhere in the $800 billion number in the United States. So they are continuing to raise money to continue to double, triple down in this economy. They're not seeing anything that scares them to suggest otherwise.

Q. So nothing to scare them as far as they tell you, right?

Green: No, nothing to scare them. There's tweaks, there's adjustments. We all adjust in business. So they might press pause on certain industries for now. But generally speaking, they are pouring into more industries than not and continuing to do so. And South Carolina was mentioned. … South Carolina ranks up there on a number of levels on (being) business friendly, as we all know. But to use an example, it was recently ranked the No. 1 state for manufacturers in the entire United States. And so when people are looking in the business community, it's important to watch the headlines nationwide. Obviously, it affects all of us. But when we look at our ecosystem here, we're not insulated from things, but we can take a shock or two based on the preferential position we have in South Carolina on a number of fronts.

Q. Let me just throw this up to the group. Talk about AI. How is it transforming your business and what lies ahead in terms of AI?

Green: One of the things that makes The Capital Corporation a little different is we're an investment bank, but then we're part of a portfolio of companies that is owned by the same owner, Dan Adams. We operate companies, and we help sell companies. So within our portfolio, we are using AI on a number of fronts. AI, by the way, to me, is a pretty agnostic term. It can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. It seems like that continues to evolve. So at the risk of misusing that term, we are using it in call centers. We are using it in digital marketing. We are using it with respect to diligence in mergers and acquisitions. … I do think the applications are starting to become more commercialized, and there's some convergence on how to tie loose ends together with real business decision making and AI. I also think it's got a lot of room to run before it really becomes something that can be rolled out across a lot of the business front. So I think we are dabbling in it. We are an early adopter in it on a couple of levels, both in M&A and owning and operating businesses. But I think there's a little bit more learning to be done on how to really, really unlock the value of it.

Q. Tom, do you agree?

Coker: I do agree. We actually do use a lot of AI and have been using AI in a lot of our processes. How we're using it is evolving over time. Historically, we’ve used it a lot in our IT and our fraud detection area. Our IT folks have used it to write code and in management of large data sets such as fraud detection, when we're looking at millions of transactions, we're using AI, and our vendors are using AI to improve our ability to detect fraud and help keep our customers' money safe from transactions that may not be legitimate transactions. So, using it with data, with large volumes of data, and also from a coding and building processes is helping us create efficiencies and operate efficiently. One thing we're very cognizant of is keeping a human involved with how we're using it. We're using it to help our employees be more efficient, but not necessarily to where it would do a job of an employee. We've used it in the back office and behind the scenes for a lot of years. But as language models have developed and improved, we are using it more in some of our front-line interactions. A great example I got from our head of IT the other day is, we've integrated a chatbot as part of our online banking to answer simple questions that customers may have, such as location, hours, fact-based questions. And that lets our employees in our call center respond to those more in-depth questions from clients. The AI can answer the very simple fact-based things. And then if it goes beyond that basic set of parameters, then the chat kicks over to a live human in our contact center so that they can dig in to maybe a more in-depth question that a customer may need human help to solve. But there's little things and utilizing it for small factual questions and some beginning customer interfaces has helped us find some efficiencies on that side. In our industry, we balance the need for efficiency that AI can help bring. It is very important that we do put some walls around it, especially related to customer privacy and information privacy. As a bank, there are some unique risks in that, in how we adopt and roll out the AI is that is unique to banking is that we've got to be sure that the models are keeping our customer data confidential and within the bank, and that it's not feeding broader information, and no customer information is escaping outside of our four walls that may compromise privacy of our customers. So we are embracing it and finding ways to use it to help people do their jobs more efficiently, and we are using it more and more as time goes on and maybe in more customer-facing applications than we have before, where it was just really back office-focused. But also ensuring that we're keeping oversight over it to ensure we're protecting information privacy, which is really, really important to us. And also keeping the human touch so that when we're looking at data and analyzing data with it, of course, there are bias risks and models, and managing model risk is another back-office piece. … But bottom line is we are embracing it as an opportunity to help our employees be more efficient in their jobs and get back to customers and take care of customers more quickly and efficiently, but also ensuring that we keep the guardrails of a human touch with the AI to validate our models and be sure that the results are making sense.

Q. Richard, let me ask you this, is AI a watershed event or is it just evolving?

Bhola: I think it's continuing to evolve. I think to Devin's point of it being agnostic, it's so embedded in so many different things in so many different ways. And of course, it's continuously learning based on whatever information it's processing. I think what we're seeing is just the beginning of AI being implemented in several different places, and we'll continue to see that. One, because it's a huge advantage to automate certain processes that we may have depended on human beings for, but it's not necessarily to eliminate using human beings within our process, but I think we know that there's a limited labor force available to us. In South Carolina, for example, we have one of the lower labor participation rates. Maybe not in Greenville, but the state as a whole, I think certainly struggles with having adequate labor force. Post-pandemic, we’ve seen a huge increase in cyber fraud. A lot of people get random text messages, they get emails and all kinds of things from fraudsters, and that increase in fraud activity has become impossible for human beings to monitor all of it. Of course, when people lose their money, the first thing they call the bank and they said, Why would you let this transaction go? There's no human being looking at those transactions. I think there's a huge opportunity there, as Tom mentioned, for fraud detection and prevention as you leverage some of that AI. I think that's going to continue to evolve, and it's necessary. I don't think we're going to be able to keep up with maybe some of the evil forces acting on institutions without leveraging AI just because of the number of transactions that we're having to monitor in the process. So I think it'll continue to evolve. No one knows where it's going to end up, but I think there are huge opportunities. There is so little that we know about it. Even in our profession, we're slowly trying to leverage it. There's so many different options out there and just parsing through some of it and making a decision as to which one you go with and which one you don't is a continuous process.

Q. If I understand the three of you correctly, you don't see it as an automatic displacement of your current workers. Is that correct?

Bhola: I think on our end, certainly not the case. We've got a huge deficit in our profession as a whole. As people leave, the number of people coming into the accounting profession is significantly less. So we've got a huge deficit, I think, that runs all the way to 2030. And so we'll hire everybody that's available that's willing to work in our profession. The problem is we don't have enough people, and we have people leaving. So that certainly hasn't been our experience, both on the audit and tax side, even in some of the rural areas and some of the community banks that I audit. There's such a huge lack of human resource that people will take anything they can get. And so I haven't seen it being a major displacement of actual human labor force.

Q. Devin, do you agree?

Green: I agree. It complements our team right now when we use it. It supplements the human capital side. Could it replace some the way we're using it eventually maybe, but we’re not close enough to have a line of sight on making that happen right now.

Q. Tom, your thoughts?

Coker: I agree with you and what everybody said; we see it as a complement or supplement to what folks are doing today to help them do more and be efficient, but with where it stands today, not a replacement for people. So from our side, we see it as small efficiency pickups for everybody today, but that may evolve into greater efficiency over time, but not a substitute today.

Q. Let me switch to the regulatory environment. Where are we in terms of the regulatory environment from your perspective?

Green: In M&A, when there’s a regulatory shift or a legislative shift, oftentimes it can create gaps and pain points for the value chain of people involved. So I think that's the fascinating part on any regulatory change or legislative change is the ripple effect of, how does it disrupt, how things were being done, by whom, who has more pain, who has a greater value prop to solve that pain? … To me, that ripple effect creates opportunities from an investment standpoint and from a merger and acquisition standpoint. And that's something that we watch closely.

Q. The banking industry obviously watches the regulatory environment very closely. Where does it stand for you?

Coker: As you guys know, the banking environment is a highly regulated environment. We're used to operating in that as different administrations may come and go. I would say we feel that the regulatory environment has had a variety of positive developments this year. First off … in the banking world, we see an openness to bank M&A as a very positive thing. We're seeing regulators more open to M&A and speeding approval up of the transactions pretty significantly for where things have been. And so the openness and the speed of M&A is a very positive development in the banking industry. The other development we've seen this year … is a refocus on safety and soundness of banks and getting that in exams to focus on safety and soundness of banks making good loans, getting back to the blocking and tackling of making loans, taking care of deposits, and taking care of customers, and supporting customers with what they need for themselves or for their businesses to grow. And so we've seen that as a positive development that's making it a little bit easier to do business within the banking industry and getting back to some of the basics of banking.

Q. Richard, your thoughts?

Bhola: I think industry regulations work positively in a lot of ways, a lot of it geared towards consumer protection, ensuring market integrity and confidence, and then maybe hopefully fueling some economic growth. My only struggle with it … is when you apply it across the board, it may not be beneficial to everyone. You may have some regulations, for example, within the banking industry that may apply to all banks, but not necessarily affect a small community bank in the same way. And some of those compliance with those regulations, the costs can outweigh the benefits. Some of it obviously works well to protect the consumer, to protect financial institutions. But some of it can become burdensome if it just applies across the board, regardless of size. And we do see some of the struggles with some of the smaller banks trying to keep up with some of those regulatory compliance that is not necessarily significantly affecting their portfolio.

Q. Let me throw this out to all of you. The American consumer, how resilient is it, does it need to be, and will it be?

Coker: With the bank, we've seen that the consumer so far has been very resilient through the year. Americans tend to be a resilient bunch. We've seen personal income and salaries remain strong throughout the year, but we are starting to see spending starting to decline slightly, and you are starting to see, especially in the news, on a macro level, some of the subprime lenders are beginning to see some cracks and some delinquencies rise as unemployment has ticked up a little bit over the course of the year. But we have seen, overall, the consumers stay strong, but beginning to pump the brakes and slowing down on spending a little bit.

Q. Richard, is that what your firm is seeing?

Bhola: I think for the most part, it's been difficult post-pandemic to measure the resilience of the American consumer, because I do think we're really good at sensing big things happening in the economy and restricting our spending or increasing our spending. I know that we're very responsive to interest rate changes and big things like purchasing a home. You saw a lot of people pull back and say, Well, I'm not going to go ahead and purchase a home now just because the rates are so high. I'm going to keep my cash. You did see as well a lot of people being willing to move their deposits from different institutions because they saw increase in rates in some institutions while not necessarily increasing as quickly as others. And so they're very on top of that and knowing where to keep their money and when to spend their money and where to spend their money on big-ticket items. But I also think we've seen a little bit of spending more on post-pandemic, a lot of experiences, things like travel. I'm surprised when I'm at an airport, how busy it is and how full it is. I think overall, I would say the American consumer is pretty resilient. But like I said earlier, I do think it's become a lot easier to spend our funds. And so sometimes that consumer spending can get away from us, which I think is also showing a little bit on the increase in the use of credit cards by consumers. That, I think, has gone up over the last couple of years.

Q. How are businesses and your clients adjusting to the changing economic policies and conditions that we're facing these days?

Green: Tell me more about the changing policies and conditions you're thinking about.

Q. I'm thinking about businesses looking at the uncertainty in the M&A market. Like you said, they're still plowing ahead. But do you detect any changes in the speed with which the M&A market works? Is it slowing down?

Green: What comes to mind is some businesses, just like everything in life, some are affected more, some are affected less. The use case we're seeing a lot of with some of the policies right now and how it's rippling through M&A is for companies that have cross-border supply chains, given the tariff situation, we are seeing a big-time ripple effect there with respect to both ops and M&A. … Companies this year have been looking at the country of origin of where they're sourcing items, and they're looking at the tariff impact, and they're trying to optimize that supply chain. And so a number of our clients who are preparing to sell their business right now, we are looking at how to reallocate their footprint appropriately on where they're sourcing from, amongst other things. And so that is one example, an obvious one on the tariff side, that is rippling through operations for some of these companies, and it's impacting M&A. Some buyers right now, if they are looking at a domestic service provider versus an international manufacturer, they're going towards the domestic service provider because the tariffs, there's not a direct correlation on tariff impact to them. So some people are pressing pause on certain sectors of the market because there's some uncertainty associated with it. And some are forging ahead. But it's thinning out the buyer landscape on some industries where there's uncertainty, if that makes sense. It's still active. It's just thinning out some people because they're pressing pause until they have better certainty.

Q. In terms of the M&A market, you said there's a lot of money to be spent. How much longer before that floodgate opens, or will it just not open for the foreseeable future?

Green: This overhang I keep talking about, it's a good metric. All this money that's been raised that hasn't yet found a company to buy and be allocated towards the $800 billion-plus number. Private equity funds keep raising more money, so as they allocate this money and buy companies, they're raising more and keeping that overhang to where it is today. So that's been a pretty static number the last however many years. It is a seller's market. I'm not trying to sound biased. It just is. Valuations are inflated. The private equity funds, and I’ve got a lot of friends in private equity … there’s so much money that’s been raised. They are trying to find a place to put this money to work because they're getting pressure from their limited partners, the people that invested in private equity fund to put their money to work. And so that is increasing the valuations. And if private equity valuations are going up, guess what's happening to strategic buyers valuations? They're going up. So it has been a seller's market for years. My hope and expectation is it will continue to be unless there's a material shift. And we've been seeing that dynamic to be holding true for the last five, six, seven years. It's been a good run.

Q. What particular sectors are the strongest or the weakest right now?

Green: I think of quants and quals, quantitative and qualitative considerations of businesses. If you have what drives value, and this is not necessarily what you asked, but I think it's relevant. Growth, margin, free cash flow, and certainty of future cash flow. If you can sit there and say, We are growing quickly. We have high line of sight on that future growth, and we're making a lot of money when we do it. And then there's qualitative things, barriers to entry, strength of management team, brand, IP. Sectors that have those elements that are not being affected directly by any policies such as tariffs are highly active right now. But then you've got this dynamic where there's so much money out there. If there are businesses on the margin where they don't necessarily check all the boxes, but they check some of them, they are getting a lot of looks from buyers because buyers are trying to continue to build their portfolio of companies because of the dynamic we discussed. It’s not binary, either you’re in this strike zone or you’re out, there’s a lot of shades of gray, and I am seeing buyers expand their thinking to be a lot more flexible on how to deploy their money because of that fact that the money industry has been overbuilt. There's an excess supply of money.

Q. Let me throw this out. South Carolina's economy – everybody says it's in good shape, but it still is heavily dependent on manufacturing. Do you see a robust future for entrepreneurs, startup companies in South Carolina?

Green: Absolutely. The buyers that we talk to for South Carolina companies love South Carolina … the tax landscape, the cost of living, the accessibility with the infrastructure, all of it. They are targeting the Southeast and South Carolina. And labor was mentioned earlier, Richard, I think you said it, about how it's hard to continue to fill the labor needs. I have a client in Chicago. They went to a movie theater, and they're sitting there in front of the big screen at an AMC movie theater, and there's an ad for Greenville to move to Greenville. So this state is recruiting people to relocate here because the business demand is so high. South Carolina is near or at the top of the list for a lot of buyers, everything else equal to invest in.

Q. Richard, same thing you’re hearing?

Bhola: Yeah, I think that's consistent. I do think that there are a few things for the state of South Carolina to work on, but I do think we continue to be a very attractive place to do business. I think you saw that a little bit with the Scout plant that's under construction in Blythewood. When that's up and running, I think there'll be a huge demand for local labor, and that's going to be a pretty big deal for the Midlands. We do have a little bit of a low labor participation rate. But it doesn't mean that we don't have the capacity, the ability to increase that. I'm part of a few discussions on the Chamber of Commerce side, and I know that there's constant work being done there to address some of that. But I think, if I remember correctly, South Carolina was the No. 1 state last year for people moving into the state across the entire U.S. And in looking at those numbers, they aren't just retirees, because I know we're obviously in an attractive climate, and it's still relatively affordable to live in South Carolina. So I think there are a lot of positive things about the state. I know we're constantly looking at our neighboring states and what they're doing relative to us in terms of small business policies and attractiveness and coming to the state and working pretty hard to make sure that we stay competitive. We've still got some work to do, of course, because we've got North Carolina and Georgia right there, but we're on top of it. I think we certainly have the capacity and the attractiveness. I agree with Devin that people want to be in South Carolina to do business. We're a friendly bunch of people and hard-working, but I think just the lower cost is very attractive as well.

Q. Tom, let me ask you this. Your bank is headquartered in Greenville. Does a lack of corporate headquarters put South Carolina back at all?

Coker: I think it does. I think we're a very business-friendly state, very entrepreneurial friendly. There is a lot of opportunity to attract corporate headquarters and the jobs and the wealth creation that corporate headquarters bring that would benefit the state. So, I do think we've got some work to do. I think the talent pool that Richard has talked about before is something that corporate headquarters look for. Low cost is certainly important. … But the ability to attract new talent to the area and to South Carolina would be something that would be helpful to hopefully grow the number of companies that are headquartered here.

Q. And finally, let me throw out this question. But if you were governor, if you go back and one thing differently for South Carolina, what would that be?

Bhola: I think we could benefit a lot from investing in some public transport. I talk about the labor participation rate. South Carolina is such an interesting state. We've got the big cities of Greenville and Charleston and places like Columbia. I think maybe if we're able to look at the unemployment levels in those smaller places, in those smaller cities in rural South Carolina, we'll realize that there's a lot of opportunity there. But we don't have a very good public transport system. And so it isn't as easy for those people to get to the places where those jobs may be available. I think we have jobs. We don't have an issue with jobs. I think we just don't have the people to fill those roles, and they're just not able to show up for work if they live in some of those rural areas. … I do think maybe we can drive more business in some areas of rural South Carolina. If we're able to do that, I do think the state as a whole I could benefit from that. But public transport would be my top point.

Q. Tom?

Coker: I don't know that I would do it differently, but I would say it's something that frame it in what can we do to enhance things for the future would be a continued and greater investment in education, both K through 12 and in our community college system, technical college system, and in our larger research institutions. I think North Carolina, as an example, has put a lot into that educational ecosystem, and that has paid dividends for the state in terms of attracting knowledge jobs to the economy, and also back to the corporate headquarters question. An educated workforce can be a more productive workforce and can make it a more attractive place to come. I think South Carolina has been doing a good job, but I think we can do more with funding and expanding education. Our technical college system has been an integral part of attracting some great businesses here in the Upstate. I think of Michelin, I think of Ryobi, I think of BMW. Our technical college system here has been a big part of educating a workforce to staff those clients and giving people skills to obtain more jobs with higher salaries and that education broadly would help us attract more business to the state and address some of the people shortage that we've all talked about.

Q. Any other comments you'd like to make in closing?

Green: The lens I look through is small business and specifically mergers and acquisitions, but I think right now we are as busy as we've ever been. It's a seller's market. And for some of the reasons we discussed, South Carolina is a great place to play in this space. I just wanted to reiterate that right now we're optimistic and encouraged by what we're seeing and the activity we're seeing.

Q. Richard, final thoughts?

Bhola: I think we live in a time of probably the greatest uncertainty and more changing things every day. And that’s becoming harder on multiple levels, in terms of how we’re leveraging technology, issues with labor force, issues with different generations in the workforce and being able to work with all of them at the same time. But I do think that we’re in a good place to continue to be resilient. We’re responding a lot faster than we used to as well. So I think that says a lot. I’ve been living in Columbia since 2012, and I’ve certainly seen some significant growth over those years in very different parts of the city itself. And I know that a lot is happening across the state as well. I’m encouraged by it. We benefited a lot from the migration during Covid. … I think we're poised to be ready for all of the changes that's happening.

Q. Thank you. Tom, a final thought?

Coker: I think in the banking industry, we are very optimistic. We're optimistic with where things are going in the industry and with where South Carolina is going. Also seeing a lot of M&A activity, both within the industry and with our customers. And so we've got a very optimistic view of where things are going for the industry and for the state.

Much has changed in the energy systems in the decade since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.
All these developments are taking place amid growing uncertainty – both financial and regulatory – for clean energy developers.
Ten years after Paris, COP30 will take place as renewable energy installations soar to record highs, but investment and capacity additions are not yet on track for net zero or for any other intermediate or renewable energy goal.
In the first half of 2025, China remained the world’s top market for renewable energy investment, accounting for 44% of the global total, BNEF has estimated.","Ten years after the landmark Paris Agreement to pursue net-zero emissions by 2050, the world faces a slowing transition to clean energy despite record-breaking renewable capacity installations.

Much has changed in the energy systems in the decade since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. These systems faced a global pandemic, the first war in Europe since WWII, an energy crisis, a U.S. government that questioned climate change, and backlash against net-zero policies in banking and equity investment.

Some things have remained constant. One is China’s undisputed leadership in clean energy investment and installations, and cheaper domestically-manufactured equipment, allowing the rollout of solar and wind power capacity at much lower costs compared to Europe and the U.S.

The other constant is the EU’s unwavering insistence on decarbonizing to achieve net-zero emissions across its economies by 2050, despite soaring costs and growing political resistance to intermediate targets and warnings from trade partners that the burdensome EU climate directives on emissions and carbon prices could undermine its energy supply. Last week, the United States and Qatar joined forces for a fresh warning to Brussels that its corporate sustainability directive risks LNG imports from two of the world’s biggest exporters at a time when the EU is seeking to ban all Russian gas imports.

All these developments are taking place amid growing uncertainty – both financial and regulatory – for clean energy developers.

U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement – twice, on Day One of each of his terms in office. Coinciding with President Trump’s inauguration in 2025, banks started quitting net-zero alliances and stopped the previously very vocal pledges to cut off financing for fossil fuels, with a U.S. Administration, which is now openly hostile toward clean energy solutions, especially offshore wind, and which drastically scaled back U.S. renewable energy and EV incentives.

Amid geopolitical, financing, cost, and regulatory challenges to clean energy, Brazil is hosting the annual global climate summit COP30 in Belem from November 10 to 21.

Ten years after Paris, COP30 will take place as renewable energy installations soar to record highs, but investment and capacity additions are not yet on track for net zero or for any other intermediate or renewable energy goal.

“Some countries are quietly wavering on their climate commitments on the eve of the meeting while the US very loudly questions the entire concept of global warming,” Ethan Zindler, Countries and Policy Research at BloombergNEF, says.

Despite the record-high investments into clean energy technologies and soaring solar power installations, “the transition to a lower-carbon economy is not moving nearly fast enough to deliver on the ambition for net-zero emissions agreed in Paris a decade ago,” BloombergNEF noted.

In the first half of 2025, China remained the world’s top market for renewable energy investment, accounting for 44% of the global total, BNEF has estimated. The U.S. U-turn in policy, on the other hand, may prompt developers and investors to reallocate capital from the United States to Europe, according to the research provider.

Ahead of COP30, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the COP30 Brazilian Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) said in an October report that the world is falling behind on its renewable energy and efficiency goals despite record progress last year.

The global progress report flagged bottlenecks in investment, grids, and supply chains, and urged governments for bolder renewable targets before COP30.

The climate summit in Brazil is not without controversies, as were the previous two editions held in major oil and gas producing countries, the UAE and Azerbaijan.

The host country, Brazil, South America’s top oil producer and exporter, is expected to push for the Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels—known as Belém 4x—an initiative aimed at building high-level political support for the global goal of quadrupling the production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035.

But “Brazil faces a fundamental contradiction as it prepares to host COP30: leading the world in sustainable fuels while simultaneously planning an expansion of its upstream sector,” David Brown, Director, Energy Transition Research at Wood Mackenzie, said this week.

“This tension reflects the complex realities facing large energy markets and companies.”

,Texas Environment,2025-11-03 18:47:09+00:00,National Taxpayers Union,Protecting Texas Farmers and Families: Why Proposition 8 Matters,Alexander Ciccone,,,,,https://www.ntu.org/publications/detail/protecting-texas-farmers-and-families-why-proposition-8-matters,"This November, Texans have the chance to protect family farms and the rural communities they sustain.
Proposition 8 supports family farms by taking the prospect of ruinous fire sales off the table.
In 2022, Texas farms sold over $32 billion in agricultural products, and today one in seven Texans works in an agriculture-related job.
Labor expenses, which have gone up by a whopping 50% since 2020, only compound the cost pressures facing cash-strapped family farms.
Approving Proposition 8 helps keep family farms intact, gives businesses the confidence to invest, and strengthens the state’s long-term economic growth.","Family farmers and ranchers are the backbone of Texas, tending land that has often been passed down through generations. Family-owned farms make up more than 90% of all farms in the state. Yet, without legislative safeguards, heirs may one day be forced to sell parts of their family farms just to cover tax bills when a loved one passes away.

This November, Texans have the chance to protect family farms and the rural communities they sustain. Proposition 8 would permanently prohibit the state legislature from imposing estate, inheritance, or gift taxes. This ensures families won’t be forced to sell portions of their farms to pay taxes, keeps family property intact, and provides the policy certainty needed for long-term capital investments.

Texas currently has no estate or inheritance tax, so the amendment is preventative, locking in protections for families, farmers, and businesses before any new financial burdens can arise. Importantly, the measure does not affect existing taxes, such as property taxes, motor vehicle gift taxes, or other levies already authorized under state law. By clarifying what is allowed and what is prohibited, Proposition 8 ensures families and businesses have the necessary clarity to start making plans without the fear of sudden or unpredictable new levies.

Many farmers and ranchers run estates that are land-rich but cash-poor, with wealth tied up in property, equipment, and livestock rather than liquid funds. For example, farms across the nation typically have 80% of their assets tied up in real estate. Without legislative protections, heirs could be forced to sell parts of their land just to pay taxes, threatening decades of family investment.

Even highly valuable farms can face a cash crunch if heirs are required to pay estate taxes. For example, in states like New York and New Jersey, families have been forced to sell portions of farmland or valuable equipment to meet tax bills, sometimes breaking up farms in the process. Proposition 8 supports family farms by taking the prospect of ruinous fire sales off the table.

Texas is a national agricultural leader, with nearly 250,000 farms and ranches covering over 125 million acres. Farming contributes billions each year to the state economy and supports thousands of rural jobs. In 2022, Texas farms sold over $32 billion in agricultural products, and today one in seven Texans works in an agriculture-related job. Protecting farms from forced sales is therefore both an economic and social imperative for the Lone Star State.

This support is especially welcome given the recent headwinds for agriculture, including rising input costs, unpredictable weather, and market volatility caused by growing geopolitical tensions. Over the past five years alone, seed expenses increased by 18%, fuel and oil expenses rose 32%, and fertilizer costs increased 37%. Labor expenses, which have gone up by a whopping 50% since 2020, only compound the cost pressures facing cash-strapped family farms. This doesn’t even take into account the prospect of wasteful tit-for-tat tariff battles that could impact the agricultural supply chain.

Texas’ effort to protect family farms from forced sales mirrors the federal government’s recent progress in shielding taxpayers from the ruinous effects of estate taxes. As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed this summer, federal lawmakers increased the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million per individual and $30 million for married couples.

Ultimately, Proposition 8 is more than a technical tax amendment. It’s a thoughtful decision about the kind of economic environment Texas wants to foster.

Europe, along with the rest of the world, has relied on coal and gas as a major source of energy resources on the continent, with Central Europe being a key driver in coal usage. However, the waves of change have swept through the European continent, leading the charge is the most practical and easy-to-use form of renewable energy.

Europe’s energy sector has seen significant change over the past few years

As the renewable energy sector has grown far beyond what anyone could have expected, there is one form of energy generation that has become the darling of the energy sector: solar power.

The world has been consumed by the need to diversify the energy sector. Wind power has come a long way, but it lacks significant investments in infrastructure and a more favorable policy environment. Not to mention the time it takes to build wind turbines and towers.

Nuclear is an alternative, but it also has a negative connotation attached to it due to the Cold War era, placing the fear of God in everyone. The result is that solar power has become the best form of energy generation that does not harm the planet and can be scaled up to meet any potential increases in demand.

Advancements in solar power technology and generation capacity have catapulted the sector to the forefront of our collective consciousness

Following a wave of innovations in the solar power sector and the news that Europe is phasing out any and all forms of Russian energy, the continent has turned to solar power to compensate for the loss of the conventional energy sector’s generation potential. However, change does not happen overnight, and rarely comes with no consequences, regardless of whether the intentions are good or bad.

The rapid expansion of solar in Europe has been unprecedented and embraced by leaders

Central Europe, in particular, has seen its solar power generation skyrocket over the past few years. A record-breaking summer in Europe saw Hungary, which is one of the nations still relying on Russian gas imports, experiencing unprecedented growth in the solar power sector, with over 40% of the nation’s energy supply coming from solar power.

However, the rapid expansion of the solar power sector has had the inevitable effect of straining the European power grid overall as it struggles to accept the reality of life without the need for fossil fuels.

Plug-in solar devices have seen a meteoric rise in several European nations

Plug-in solar devices, known in some parts of the world as Balcony solar, have seen several European nations embracing them as the call for a more climate-friendly way of life has consumed the world. The rise of the solar power sector has also resulted in solar PPA prices declining due to a surplus of supply exceeding demand in Europe.

Batteries go into rechargeable units that store hydro during off-peak hours

NextStar Energy is expanding into the energy storage world — along with making batteries for electric vehicles.

The manufacturer says its Windsor, Ont., factory will begin making energy storage system (ESS) battery cells designed to support commercial and grid-scale energy platforms. This will be through the company’s joint venture partners LG Energy Solution and Stellantis.

The federal government has pledged up to $10 billion in production subsidies to NextStar Energy, the joint venture between Stellantis and LG Energy Solution that’s behind the battery plant. The other $5 billion is coming from the provincial government.

Monday's announcement does not mean the factory will stop producing batteries for EVs, according to a spokesperson for the company, but is prioritizing production for storage systems.

An ESS is a large rechargeable battery unit that stores energy during off-peak hours — and provides backup power during grid outages.

Danies Lee, NextStar’s CEO, says the ESS is rapidly growing and driven, in part, by AI data centres with an increasing need for energy grid stability.

""By adding to our portfolio, we are not only demonstrating our resilience and flexibility as a company, but also our commitment to sustainable innovation, and a lasting footprint here in Windsor.""

NextStar says the new product means new chemistry to its production, focused on lithium iron phosphate — LFP batteries — a technology “suitable” for a “wide range of battery needs.”

In a Monday morning statement, the company said LFP will support its current nickel manganese cobalt chemistry already at the Windsor factory.

“NextStar has been conducting material testing and equipment calibration in preparation for mass production, which is scheduled to begin in the coming weeks,” the company said.

At the time, it was the second to connect to the province's grid and is expected to be one of many across the province as part of an effort to meet growing energy demand.

Ontario's first battery storage facility opened in Haldimand County and is able to store up to 250 megawatts of power, which the company says is enough to power a city the size of Oshawa for an hour.

The chief executive officer of Invest WindsorEssex thinks NextStar's latest move helps shape the future of sustainable energy for the region.

“By diversifying the company’s portfolio and adapting to changing markets, NextStar continues to strengthen its resilience and position itself, and the region, for strong, sustained growth in the years ahead,” said Gordon Orr in a statement.

He calls it an “evolution” to strengthen the potential of the local supply chain.

“As NextStar broadens its operations, we expect to see continued momentum in supply chain development and integration, positioning Windsor-Essex as a key hub for Canada’s battery and energy storage ecosystem.”",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-03 14:59:42.072693

In addition, Attorney General James is requiring JBS USA to immediately stop making deceptive or unsubstantiated environmental claims and placing JBS USA under OAG monitoring for three years.
Both the Division for Economic Justice and the Division for Social Justice are overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.","NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today announced a $1.1 million settlement with JBS USA Food Company and JBS USA Food Company Holdings (JBS USA), the American subsidiary of the JBS Group, the world’s largest producer of beef products, for allegedly misleading the public about its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. Attorney General James sued JBS USA in 2024, after an Office of the Attorney General (OAG) investigation revealed that it was advertising that the JBS Group would reach “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, despite having no plan to actually achieve it. Under the settlement, JBS USA will pay $1.1 million to support climate-smart agriculture programs that help New York farmers adopt best practices to reduce emissions, increase resiliency, and enhance productivity. JBS USA has also agreed to reform its environmental marketing practices and report annually to OAG for three years.

“New Yorkers deserve the truth when it comes to the environmental impact of the products they buy,” said Attorney General James. “JBS USA made sweeping promises about its parent company’s climate impacts despite the company having no real plan to back those promises up. My office will always hold companies accountable when they mislead New Yorkers and harm our planet.”

Beef production emits the most greenhouse gases of any major food commodity, and animal agriculture accounts for at least 14.5 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, the JBS Group reported total global greenhouse gas emissions of over 71 million tons, more than the total emissions of many countries.

Attorney General James sued JBS USA in February 2024 for violating New York’s consumer protection laws by falsely advertising that the JBS Group would achieve “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. In reality, an OAG investigation showed that the JBS Group had no viable plan or factual basis to reach such a goal and, instead, was making plans to increase production – thereby increasing its carbon footprint. The OAG found that when JBS USA announced its “Net Zero by 2040” commitment, the JBS Group had not yet calculated the company’s total greenhouse gas emissions, nor had it developed a plan to execute the commitment or determined whether it was economically or technologically feasible. Despite this, JBS USA publicly represented that its commitment was achievable and that it had a plan to meet its target.

In her lawsuit, Attorney General James alleged that JBS USA used greenwashing and misleading statements to capitalize on consumers’ increasing desire to make environmentally friendly choices, including:

“Agriculture can be part of the climate solution. Bacon, chicken wings, and steak with net zero emissions. It’s possible.”

“We will cut our own emissions by 30% in 2030 and eliminate Amazon deforestation from our supply chain within five years.”

“JBS will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, reducing its direct and indirect emissions and offsetting all residual emissions.”

JBS USA continued to make these false claims despite receiving a warning from the Better Business Bureau National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD), which determined that the company’s evidence did not support the net-zero claims it was making to consumers. The NAD recommended that JBS USA stop making these net-zero claims in its advertising, a recommendation later affirmed by the National Advertising Review Board.

Attorney General James has secured $1.1 million from JBS USA, which will fund independent, science-based initiatives supporting climate goals across New York. The funds will be directed to promoting climate-smart agriculture on New York farms, with the exact recipient to be determined in the coming months. The OAG will work with the funding recipient to prioritize support for New York farms that lost federal funding to supply food to food banks. In addition, Attorney General James is requiring JBS USA to immediately stop making deceptive or unsubstantiated environmental claims and placing JBS USA under OAG monitoring for three years. As part of this monitoring, JBS USA must submit annual compliance reports to OAG, verifying adherence to the agreement.

Agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that agriculture emits over 660 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually – or roughly 10 percent of all U.S. emissions. Climate-smart agricultural practices offer tools for farmers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, make their operations more resilient in the face of increasingly severe climate events, and maintain or increase their productivity in the face of accelerating climate change.

The case was handled by Assistant Attorneys General Rita McDonough and Ashley M. Gregor, Special Assistant Attorney General Libby Dimenstein, and Science Policy Fellow Maggie DeLessio of the Environmental Protection Bureau, and Assistant Attorney General Ben Fishman of the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau. The Environmental Protection Bureau is led by Bureau Chief Lemuel Srolovic and Deputy Bureau Chief Monica Wagner and is part of the Division for Social Justice, led by Chief Deputy Attorney General Meghan Faux. The Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau is led by Bureau Chief Jane M. Azia and Deputy Bureau Chief Laura J. Levine and is part of the Division for Economic Justice, led by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D’Angelo. Both the Division for Economic Justice and the Division for Social Justice are overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.

For this region specifically, Avalo aims to develop seeds that address its water and climate issues.
Despite these drawbacks, dryland cotton offers notable sustainability advantages, including a smaller carbon footprint compared to other cotton varieties.
Avalo chose Clarendon for its test field partly because local farmers rotate cotton with peanuts.
“The biggest challenge that cotton farmers are facing today is actually an economic answer,” said Roger Wade, a fifth-generation farmer and one of Avalo’s farming partners.","No machine or human can yet control the rainfall or temperature of a cotton field, but Avalo is redefining what’s possible, using nature and artificial intelligence to take some of the guesswork out of cotton farming.

Through its Rapid Evolution Platform, the North Carolina-based plant biotechnology startup employs AI-powered genomic analysis to optimize certain traits in crops. Avalo can tailor seeds to region and climate, to grow in harsher conditions and to require less water, fertilizer and pesticide.

By developing crops that can thrive under stress and with fewer inputs, Avalo’s technology not only boosts productivity but also strengthens the resilience of agricultural systems facing climate volatility.

“Our globalized agricultural system has made it so that we have high demand on yield. The Green Revolution has made it so that we can force things to grow very quickly, but we’ve now ran into a situation where all those high intensity farming practices has led to bad sustainability downsides,” explained Nick Schwanz, Avalo’s chief marketing officer. “We have extremely high inputs; we have extremely high soil disturbance. We have very low resilience, because we’ve bred things specifically for yield. And so, the next big frontier in the agricultural world is all about resilience.”

Avalo’s technology is being applied to rice, rubber, sugar and cotton, which Schwanz said quickly rose to the top when its founders Mariano Alvarez and Brendan Collins examined which agricultural industries have not had the same investment or progress as crops like wheat, corn and soy.

“Cotton is one of the most important agricultural products on the planet, but it does not get the same love as some of the massive crops we grow in the United States,” Schwanz said. “It uses, traditionally, a lot more pesticide than any other row crop. It uses a lot of water, and a lot of regions use a lot of fertilizer.”

However, Avalo is on the path to develop low-input, high-quality cotton for these specific conditions.

In Clarendon, Texas, on the northeast side of what is affectionately referred to as the “world’s largest cotton patch”—a region of Texas that that produces 30-50 percent of the U.S.’s cotton—stands one of Avalo’s three R&D plots in the state. Sourcing Journal toured the field last month.

Here, Avalo is creating data for a machine to learn from. “If we’re going to train a machine-learning algorithm to forecast how cotton is going to perform, we need to have high quality training data for it. And we live in the real world, and so this is what real data looks like,” Alvarez, who also serves as the chief science officer, said about the test field.

To prepare the plot, Alvarez said the company “raided” the USDA cotton seed bank in College Station, Texas to capture as much genetic diversity as it could, from wild varieties, cultivated varieties, modern varieties, to historical varieties.

“Having diversity in a crop development program is usually bad. You want to get away from it as quickly as possible. But in the context of machine learning, you need variation and diversity in order to learn something. You can’t learn anything about your crop if you don’t see more options,” he said.

In total, Avalo’s 5-acre field has 500 varieties of cotton. Each row is a different variety and each plant is tagged with identifiers. Alvarez emphasized that for machine learning to be effective, it needs to learn the evolutionary history of cotton in a very short period.

Drones are used to create digital maps and collect data that would otherwise be time consuming for humans. Weekly drone flights provide data on how much a plant has grown (measurable by the physical boundary of the plant from the top down) and much light it’s eating, which will help determine if a plant will put out more cotton bowls.

“By doing that every week, the drone adds to a growth trajectory for each of the plants,” he explained. “When there’s a rain event, for example, we can see if the plants are taking advantage of the rain. Are they eating more light because they’re less thirsty? Are they using the available nitrogen in the ground or are they like ignoring the nitrogen that’s available to them?”

The data Avalo collects is fed into a machine learning algorithm, along with all the environmental data that is coming from the field’s weather station so the model can predict the performance of the plants even when farmers put them out in the field in future years. “In this field, we have as much genetic data as 23andme would grab in about a year’s worth of business,” Alvarez said.

For this region specifically, Avalo aims to develop seeds that address its water and climate issues.

“Cotton can be a thirsty crop, and it takes a lot of water,” said Rebecca White, Avalo chief product officer, adding how the region is on top of the Ogallala Aquifer, which spans from south of Lubbock, Texas all the way into the Dakotas.

“The intensive agriculture that we’ve done over the past couple of centuries, especially the last 150 years, has detrimentally affected that aquifer and wells are drying up,” she said, pointing to a nearby well that stopped drawing enough water to have irrigated cotton.

If farmers in this region want to continue to cultivate cotton, they need cotton seed varieties that are not just drought resistant, meaning that they can tolerate it when there’s less rain than expected, but which are bred specifically to grow in low water environments.

White noted that a lot of the genetics that are available in the cotton industry are for irrigated cotton, or they are for wet area cotton.

Farmers also need varieties that are heat tolerant. Rising temperatures due to climate change is problematic for cotton, especially at night.

“One of the things that cotton needs to mature properly, is a good temperature differential between daytime and nighttime temperatures,” White said. “So, if it’s not cooling off at night, the cotton will drop its blooms. That’s a stress response. It would rather be a bush then put on fruit.”

That response, she added, is basically a defense mechanism that signals to the farmer to try again next year.

Cotton produced in this region comes with some limitations. Much of the cotton grown in Texas—especially under dryland, non-irrigated conditions—lacks the fiber quality required for textile manufacturing and is therefore often used for other purposes. White said this fiber characteristic is closely linked to factors like water availability and nitrogen levels.

Despite these drawbacks, dryland cotton offers notable sustainability advantages, including a smaller carbon footprint compared to other cotton varieties. Avalo chose Clarendon for its test field partly because local farmers rotate cotton with peanuts.

“One of the largest inputs in terms of carbon footprint for cotton is the nitrogen inputs,” White explained. “Peanuts, being a legume, naturally return nitrogen to the soil. So, you can grow peanuts for a year or two and then swap your cotton in, and you don’t have to use nitrogen fertilizer. The combination of being lower input in general and rotating with peanuts means that this cotton in particular has a low carbon footprint.”

Cotton will be the first product that Avalo takes to market. Schwanz said the goal is to use this same approach to regionally adapt cotton varieties to any growing region, so that it can have the attributes needed to both meet the ecological, agricultural and economic demands there.

“Taking data from real fields like this and being able to meld that with really advanced technology—that’s come a long way in the last few years, I think we’re going to really unlock some secrets that we’re not aware of,” said Dakota Keyser, Avalo’s production agronomist.

The technology is also creating new opportunities for farmers managing Avalo’s test fields, helping them boost income during challenging times. “The biggest challenge that cotton farmers are facing today is actually an economic answer,” said Roger Wade, a fifth-generation farmer and one of Avalo’s farming partners. “We’ve got a depressed price and increased input prices, which are things like diesel. As much as we want rechargeable electric tractors, logistically, it’s very hard. The chemicals that we’re using are very expensive, and fertility is very expensive.”

Avalo offers farmers a participation incentive of five cents per pound and contributes toward seed costs, supporting farmers both financially and operationally. In exchange, farmers follow Avalo’s guidelines like a limit on upper fertilizers (no more than 30 lbs. per acre) and collects data for a lifecycle assessment.

At its core, Avalo is focused on addressing challenges across the entire supply chain—creating solutions that benefit both ends and generate meaningful synergies throughout.

Schwanz pointed out how the work goes back to breeding resilience—not just breeding crops that can do more with less or maximizing yield—but true resilience for everyone. “You have to win the ecological and eco economical problem at the same time,” he said.

No machine or human can yet control the rainfall or temperature of a cotton field, but Avalo is redefining what’s possible, using nature and artificial intelligence to take some of the guesswork out o",https://sourcingjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/avalo6.jpg?w=1024,N,,2025-11-03 14:06:33.814087

The lawsuit targets Daimler Truck North America, International Motors, Paccar and Volvo Group North America. CARB claims the companies “have already or will soon breach the terms of contract requiring them to sell clean vehicles in California,” and that even if they have not yet breached the contract, all four have “unambiguously stated that they do not intend to comply.”

The case was filed in the Alameda County Superior Court on Oct. 27, and seeks to compel the truck manufacturers to fulfill the agreement or compensate California for the costs incurred in carrying out its side of the deal.

The lawsuit follows an earlier legal challenge by the same manufacturers. In August, the truck companies filed a suit seeking to invalidate the CTP, which was signed in 2023 and mandated the phasing out of traditional trucks in favor of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The manufacturers argued that federal policy changes under the Trump administration, which rolled back Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules permitting states to set their own emissions laws, rendered the agreement null and void. They contended that California’s enforcement of the CTP conflicts with federal law.

Republicans saw President Donald Trump’s return to office in January as giving them a chance to repeal the Biden administration rules.
But the agency actions could be jeopardized by the status of its acting director, Bill Groffy.
The first Trump administration never had a BLM director confirmed by the Senate and the current Trump administration hasn’t nominated one since its first candidate withdrew.
Trump nominated Kathleen Sgamma in February to BLM director.","Congress has delivered some key wins on federal land management for the Trump administration even as the Bureau of Land Management, the agency that manages roughly 10 percent of American lands, lacks a director confirmed by the Senate.

Using the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers have vacated three BLM rules regarding management of federal lands in Alaska, North Dakota and Montana. The nullifications remove resource management plans adopted by the BLM during the Biden administration that prevented mining and drilling on federal lands in the states.

The Senate last Thursday also voted to rescind a 2022 BLM record of decision that would close off 11 million acres of the 23 million acre Strategic Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to oil and gas leasing. Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, has a companion bill in the House.

The congressional actions have more immediate effect than would a time- and manpower-consuming rule reversal by the BLM, an agency that is working under an acting director whose authority is under challenge. They allow the Trump administration to implement policies to increase drilling and mining on public lands.

Congressional Republicans are critics of the BLM plans, saying the Biden administration was increasing energy prices by curtailing production on federal land.

Republicans saw President Donald Trump’s return to office in January as giving them a chance to repeal the Biden administration rules. The Government Accountability Office’s determination in June that the rules for the purposes of the Congressional Review Act gave them more time to act than is typical under the CRA.

Congress has also cleared three joint resolutions for the president’s desk that will vacate BLM resource management plans concerning eastern Montana, North Dakota and the central Yukon in Alaska.

The agency is also moving forward with other reversals of Biden administration actions that aren’t eligible for nullification under the CRA, including the repeal of a rule that considered conservation a “use” for public lands alongside grazing, mining, and oil and gas extraction. The change, which allowed leases for environmental mitigation and restoration, was criticized by Republicans.

But the agency actions could be jeopardized by the status of its acting director, Bill Groffy. The first Trump administration never had a BLM director confirmed by the Senate and the current Trump administration hasn’t nominated one since its first candidate withdrew.

District Judge Brian Morris in U.S. District Court for the District of Montana found during the first Trump administration that William Perry Pendley had served unlawfully as acting director of the BLM for more than a year. Pendley had been nominated by Trump, but the nomination was soon withdrawn after Republican senators expressed reservations.

Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which filed a challenge of Pendley’s tenure in 2020, sent a letter Friday to the Interior Department expressing concern that the various BLM acting heads, including Groffy, don’t satisfy the requirements of the law that outlines who can lead agencies without a Senate-confirmed leader.

“Without Senate confirmation, Interior’s leaders are more likely to be ‘fringe’ figures or otherwise unqualified. Further, official actions they take may be found by courts to be invalid,” the letter said.

The Interior Department said in an email it “will respond to non-shutdown related queries once appropriations have been enacted.”

Groffy was appointed the principal deputy director of BLM in June, a position that doesn’t require Senate confirmation, and was simultaneously named acting director. He was previously the senior director of legislative and regulatory affairs at the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, an industry group critical of the Biden administration’s land policies.

Trump nominated Kathleen Sgamma in February to BLM director. As director of the oil and natural gas industry group Western Energy Alliance, she was a vocal advocate for the industry and challenged a number of Biden administration decisions in court.

Her nomination was pulled in April just hours before her confirmation hearing was set to begin. Sgamma has previously criticized Trump’s actions during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, writing in a message to WEA members she was “disgusted” by his role in “spreading misinformation.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/hegseth_hearing_704_011425.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:38.989160

The beverage giant, a major producer o premium champagnes and spirits, unveils an updated version of its sustainability roadmap, Good Times from a Good Place, first established in 2019.

The company, which employs 18,224 people and distributes products across more than 160 countries, manages a portfolio exceeding 200 brands including Absolut vodka, Jameson Irish whiskey, Beefeater gin and Malibu liqueur.

Alexandre says: ""Good Times from a Good Place is our strategy to ensure that we operate in a way that minimises our impact on the environment, supports people throughout our value chain and fosters a culture of convivial drinking.

""We are building brands that will last for generations to come, from the soil of our terroirs to the very last sip.""

This philosophy could demonstrate the CEO's understanding that long-term brand value depends on sustainable operations that protect both environmental resources and community wellbeing.

Protecting terroir through regenerative practices

Central to Alexandre's sustainability strategy is the protection of terroir, the specific environment where wine and spirits ingredients are cultivated.

Pernod Ricard sets ambitious 2030 targets to reduce agricultural carbon emissions and preserve biodiversity through regenerative agriculture and carbon removal projects across its terroirs.

The company is transforming its agricultural practices by adopting greener fertilisers and renewable energy for machinery.

Between harvests, it implements cover crops such as clover, herbs and grasses to nourish soil, control pests and support biodiversity. This approach could ensure fields remain healthy and resilient for future production cycles.

Pernod Ricard collaborates with environmental experts to protect habitats and create thriving ecosystems, which could lead to healthier terroirs and more resilient harvests.

Discussing the current environment, the CEO says: ""Today, the world at large faces a growing number of existential challenges. From the escalating impact of climate change to increasing social and political uncertainty, we remain firm in the belief that operating responsibly and sustainably is fundamental to ensure our business remains resilient in the future.""

Reducing carbon through packaging innovation

Circularity represents a fundamental principle in the CEO's sustainability vision. With packaging accounting for 26% of the company's carbon footprint, Alexandre prioritises initiatives to redesign bottles and reduce emissions throughout the supply chain.

The company is light-weighting bottles, switching glass colours and increasing recycled content in packaging to reduce carbon emissions during the design process.

Pernod Ricard's commitment to circular principles extends throughout the product lifecycle, including transitions to plastic-free caps and bottles manufactured from 95% post-consumer glass.

The strategy targets Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions through energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, regenerative agriculture and carbon removal strategies.

In 2024, Pernod Ricard achieved its objective of sourcing 100% renewable electricity across all offices and production sites through green energy procurement and Renewable Energy Certificates.

In the age of AI and “big data,” coal isn’t finished yet.","For more than a decade, the U.S. coal industry has been in decline — with waning investment, shrinking capacity, and the steady rise of gas and renewables. Yet, in 2025, a different story is emerging. Across the country, coal units once scheduled for quiet retirement are being called back into service in ways few anticipated—driven not by nostalgia, but by a new kind of demand shock: the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), data centers, and industrial reshoring.

Massive, round-the-clock power needs from AI and cloud computing, along with “Made in America” manufacturing growth, have led to a capacity crunch that renewables and gas alone can’t satisfy. Momentarily eased policy pressures have allowed coal plants a second act—one defined not by expansion, but on efficiency, reliability, and return on investment.

From Survival to Selective Modernization

Over the past decade, most coal plants operated in “maintenance-only mode.” With low wholesale prices and high regulatory uncertainty, investment was deferred, units slipped to lower efficiency levels, and chronic slagging and fouling became routine.

Now, utilities are being asked to do more, operate more efficiently, and run cleaner without significant capital upgrades. This has pushed operators to focus on selective modernization, especially in areas that provide immediate, measurable benefits.

Reclaiming Lost Megawatts Through Chemistry

One of the most effective tools transforming coal economics is fuel chemistry optimization—led by Environmental Energy Services (EES) and its CoalTreat additive program. CoalTreat additives are applied to the fuel and can alter coal ash characteristics during and after combustion, raising fusion temperatures, decreasing fouling, and recovering lost megawatts.

In one 750-MW tangential-fired boiler, CoalTreat eliminated reheat-section slagging that had previously caused derates. The unit increased output by 3% and lowered NOx emissions by 0.02 lb/MMBtu.

Another 650-MW plant firing high-slag Illinois Basin and Northern Appalachian blends operated five consecutive days at full load—a feat once impossible—after treatment. Infrared boiler cameras confirmed clean pendant and nose-arch surfaces throughout the run.

The economic benefits are equally significant. Switching from premium Central Appalachian to Illinois Basin fuel saved plants $40 per ton while keeping output and compliance intact. At another location, slagging had lowered furnace exit-gas temperatures by 100F, which improved heat rate by 2.5% and increased net annual revenue by an estimated $2.5 million.

Inside the Process: How Additives Transform Ash

Slag formation begins when minerals in coal, such as silicates, iron, sodium, and potassium, are volatilized and/or react during combustion to create high-strength, low-melting point, sometimes glassy deposits that adhere to tube surfaces.

CoalTreat works by introducing specially formulated chemical additives that alter ash chemistry, promoting the formation of brittle crystals (high-melting crystalline structures like anorthite and hematite) instead of “sticky” amorphous glass. The result:

Fluxing or molten deposits become solid and friable, and are easily removed by sootblowing.

Ash fusion temperatures increase by 150F to 200F.

Accumulated slag or fouling is weaker, as shown in sintering strength data, becoming increasingly friable and more easily removed by existing equipment.

Forced outages and heat transfer losses decrease.

Changes in ash chemistry can be observed through high-temperature probe (HTP) testing that simulates tube-surface conditions (Figure 1). Probe accumulations and associated temperature mapping data consistently show reduced slag adhesion and no or reduced “black glass” formation, validating the chemistry’s effectiveness in actual furnace operating conditions (Figure 2). HTP testing, along with furnace infrared photography/thermography conducted during field trials can be used to verify performance in short demonstration programs.

Field Proven: Restoring Lost Megawatts Through Fuel Chemistry

The shift from maintaining the status quo to a renewed focus on maximizing generating capacity and reliability is borne out daily across the U.S. fleet. Utilities that once viewed additive chemistry as a tool of last resort are now actualizing significant operational and financial returns. The following case study from a U.S. coal-fired generating unit demonstrates how a targeted CoalTreat program restored lost megawatts, improved heat rate, and delivered multimillion-dollar gains—all without capital upgrades.

Case Study: Restoring Lost Capacity Through Chemistry

A Midwestern public utility operates a 500-MW-class generating unit burning a high-moisture, moderate-ash coal blend. The unit had faced persistent derates and forced outages due to severe slagging. Traditional sootblowing, load-shedding, and best practices proved inadequate, resulting in the loss of thousands of megawatt-hours of generation annually—often during high-value peak periods.

Implementing a custom additive treatment increased ash fusion temperatures by approximately 200F and through crystal changes in the slag reduced adhesion and accumulation. During the initial test period, the plant avoided more than 9,000 MWh of derate due to fouling and cut forced outages by about 120 hours. Additionally, the unit improved its average heat rate by nearly 200 Btu/kWh and significantly lowered boiler maintenance and sootblower steam consumption.

The savings from heat-rate improvement contribute approximately $1.0 million annually to the plant’s bottom line. Recovered power sales generated a net income of about $5 million per year (after fuel costs), based on an average power sale price of $100/MWh. Maintenance savings from reduced boiler cleaning and weld repairs eliminated roughly $100,000 in annual maintenance expenses.

Peak power sales in many regions will continue to rise. For example, PJM peak power prices hit $898/MWh on April 8, 2025, and $1,334/MWh on June 23, 2025. Plants that can increase power sales during peak hours can substantially boost their profitability. For example, at PJM’s June 2025 peak ($1,334/MWh), recovered MWh could yield greater than $5 million in a single event.

The primary benefit wasn’t just financial. By stabilizing combustion and extending tube life, the additive program also lowered safety risks related to explosive cleaning. Moreover, CoalTreat does not require installing water cannons or other costly maintenance additions. CoalTreat has demonstrated increased plant reliability and that chemistry-based performance recovery can replace substantial capital investments and prevent power sales losses during long upgrade outages.

Fuel Flexibility: The Competitive Edge

With tailored fuel treatment programs, utilities can confidently burn lower-cost, higher-slagging coals without sacrificing performance. This capability to switch between fuel sources offers a valuable hedge against volatile supply and pricing while providing a strategic advantage as dispatch needs evolve with AI-driven baseload growth. By enabling the use of lower-cost “opportunity” coals without sacrificing performance, plants can realize a significant increase in gross profit and maintain operational flexibility in a shifting energy landscape.

EES’s latest CoalTreat On-Demand Systems (ODS) are portable, intelligent treatment systems available for rapid deployment. Reagent dosages and blends are tailored to varying coal types and are capable of automatic control. ODS systems can be used for continuous applications to control persistent slagging or intermittent applications where particular coal blends/seams or operating conditions cause periodic issues.

As AI and reshoring drive unprecedented electricity demand (the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts 20 GW to 30 GW of new data center load by 2030—equivalent to more than 50 coal units at 80% capacity factor), the existing coal fleet remains essential for system stability. For utility stakeholders, the message is practical: Invest selectively, measure diligently, and optimize the assets you already have. Every avoided derate, every efficiency improvement, and every ton of fuel flexibility counts in this high-demand environment (Figure 3).

In the age of AI and “big data,” coal isn’t finished yet. By embracing targeted innovation and smarter fuel chemistry, operators demonstrate that legacy assets can adapt (Figure 4), delivering cleaner, more reliable, and cost-effective power when the grid needs it most.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/fig4-coal-bottom-and-pendant-ash-before-after-treatment-ees-1024x672.png,N,,2025-11-03 14:06:13.635309

Who're they gonna call? Well, Toyota's latest SEMA 2025 build may be the answer.

Combining its hydrogen fuel cell innovations with proven EV tech, Toyota presents a unique and eco-friendly take on adventure with the Tacoma H2-Overland Concept, built on the latest Toyota Tacoma. This concept will be on display at the 2025 SEMA Show and features specs that will undoubtedly make for a fun time beyond the pavement, while also serving as a sort of rescue/recovery vehicle, thanks to some nifty features. Let's take a look!

The Tacoma H2-Overland Is A 540+ Horsepower, Clean-Driving Off-Road Pickup

The Tacoma H2-Overland Concept showcases Toyota's multi-path approach to a cleaner future, showing that hydrogen fuel cell tech can be as capable as it is clean. Built by the Toyota Racing Development (TRD) engineering teams in California and North Carolina, as well as Toyota Motor North America R&D, the Tacoma H2-Overland Concept features a 547-horsepower dual-motor setup that consists of a 225-kW front motor and a 188-kW rear eAxle powered by a 24.9-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, offering genuine 4WD ability.

The system utilizes a fuel cell stack taken from the second-gen Toyota Mirai with three H2 tanks providing a 6-kg capacity that pairs with the battery pack to deliver the very respectable 547 horsepower mentioned. The system relies on a TRD custom cooling system that was adapted from Tacoma TRD and Lexus RZ parts to ensure thermal stability when pushing the H2-Overland Concept.

The concept features a 15-kW power takeoff that's capable of powering a home off-grid or even charging two EVs simultaneously, thanks to dual NEMA 14–50 outlets. Its charging capability, as well as its powerful off-road ability, make it a noteworthy recovery vehicle. From simply charging your battery to pulling you out of a mud bog and powering your campsite, this build is essentially a St. Bernard with a barrel of whiskey in a blizzard. But wait, there's more! Taking survivability to new heights is the patent-pending TRD exhaust water recovery system, which captures and filters water from the exhaust for camping and outdoor use. While the captured water may not be recommended for drinking, it's distilled and is perfect for showering and washing.

A Proper Off-Roader That Takes The 'Buddy System' Seriously

The concept was designed and built entirely in-house by TRD-USA and features everything you'd expect from such a model, and more. Features include a front limited-slip diff and rear electronic locking diff, a TRD billet long-travel kit with heavy-duty, high-performance Fox 2.5 Performance Elite Series shocks, a brake upgrade, and a set of custom 17x8.5-inch wheels shod in 35x12.5R17 off-road tires. In other words, it's a true four-wheel-drive overlander that can handle pretty much any terrain.

The build is also equipped with a camper fitted with recycled carbon-fiber aero panels, heavy-duty off-road bumpers on the front and rear, integrated recovery points, a winch, and dual swingouts, as well as tiedowns and a recovery board storage system in the bed of the pickup. Of course, an adventure vehicle needs ample lighting, which the team supplied in the form of DOT-compliant front lightbars, fog lights, and camp lights for those late nights in the wild. The TRD team has successfully adapted FCEV and BEV technology onto a platform that was never meant to house such applications, creating a concept that can tackle any terrain, help those stranded, power campsites, and provide usable water, all without damaging the very environment it's built to dominate.",https://static0.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/jpegtacoma_h2_overlander_concept_toyota_sema_2025_hi-res_29.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-03 19:05:17.158357

Efforts by politicians to tilt the electoral playing field through redistricting and other manipulations are almost as old as American democracy itself, and indeed, by the late 19th century, both parties had turned redistricting into a blood sport.

Republicans and Democrats alike used every procedural lever available — from mid-decade map rewrites to the strategic admission of new states like the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming — to lock in House, Senate and Electoral College advantages that would outlast their popular vote share.

What’s unfolding in California is less a break from tradition than a reversion to it — and a reminder that the map wars of the Gilded Age, not the reformist ideals of the late 20th century, might be the true American inheritance.

The history of gerrymandering is nearly as old as the republic itself. The term was coined in 1812, when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry approved a state senate map so contorted that one district outside Boston resembled a salamander — hence, “Gerry-mander.” But the instinct to manipulate boundaries for advantage long predated the nickname. Early state legislatures routinely redrew maps mid-decade to dilute rival factions, suppress emerging parties or amplify rural interests. By the 1840s and 1850s, as industrial cities grew and immigrant voters swelled the rolls, both Democrats and Whigs were perfecting the art — carving up counties, annexing wards and tinkering with apportionment formulas — in the name of “fair representation.”

Drawing convoluted maps was one matter. But in the late 19th century, as popular vote shares in presidential and House races grew tighter, parties worked feverishly to devise new ways to achieve and preserve power.

Throughout the Gilded Age, state legislatures treated redistricting as a political cudgel. With no “one person, one vote” rule — that wouldn’t become the law of the land until Baker v. Carr in 1962 — little judicial oversight and volatile shifts in partisan control, state politicians wielded mapmaking as an extension of electoral combat. Whenever one party captured the governorship and legislature, it redrew district lines to tilt the playing field and expand its share of congressional seats — sometimes mid-decade, sometimes repeatedly within a few election cycles. As political scientist Erik Engstrom observed in his article, “The Rise and Decline of Party Gerrymandering in the 19th Century U.S. Congress,” “these 19th-century gerrymanders were not symbolic gestures but decisive acts that could swing national power in Washington itself.”

Nowhere was that more apparent than in Ohio, where lawmakers redrew the state’s congressional map an astonishing seven times between 1878 and 1892 as Democrats and Republicans traded control of the legislature and governorship. Each new majority sought to reverse its predecessor’s advantage and pad its own congressional delegation — often with immediate national consequences. One Democratic redraw, urged on by House Speaker Samuel Randall in 1878, flipped nine seats and preserved his party’s tenuous majority in Congress. A decade later, also in the middle of a 10-year census cycle, Republicans returned the favor in Pennsylvania, carving out 21 safe GOP districts out of 28 and seizing back control of the U.S. House — and with it, unified command of the federal government.

Other states followed similar patterns. In Alabama, Democrats redrew the map in the mid-1870s, packing nearly every Black Belt county into a single district to quarantine Republican votes. In Missouri, Democrats undertook a mid-decade 1878 redistricting alongside Ohio’s, flipping seats that helped preserve their narrow House majority. And in Maine, Republicans’ 1884 gerrymander proved so effective that it delivered them all four congressional seats for the next five elections, even though they won only about 54 percent of the statewide vote. Across the map, the pattern was unmistakable: Whenever control of a statehouse shifted, new lines quickly followed.

In the decades after the Civil War, Republicans pursued another, even more durable form of redistricting — one that operated at the national level. By the late 1870s, with the party’s congressional majorities slipping and the reunited Democrats regaining strength in the South, GOP leaders turned to the map of the Union itself. Between 1889 and 1890, Congress admitted six new western states — North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho and Wyoming — most with populations not remotely sufficient to justify statehood. Each brought two reliable Republican senators and at least one new seat in the Electoral College.

The motivation was as ideological as it was partisan. To many Republicans of that generation, allowing Democrats to reclaim full control of the federal government was tantamount to losing the Civil War after the fact — a return to the 1850s, when a coalition of Southern slaveholders and Northern Democrats dominated Washington. The rapid stacking of Republican states in the high plains and Rockies was meant to safeguard the political gains of Union victory, ensuring that the party of Lincoln could not easily be dislodged from national power. In the process, the GOP quite literally redrew the American map in an effort to preserve its governing majority — a reminder that in this period, the boundaries of the nation itself were tools of partisan survival.

Mid-decade redistricting may have slept for a century, but it didn’t die. Beginning in the early 2000s, Republicans revived the practice with remarkable zeal — first in Texas in 2003, when then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay engineered a mid-cycle remap that netted the GOP six new congressional seats, and later in Georgia (2005) and North Carolina (2016), where party leaders followed suit. Each case upended the modern norm of once-a-decade redistricting and demonstrated that the old Gilded Age instincts — redraw when you can, because you can — were still alive in American politics.

For Democrats today, the lesson isn’t necessarily that bare-knuckle politics of the variety plied by Gilded Age politicians is good, or just, or sensible. Rather, it’s that history does not offer a particularly compelling case for political purity at the sacrifice of power. The line between principle and self-preservation — or, as was often the case, outright partisan conquest — has always been negotiable in American democracy. Those who refuse to negotiate it often find themselves out of the map room, and out of power.

The same historical argument that can be made for mid-decade redistricting in blue states can also be made for admitting new states to the Union — Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., to be sure, but why not Guam, American Samoa or the U.S. Virgin Islands? However out of step such moves might seem with recent norms, an expansion of the federal map would be entirely consistent with the country’s political traditions.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F96%2F36%2F73336e904fd2af269e4b72ab6578%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2242675715,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:55.689510

In a surprise move that could benefit PJM Interconnection, Gov. Josh Shapiro and three other have submitted a joint proposal formulated with the Data Center Coalition (DCC), an industry group, that favors approving connections to data center firms that will generate and add their own power to the grid.

The proposal would offer a fast track approval process for both the data centers and the power sources they would build. The idea was raised this week during a hearing held by PJM, the nation’s largest electrical grid, as it grapples with soaring demands and seeks federal approval later this year to hasten permit reviews.

Pamela Quinlan, a principal at GQS New Energy Strategies, an energy consulting company that represents the DCC, a leading data center trade group, described the eight-page plan as a “voluntary and heavily incentivized” path for the industry.

Quinlan offered limited details during the hearing at PJM’s office near Philadelphia. The proposal generated interest because the four governors—from Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia—have been critical of PJM’s operations but eager for data center expansion in their states.

The electricity originated by the centers’ power generators would feed into the PJM’s regional grid, bolstering its reliability, according to the proposal. At least one energy researcher who reviewed the proposal said the strategy may also boost reliance by the new data centers on natural gas.

The DCC is an industry trade group for data center operators and cloud providers. Among its members are the biggest tech companies in the world, including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, all of which have invested billions of dollars in developing and deploying artificial intelligence and, in the past couple years, proposing new data centers. AI operations require massive amounts of water and power.

Jacob Finkel, an aide to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, spoke at the hearing and said he was representing the four states, which are in “strong alignment” with the DCC over the proposal.

PJM’s inability to process grid applications in a timely manner has frustrated many governors across the grid operator’s 13-state service area. The other states reliant on PJM are Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. It was not clear during the meeting if the other states were consulted by Finkel.

Data centers require around-the-clock electricity and even brief dips can cost millions of dollars in revenue. The fast-track proposal aims to accommodate lucrative investment from tech and financial firms in some pivotal states.

States oversee the siting, permitting and environmental review for commercial projects that require grid access. The states also assess land-use or rights-of-way and construction approvals related to the construction of electric lines and substations.

The DCC-governors proposal essentially relies on the states to expedite permitting and siting for the data operations. Under the proposal outlined by Quinlan, each state can issue directives to expedite projects that will build energy lines or substations. The data center’s power sources don’t have to be on the data-center site itself. The generators can be elsewhere in the same grid area that is approved by the state.

Under the plan, data centers qualify for the fast lane only if they create power equal to their expected use. For example, a data center site planning to use 50 megawatts must secure or develop 50 megawatts of supply. Those megawatts would be added to PJM’s grid at the time the business is launched.

The proposal includes a measure to combat rising bills for all ratepayers. The proposal would extend or maintain the current capacity charge set by PJM—what customers pay to guarantee power at all times—for another year. In July, PJM issued a capacity charge for service from June 2026 to May 2027 that topped 20 percent, and it agreed then to extend the cap to that charge to 2028. PJM said that would mean an increase of about 1.5 to 5 percent in customers’ bills, depending on their area.

The proposal outlined by the DCC would extend the price cap into the summer of 2029.

“Seeing this proposal to extend the price cap for another year is a very significant win for consumers,” said Abraham Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute. That would shield customers from price spikes as data centers come online, he said.

The DCC and the governors supplied few details about their proposal beyond an eight-page outline. Some analysts said the DCC and the governors need to provide specifics on how each state will review and decide to fast-track the projects.

Paul Sotkiewicz, the president of energy consulting company E-Cubed Policy Associates and a former chief economist for PJM, said states should be wary of how they “short-circuit” processes that will affect local residents and governments.

“I can imagine it backfiring on politicians if they do that,” Sotkiewicz said. “It all sounds nice on paper, but….I don’t see how it can happen.”

“There are certain processes that they have to follow and procedures that they have to follow to issue permits,” he said. “That’s just the way permitting works.”

Finkel said Pennsylvnia and other states will form a “consortium” to “figure out how they’re going to do this.” Finkel offered Pennsylvania’s months-old Lightning Plan as an example, which aims for a one-stop deadline-driven framework for power projects permits. The plan, announced in January, would create a new oversight board to coordinate and speed siting and approvals. As of this month, the plan remains a blueprint.

Silverman pointed to another concern about the fuel driving the new power sources. States with ambitious climate change goals might have to accept that the data centers that contribute to PJM will be using gas rather than solar or wind power, he said.

“A hyperscale data center…may be a thousand megawatts. That’s a lot of solar,” Silverman said.

Joseph Bowring, the president of Monitoring Analytics, an independent monitoring unit that reports on PJM’s electric power market, said the DCC-governors proposal is missing some notable guarantees.

A central question in the rulemaking discussions over PJM reliability is who should lose power when the grid is stressed, he said. Should data centers lose power first? Should they lose it in sync with everyone? Or should they be the last to lose power?

“The equitable way to formulate it for these guys who are coming onto the system (and) bringing 30,000 megawatts of issues is for them to be interrupted first,” Bowring said. “If interruptions were assigned to data centers first,” he said, it is likely that “data centers would not sign up for that service.”

Bowring said even if PJM assigned interruptions “perfectly,” the fact that there would be interruptions means the grid cannot reliably serve its customer base.

Bowring said the monitoring group advocates not allowing data centers to connect unless the grid can guarantee continual service and reliability.

The plan from DCC and the governors is one of more than a dozen proposals being considered by PJM as it seeks public comment to support a request for a rule change—known as the Critical Issue Fast Path—meant to add suppliers to the grid.

PJM has also heard its own staff proposal: allowing 10 new proposed projects per year to connect to the grid in as little as 10 months through expedited reviews. Critics said that approach, too, would favor gas-fueled developers.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Josh-Shapiro-Lightning-Plan-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:13:13.131556

4.5 GW

New power generating secured for “large growth opportunities.”

$41 billion

Estimated capital spending through 2029.

Pending and signed hyperscaler deals

Entergy is a vertically-integrated electric utility with five operating companies in four states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Its weather-adjusted retail sales rose 4.4% compared to last year. Profit increased from $645 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $694 million in the third quarter of 2025. In 2024, commercial and industrial customers made up 69% of Entergy’s sales, which were concentrated in Louisiana.

The company has agreements for several notable large load projects with Google and Meta. In general, it expects substantial load growth from commercial and industrial customers through 2029, though not the breakneck pace utilities like Dominion Energy expect in data center hotspots such as northern Virginia.

In its third-quarter investor update, Entergy said its data center customer pipeline increased 2 GW from the previous quarter to land in the 7 GW to 12 GW range. Also in the quarter, Energy secured 4.5 GW of power generation equipmentto serve new load expected to come online this decade.

In August, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the generation and transmission resources needed to support Meta’s planned 2-GW campus in northeastern Louisiana. Those include three combined-cycle gas plants with combined nameplate capacity of about 2.2 GW.

As part of the same proceeding, the commission also authorized Entergy to procure up to 1.5 GW of solar resources for the project.

Entergy executives said Wednesday that the Meta agreement and additional expected load growth are reflected in the utility’s five-year capital plan, which lays out $41 billion in estimated spending through 2029.

Entergy has also submitted an application to the Arkansas Public Service Commission for the Cypress Solar project, a 600-MW solar / 350-MW battery energy storage project backed by Google.

The Cypress Solar project would power a 1,000-acre Google data center campus in West Memphis, Arkansas. Google will cover the “full energy costs” of the campus, the Arkansas Economic Development Corporation said on Oct. 2.

Gas continues to dominate Entergy’s energy mix

In December 2024, renewables made up just 3% of Entergy’s 24-GW portfolio of owned and leased generation. Gas-, coal- and oil-fired resources make up more than 75% of its existing generation capacity and around 75% of capacity approved or under consideration by utility commissions across its four-state footprint, according to its third-quarter earnings presentation.

In September, the PUCT approved two gas-fired power projects, the 754-MW Legend combined-cycle power station and the 454-MW Lone Star combustion-turbine plant, but with a $2.4 billion “hard cap” to protect ratepayers due to regulator concerns that the utility did not take steps to ensure the projects were cost effective.

In addition to gas-powered generation, executives said they also see long-term opportunity in clean energy development and electrification.

Including the Cypress Solar project, which is pending regulator approval, Entergy has more than 2 GW of clean energy projects — mostly standalone solar — approved or under consideration. Entergy itself will own about 1.5 GW of that capacity while procuring 570 MW through power purchase agreements.

Marsh said large customers’ sustainability goals could support future carbon capture investments.

“We are building this gas generation, but we have expectations that we will also do carbon capture at some point, and we are working on that actively,” he said, citing requests for proposals for projects in Mississippi and Texas.

Cautious optimism on new nuclear

Marsh said he was “excited” by recent nuclear-related developments nationally and in Entergy territory, such as the creation of the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office. All four Entergy states have a formal, state-led process or body to explore new nuclear generation, he said.

He said Entergy “applauds” the $80 billion deal between Brookfield Asset Management, Cameco, Westinghouse Electric and the U.S. government to deploy multiple gigawatt-scale reactors. The utility will keep close tabs on the partnership as more details come out, Marsh said.

“We’re excited to see someone moving forward,” he said.

Marsh did not announce any new-build nuclear projects on the call, but Entergy has filed for a $69 million, 45-MW capacity uprate of its Waterford 3 nuclear plant in Louisiana. It expects to complete that project by 2029.

Transmission and grid hardening investments

In addition to large load growth, Entergy is planning to grade and expand its transmission and distribution network.

In October, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas approved the company’s 145-mile, 500-kV SETEX transmission project in Entergy’s Southeast Texas territory. Entergy expects the Texas commission to approve its approximately 45-mile, 500-kV Cypress to Legend line later this year.

Separately, the company was awarded a $200 million grant from the Texas Energy Fund that Entergy CEO Drew Marsh said would harden 16 transmission lines and more than 8,000 distribution poles.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JvhbgH5If-il9tKXst4GxfDj9jBJDsco4LgrVwcMjHU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9FbnRlcmd5X0NvcnBfTmluZW1pbGVfNl9wb3dlcl9wbGFudF9Mb3Vpc2lhbmFfMjAxOS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-03 14:06:17.376631

The project’s contractor, Barton Malow, confirmed the workforce reduction.

The statement affirmed a commitment to ""supporting them through this transition."" While steel frames for the massive facility stand in place, the pace of work has visibly decelerated. Local officials attribute the pause to potential design changes, possibly for a different battery type than the originally planned nickel-rich prismatic cells.

This hesitation arrives as GM aggressively slashes EV costs and redirects capital toward its profitable gasoline-powered truck and SUV portfolio. The automaker’s broader retrenchment includes thousands of layoffs at other EV and battery facilities. Shifting federal policies under the Trump administration have further clouded the business case for electric vehicles, dismantling incentives and creating a more challenging environment.

Despite the turbulence, St. Joseph County’s Bill Schalliol projects confidence in the project's ultimate completion. He believes the plant will open by the December 2027 deadline, even if its final product differs from the initial blueprint. ""We're playing the long game,"" Schalliol said, dismissing any notion of a complete abandonment. GM, he quipped, didn’t invest billions ""to convert this into the world's largest pickleball facility."" Yet for nearby residents like Dan Caruso, the slowed construction fuels skepticism.

2. The world is on track for about 2.8 degrees of warming

The world is on track to warm by an average of 2.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the Rhodium Group predicted in its latest forecast. The consultancy said its modeling showed a 67% likelihood that global temperatures will rise between 2.3 degrees and 3.4 degrees thanks to the current trajectory of planet-heating pollution. That’s a significant improvement on the dire predictions issued a decade ago. But if decarbonization doesn’t pick up pace, the probability of limiting warming to 2 degrees — the more modest target set in the Paris Agreement — is below 5%. Still, the findings don’t deviate much from Rhodium’s projections before Trump returned to office. As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote this morning, “in the long run, Trump might not mean much for the climate’s trajectory.”

Nevertheless, the overshoot beyond 2 degrees is partly why Bill Gates took a more moderate stance on climate change in his latest memo, as Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer wrote last week. It’s also why, as Rob explained in a big story, private companies promising to commercialize technology to geoengineer the world’s temperature are raising large sums of money.

3. Energy Department makes $100 million available to help modernize coal plants

The Department of Energy is stepping up its efforts to keep aging coal plants online. The agency on Friday announced plans to offer up to $100 million to owners of coal-fired power stations that plan to modernize the stations with upgrades that “improve efficiency, plant lifetimes, and performance of coal and natural gas use.” In a press release, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright praised President Donald Trump for having “ended the war on American coal” and “restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

Despite Trump’s promises to revive American coal production and use, exports fell 11% in the first half of this year due to China buying less of the fuel amid ongoing trade negotiations, according to an analysis published Friday by the Energy Information Administration.

Quarterly coal exports, on the rise on the Biden administration, are now plunging. EIA

The company said “it had decided that only its units serving UK and European clients would remain part of the Net Zero Asset Managers” group, the Financial Times reported. BlackRock, Vanguard, and JP Morgan Asset Management had already left the group known as NZAM in the U.S. JP Morgan and State Street had already also quit another green investor group, Climate Action 100+, last year.

5. Spain is officially reconsidering the world’s last national nuclear phaseout

Months after Taiwan shut down its final reactors earlier this year, a plurality of voters approved a referendum calling for the last atomic plant to be turned back on. Years after Germany completely exited nuclear power, the new government has reversed Berlin’s position and has now joined France in supporting atomic energy again as it considers ways to restore its fleet. Switzerland and Belgium, meanwhile, reversed plans to shut down nuclear plants, and Italy — the first country in the world to end its nuclear power production years ago — is working on reviving its industry. That leaves only Spain still stubbornly planning to close its nuclear plants starting in 2027.

The tides may be turning. In February, a majority of lawmakers in Spain’s parliament approved a resolution condemning Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s phaseout plans. Now the board of Spain’s Centrales Nucleares Almaraz-Trillo has officially requested a three-year extension on the operating license for units one and two of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant. If granted, the extension would allow the reactors to stay online through 2030. The station currently supplies 7% of Spain’s electricity.

THE KICKER

Fusion energy, the joke goes, is the energy source of tomorrow — and always will be. But recent laboratory breakthroughs have unleashed billions of dollars in private financing to commercialize fusion energy for real, with companies promising to open power plants in the next decade. There’s a big bottleneck, however: Many of the materials needed for fusion reactors are scarcely produced right now. New bipartisan legislation aims to change that by extending the 45X tax credit for clean manufacturing — one of the few parts of the Inflation Reduction Act retained in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act — to producers of vanadium, deuterium, helium-3, and other materials needed for fusion power to take off.

The “Supreme Court” of energy in Georgia

There are only 10 states in the country that hold elections for a Public Service Commission, a small group of regulators who oversee utility companies, and Georgia is one of them. As Charles Hua, the executive director of the nonprofit PowerLines, recently put it, these officials are the “Supreme Court justices” of energy. They preside over what kinds of infrastructure gas and electric utilities will build, where they’ll build it, and how much rates will go up as a result.

The election in Georgia is long overdue after being held up by a lawsuit the last two election cycles. Two of the five current commissioners have served three extra years without being re-elected by voters. During that time, the commission has approved six rate increases for customers of Georgia Power, the largest utility in the state, in part to pay for major cost overruns on new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle. Now Georgia Power is proposing a major expansion of natural gas power — about 10 nuclear reactors’ worth — mostly to meet data center demand.

The two seats are held by Republicans Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. They are being challenged by Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johson, who have vowed to push for Georgia Power to meet demand with clean energy.

Battle for the soul of electricity affordability in New Jersey and Virginia

Energy costs are at the center of the governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia this year, and Democrats and Republicans are making opposite arguments about how to lower them. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill has vowed to freeze utility rates and clear red tape to “open the floodgates on new cheaper and cleaner energy projects,” including solar, battery storage, and nuclear. Her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, thinks the key to lower prices is pulling out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 13-state cap and trade program that incentivizes cleaner power generation and raises money for climate-friendly projects. He also wants to repeal the state’s electrification goals for vehicles and buildings and ban offshore wind development.

A similar fight is playing out in Virginia, although there it’s tied more to the state’s rapidly multiplying data centers. Virginia is already home to 13% of global data center capacity, with more coming online. A recent state legislative report warns that customers are looking at increases of $14 to $37 per month by 2040 as a result.

The Democratic candidate for governor, former U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger, wants to expand solar and wind power and invest in building efficiency. She’s also advocated for data centers to “pay their fair share” of new energy infrastructure, and said she will encourage them to pilot advanced clean technologies like small modular nuclear reactors and hydrogen. She’s running against Winson Earle Sears, the current lieutenant governor of Virginia, who has questioned the reliability of renewable energy, arguing for an all-of-the-above strategy that includes “clean coal.” While “beautiful clean coal,” may be one of Trump’s favorite energy sources, the reality is, it’s still just coal.

The governor’s seat isn’t the only one that’s up for grabs in Virginia. Whoever wins will need the House of Delegates on their side. Democrats currently have a razor thin 51-seat majority, and all 100 seats are on offer. Even a blue wave in the House doesn’t guarantee strong climate action, however, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Climate Cabinet. “Which candidates win will determine whether Virginia expands on” its climate law, the Clean Economy Act, “or backslides,” the group said in a “races to watch” memo.

Public transit for a fast-growing city

Voters in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the whole of Mecklenburg County, will be asked whether to increase their sales tax by 1% to fund new transportation projects. Roughly 60% of the estimated $20 billion raised by the tax will go toward the expansion of rail and bus service. Charlotte is among the fastest-growing cities in the country. During a legislative hearing this summer, State Senator Mujtaba Mohammad said an average of 130 people move to the area each day. “We are experiencing longer commutes, more car accidents, higher car insurance premiums, more pedestrian-related accidents and less revenue to address our crumbling critical infrastructure,” he said.

The Charlotte Area Transit System finalized a new long-range plan this year to foster “transit-oriented communities,” by increasing bus frequency, extending service hours, adding microtransit options to underserved neighborhoods, and adding 43 miles of new rail. But the plan is only possible with funding from the sales tax.

Sales tax increases are a common way to raise money for public transit systems — legislators in California recently voted to put a sales tax increase on next year’s ballot to address a looming fiscal cliff for transit in the Bay Area. Illinois also voted last week to increase the sales tax in the Chicago area by 0.025% to raise money for its ailing transit system, among other measures.

Other fights to watch:

A few smaller elections where climate is also on the ballot this year, according to Climate Cabinet:

The Whatcom County Council, in Washington State, which in 2021, became the first local government in the country to prohibit new oil refineries, coal plants, and fossil fuel shipment facilities. There’s currently a slim 4-3 pro-climate majority on the council, and Climate Cabinet says that if that majority holds, it will “send a signal to other pro-climate county leaders around the country that their courage won’t cost them their seats.”

Jacob Frey, the current mayor of Minneapolis, pissed off climate advocates earlier this year when he vetoed a local carbon fee passed by the city council, arguing it was not legally sound. The council overrode the veto, but the fee was ultimately scaled back from $452 per ton to $5 per ton after a study by city staff found the lower number to be safer from legal challenges. Climate Cabinet is watching for whether candidates for the mayor’s office and city council who support carbon fees will win or be punished, and “whether anti-climate candidates gain more of a foothold in the city.”

A full decade has passed since the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, and in that time the world has avoided the most catastrophic scientific projections. In 2015, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, projected that global average temperatures could increase by as much as 7.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century without significant shifts in policy and advancements in technology. Now, the Rhodium Group estimates that warming is highly unlikely to exceed 3.9 degrees by 2100, and could be limited to 2 degrees.

The numbers themselves are not hopeful. This is a vast range in terms of the potential impacts implied, and even 2 degrees of warming should not be considered “little.” The IPCC estimates that compared with a scenario that limits warming to 1.5 degrees, more than twice as many people would be exposed to severe heat at least once every five years in a world 2 degrees warmer; ice-free summers in the Arctic would occur 10 times more often; the number of plant, animal, and insect species that lose at least half their habitat would be two to three times larger; and crop yields and fisheries would suffer roughly twice the losses.

Putting those dire projections aside, what’s interesting is that this 2- to 3.9-degree range is about the same as what the Rhodium Group forecast when it published its first Climate Outlook report in 2023. Also relatively unchanged: a finding that global power sector emissions will peak within the next decade, and that total emissions will likely remain constant or subtly decline through 2060, but then go up again as Global South countries see more rapid economic development in the latter half of the century.

The reason the numbers haven’t changed much, despite some seemingly dramatic policy changes that have occurred in the interim, has to do with Rhodium’s unique approach to projecting the future.

Many of the reports that come out around this time, such as the UN’s annual Emissions Gap Report, try to assess where the world is headed based on currently enacted policies as well as pledges, such as the “nationally determined contributions” that countries submit to the UN. Those might include promises like, “We’ll build X quantity of renewable energy by 2030,” or “We’ll protect X amount of our forests.” The models assume that these policies and pledges are fixed. They do not contemplate future ramp-ups or potential reversals. They also use fixed assumptions about GDP and population growth, oil prices, technology costs, etc.

A recent report by Wood Mackenzie, for example, estimates that temperatures will climb to 2.6 degrees by 2060, and then models a few other potential discrete scenarios, including one that shows what it would take to limit warming to 2 degrees.

The limitation of this approach is that the trajectory for each variable these models use is deeply uncertain, Hannah Pitt, one of the authors of the Rhodium report, told me. “Even a small change in GDP growth can have really big implications for emissions — likewise for oil prices and renewable costs and all that,” she said. “We try to take into consideration the wide range of uncertainty we have in the future of those core drivers of emissions.” That requires modeling thousands of scenarios with different combinations of how those underlying drivers might evolve.

Then, rather than assuming that policies on the books today remain static, Rhodium uses data on how climate and energy policy has historically responded to economic inputs like oil prices and GDP growth, in different parts of the world to project how policy might change going forward, using a carbon price as a proxy for policy ambition.

This approach takes into account such a wide range of possibilities that the results aren’t likely to change much year to year. Both in 2023 and now, the modeling incorporated the prospect that a Trump administration or something like it could reverse some progress, and that energy demand could soar. “We are looking at the long-term evolution of policy, not the administration fluctuations,” Pitt explained. It would take a true step-change in policy or a major technological breakthrough to produce a noticeable change in the trajectory, she said.

What are those breakthroughs? At this point, they aren’t a mystery. Cheaper clean firm power — like advanced nuclear, fusion, or geothermal — would be a huge help. Solutions for decarbonizing flying and shipping are also on the list. We also need to make it affordable to produce iron, steel, cement, and petrochemicals with far fewer emissions.

On the policy side, bending the curve might mean something like stricter electric vehicle requirements. As mentioned earlier, economic development in the Global South is expected to shift emissions back upward later this century — in part because if policy evolves the way it has historically, and if more and more people around the world are buying cars, the cars may not be 100% electric, and emissions from transport will go up.

None of this is to say that the Trump administration’s actions will have no effect on warming. Recall the report’s expansive range of future warming scenarios of 2 to 3.9 degrees — it’s very possible that policies enacted today will push the world closer to one or the other. A separate recent Rhodium study that dives into the specifics of U.S. policies found that emissions in 2035 could be 0.8 to 1.2 gigatonnes higher than what the group projected in the same report last year, largely due to Trump’s policies.

It should be comforting that one administration can’t veer the world too far off course — although by that same logic, we can’t expect a single administration to shift projections in a positive direction, either. A ""breakthrough"" in something like decarbonized cement will likely happen over years, through a feedback loop of sustained policy support and technological development.

There is no “too late” when it comes to addressing the technology and policy gaps the report highlights, Pitt said “Of course, the sooner the better,” she said. “But the difference between a 2.8-degree future and a 2.5-degree future saves lives. So the effort to drive these technology costs down is worthwhile, even if it doesn’t happen on the timeline that we would hope.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjAwMTc5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNjYzMzcyMH0.JLSQqq1tXMvX2awV44mALHTDHXLSQUYOuv4pdP-Gh7I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-03 13:13:17.126363

The U.S. energy system is changing faster than most organization's planning cycles, and new clean energy policies, evolving reliability standards, rapid load growth from data centers, electrification, and a flood of distributed resources are reshaping what a ""least cost, least risk"" portfolio looks like.

Mastering Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) is no longer optional - it's how utilities, regulators, and advisors make capital decisions that stand up to scrutiny, deliver reliability in extreme conditions, and keep bills affordable while meeting environmental commitments.

This seminar explains how to turn policy shifts and technological complexity into a repeatable, defensible planning process. You'll learn the methods, models, and software that top IRP teams use to translate goals into portfolios; then into procurement and execution.

The rare earth processing landscape witnessed a transformative development when Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF) established a strategic alliance with German magnet manufacturer Vacuumschmelze (VAC) and its American subsidiary eVAC Magnetics LLC. This collaboration represents a fundamental pivot toward Western supply chain independence in critical materials processing, targeting the creation of an integrated pathway from refined oxides to finished permanent magnets.

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance centers on bridging two crucial industrial stages within North American manufacturing infrastructure. Ucore contributes its proprietary RapidSX™ separation technology alongside planned production facilities in Louisiana and Ontario, while VAC brings decades of magnet manufacturing expertise through established distribution networks across automotive, defense, and renewable energy sectors.

Core Components of the Partnership Framework

The alliance establishes an integrated supply pathway connecting refined rare earth oxides directly to finished permanent magnet production. This vertical integration approach addresses a critical gap in Western rare earth processing capabilities, where refined materials typically require export to Asian manufacturers for magnet production before returning to Western end-users.

Partnership Component Ucore Contribution VAC/eVAC Contribution Technology Platform RapidSX™ separation process Advanced magnet manufacturing Production Capacity 2,000-7,500 tonnes annually Established global supply chains Government Support $22.4M DoD backing $111.9M federal tax credits Geographic Footprint Louisiana & Ontario facilities South Carolina & European plants

The partnership operates under a nine-month Memorandum of Understanding timeline, requiring both parties to negotiate definitive commercial terms while managing ongoing construction, permitting, and financing activities simultaneously. This compressed timeframe creates both opportunity and execution pressure for finalizing binding agreements.

Key Elements Driving the Partnership

Strategic government support underpins the collaboration through multiple funding mechanisms. eVAC Magnetics secured $111.9 million in federal tax credits for its South Carolina permanent magnet manufacturing facility, while Ucore received $22.4 million in Department of Defense backing for its RapidSX™ technology development and facility construction.

Furthermore, this partnership aligns with critical minerals energy security initiatives that recognise the strategic importance of domestic processing capabilities. The geographic distribution of facilities creates a North American rare earth processing corridor spanning Louisiana, Ontario, and South Carolina. This configuration positions the alliance to serve both U.S. and Canadian defense requirements while supporting clean energy infrastructure development across the continent.

How Does the RapidSX™ Technology Transform Rare Earth Processing?

Revolutionary Separation Methodology

Ucore's RapidSX™ platform employs molecular recognition technology to achieve superior purity levels while significantly reducing processing time compared to conventional solvent extraction methods. This innovative approach enables production of battery-grade and magnet-grade oxides with measurably lower environmental impact than traditional processing techniques.

The technology processes rare earth elements 3-5 times faster than conventional methods while achieving 99.9%+ purity levels for standard magnet applications. Enhanced purity specifications reach 99.95%+ for wind turbine applications and 99.99%+ for defense systems, making the technology suitable for the most demanding high-performance applications.

Commercial Scalability Advantages

The RapidSX™ technology's modular design architecture allows for rapid capacity expansion without proportional increases in capital expenditure. Initial operations targeting 2,000 tonnes per annum can scale systematically to 7,500 tonnes through additional processing modules, creating flexible response capabilities to market demand fluctuations.

This scalability approach contrasts sharply with conventional rare earth processing facilities, which typically require complete facility reconstruction to achieve meaningful capacity increases. Consequently, the modular framework enables Ucore to respond dynamically to market conditions while minimising stranded capital investment risks.

Technology Performance Specifications:

• Processing speed: 3-5 times faster than traditional solvent extraction

• Purity achievement: 99.9%+ for standard applications

• Enhanced purity: 99.95%+ for wind turbine systems

• Defence-grade purity: 99.99%+ for military applications

• Modular capacity scaling: 2,000 to 7,500 tonnes annually

• Environmental impact: Significantly reduced versus conventional processing

The molecular recognition approach represents a departure from decades of solvent extraction dominance in rare earth processing. While conventional methods rely on chemical separation through successive extraction stages, RapidSX™ utilises selective binding mechanisms to isolate specific rare earth elements more efficiently.

What Market Dynamics Are Driving Western Supply Chain Diversification?

Chinese Market Dominance and Strategic Vulnerabilities

Current global rare earth refining capacity remains heavily concentrated in Chinese facilities, controlling approximately 90% of worldwide processing operations. This concentration creates substantial supply security concerns for Western manufacturers, particularly in defence and clean energy applications where material reliability and consistent availability are paramount operational requirements.

The extent of Chinese refining dominance extends beyond simple market share statistics. Most Western rare earth mining operations export unprocessed concentrates to Chinese facilities for separation into individual oxides, creating dependency relationships that persist even when raw materials originate from Western sources.

Government Policy Alignment and Industrial Strategy

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance aligns strategically with multiple Western industrial policy initiatives designed to strengthen supply chain resilience and reduce critical materials dependencies. Moreover, this collaboration reflects broader industry innovation trends that emphasise technological advancement and supply chain localisation.

These policy frameworks provide both financial support and regulatory backing for domestic rare earth processing capabilities.

Key Policy Support Mechanisms:

• Defence Production Act Title III: Direct financial assistance for critical materials production

• Inflation Reduction Act: Tax incentives for domestic clean energy supply chains

• Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy: Supply chain resilience and processing capacity development

• European Raw Materials Act: Strategic autonomy objectives for critical materials

The convergence of these policy initiatives creates unprecedented support for Western rare earth processing ventures. Unlike previous market cycles driven primarily by price volatility, current diversification efforts receive sustained government backing across multiple jurisdictions.

Investment Wave and Competitive Response

Western rare earth processing initiatives have attracted substantial investment flows as governments and private investors recognise the strategic importance of supply chain diversification. Multiple projects across Australia, Europe, and North America are advancing simultaneously, creating a coordinated response to Chinese processing dominance.

This investment wave encompasses both traditional mining operations and advanced processing technologies. For instance, the focus has shifted from simply securing rare earth ore sources to developing complete processing capabilities that can deliver finished materials to end-users without Asian intermediaries.

Which Rare Earth Elements Will the Alliance Target?

Primary Focus on Permanent Magnet Elements

The Ucore-VAC collaboration prioritises six critical oxides essential for high-performance permanent magnet production. These elements form the foundation of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, which dominate applications in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defence systems.

Targeted Rare Earth Elements:

Neodymium oxide (Nd₂O₃) – Primary magnetic component providing fundamental magnetic strength

Praseodymium oxide (Pr₆O₁₁) – Magnetic strength enhancement and cost optimisation

Dysprosium oxide (Dy₂O₃) – High-temperature stability and coercivity improvement

Terbium oxide (Tb₄O₇) – Advanced coercivity enhancement for demanding applications

Samarium oxide (Sm₂O₃) – Specialised high-temperature magnet applications

Gadolinium oxide (Gd₂O₃) – Thermal management and specialised magnetic properties

Application-Specific Requirements

Different end-use applications demand varying purity specifications and elemental compositions. Electric vehicle motors typically require neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium at 99.9%+ purity levels, balancing performance requirements with cost considerations for mass-market manufacturing.

Wind turbine generators demand higher purity specifications of 99.95%+ for neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium. The enhanced purity requirements reflect the demanding operational environment and extended service life expectations of large-scale wind generation systems.

End-Use Sector Primary Elements Purity Requirements Application Context Electric Vehicles Nd, Pr, Dy 99.9%+ Mass-market motor production Wind Turbines Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb 99.95%+ Large-scale generation systems Defence Systems All six elements 99.99%+ Mission-critical applications Industrial Motors Nd, Pr, Sm 99.9%+ Commercial motor applications

Defence applications require the highest purity specifications of 99.99%+ across all six targeted elements. Military systems demand maximum reliability and consistent performance under extreme operational conditions, necessitating the most stringent material quality standards.

Magnet Performance Characteristics

Each targeted element contributes specific performance characteristics to finished permanent magnets. Neodymium and praseodymium provide fundamental magnetic strength through their electronic structure and magnetic moment properties. These light rare earth elements form the primary magnetic phase in NdFeB magnets.

Heavy rare earth elements, particularly dysprosium and terbium, enhance coercivity and high-temperature stability. While these elements are used in smaller quantities compared to neodymium and praseodymium, their impact on magnet performance is disproportionately significant for demanding applications.

What Are the Timeline and Production Milestones?

Phase-Based Development Strategy

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance operates under an aggressive development timeline designed to establish commercial production capabilities by late 2025. The phased approach allows for systematic capacity scaling while managing construction, commissioning, and operational risks.

Phase 1 (Late 2025): Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex commissioning targeting 2,000 tonnes per annum initial capacity. This phase focuses on demonstrating commercial-scale RapidSX™ technology performance and establishing initial oxide supply agreements with eVAC Magnetics.

Phase 2 (2026): Capacity expansion to 5,000+ tonnes annually with comprehensive commercial supply agreements. This phase emphasises production optimisation, quality consistency, and market penetration across automotive and renewable energy sectors.

Phase 3 (2027): Full-scale operations reaching 7,500 tonnes per annum with multiple product streams serving diverse end-market applications. This phase targets maximum facility utilisation and expanded customer base development.

Revenue Projections and Market Impact

At projected full-scale capacity levels and current rare earth oxide market pricing, the alliance could generate approximately $500 million in annual revenue by 2026. This revenue projection assumes successful commissioning, consistent production quality, and sustained market demand for Western-sourced materials.

The revenue potential reflects the premium pricing available for non-Chinese rare earth oxides, particularly for defence and critical infrastructure applications. Western buyers demonstrate willingness to pay premium pricing for supply security and regulatory compliance advantages.

Production Timeline Milestones:

• Late 2025: Initial Louisiana facility commissioning (2,000 tpa)

• Mid-2026: Commercial production ramp-up (5,000+ tpa)

• 2027: Full-scale operations (7,500 tpa maximum capacity)

• 2026 target: $500 million annual revenue potential

• 9-month MOU timeline: Definitive commercial agreement completion

Critical Timeline Dependencies

The aggressive timeline relies on successful completion of multiple parallel activities. Louisiana facility construction must proceed without significant delays, while Ontario facility commissioning provides backup production capabilities and technology validation.

Permitting approvals, environmental compliance, and workforce development represent potential timeline risks that could impact commissioning schedules. The compressed development timeline leaves limited buffer for addressing unexpected construction or regulatory challenges.

What Execution Risks Could Impact the Alliance's Success?

Technical and Operational Challenges

The partnership confronts substantial technical scaling risks as RapidSX™ technology transitions from demonstration scale to commercial production. While laboratory and pilot-scale results appear promising, large-scale processing operations often reveal unforeseen technical complexities that require extended optimisation periods.

• Complex feedstock quality management: Rare earth concentrates exhibit significant compositional variations

• Process optimisation requirements: Large-scale operations demand continuous technical refinement

• Equipment reliability concerns: New separation technology faces durability testing under commercial conditions

Financial and Timeline Pressures

Substantial remaining funding requirements create execution pressure for both partners. While government support provides significant backing, additional private investment is necessary to complete facility construction and support initial operating capital requirements.

The nine-month Memorandum of Understanding timeline creates compressed decision-making pressure for finalising binding commercial terms. This timeline requires simultaneous resolution of technical validation, financial arrangements, and legal documentation while managing ongoing construction activities.

Financial Risk Elements:

• Substantial remaining funding requirements for completion

• Aggressive commissioning schedules with limited buffer time

• Market price volatility exposure affecting project economics

• Working capital requirements for initial production ramp-up

Regulatory and Competitive Factors

Regulatory approval processes for rare earth processing facilities involve complex environmental permitting and safety certification requirements. Delays in regulatory approvals could impact commissioning timelines and increase project costs significantly.

Competitive pressure from established Chinese processors presents ongoing market challenges. Chinese facilities benefit from decades of operational optimisation, integrated supply chains, and lower labour costs that create persistent pricing pressure on Western processors.

Critical Risk Assessment: The combination of unproven commercial-scale technology, aggressive timelines, substantial funding requirements, and competitive market dynamics creates significant execution uncertainty for the alliance's success prospects.

How Does This Compare to Other Western Rare Earth Initiatives?

Competitive Landscape Analysis

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance operates within a broader competitive landscape encompassing multiple Western rare earth processing initiatives. However, this partnership benefits from the context established by the Australia critical minerals reserve strategy, which demonstrates international coordination in securing supply chains.

Do you want some great news? The chip shortage I wrote about on Friday may have a political solution, although I wouldn’t count my wafers until they’ve been fabricated. Also, Škoda is having a great year. That’s something to celebrate.

S&P Projects A Huge Share For ‘Electrified’ Cars

If I’m being 100% real, I did initially want to call this the “Decade of the EREV” given what’s coming from various automakers. America loves big trucks, and big trucks either require massive batteries or some other tradeoff in order to do big truck things. An obvious solution is to pair a generator engine with a battery pack that isn’t the equivalent of four Nissan Leafs.

I still think EREVs and, to a smaller extent, PHEVs will be a part of the picture. It’s just that full hybrids (FHEV) and mild hybrids (MHEV) solve so many problems at so low a relative cost that it seems like a no-brainer for almost every car out there. S&P Global Mobility is out with a fancy new chart showing the potential future mix, broken down by region:

S&P Global does great infographics.

As you can see, this is how much of the total share of various markets will be electrified in some sort of way. This ranges from 48v MHEVs all the way up to full BEVs. I can’t think of a single vehicle for sale that couldn’t be at least an MHEV, so it’s interesting to see that this isn’t the biggest area of projected growth. It’s hybrids.

There are a few reasons for this. Mostly, it’s just the cheapest way to solve the following problem: Electric cars are way more efficient than gasoline-powered cars, but gasoline has a way higher energy density than current batteries, which are not cheap.

My current CR-V Hybrid is floating around its 37 MPG combined average, and I never have to think about it. When it’s puttering around town, it’s mostly using stored energy. When I get going on the highway, it turns the motor on when necessary.

The other reason for hybrids coming in strong, as S&P Global Mobility notes, is that the regulatory environment in the United States is too unpredictable. We have a system wherein the Executive branch can dramatically change the universe in which carmakers exist. Flexibility is key, and while you can make a vehicle that can accept EV and ICE powertrains (this is what’s interesting about the BMW iX3), it does create some compromises:

Overall, manufacturers are shifting their focus toward flexible powertrain system strategies that can accommodate regulatory uncertainty and changing consumer preferences. The US market is likely to witness increased experimentation with transitional technologies such as REEVs and hybrids, as the industry navigates the complex interplay of incentives, policy, and consumer demand.

It’s all about flexibility going forward, although most companies will likely still create EV-only platforms to address the growing market for EVs. Looking ahead to 2030, if this projection is correct, then an increase in BEVs will be dwarfed by EREVs (they call them REEVs), MHEVs, PHEVs, and just plain old hybrids. That sounds right to me. [Ed Note: I think this study is underestimating EREVs/REEVs, but we’ll see. -DT].

October Sales Back Up The Trend

It was always clear that this month was going to see a massive reduction in EV sales as buyers stocked up on EVs while the $7,500 discount was still in play. So far, Hyundai, Kia, and Ford are out with October sales data, and this seems to support the “Decade of the Hybrid” thesis.

Let’s talk Hyundai, which saw its ongoing year-over-year sales streak finally come to an end as year-over-year sales dropped by a nominal 2%.

“Hybrid vehicles led the way in October with a 41% increase, and electrified sales were up 8%,” said Randy Parker, president and CEO, Hyundai Motor North America. “We saw strong EV demand leading up to the expiration of federal tax credits, and while that shift has temporarily disrupted the market, we’re confident it will reset. Hyundai’s momentum remains strong, and we’re on pace for record retail and total sales for the year. Solid fundamentals, smart inventory strategy, and an exceptional team and dealer network power us.”

I’m not a math genius, but if hybrid sales were up 41% and “electrified sales” were only up 8%, that means EV sales had to drop. Yup! The Ioniq 5 was down 63% year-over-year, and the Ioniq 6 dropped 52%. The cheap Venue was the biggest winner, up 49%, but the most important number for Hyundai was the 15% increase in Tucson sales.

Kia managed to keep its sales streak going by selling an extra 94 cars! That’s tight. The cheap Niro saw a huge 75% year-over-year increase, but the real winner in my heart is the now-hybrid Kia Carnival, up 35% over the same period. Ford’s total sales were up by about 2% in October, with electric vehicles down 25% and hybrids down 4%.

What’s up with hybrids? Ford is winding down sales of the Escape, which had a hybrid model, and hasn’t yet replaced it with a Bronco Sport Hybrid. Maverick sales were still up year-over-year, though I’m not sure of the breakdown of hybrids v. ICE for that or the F-150.

The Chip Shortage That Maybe Just Went Away

Full disclosure time: Our co-founder, Beau, has a few other businesses in addition to being a part of this one. Remarkably, there has been little to no editorial pressure or conflict of interest. There was some over the weekend, and I just feel the need to call it out when it happens, for the sake of journalist integrity. On Friday, I wrote about the Nexperia chip shortage that threatened to derail the auto industry. I made a joke about the film Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo, noting that the film “was neither very good nor popular.”

Beau let me know via a stern text that not only did he think the film wasn’t so bad, but that he actually saw it in the theater. The only time I’d seen the film was projected on the wall of a house party in college, and was therefore not fully paying attention.

Taking any critique of my work seriously, I watched more of the film this weekend and looked up contemporaneous reviews. Roger Ebert actually gave it three stars, and made it clear he liked it better than Annie, which he didn’t like:

Remember all the self-importance of “Annie“? That’s why a modest, cheerful little movie like “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo” is so refreshing. Here is a movie that wants nothing more than to allow some high-spirited kids to sing and dance their way through a silly plot just long enough to make us grin.

Perhaps I was being too glib. I regret the error, but I also want you to know that we take editorial independence seriously here and that the Morning Dump will not be caving to pressure (from a certain North Carolinian taillight enthusiast) regarding my belief that “Son in Law” is the best Pauly Shore movie.

Oh, right, chips. Yeah, that whole thing with the politically-charged chip shortages seems to have resolved itself, according to this Bloomberg report:

Following the trade truce agreed by presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at their summit last week, the US said on Saturday that Beijing will take steps to allow the Chinese facilities of Nexperia to resume shipments. This move, which confirms an earlier Bloomberg report, will likely ease worries about chip shipments that had threatened auto production as a trade fight between China and the US escalated.

The Dutch and Chinese arms of the same company are still beefing, but it sounds like they’ll keep doing their respective jobs and not disrupt a whole industry while they work out their issues.

Škoda Stays Singularly Superlative

My favorite modern Czech automaker (suck it Kaipan!) is the one arm of Volkswagen that doesn’t seem to be sweating it all that much. It doesn’t sell cars in North America, it never earned a huge stake in China that it’s suddenly losing, and it makes the kind of nice and cheap cars that consumers want.

According to a company sales release, through Q3 the company’s sales are up 14.1% year-over-year, and its balanced portfolio of ICE, EV, and hybrid vehicles is leading the company to big sales in Europe. Only Cupra is doing better, but that’s a relatively new automaker with less than half the volume.

It’s also expanding in markets like Vietnam and India, which are so far not as impacted by the global trade war:

Klaus Zellmer, CEO of Škoda Auto, commented: “Škoda’s strong nine-month results prove that our strategy is working: We are growing profitably, electrifying faster, and expanding globally. Holding firm as Europe’s No. 3 car brand while doubling deliveries in India shows the power of our team, our partners, and our customer’s trust. We’re driving forward with confidence, efficiency, and the courage to shape the future of mobility.”

Superb!

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

My wife put on “November Rain” by Guns N’Roses to celebrate the dawning of a new month, and I remembered that she wasn’t an MTV kid and had therefore not seen the extravagant video. If there’s a better way to start this month than Stephanie Seymour taking a luxurious pull of a cigarette, I’d like to know it.

Even if a Republican-led Congress passed a measure to reclaim power over tariffs, Trump would have the power to veto it and keep that control for the executive branch.","The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Wednesday over whether a law allows President Donald Trump to implement a worldwide tariff regime, in a case experts and lawmakers said ultimately could undermine Congress’ foundational power over taxation.

The Trump administration is set to urge the justices to find that those tariffs are within the powers that Congress gave to the presidency in an emergency economic powers law in 1977, with huge issues in the balance, including billions of dollars in federal tariff revenue and trillions of dollars in international trade.

The legal questions hinge on the wording in the law around regulating trade and declaring emergencies, how specific Congress must be when delegating large powers to the executive branch and whether Congress can turn over its constitutionally assigned role to establish tariffs.

But a larger question lurks over eroding the congressional power over the purse, at a time when Trump has pushed the boundaries of long-standing ideas on what presidents have the authority to do.

A decision in favor of the Trump administration would undermine the constitutional order on how federal funds are collected and spent, said Josh Chafetz, a Georgetown Law professor who specializes in the powers of Congress.

“It’s going to be a huge blow to Congress if Trump essentially can try to raise as much money as he wants by levying tariffs. That is creating a huge slush fund,” Chafetz said. “That is so deeply antithetical to the text of the Constitution and the struggle that birthed it.”

Chafetz said actions by the Trump administration to freeze funds, spend funds during the shutdown and raise revenue through tariffs are undermining the “three pillars” of Congress’ main power over federal spending.

“This administration has been not just chipping away but taking a sledgehammer to some of Congress’ core powers,” Chafetz said.

At the same time, a decision against the Trump administration would put pressure back on the Republican-controlled Congress to pass laws addressing a signature piece of Trump’s domestic and foreign policy, said Molly Reynolds, the interim vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.

The country has experienced “several decades of increasing presidential power in lots of ways at the expense of congressional power,” with numerous decisions by members of Congress and the Supreme Court that effectively granted more power to the presidency, Reynolds said.

“I think it would sort of put the ball back in Congress’ court. Congress would have to decide if it wants to legislate and decide whether it wants to codify what Trump has asked for,” Reynolds said.

Legal case

This year Trump declared a swath of national emergencies under the National Emergencies Act, including problems tied to fentanyl smuggling, trade imbalances and the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in his home country.

The administration then used those declarations to justify tariffs under a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. That includes specific tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, the worldwide “Liberation Day” tariffs and others against countries such as Brazil.

The Trump administration has argued that Congress in IEEPA gave the president broad power to “regulate” trade in an emergency, which could include embargoing trade with another country entirely. Tariffs, the administration argued, are less extreme than that.

Earlier this year, the Court of International Trade and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit both found that the tariff regime violated federal law. They agreed with the challenges from the businesses and states that the law at issue did not mention tariffs or give specific rules for how they could be put in place.

Michael McConnell, a retired judge from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit who represents one of the challengers to Trump’s tariffs, told reporters last week that allowing a president to impose tariffs without congressional approval would make it “very tempting” for an executive to end-run the legislative process to raise revenue.

“He has no power to authorize tariffs on American citizens without the authorization of Congress,” McConnell said.

In one bipartisan brief at the Supreme Court, more than 200 House and Senate members, including Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, argued that Trump’s tariffs “usurped” congressional authority over tariffs and taxes.

“The Administration’s interpretation of IEEPA would effectively nullify the guardrails set forth in every statute in which Congress expressly granted the President limited tariff authority — a result Congress did not intend,” the brief said.

“IEEPA does not grant the President the power to impose tariffs on American citizens importing goods to generate leverage in trade talks,” the brief said.

The brief argued that Congress has been specific in the past when it gave the president the power to collect tariffs and mostly limited those powers to tariffs on a single product or country.

A few Republicans have expressed misgivings about the tariffs and emergency powers and voted to overturn them.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who has criticized some of the Trump tariff decisions and voted to overturn the emergency declaration for Brazil last week, said he’s concerned about what the case could mean for the power of Congress.

“I worry less about what President Trump is doing now and more about what President Harris would do with that same sort of authority,” Tillis said, referring to Trump’s 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.

Congressional action

A Supreme Court decision to uphold Trump’s tariffs could make it even harder for Congress to potentially undo those tariffs and other presidential actions, experts said.

They noted that the Supreme Court already defanged a major congressional tool to rein in the president’s emergency powers directly in a 1983 decision in an immigration case known as INS v. Chadha. The court invalidated the so-called legislative veto, which experts said extended to the same framework under the National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to underpin the tariffs.

Congress passed the National Emergencies Act, along with IEEPA and other post-Watergate reforms, as a means of clearly defining the president’s emergency powers, Michael Thorning, associate director of governance at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said.

That 1983 decision leaves the legislative veto “essentially inoperative at the moment, until Congress acts to change it,” Thorning said.

“The authority granted to the president has not changed in scope or magnitude, but Congress’ ability to undo actions taken by the White House has changed,” Thorning said. “Congress is at a bit of a disadvantage because it essentially created an escape hatch for itself where it could vote to overturn an emergency and now can’t anymore.”

That means that instead of Congress being able to override emergency declarations on its own, they have to face a presidential veto, experts said.

That played out in the first Trump administration, when both chambers of Congress voted to override a national emergency declaration at the U.S. border with Mexico in 2019, only for Trump to veto the provision.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a lead sponsor of Senate efforts to overturn the national emergency declarations in the current Congress, said he would continue to push for votes to override them, even if the Supreme Court determines that the tariffs are legal.

“If the court were to uphold that, they would sort of be solving that legal challenge, but again, from a policy matter, we still need to challenge emergencies that are bogus,” Kaine said.

Reynolds said a decision in favor of the Trump administration would also undermine the political case to overturn the emergency declarations.

“I expect that many Republicans in particular would point to that and say, ‘Look, the Supreme Court has said it is OK, and we are just going to go along with it,’” Reynolds said.

Tillis also said that a decision in favor of the Trump administration would “pretty much end the discussion” around overturning the emergency declarations underpinning the tariffs. It also wouldn’t bode well for broader legislation regarding the president’s emergency powers.

Even if a Republican-led Congress passed a measure to reclaim power over tariffs, Trump would have the power to veto it and keep that control for the executive branch.

“You’d have to take veto-proof congressional action to fix it if you wanted to claw back power. And that never happens,” Tillis said. “It hasn’t happened for the 80 years that we’ve conveyed too much power to the Article II branch, because we always make the mistake of living in the moment and not thinking about the long-term consequences.”

Stellantis, the Euro-American auto conglomerate behind Jeep, RAM, Dodge, and Chrysler, is injecting $13 billion into what amounts to a corporate rescue mission. Despite generating more than half of its total profits from the U.S., the company’s American operations have turned into a financial sinkhole. Formed in 2021 through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France’s PSA Group, Stellantis enjoyed a golden start. Each year brought record earnings, fat margins, and massive dividends for investors. Yet beneath the glossy financials, its U.S. brands were quietly bleeding market share. Consumers, once fiercely loyal to names like Jeep and Dodge, began shifting to electric rivals or newer, more refined gas-powered competitors. The $13 billion plan, confirmed by CEO Carlos Tavares in recent investor briefings, aims to overhaul everything from product design to factory operations. Stellantis will revamp aging lineups, expand electric vehicle production, and modernize its U.S. manufacturing plants to stay competitive with Ford, GM, and Tesla.

Jeep and RAM: The Once-Mighty Now Stumbling

Jeep, once the company’s global profit engine, has lost ground in the SUV race. The Wrangler and Grand Cherokee still sell, but volumes have slipped as Toyota, Hyundai, and Rivian lure buyers with fresher designs and better tech. RAM, meanwhile, has been outgunned by Ford’s F-150 and GM’s Silverado in both sales and innovation. In 2024, Stellantis announced layoffs at several U.S. plants amid slumping demand and rising labor costs tied to the United Auto Workers’ new contract. Analysts estimate that profit margins in North America, once among the best in the business, have fallen by more than 30 percent in the past two years. Tavares has been blunt about the stakes. “We are losing share in our most profitable market. That cannot continue,” he told investors earlier this year.

Betting Big on EVs but Playing Catch-Up

A large chunk of the $13 billion will go toward electrification. Stellantis plans to launch more than 25 new electric models in North America by 2030, including an all-electric Dodge Charger and a RAM 1500 REV pickup designed to compete with the Ford F-150 Lightning and Tesla Cybertruck. The company is also investing heavily in battery plants, including a $3.2 billion facility in Kokomo, Indiana, and a joint venture with Samsung SDI to secure supply chains. But Stellantis faces a steep uphill climb: its EV offerings remain limited in the U.S., where consumers are increasingly expecting long-range, high-tech electric vehicles backed by strong charging networks.

The Chrysler Question

Then there’s Chrysler, the brand that’s become an industry punchline. Once a cornerstone of American automotive identity, Chrysler now has just two models on sale: the Pacifica minivan and the aging 300 sedan. As part of its turnaround plan, Stellantis says it will reinvent Chrysler as a “tech-forward electric brand,” with the first new EV slated for 2026. Whether the nameplate can be revived remains an open question.

Tavares’s Tightrope

Carlos Tavares is known for slashing costs and squeezing efficiency out of struggling automakers. But the U.S. comeback requires more than trimming fat; it demands rebuilding trust with customers and dealers, and taking creative risks in a fiercely competitive market. He faces a delicate balance: satisfying European regulators pushing for rapid electrification while keeping American truck and SUV buyers happy. And with UAW labor costs climbing and consumer demand shifting unpredictably, Stellantis’s U.S. recovery could determine whether the company thrives or unravels over the next decade.

The Road Ahead

For Stellantis, this $13 billion gamble is a make-or-break moment. The company cannot afford another year of shrinking U.S. sales while rivals roll out stronger electric portfolios. The challenge now is proving it can evolve fast enough to win back drivers who have already moved on. If the bet pays off, Stellantis could once again become a dominant force in the American auto market. If not, the company’s most lucrative region could become its greatest liability.",https://sfl.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/auto-draft-screenshot-2025-11-03-at-10.40.55-am.png,N,,2025-11-03 13:13:49.191972

By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it.","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk.

“I feel like I’m living in scary times. It’s not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn’t too much you can do,” said Chapman, 74.

Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes.

With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week.

The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.

“The impact, even if it’s temporary, on many of the nation’s poor families is going to be profound if we don’t solve this problem,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state directors of the program. Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes.

“These are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,” Wolfe said. “And I can’t point to a similar time in recent history where we’ve had this.”

States are warning applicants about a funding delay

LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades.

States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data.

While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet.

Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown.

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary.

Minnesota’s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state’s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients’ heating bills until the shutdown ends.

“As temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,” the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities.

Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves.

“The situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,” said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, blamed the federal shutdown and the delay in LIHEAP payments on congressional Democrats and said the Trump administration is committed to reopening the government.

“Once the government reopens, ACF will work swiftly to administer annual awards,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within HHS. The spokesperson did not directly answer whether the timing could be affected by the administration’s earlier decision to fire workers who run the LIHEAP program.

Wolfe, from the group that represents state program directors, predicts there could be delays into January. He noted there are questions over who will approve states’ program plans and how the money will be released when it becomes available.

“Once you’ve fired the staff, things just slow down,” he said.

Low-income families face mounting obstacles

Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections.

Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast.

“If you’re a heating oil dealer, we can’t tell that dealer, ‘Look, continue to provide heating oil to your low-income customers on the possibility you’ll get your money back,’” Wolfe said.

Mark Bain, 67, who lives in Bloomfield, Connecticut, with his son, a student at the University of Connecticut, started receiving financial assistance for his home heating oil needs three years ago.

“I remember the first winter before I knew about this program. I was desperate. I was on fumes,” said Bains, who is retired and relies on income from Social Security and a small annuity. “I was calling around to my social services people to find out what I could do.”

He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter.

Bains said he can “get by” if he does not receive the help this year.

“I would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,” he said.

E2, a nationwide collection of businesses and investors advocating for policies benefitting the economy and environment, welcomed the “major milestone in clean energy”.
E2 recently published a report which highlighted Illinois’ position as a clean energy leader among states in the US Midwest.
“In light of federal rollbacks of clean energy tax credits and environmental protections, it is more important than ever that Illinois remains steadfast in its commitment to creating a clean energy economy,” E2 state advocacy director Micaela Preskill said.","Alongside this are measures to solidify funding for solar PV and wind, give utilities and state agencies new energy planning tools, expand energy efficiency programmes and introduce new programmes and incentives for consumer-sided distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar and home battery storage.

Pritzker publicly backed the bill previously and last week after its passing that Illinois is responding to rate hikes from utility companies and actions from the Trump Administration that the governor said are “blocking the ability to bring lower-cost energy options online.”

A frequent media sparring partner for the US president, Pritzker said the passing of the CRGA is “an important step that will help lower utility bills and make our electrical grid stronger.”

“This legislation takes two routes toward affordability,” Pritzker said.

“First, it will accelerate clean energy projects with new grid-scale batteries and other clean energy technology to increase the available electricity supply. Second, it will require utility companies to help their consumers to lower their utility bills and access energy-efficient resources. This bill will build upon the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, positioning Illinois to keep growing our clean energy economy and creating good-paying jobs in communities across the state.”

The bill’s passing is the result of ongoing efforts by Illinois politicians to introduce a coherent energy storage strategy that includes a target. One bill, House Bill 3758 (HB3758), would have set a 15GW target and was first read into the record in March.

‘Solid foundation to address rising electricity demand and power price volatility’

Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) CEO Abigail Ross Hopper​ said the Act “is a blueprint for how to meet growing electricity demand while keeping costs down and building a stronger, more resilient grid.”

“By investing in solar, storage, and a forward-looking virtual power plant programme, this bill will create good jobs and empower Illinois families and businesses,” Ross Hopper, who recently announced she is stepping down from leading SEIA after almost nine years, said.

E2, a nationwide collection of businesses and investors advocating for policies benefitting the economy and environment, welcomed the “major milestone in clean energy”. E2 recently published a report which highlighted Illinois’ position as a clean energy leader among states in the US Midwest.

“In light of federal rollbacks of clean energy tax credits and environmental protections, it is more important than ever that Illinois remains steadfast in its commitment to creating a clean energy economy,” E2 state advocacy director Micaela Preskill said.

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) noted that the legislation comes amid not just Trump’s attacks on clean energy but also spikes in electricity bills that are caused in part by increased demand from data centres.

A UCS factsheet about the CRGA published earlier in the year pointed out that a supply crunch and unprecedented increase in electricity demand from data centres was leading to jumps in electricity costs for customers of Ameren and ComEdison, two of the state’s main utilities.

UCS applauded the passing of earlier climate legislation—the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA)—that put in place a 2050 net zero target for Illinois, but said obstacles such as the lengthy wait for interconnection in the PJM regional transmission organisation (RTO) were holding back its implementation, arguing that CRGA builds upon the CEJA’s goals and sets out a path toward achieving them.

“The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power,” Midwest policy director at the UCS Climate and Energy Program, James Gignac, said.

“Lawmakers have built a solid foundation to address rising electricity demand and power price volatility fostered by data centres. Today, policymakers chose to make smart, responsible investments and safeguard a clean energy future while protecting Illinoisans from prospective cost spikes, and that’s something to celebrate.”

‘Big Tech, data centres must join the solution’

Other groups applauding the state legislature’s actions and endorsing the bill included the Illinois Citizens Utility Board (CUB), the Clean Grid Alliance and the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition.

CUB executive director Sarah Moskowitz said escalating energy bills in Illinois “require solutions at the state, regional, and federal levels, so passing the CRGA Act is a significant and urgently needed step to protect consumers from future electricity market volatility.”

Jeff Danielson, VP of advocacy at the Clean Grid Alliance said the bill invests “in proven solutions that promote the stability and reliability of our grid while also lowering costs for homeowners and businesses.”

Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition was filled with similar praise, but added that the victory the bill’s passing represents “must be followed by legislative action in the spring 2026 session to ensure that Big Tech and data centres, the primary driver of rising utility bills, joins the solution instead of continuing to be the problem.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JB-Pritzker_wikimedia-gage-skidmore.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:12.073902

Energy Leadership from Our Hosts, The State of Massachusetts

On October 8, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey joined Energy Policy Institute participants to share her insights on the path being charted in Massachusetts to ensure reliable and affordable energy. Governor Healey emphasized her all-of-the-above strategy to bring more energy into Massachusetts and meet rising demand. Following Governor Healey’s remarks, attendees heard from Massachusetts Secretary of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper. Secretary Tepper elaborated further on the strategies that Massachusetts is employing to make energy more affordable to consumers and increase energy production.

Highlights From the Energy Policy Institute

Keynote Remarks by FERC Commissioner Judy W. Chang

The program launched with expert remarks from Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner (FERC) Judy W. Chang. Commissioner Chang emphasized the importance of clear, informed state engagement in shaping energy markets and transmission policy. The Commissioner also shared her appreciation for state perspectives, noting that the more context FERC has about state interests and motivations, the better positioned the commission is to weigh them alongside legal precedent and broader regulatory considerations. Her remarks demonstrated a collaborative perspective on how federal and state entities can work together in energy governance.

State of the Market: 2025 Energy Trends

The U.S. is facing its highest power demand growth since the 1940s-1950s, driven in part by a large surge in data center development. To set the stage on how the U.S. is approaching this demand growth, Kate Hardin, Executive Director of Energy, Resources, and Industrials Research at Deloitte, gave a presentation on the major energy, economic, market and technology trends. One trend includes the increase in data center driven natural gas demand through 2030 which could range from 3 to 12 billion cubic feet per day, driven by a growing number of planned gas power plants. Nuclear energy is also re-emerging as a longer-term solution and could address at least 10% of the increased electricity demand being seen.

A convergence of energy demand, fuels, and technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) for energy, grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), and automation are reshaping the power sector. The uncertainty in projected load growth, due to cloud and AI demand, is raising risks and costs, making demand management and load flexibility important to future planning.

Energy as an Economic Driver for AI, Manufacturing, and More

As artificial intelligence (AI), advanced manufacturing and data-driven technologies surge, so does the demand for reliable, scalable energy infrastructure. This panel of experts, which included both state and industry perspectives, dove into how states and territories can position energy as a driver for economic development, meeting the rising load from data centers and AI while fostering industrial growth. Attendees heard from Mark Silberg, Energy Policy Advisor with the Office of Colorado Governor Jared Polis; Mike Fradette, Principle of Energy Strategy at Amazon Web Services; and Jennie Nevin, Associate Partner of Public Sector, Energy, and Infrastructure Practices at McKinsey. The speakers underscored the importance of treating energy as a central pillar of economic competitiveness in an AI-driven future. Governors can foster early coordination between energy planning and economic development to inform investments and ensure economies maintain robust growth while mitigating impacts to grid reliability and rates.

Nuclear Energy: State Actions and Initiatives

As states explore how to meet significant load growth, new nuclear energy is emerging as a potential solution. This year, NGA hosted a slate of nuclear in-state retreats for seven state teams aimed to advance Governors’ nuclear energy policy. Attendees heard from Kurt Schaefer, Director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources; Jon Ford, Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Energy Development; Stephen Swiber, Deputy Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources; and Jeff Semancik, Division Director of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, on behalf of the New England cohort team. The four speakers shared the outcomes of their retreats, lessons learned, and where their state is headed now regarding nuclear energy. Each state has a different focus for their project with NGA, including how to align the economic development and energy sector to advance nuclear projects, how to incentivize financing of large nuclear projects, how to communicate the advantages of nuclear and what the role is for state government in bolstering the nuclear energy sector. This session provided insight to attendees on how other states are exploring and talking about the use of new nuclear energy.

State Energy Security Briefing

As threats to the security of the energy system are multiplying and growing more sophisticated, Governors and their staff play a critical role in securing the system through both their own actions and through partnerships with private sector operators. To highlight the emerging energy security threats to systems, Brian Harrell, VP and Chief Security Officer of Avangrid, and Kimberly Denbow, Vice President of Security and Operations at the American Gas Association (AGA) provided an unclassified threat briefing to attendees. This briefing included detailed discussions of cyber and physical incidents that are impacting the energy sector.

State Leadership to Meet Emerging Energy Security Threats

Building off the energy security threat briefing, Paul Holloway, Senior Energy Security and Resilience Lead at the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, and Travis Kellerman, Senior Climate Policy Advisor with the Office of New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, explored state policies and actions to address two emerging threats: cybersecurity and wildfires.

Holloway emphasized that as the grid becomes more automated and interconnected, it also becomes more vulnerable cyberattacks – particularly targeting generation, transmission, and distribution assets. Massachusetts has developed a robust cybersecurity resilience network, including regular coordination with the public utilities commission (PUC), industry partners and the state’s fusion center for secure information sharing. Holloway also emphasized the lessons learned from exercises like GridEx-VIII and the development of the State Energy Security Plan (SESP), which highlighted the importance of knowing who to contact and how to respond in a crisis.

Kellerman highlighted how New Mexico views wildfires as a systemic energy risk and is taking proactive steps through legislation like the Wildfire Prepared Act. This legislation includes funding for home hardening, protecting critical infrastructure and collaborating with tribal nations using traditional ecological knowledge. He stressed the importance of prevention over response, noting innovative mitigation strategies like cloud seeding and maintaining irrigation networks. A key message was shared that investment in wildfire mitigation not only reduces systemic risk but also creates long-term economic and social benefits.

Meeting Growth Through Demand-Side and Behind-the-Meter Resources

Demand-side and behind-the-meter resources are increasingly becoming strategic assets within modern energy systems. To discuss this development, attendees heard from a panel of experts including Jenifer French, Chair of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission; Rachel Wilson, Southeast Energy Market Lead at Google; Michael Wheeler, Vice President of Government Affairs and Intersect Power; and Jeannie Salo, Chief Public Policy Officer at Schneider Electric.

As electricity load increases, states are looking for near-term solutions to meet this growth while they continue exploring more systematic investments in generation and transmission. These speakers discussed two potential near-term solutions for data centers and manufacturers: demand response to enable peak shaving and power generation co-located with new large loads. While automation and smart infrastructure can enable flexible load and resilience, scaling these capabilities will require significant policy support and investment. The speakers discussed examples of public-private collaboration to meet the dual challenge of rising electricity demand and the race for AI-driven infrastructure.

Investments in Energy Infrastructure in a Dynamic Power Market

As the energy landscape continues to evolve, state leaders are facing mounting pressure to ensure reliable and affordable power. Rapid shifts in technology, regulatory frameworks, market structures and consumer demand are fundamentally reshaping the economics of electricity generation. To contextualize how states and territories can enable strategic investments, participants heard from Dan Pugliese, Investment Director at Meridiam, and Will Sauer, Vice President of Federal Regulatory Affairs at Exelon.

Dan Pugliese highlighted Meridiam’s global investment approach – building, owning and operating infrastructure – with a focus on community benefit and long-term value. Will Sauer, representing the largest utility in the U.S. by customer count, emphasized the critical need of regulatory frameworks that ensure both supply reliability and cost effectiveness. Both speakers stressed that even in the absence of recent load growth, significant infrastructure gaps exist. Current conditions have created opportunities for private-public partnerships, and clear, consistent state policies, supportive legislation for P3s and internal advocates within government to champion major projects are crucial.

Regional Gubernatorial Collaboration for Energy Planning

In a session on regional gubernatorial collaboration for energy planning, state leaders from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Virginia emphasized the growing importance of cross-state collaboration to address regional energy challenges and transmission needs. Weezie Naura, Deputy Secretary for Federal and Regional Energy Affairs at the MA Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, and Daniel Phelan, Regional Policy Director at the New Hampshire Department of Energy, discussed the partnership convened through the New England States Committee on Electricity (NESCOE).

Through NESCOE, the states have achieved significant progress, such as a multi-state request for proposals to unlock 1,200 MW of onshore wind in northern Maine. Jacob Finkel, Deputy Secretary of Policy with the Office of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Glenn Davis, Director of the Virginia Department of Energy, shared their experiences as states within the PJM Interconnection (PJM) region. They emphasized the point that Governors’ office engagement is crucial to improving PJM processes and structures, citing outdated governance structures as a challenge. A key takeaway from this session was that sustained regional collaboration, even when state policies do not necessarily align, is crucial to addressing shared energy needs.

Ford Motor , Kia and Hyundai Motor reported massive declines in EV sales as many buyers pulled ahead purchases before the credits ended under changes by the Trump administration.

Ford, which ranked third in U.S. EV sales through the third quarter, reported a 25% drop in its year-over-year all-electric October sales. That included a 12% decline for its Mustang Mach-E crossover and a 17% fall for the F-150 Lightning.

Kia and Hyundai reported their top EV models dropped between 52% and 71% from a year earlier. The declines are notably greater when looking month to month, as September marked the end of a record quarter for EV sales in the U.S. ahead of the credits ending.

Some models, such as Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EVs, fell by 80% and 71% from September to October, respectively, according to its reported sales. It was a similar story for comparable vehicles at Kia, which is owned by Hyundai Motor but largely operates separately in the U.S.

""We saw strong EV demand leading up to the expiration of federal tax credits, and while that shift has temporarily disrupted the market, we're confident it will reset,"" Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker said in a release.

Meanwhile, sales of hybrid vehicles for carmakers are expected to continue to rise. Sales of such models for each of the automakers were bright spots in October, the companies said.

Only a limited number of automakers report monthly sales, rather than quarterly, but the results are an early indication of the expected fall in EV sales following the end of the federal incentives.

""With the credit now off the table, the market appears to be settling into a more natural rhythm,"" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for CarMax's Edmunds, said in a Monday blog. ""October marks the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.""

Ahead of the EV incentives ending, several automotive executives such as Parker and Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted a massive drop off in EV sales.

Farley late last month said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 5% after the end of the incentives from a level of 10% to 12% in September.

“Completing the pipeline installation is a major step forward in delivering safe, reliable drinking water to Dimock residents,” said Tony Nokovich, vice president of engineering at Pennsylvania American Water. “With this phase complete, we’re now ready to begin construction of the advanced treatment facility.”

Installation of new water service lines to connect homes to the newly installed pipeline is planned for spring 2026, with customer connections anticipated in the summer. As part of this process, all existing plumbing will be disconnected from individual wells to prevent cross-contamination.

Construction of a new groundwater treatment facility is scheduled to begin this week. The facility will feature a robust four-stage treatment process, resulting in finished water that meets U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection safe drinking water standards. The treatment facility is expected to be operational by summer 2026, with all construction activities anticipated to be completed by fall.

This project stems from a 2022 agreement negotiated between the Office of then-Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Coterra Energy, through which Pennsylvania American Water was selected to design, permit and construct a new public water system for Dimock. The system is designed to provide residents with reliable, clean and safe drinking water, who have long relied on private wells.

Importantly, the cost of the new water system is being fully underwritten by Coterra Energy, which helps provide a sustainable solution to the area's long-standing water quality concerns while ensuring that financial responsibility does not fall on the affected community or existing Pennsylvania American Water customers.

Despite these rollbacks, the report suggests that local leadership, combined with the prospect of renewed federal engagement after 2028 – i.e.
once Trump leaves office – can keep the US on track to slash emissions by the mid part of the next decade.
The coalition’s call comes days before COP30 gets underway in Brazil, to which America Is All In is sending representatives.
Last week, the Trump administration confirmed that it will not send any high-level government officials to the Belém gathering.","Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back the sustainability agenda in the United States, states and local governments can still play a key role in enabling the US to meet its climate targets, a new study by America Is All In has suggested.

According to the study, Pathways to 2035: Expanding Non-Federal Climate Leadership in the United States, which was conducted alongside the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, non-federal efforts could lead to a 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, compared to 2005 levels, if ambitious measures are pursued at state and local level.

‘Continuing to push forward’

“If our current federal government refuses to track and submit US progress toward meeting our climate goals, America Is All In will,” commented Gina McCarthy, America Is All In managing co-chair, and a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

“Governors, mayors, the private sector, and more continue to push forward, driving our transition to clean energy. There are so many opportunities at the state and local levels to grow jobs and protect our health and well-being, and we’re going to deliver this brighter future for our kids.”

Recent changes to federal legislation, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, have reduced clean energy investment and production capacity in the US, as well as repealing regulations linked to transport and energy emissions.

Despite these rollbacks, the report suggests that local leadership, combined with the prospect of renewed federal engagement after 2028 – i.e. once Trump leaves office – can keep the US on track to slash emissions by the mid part of the next decade.

“As international partners look to US cities, states, and businesses to fill the gap created by current US federal policy rollbacks, this study underscores the importance of non-federal actions in driving US climate ambition in the near term,” added Nate Hultman, director at the Center for Global Sustainability. “A critical component of this report is the need to identify and implement opportunities to raise climate ambition within jurisdictions that currently have moderate or low ambition in order to have the greatest impact on overall US emissions reductions.

“Our findings show that innovative local policies and market-driven clean technology investments can keep the US on a path toward significant emissions reductions, even in challenging times.”

America Is All In is a coalition of US cities, states, businesses, and institutions committed to advancing a clean energy economy and maintaining US engagement with Paris Agreement objectives through coordinated, non-federal climate action.

The coalition’s call comes days before COP30 gets underway in Brazil, to which America Is All In is sending representatives. Last week, the Trump administration confirmed that it will not send any high-level government officials to the Belém gathering.

From the US Conference of Catholic Bishops:

As world leaders head to COP30 [in Brazil] to advance climate action, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to effectively end its ability to track US climate warming emissions, data needed to reduce climate impacts, meet our international climate commitments and protect children’s health and futures.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), established in 2009, requires industries to report large GHG emissions sources such as oil and gas facilities. The EPA proposal would remove reporting obligations on most sources or suspend them until 2034. This, combined with the EPA’s proposed rollback of the “endangerment finding” that gives EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases, will make it difficult for the US to reduce GHG emissions and climate impacts.

Extreme weather disasters, exacerbated by climate change, fall hardest on the poor and communities on the margins in the United States and around the world with the least resources to respond. As Pope Leo XIV said, “When the Earth suffers, the poor suffer even more.”

The GHGRP data helps local governments, companies, and communities to keep track of emissions, promote accountability, and create innovative and resilient solutions to sustain life on our common home.

Pope Leo said at the October Raising Hope global gathering, “Everyone in society must put pressure on governments to develop and implement more rigorous regulations, procedures and controls. Citizens need to take an active role in political decision-making at national, regional and local levels. Only then will it be possible to mitigate the damage done to the environment.”

To respond to this threat, the USCCB provides this action alert, which requests Congress to “withdraw Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0186.”

“Our first priority is funding research by early-stage companies who are ready for professional funding,” says Stephen Loy, FUEL’s director of technology commercialization.
“There are also two energy companies I’m looking at investing in,” Ellison says.
“We work together to make these companies succeed.” Most of the successful energy industry startups in Louisiana have gone through similar accelerator programs, where they’re often connected with mentors and investors.
Increasingly, they’re approached by energy companies needing solutions to specific problems.","Academics and private industry invest millions of dollars each year in energy research, but only a handful of ideas advance from theory to application.

Nevertheless, investors say there’s usually a secret sauce behind those who do succeed.

Bill Ellison, CEO of Baton Rouge-based Innovation Catalyst Inc., a nonprofit venture development organization, says marketable research often provides a scalable and affordable solution to an industry-wide “real world” problem.

“The innovation originates from someone who is an expert, has the necessary domain expertise and is able to pair their solution with a really big problem,” he says. “Better yet, it solves a problem for a huge market, and they already have a potential customer.”

Ellison accelerates the growth of early-stage businesses into venture-ready companies by providing capital, connections and coaching. In recent months, he has collaborated frequently with researchers funded by grants through the FUEL, or Future Use of Energy in Louisiana, initiative.

Supported by a National Science Foundation grant, FUEL is a partnership between LSU and more than 50 universities, technical colleges, state agencies and private industry partners.

FUEL and other accelerator programs serve a critical role, as they connect fledgling startups with mentors and investors.

“Our first priority is funding research by early-stage companies who are ready for professional funding,” says Stephen Loy, FUEL’s director of technology commercialization. “They’re at a point where they need a little bit more ‘oomph’ to get over that hump so that they can create a proof-of-concept and bring this to professional funders.”

FUEL funded five companies in its first year, with another five expected this fall.

Initially, we issued a call for applications and received about 80,” Loy says. “That blew me away. Until then, we weren’t sure of the landscape for startups and energy.”

In his role, Loy works with the selected companies to ensure they’re getting the resources they need and that they’re in a position to receive investor funding. Many times, the passion and enthusiasm of the researcher are significant factors in determining whether Ellison chooses to invest.

“You want to invest in the jockey, not the horse,” he says. “It starts with the team. If you don’t have someone who you think is going to be a rock star, who has integrity and is going to work hard, pretty much the evaluation stops there.”

Ellison is the sole investor in Codegig, one of the initial FUEL grant recipients. Codegig designs and deploys computer systems to help clients optimize workflow and make better decisions. “There are also two energy companies I’m looking at investing in,” Ellison says. “We work together to make these companies succeed.”

Most of the successful energy industry startups in Louisiana have gone through similar accelerator programs, where they’re often connected with mentors and investors. Ellison is also CEO of the Red Stick Angel Network, a group of “angel” investors who identify, vet, fund and grow companies.

“There are a lot of individuals who look for deals themselves and they’re harder to find,” he says. “I think they’re missing out on a lot of good deals by not joining angel groups because these groups see a lot of deals. We want to see some traction and we’re throwing fuel on the fire.”

Shell invests in FUEL-funded companies through its GameChanger program. Led by program manager Veronica Simmonds, GameChanger works with startups and businesses on unproven early-stage ideas that have the potential to impact the future of energy.

Shell asserts that its technological capacity, customer mindset, operational experience and market knowledge place it at the forefront of innovative and collaborative approaches to help build a sustainable energy future.

The program has been actively assisting Louisiana companies for years. In May, New Orleans-based The Idea Village partnered with Shell to launch “Coastal Innovation Challenge 2025,” an initiative designed to support innovative, early-stage startups tackling coastal climate challenges.

The program offers up to $150,000 in non-dilutive funding from Shell GameChanger, along with mentorship, technical support and accelerator programming led by The Idea Village.

To date, Shell GameChanger has supported more than 150 breakthrough ideas globally, transforming unproven concepts into scalable technologies across energy, sustainability and digital transformation.

The collaboration with The Idea Village brings the program’s global vision to the Gulf South’s most pressing environmental issues.

Evaluating the value of a concept

Determining which ideas have the ability to take root in the “real world” is a tricky—but necessary—proposition. “FUEL’s not in the business of doing research for research’s sake,” Loy says.

“We’re in the business of funding research so that we can commercialize it on the other end.”

FUEL uses a complex rubric for evaluating its applications, and depends heavily upon its Technology Commercialization Subcommittee, comprised of a diverse mix of professional funders, business leaders, entrepreneurial support organizations and university academics.

“Everyone reviews each application and issues a score,” he adds. “I could evaluate something from a business standpoint, but I’m not a chemist. I need someone to tell me a little bit about what’s behind the science of it, so we need people to tell us.”

As they’re going through the process, committee members examine the science and practicality of the investment, Loy says, “as well as how implementable it is and how it benefits the industry at large. “We’re also looking at the scalability of it—the research might be cute in a lab, but how can you scale that to meet the needs of the energy industry?”

For applicants who make the cut, FUEL doles out grants in four allotments. The payments are treated as investments, whereby FUEL requires frequent updates and quarterly reports on their performance.

“Whether you’re talking about an energy company or a food product company, it really comes down to the investor and the entrepreneur,” Loy says. “Can people get behind this person? Because at the end of the day, you’re putting your money into this.

“The science and the product are important, but being able to move the product forward, both from a marketing and a funding angle, is a whole different side of it.”

The company’s strategic plan and profitability are equally important. “For a startup with a $1 million to $2 million valuation, we hope that in a year or so that valuation will be $10 million and then move up to $20 million,” he adds. “That’s the metric that we have in the back of our brain when we’re looking at these companies.”

FUEL’s six core pillars encompass everything from water to carbon sequestration, “but our north star is the ‘waste to wealth’ concept,” Loy says. In that vein, they seek to develop new industries from local waste streams, such as biomass from agriculture, which can be converted into renewable fuels.

Louisiana Green Fuels, a company partnered with FUEL, converts sustainable forestry waste into renewable transportation fuel, while other initiatives explore using sugarcane by-products for valuable products.

UNO entrepreneurs take to ‘The Beach’

Shafin Kahn, vice president of innovation and technology commercialization at the University of New Orleans, says the university’s 30-acre research and technology park, “The Beach,” has taken on an energy focus of its own in recent months.

The Beach fosters collaborations between academia, industry and entrepreneurial endeavors, as well as provides office and lab space for various technology-focused companies.

Increasingly, they’re approached by energy companies needing solutions to specific problems. Case in point—Gulf Wind Technology in Avondale asked for help in designing wind turbine blades.

“We connected Gulf Wind to one of our mechanical engineering faculty, and that collaboration continues today,” Kahn says.

A UNO electrical engineering professor is also assisting a local energy provider with modeling the impacts of hurricanes on the power grid, utilizing intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar to improve resilience.

“They’re seeking to determine what impacts that would have in terms of the stability and resilience of the grid,” Kahn says. “How do we get to the point where we can very quickly get back online after a storm or reduce the number of outages?”

Additionally, the university operates a large wave tank that researchers use to test how certain structures react to waves and other conditions in the ocean. The data is then used to design new ship hulls, oil structures and floating wind structures.

More recently, the university has taken a more active role in coordinating the commercialization of its research, a responsibility given to Kahn’s office. UNO faculty can help create marketing and business plans for the companies, and an innovation management class provides additional support.

“We’re basically taking over the patent management and folding that into our other entrepreneurial activities, such as StartUp UNO,” Kahn says, referring to a business pitch competition for undergraduate and graduate students.

“In turn, we’re helping turn ideas into business plans and creating an ecosystem for new technology development out of the university.”",https://www.1012industryreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bill-Ellison-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-03 15:20:59.892094

MCCALLA, Ala.—Mary Rosenboom is fed up.

Like 1.5 million other Alabamians, Rosenboom is forced to pay ever-increasing electricity prices set by Alabama Power and approved by the state’s Public Service Commission. Each month, Rosenboom forks over hundreds of dollars to the utility—and a massive hyperscale data center proposed near her home, she fears, will make the situation even worse.

Her electricity costs are already a huge financial burden. Rosenboom, who works as a sales professional, said she chooses not to run her air conditioner during much of the day to prevent an untenable power bill. Even that isn’t enough. Often, Rosenboom said she must turn to high-interest credit cards to keep the lights on.

“I’m robbing Peter to pay Paul,” she told Inside Climate News. “It makes me sick.”

Rosenboom’s plight isn’t unique.

Inside Climate News examined the 2024 federal filings of 100 of the largest electric utilities in the country.

None reported higher total residential electric bills, on average, than Alabama Power.

Because Alabama is one of the poorest states in the nation, that hits especially hard. Electricity customers here are among the most financially burdened in the nation, the U.S. Department of Energy found. And an analysis by think tank RMI showed that among households with extremely low incomes, Alabamians pay nearly a quarter of their earnings for electricity—the highest percentage in the country.

So why are power bills so high?

Experts point to lax regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which is charged with regulating Alabama Power and overseeing any large spending or rate increases proposed by the utility.

Robert Blanton, chair of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has been digging into the mechanisms that allow Alabama Power to earn record profits in such an impoverished state.

Ultimately, he said, there’s strong evidence that Alabama Power has effectively “captured” its regulator, the PSC. Academics use the concept of regulatory capture to describe a situation in which regulators are more beholden to the entities they are charged with regulating than the public they represent.

The commission conducts much of its regulation of Alabama Power behind closed doors, with little to no access for the public or outside interest groups. It has consistently granted Alabama Power unusually high profit margins. The company’s return on equity was 11 percent in 2023, according to a utility analysis by financial firm S&P Global.

That’s down slightly from the company’s historical average of around 13 percent, but still among the highest of any utility in the country. Nationwide, the average rate of return approved for electric utilities in 2024 rate cases was 9.74 percent, according to S&P.

“I don’t think there’s a single utility in the country that would be upset with an 11 percent earned ROE,” said Kent Chandler, former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, now a senior fellow in energy and environmental policy for the R Street Institute. “I mean, that’s like double what I know some utilities are actually earning.”

Meanwhile, Alabama Power and its parent, Southern Co., have boasted about their record profits. “Every quarter for 78 consecutive years, Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter,” the company said in a July press release.

In a statement, representatives for Alabama Power said the company’s rates were fair and its reliability was among the best in the nation. The company pointed to high per capita electricity usage in the state, the seventh-highest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the third-highest residential usage. The company said that its residential rate, not the total bill, is a more appropriate way to evaluate the company’s affordability.

“On those price-based measures—paired with our industry-leading reliability—Alabama Power’s residential service is fairly priced under PSC oversight,” the company said.

Alabama Power’s average residential rate last year was 16.77 cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than the national average of 16.48 cents and 35th highest out of 100 utilities examined by Inside Climate News.

But the national average includes places like Hawaii, Connecticut and Southern California, which are all among the top 10 states for median household income. Shipping fuel oil to Hawaii and wildfire prevention in California are also huge costs that don’t apply in Alabama.

Alabama Power’s combination of above-average rates with top-five usage yielded the highest total residential bills in the nation last year. Other states with similar or greater usage feature lower rates. One reason Alabama’s usage is so high: nearly 70 percent of Alabamians use electric heat, as opposed to natural gas, thanks in part to incentives offered by Alabama Power.

Louisiana, which has the highest per capita residential electricity use in the nation, has electric rates that averaged 11.64 cents/kWh in 2024, about 30 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rate. The average Alabama Power residential customer used 1,129 kWh of electricity per month last year, at a cost of about $189. A customer using the same amount of electricity in Louisiana would have paid $58 less every month. Those figures do not include state or local taxes, so the actual bills are even higher.

Average residential rates in the states bordering Alabama—Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida—are 15 to 25 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rates.

Alabama Power’s rates are also well above those of other providers in the state—46 percent higher than the average rate last year charged by Huntsville Utilities, which serves almost 200,000 residential customers in north Alabama.

The R Street Institute, the think tank where Chandler now works, gave Alabama an “F” in its ranking of electricity competition—how much choice consumers have about where their power comes from. No other state received such a bad grade.

The group only considered investor-owned utility companies in its rankings, and Alabama Power is the only such company in Alabama.

Alabama Power also charges about 16 percent more than Mississippi Power and about 8 percent more than Georgia Power, the other two utilities owned by its parent company, Southern Co.

The difference, at least in part, is that Alabama Power’s rates are driven up by the company’s ever-increasing profits.

The company reported a $1.4 billion profit in 2024, almost double the $712 million it earned in 2013, the year the PSC changed its formula for measuring Alabama Power’s profits. The company’s book value—its assets minus debt—more than doubled over that span, going from $5.5 billion to $13 billion.

Alabama Power said the increase in equity is driven by investments made to improve the system. “Growth in book equity primarily mirrors system investment—storm hardening, cyber and physical security, as well as transmission and distribution upgrades, along with other investments driven by reliability and compliance,” the company said.

Almost No Public Participation

In virtually all states with regulated utilities, rate cases force the company to justify its proposed increases in a public forum, providing sworn, expert testimony and allowing outside groups to challenge the projections and assertions made by the power company. Not in Alabama.

The PSC hasn’t conducted a formal rate case related to Alabama Power since 1982, more than four decades ago.

“There are no courtroom-style hearings on Alabama Power’s long-term energy planning or how those plans impact customers’ bills,” said Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Alabama office. “These types of proceedings are routine in other states. When the public can participate, we believe they’re better informed about how this process impacts their lives.”

Chandler, the former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said that while rate cases can be tedious, they are valuable to the public.

“One of the benefits of having rate cases is that you get a holistic look at a utility’s revenues and a utility’s costs,” Chandler said. “In my experience in Kentucky, consumers benefit from having periodic reviews by an objective regulator.”

And since regulated utilities earn profits on all their approved spending, the more they spend, the more they earn, he said.

“They have an incentive to over-invest,” Chandler said. “And if you never check things after the fact, then you’re just writing them a blank check.”

Wall Street has taken notice. A 2024 report by S&P Global put Alabama in a tier of its own atop the rankings in its State Regulatory Evaluations, examining the likelihood that state regulators might decrease or limit a utility’s profits. The report found no other state where a utility’s profits were as safe as in Alabama.

The last PSC commissioner to advocate for formal rate hearings for Alabama Power—Terry Dunn in 2013—was promptly voted out of office in the next election. Dunn, a self-described conservative Republican, faced a curious and largely anonymous campaign linking him to environmental groups.

Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, the former PSC president, described Dunn’s efforts to initiate formal reviews of Alabama Power as a “full frontal assault” by “extremist groups” and their “fancy San Francisco environmental lawyers.”

Dunn, who died last year, called the efforts “a smear campaign orchestrated against a Republican by fellow Republicans,” in a letter to the state party in 2013.

Later that year, about 10 people staged what many believe to be a faked environmental protest on the front steps of the PSC building. The protesters, wearing blue surgical masks and other items obscuring their identities, bore signs with slogans such as “Environmentalists [heart] Dunn,” and “Save the Warrior,” likely a reference to the Black Warrior River, which runs through Tuscaloosa. Representatives of environmental groups who were there to attend a meeting said they had no idea who the people were.

Ultimately, Dunn was defeated in the 2014 Republican primary by Chris “Chip” Beeker Jr., a cattle and catfish farm operator and former county commissioner in rural Greene County—a county whose largest employer was an Alabama Power plant. Beeker had help. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, whose lobbying firm represented Alabama Power’s parent company, organized a fundraiser for Beeker in 2013.

Beeker stepped down from the commission partway through his term last year, citing health issues. His son, Chris Beeker III, filled his seat after being appointed by Gov. Kay Ivey.

The PSC’s new president, Cynthia Lee Almond, has said transparency will be one of her priorities. But PSC staff would not make her or other commissioners available for an interview to discuss the absence of rate hearings or the public’s limited role in PSC affairs. Instead, the PSC’s press office provided written responses to questions.

When reporters reach out to the agency seeking information, the answers come with this warning:

“All verbal and/or written responses provided by the staff of the Alabama Public Service Commission (“APSC”) are for informational purposes only and may not be the subject of quotation(s) attributed to staff in any public medium without the express permission of the APSC.”

A Profitable Change

A turning point for Alabama Power’s profits came in 2013. That’s the year Alabama state regulators changed the way they measure Alabama Power’s returns, switching from the industry standard return on equity metric to a formula they created, called weighted retail return on common equity.

The weighted return rate rewards Alabama Power for having higher ratios of equity to debt. The idea was that by incentivizing company officials to carry a greater percentage of equity as opposed to debt, they would secure higher credit ratings and be able to borrow money under better terms, decreasing overall costs.

At the time, commissioners and the company said they expected electric rates to go down as a result.

“I will tell you as you see adjustments over the next few years, you are going to see a decrease,” then-PSC President Cavanaugh said.

That didn’t happen.

Instead, the company benefited from the change far more than its customers did.

Alabama Power’s electric rates have risen 45 percent across all customer groups since the novel rate formula went into effect. That’s far more than the national average, which increased 29 percent over the same span.

Meanwhile, the company’s profit nearly doubled, despite producing less electricity today than it did in 2013.

Since Alabama Power earns a return on all of its equity, having more power plants and infrastructure in place increases its profitability. The company also earns bonuses under the rate structure for maintaining positive credit ratings by financial agencies and for having a greater than 50 percent ratio of equity to debt.

The PSC, in a written statement, denied that its switch to weighted common equity was driving Alabama Power’s increased profitability.

“With regard to your analysis of public documents, which reflect the financial position of Alabama Power, please be advised there is no correlation between Alabama Power’s current financial position and the implementation of the weighted retail return on average common equality mechanism in 2013,” a commission representative told Inside Climate News.

Instead, the PSC said the increased net income was the result of Alabama Power’s “significant capital investments to modernize its systems,” which were approved by the PSC.

“If That’s Not Regulatory Capture…”

Blanton, the political science professor at UAB, sees the absence of rate-making cases, the nation’s highest electricity rates and Alabama’s record profits as unmistakable signs that Alabama’s PSC has been captured by the company it regulates.

He points to three ways regulatory capture manifests itself in Alabama.

“One is campaign finance, the ability of the regulated industry to financially contribute towards the campaigns of regulatory bodies,” he said.

A 2024 analysis by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom, showed that of the states that elect the members of their utility regulator, Alabama tops the list of those receiving the most campaign finance cash from fossil fuel-linked interests.

Fifty-five percent of political donations to Alabama public service commissioners above $250 from 2013 to 2023 came from fossil-fuel interests, the analysis concluded.

“You don’t have to have a conspiratorial mindset to figure out that gives these donors leverage—if they’re the ones that are financing the campaigns of the people they’re supposed to be regulating,” Blanton said of such contributions.

Part of the problem, Blanton said, is that Alabama is one of 10 states that directly elects its utility commissioners. PSC commissioners say they don’t accept money directly from the utilities they regulate, but lax campaign finance laws provide ample opportunity for influencing regulators, Blanton said.

An examination of “information flows” in the state also points toward capture, he said. There’s a general opacity and complexity around the information involved and a relative dominance of the industry as the primary source for information for the regulators, according to Blanton.

The third aspect of regulatory capture is “cultural capture,” Blanton said, a concept that alludes to the extent to which industry and regulators share similar worldviews or perspectives.

“The key is whether or not regulators are likely to unquestioningly accept evidence and opinions put forth by the industry, and the extent to which regulators accept information from outside sources,” Blanton said.

Looking at these three lines of evidence, Blanton said there are some clear takeaways about where Alabama finds itself—captured.

“There’s no objective reason why Alabama should be an outlier. We’re not hotter than Texas. We don’t have worse conditions than Louisiana,” he said. “There’s just nothing that makes sense. … Any reasonable person, looking through the data, looking through the evidence, will say, ‘We have a situation that’s, if that’s not regulatory capture, I don’t know what is.’”

Data Center Angst

Inside Climate News interviewed more than a dozen Alabama Power customers for this story, and each shared the concerns voiced by Mary Rosenboom, the customer who lives near the proposed hyperscale data center—rising energy costs, a lack of transparency and fear about what the future may hold.

Rosenboom and others worry that construction and operation of power-hungry data centers will drive their electricity costs even higher.

“I know that’s what’s coming,” Rosenboom said. “And it’ll be us that foot the bill. It’s not good for the citizens. It’s good for Alabama Power’s pocketbook.”

Alabama Power and the PSC both insist that data center costs will not be passed on to other customers. But they also declined to say whether those agreements with data centers will be made public, making it impossible to verify those claims.

In a statement, a representative for the company said that it takes a “disciplined approach” to engaging with potential data center customers.

“We understand that budgets are tight, and affordability is central to our mission. That is why we work hard to connect customers with offerings like Budget Billing, payment plans, efficiency tools, and assistance programs,” the company’s response said.

Data centers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” the company said. “We work with the Alabama Public Service Commission to approve large-load customer contracts and any needed operational investments, ensuring a thorough process that validates needs and protects customers.”

Alabama Power declined to provide a list of planned data center projects and their anticipated electricity demand.

“Long-term capacity planning is reviewed with the PSC,” the company responded. “We don’t publish speculative load projections for individual customer classes or projects. Any major resource additions follow established processes to ensure reliability and fairness for all customers.”

Regulatory interactions involving Alabama Power and the PSC are often similarly opaque.

During depositions involving Alabama Power’s request to purchase a natural gas plant earlier this year, lawyers for environmental groups questioned company management about data centers and their anticipated loads.

The company’s representatives were often vague in their answers, though they did admit that data centers are the “primary driver” of increased load projections. When company lawyers did provide substantive information about specific load figures, their answers were redacted in PSC transcripts.

“I’ll say that some projects fall off of this list and some projects are added to this list and the net change is [redacted] megawatts,” Alabama Power forecasting manager Maria Burke said in a deposition. “They have a mixed answer because in the previous forecast I would say we only had [redacted] megawatts to data centers and in this forecast we have [redacted]. So the delta is [redacted].”

If built to capacity, a proposed data center campus in Bessemer, just southwest of Birmingham near Rosenboom’s home in McCalla, is expected to consume as much as 1,200 megawatts of electricity, running every hour, 24 hours a day, according to estimates provided to residents. That amount of energy is about 10 times the usage of all residences in nearby Birmingham or around 90 times the usage of all residences in Bessemer.

In one fell swoop, it could increase Alabama Power’s total demand across the state by around 10 percent.

“My power bill’s already not affordable,” said Brenda Small, who lives in a trailer park adjacent to the site of the proposed data center. “I had one bill that was $495. No one can afford that.”

Reliant on Fossil Fuels

Alabama Power’s electricity is not only expensive, it’s dirty and comes with a heavy environmental footprint.

The PSC has approved costly upgrades to old coal-fired power plants, allowing Alabama Power to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to delay their retirements by only a few years. The PSC greenlit massive natural gas additions in 2020, 2022 and 2025, making Alabama Power increasingly reliant on fossil fuels for decades to come and its customers vulnerable to price spikes in natural gas and supply shortages in times of heavy energy use.

Its coal-fired power plant near Birmingham, the James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant, has been the nation’s largest single source of greenhouse gases for nine years running. The company charges hefty fees to customers who install solar panels, smothering the small-scale renewable market. Alabama ranks second to last among states in energy efficiency efforts in a recent scorecard, and upgrades to its old and expensive coal plants seem destined to continue as electricity demand rises due to large data centers.

The company has also stuck to its guns on plans to leave nearly 77 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash in unlined ponds along Alabama’s rivers, leaching contaminants into the groundwater indefinitely, even as other utilities in the South have agreed to dig out some or all of their ash ponds.

And this environmental record, UAB’s Blanton said, has come under the watch of state regulators, who have minimized the effects of climate change and Alabama Power’s pollution.

A New Profit Formula Review—With No Public Input

When adopting the 2013 profit formula, called Rate Stabilization and Equalization, or RSE, the commission agreed to review its performance every six years. The first review was conducted in 2019, with no changes made to the rate structure.

In its responses to Inside Climate News, the commission said the second review has already begun—with no public input—through a series of closed-door meetings with Alabama Power and the state attorney general’s office.

Whether outside experts or concerned members of the public will be provided an opportunity to weigh in on the review will only be decided after the commission’s staff has made its findings, the PSC statement said.

Tidwell, the Southern Environmental Law Center attorney, said public participation should be essential in utility regulation.

“Alabama Power customers who are impacted by the PSC’s decisions deserve to have a say in the process,” Tidwell said. “The Public Service Commission is tasked with ensuring that rates are just and reasonable not just for Alabama Power, but also for the public. … How can you protect customers’ best interests when there are almost no avenues for them to participate in the process?”

Access to EV chargers should never be the constraint.” A ZIP code analysis by city officials found that downtown and some northern suburban neighborhoods have significantly more EV owners than San Ysidro and neighborhoods in southeastern San Diego.
Sales have been strong in California and San Diego with the tax credits in place.
She said the rate is 50 cents per kilowatt hour at the existing city chargers that recently got upgraded.
A new city survey about EV chargers is available at sandiego.gov/general-services/energy/zev/evcharging.","San Diego is launching construction of a long-awaited citywide network of electric vehicle charging stations in public parking lots at beaches, library branches and recreation centers.

The goal is a reliable network of chargers so San Diego residents can buy or lease an EV with confidence they can conveniently charge it — even if they don’t have a garage or another way to charge at home.

Another goal is to fight the socioeconomic and geographic trends showing most of the EVs in the city are registered to residents of wealthier neighborhoods like Carmel Valley, La Jolla, Rancho Bernardo and downtown.

The network will span every neighborhood in the city and target areas with high concentrations of apartments and condominiums, because residents there are the EV owners and potential owners most likely to need public charging.

“We needed to think about the transition to clean transportation through the lens of what the city can and can’t do,” said Anna Lowe, a city program manager focused on EVs. “We can’t help with the cost of buying an EV, but we can help with charging an EV. Access to EV chargers should never be the constraint.”

A ZIP code analysis by city officials found that downtown and some northern suburban neighborhoods have significantly more EV owners than San Ysidro and neighborhoods in southeastern San Diego.

“San Diego has a lot of EVs, but they’re not equitably distributed throughout the city,” Lowe said. “The city wants to be part of the solution to reduce that inequity.”

City officials are completing permitting and working out logistical details with San Diego Gas & Electric to install between 750 and 800 charging portals at 59 locations — 20 library branches and 39 pools or recreation centers.

Officials estimate ground could be broken on the first wave of chargers early next year. Work on them follows recently completed updates and repairs to 58 existing charging ports at 12 city locations.

The city had first announced plans for a network of chargers in spring 2023, but that process was delayed partly by complex negotiations with the company that will install them.

Progress on the charging network comes with future sales of EVs becoming more uncertain, thanks to the federal government’s elimination of long-standing tax credits at the end of last month.

Sales have been strong in California and San Diego with the tax credits in place. EV registrations within the city climbed from 67,674 in 2022 to 95,155 in 2023 and 119,251 in 2024. And statewide, EV sales soared last month, as buyers rushed to beat the end of the tax credits.

The more widespread adoption of EVs plays a key role in helping meet multiple city goals.

San Diego’s climate action plan commits the city to having 16% of all miles driven be by zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and to having a quarter be zero-emission by 2035.

The plan also calls for the city to transition to an all-electric fleet for light-duty vehicles by 2035, with 75% of its heavy-duty vehicles electric by that time. The city owns about 5,000 vehicles; only a small number are now EVs.

The chargers are being planned and installed by Everged, which agreed to a controversial 10-year deal with the city last year.

Some City Council members had raised concerns that the city could owe Everged as much as $60 million for charging infrastructure at the end of the deal.

While that is technically true, the city’s independent budget analyst said that amount is based on a highly unlikely worst-case scenario where demand for electric charging stations plummets to nearly zero.

Everged faces penalties if broken chargers aren’t promptly repaired. Broken chargers can be reported on the city’s Get It Done! tipster app.

The new chargers will be split roughly half and half between those compatible with Tesla cars and those with different plug shapes and other features. A number of car manufacturers are adopting Tesla-style chargers in upcoming models.

The system will be malleable, officials said. The charging cables and ports can be changed out if the mix of vehicles changes and there is greater demand for one type of port or another, officials said.

Heather Werner, a deputy director in the city’s General Services Department, said the charging fees at the city portals are “comparable” to other public charging stations not on city property.

She said the rate is 50 cents per kilowatt hour at the existing city chargers that recently got upgraded. Everged sets the rates, but the city has the right to object if it doesn’t find them reasonable.

At each project site where new chargers are planned, crews will post public notices and then conduct two to three weeks of preparation work that may include clearing debris and flattening areas for the chargers.

They will then spend two to three weeks installing the new chargers and another week or two testing them.

Once all the chargers have been installed at libraries and rec centers, Everged is scheduled to move on to police stations, fire stations and city office buildings.

A new city survey about EV chargers is available at sandiego.gov/general-services/energy/zev/evcharging.

City officials are planning a webinar for EV drivers some time this fall. Officials said it will focus on charger types, locations and related details.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SUT-L-ev-chargers-001.jpg?w=1024&h=710,N,,2025-11-03 12:10:58.570473

“This surge threatens electricity crises and higher tariffs while derailing 2030 clean power commitments,” the report says.
Clean energy technologies rely heavily on lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements.","Global data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025-2026 report further outlines how geopolitical tensions across the world are further hindering nations’ pledge to decarbonise.

The analysis shows that achieving a 2°C warming limit would require US$4.3trillion (£3.3trilliion) in annual investment between 2025-2060 and that net zero emissions by around to be reached around 2060. With this, global energy sector investment must grow from 2.5% of global GDP today to 3.35% within the next decade.

With current rates of energy demand rise and the climate warming, the report offers a bleak outlook where few countries across the whole world, and no G7 countries, are on track to meet 2030 emissions goals.

Wood Mackenzie’s report outlines how the current rate of renewables powering grids around the world is currently at 20%. With its modelling, it outlines how by 2050, at current rates, this will only rise to 68%, restricting most nations’ pledges to decarbonise their grids due to grid stability and storage limitations.

Specifically, the report points out how China is continuing to surge ahead with its decarbonisation plans using “coordinated industrial policy and rapid clean-tech expansion”.

“It dominates solar, wind, battery and critical mineral supply chains, using scale and cost advantages to expand exports, set standards and strengthen its geopolitical leverage,” the report says.

The US, in contrast, has shifted into energy isolationism under the Trump administration with much of the Inflation Reduction Act being dismantled, tax credits being scaled back and clean-energy funding being paused. Wood Mackenzie points out how certain states and cities remain active but the national stance has turned inward and fossil friendly.

Where Europe is concerned, the report details a struggle to maintain its early leadership, which is being hindered by high energy prices, slow permitting and a hollowed-out industrial base “eroding competitiveness, while public fatigue and political fragmentation are weakening climate consensus”.

“Ambition remains high, but execution is faltering,” it says.

According to Wood Mackenzie’s Lens Energy Transition Scenarios (ETS), the US faces the steepest investment challenge among major economies where it must increase annual climate transition spending by 76% to reach net zero.

China must see a 29% increase and Europe a 36% increase in climate spending to reach the 2050 net zero target.

Power surge

Wood Mackenzie has stated the boom in energy usage around the world is being propelled by the proliferation of data centres and artificial intelligence (AI).

According to its modelling, data centres are consuming 700TWh of electricity across the world this year which could potentially double by 2030.

“This surge threatens electricity crises and higher tariffs while derailing 2030 clean power commitments,” the report says.

“However, AI itself may accelerate breakthrough technologies and optimise energy systems, as advanced simulations, optimise materials performance, and enable efficient design configurations at unprecedented speed.”

Rare materials

A further element that is restricting renewable energy growing to help decarbonise is the lack of materials needed to build the industry in line with the growth in energy usage.

Clean energy technologies rely heavily on lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements.

Wood Mackenzie points out how supply chains are “highly concentrated, with China dominating lithium and rare earth refining, creating new geopolitical dependencies”.

Last week, the government released its Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan as it aims to redirect its climate action to be more in line with the framework of the Climate Change Act 2008.

This new plan brings together the government’s actions and intent to meet carbon budgets 4-6, from 2023-2037. These budgets constitute greenhouse gas emission reductions and have caps of 1,950Mt of CO2 (Carbon Budget 4), 1,725Mt of CO2 (Carbon Budget 5) and 965Mt of CO2 (Carbon Budget 6). The cap for Carbon Budget 6 constitutes a 77% reduction in emissions compared with 1990.

Wood Mackenzie vice president head of scenarios and technologies Prakash Sharma said: “The energy system is becoming more complex, interconnected, and, volatile,”

“As power demand surges due to the expansion of technologies such as AI and electrification, what was once a mostly aspirational shift towards decarbonization is now facing the hard trade-offs of scale, system integration, capital allocation and geopolitics.

“The share of solar and wind in global power supply has grown from 5% to 20% over the past decade and the surge is expected to continue. But accelerating from deployment to a deeply decarbonized, resilient energy system is proving far more complex than simply adding megawatts.”

“A new climate leadership is emerging,” said Sharma. “As the US doubles down on fossil fuels, pushing allies to buy its LNG, China is seizing the low-carbon mantle through EV and solar dominance, plus aggressive renewables deployment. Europe maintains the strongest net zero ambitions, viewing clean technologies as essential for economic and energy security.

“While a faster transition appears more expensive in the near-term due to compressed investment timelines, delaying it carries the risk of significantly higher costs longer term towards climate adaptation. The decade ahead presents critical climate checkpoints that will determine whether meaningful decarbonisation remains achievable with significant investment increases.”

“Viewing the energy system as interconnected is more critical than ever because electrification, flexibility and decarbonisation link markets that once stood apart,” said Sharma. “Oil, gas, coal and power can no longer operate in silos: EV adoption shifts electricity demand, gas shortages ripple into power and heating, and investment in shared infrastructure like transmission lines, pipelines and storage affects multiple sectors at once.

“Geopolitical shocks or resource constraints in one fuel cascade across others, while technologies such as hydrogen, CCUS and biofuels rely on cheap renewables and common infrastructure. Treating energy carriers as separate markets risks missing the synergies and vulnerabilities that define the transition.​”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/shutterstock_1904019460-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 16:07:05.673526

In its third-quarter earnings presentation Thursday, First Solar listed a half-dozen “headwinds” for solar panel components manufactured abroad and shipped into the United States. Those include the possibility of new Section 232 tariffs on imported polysilicon components, potential retroactive duties on certain imports between June 2022 and June 2024 following an August trade court ruling, and pending Treasury Department guidance on domestic content in clean energy equipment.

In a statement Thursday, First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said his company’s domestic supply chain positions it to benefit from trade friction.

“While trade and policy developments have introduced new challenges for many in our industry, we continue to differentiate ourselves by offering pricing and delivery certainty,” he said.

He added more color to that statement on First Solar’s Thursday afternoon investor call.

“We believe this enhances the value proposition of our vertically integrated facilities … and of expanding our U.S. manufacturing and production [while] reshoring supply chains,” Widmar said.

Manufacturing update

First Solar produced 3.6 GW of solar equipment in the third quarter, 2.5 GW of which came from U.S. factories. Its newest production facility came online in Louisiana in August, and the company plans to commission new finishing lines with 3.7 GW annual capacity at a location to be announced soon, First Solar said Thursday.

On Thursday, Widmar signaled more U.S. investment could follow as First Solar shifts production out of heavily tariffed markets in Southeast Asia.

“We are very excited about getting the first two lines up and running here next year … as we continue to evaluate market opportunities and demand, more decisions will be made,” he said.

BP Lightsource contract dispute

First Solar continues to enforce its contractual rights against Lightsource BP, Widmar and First Solar Chief Financial Officer Alexander Bradley said on Thursday.

The European renewables developer, a subsidiary of BP, terminated a 6.6-GW supply agreement with First Solar last year amid what Widmar said was a broader retreat from renewable energy development by oil-and-gas multinationals.

First Solar booked $61 million in revenue from the contract but seeks an additional $324 million in damages, Bradley said. He did not say when First Solar expects the case to be resolved.

Solid bookings, pipeline churn

First Solar has 54.5 GW of net bookings out to 2030, the company said Thursday. Bradley characterized the pipeline as healthy, driven by continued strong demand in the United States. The Lightsource BP termination accounted for the bulk of recently canceled volumes, and at least one large customer re-booked an order in 2025 after canceling in 2024, Bradley added.

But in a Friday note to First Solar investors, William Blair stock analyst Jed Dorsheimer said more cancellations could be on the way and advised investors to scrutinize First Solar’s backlog more closely.

These financial realities are reshaping investment decisions and technology choices across the energy storage industry.","Thomas Sisto is co-founder and CEO of XL Batteries.

Explosive growth in electricity demand is poised to consume any surplus that once was wasted. We all know what is coming: Forecasts expect data centers alone to increase their power consumption by 165% in 2030. At that point, 50 GW of the 100 GW of predicted new U.S. peak demand will come from data centers. Combined with broader “electrification of everything” policies and increasingly complex grid dynamics, this growth is triggering a seismic economic shift. Wasting power will soon become an unaffordable luxury of the past.

This shift demands a hard look at long-duration energy storage, or LDES, which will be critical for grid reliability and affordability as we integrate more renewables. The U.S. Department of Energy found that up to 460 GW of LDES capacity may be necessary by 2050.

Not all LDES technologies are created equal, however. Round-trip efficiency, or RTE, will be a key determinant of which technologies can deliver at the scale and cost we need and which ones will perpetuate the pattern of waste.

A dangerous misconception persists that renewable energy is sometimes wasted or is so cheap that RTE doesn’t matter. This assumption ignores the true economics, which the data reveal. The industry must prioritize high-efficiency LDES technologies now to achieve both our climate goals and economic viability.

Scale redefines the efficiency equation

Here’s what the efficiency skeptics miss: Scale changes everything. Losing 50% of the energy stored in a home battery system is inconvenient but manageable; a 50% loss of stored energy at the grid scale — amounting to gigawatt-hours of stored energy — is catastrophic. Consider the difference between a leaking glass of water and a leaking Hoover Dam: The sheer volume of the dam’s water amplifies the loss.

This becomes even more critical given that the U.S. power system already wastes more than 60% of primary energy during the conversion of fuel to electricity. Many emerging LDES technologies struggle to exceed 60% RTE, creating compounding energy losses just as we need maximum efficiency.

The numbers make it clear that LDES must scale up capacity by 2040 to meet decarbonization goals. At this magnitude, every percentage point of efficiency loss translates to massive infrastructure costs and environmental impact. This reality is reshaping which LDES technologies will be able to provide value.

DOE analysis finds that existing LDES technologies need significant RTE improvements by 2030 to attract sustained investment. To accelerate this shift, utilities and developers must make efficiency a primary evaluation criterion for procurement decisions and regulators need to incorporate RTE requirements into grid planning and resource adequacy standards. Early demonstration projects that showcase superior efficiency will create the performance benchmarks necessary to drive industrywide adoption.

For cost-effective grid decarbonization, DOE estimates that LDES must achieve a levelized cost of storage below $0.05/kWh. Given these economics, 70% RTE is emerging as the target for grid-scale LDES. Earlier studies suggesting 50% RTE would suffice now look dangerously inaccurate.

Low RTE creates two compounding problems: lost revenue from wasted energy and the cost of overbuilding renewable infrastructure to compensate. As LDES assets become ubiquitous, competition for charging will intensify, eliminating “free” energy.

The financial case for high-efficiency LDES

Transitioning the power grid by 2035 could cost as much as $740 billion in additional power system costs. Every inefficiency will force us to build more panels, more transmission lines and more materials, each carrying environmental and economic costs.

Overbuilding is not a sustainable solution. Overbuilding renewable generation to compensate for inefficient storage is economically and environmentally untenable. The costs of infrastructure, land acquisition, permitting, and maintenance compound when more generation is needed to offset storage losses.

Read More in Renewables

In Texas, recent studies show the stark difference efficiency makes for project returns. A 5-MW, 12-hour battery with 75% RTE produces an internal rate of return of 68.7% with a 1.5-year payback period, while a 40% RTE system drops to a 36.7% internal rate of return.

Recent modeling by E3 demonstrates the potential scale of this impact. For both 12-hour and 24-hour duration batteries, deployment of high (75%) RTE LDES technology could save California power producers $11 billion in renewable generation overbuild compared with low (46%) RTE technologies.

These financial realities are reshaping investment decisions and technology choices across the energy storage industry. When project returns vary this dramatically, RTE becomes the deciding factor.

As extreme weather events become more frequent, massive data centers come online, and electrification progresses, we cannot afford to waste power. The days of tolerating and investing in low-efficiency grid storage are over.

LDES technologies combining safety, scalability, and high RTE will dominate the future, and those who recognize this shift early will be positioned to lead the next phase of the energy transition.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3-j41PCC0Ehet9Y5-BPL2AWZAnAfWnELuvvRE1s6fVM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTI2MjI3OTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-03 12:11:23.060685

According to a new report from the Korea Economic Daily, Tesla has reached a substantial agreement with Samsung SDI. The deal is said to be worth over 3 trillion won (approximately $2.1 billion) and will see the South Korean battery giant supply cells to Tesla over a three-year period.

But here’s the key part: This supply is reportedly for Tesla’s Energy Storage System (ESS) business.

That means these cells are destined for Megapack and possibly Powerwall products, not for Tesla’s electric vehicles.

The report, which cites an unnamed battery industry source, marks the first large-scale supply agreement between Samsung SDI and Tesla. For years, the two companies have been in talks, with most speculation centered on Samsung building 4680 cells, a cell format Tesla pioneered. While Samsung is indeed ramping up its own 46-series cell production, this new deal appears to be focused entirely on LFP cells for stationary energy storage.

When reached for comment, Samsung SDI officially stated that “nothing has been finalized yet,” which is a common response to such reports before a deal is formally announced. Tesla has not commented.

This new deal with Samsung SDI follows another massive ESS battery agreement Tesla signed with a different South Korean supplier, LG Energy Solution, for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. Currently, Tesla exclusively uses cells from CATL and BYD for its energy storage products, but the company recently noted a bed to diversify supply due to the tariffs put in place on Chinese products.

Tesla has also been working on deploying its own LFP battery cell manufacturing in the US to partially offset Chinese supply.

Electrek’s Take

The company’s energy storage division has been a silver lining amid two years of decline in its EV division.

The growth has been impressive despite increased competition.

Ottawa, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - November 3, 2025) - Focus Graphite Inc. (TSXV: FMS) (OTCQB: FCSMF) (FSE: FKC0) (""Focus"" or the ""Company""), a leading developer of high-grade flake graphite deposits and innovator of next-generation lithium-ion battery technology, is pleased to announce that it has been selected by Natural Resources Canada (""NRCan"") under the Global Partnerships Initiative (""GPI"") for conditional approval of a non-repayable contribution of up to $14,062,500 pending final due diligence. The funding will support Focus Graphite's project, ""Transformation of Canadian Flake Graphite into Ultra-High Purity Battery & Advanced Materials Using Electrothermal Fluidized Bed Technology"" (the ""Project""). The Project unites Canadians, Ukrainian, and American partners to produce ultra-high purity graphite for global battery, aerospace, defence, and advanced material markets.

Highlights:

Up to $14.1 Million Non-Repayable Federal Contribution Funding: Announced by the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, at the G7 Energy and Environment Minister's Meeting in Toronto under NRCan's Global Partnerships Initiative (GPI), to support the establishment of Canada's first commercial, scalable electrothermal fluidized bed purification demonstration facility, advancing domestic critical mineral processing capacity and creating skilled Canadian jobs.

Environmentally Friendly Technology: This continuous process produces ultra-high purity graphite with zero liquid waste, lower emissions, and an ESG-aligned pathway to supply advanced battery, defence, aerospace, and clean technology markets.

International Collaboration: Engineering led by Ukraine's Thermal & Material Engineering Center, using Canadian graphite feedstock and U.S.-based American Energy Technologies Company's expertise in electrothermal purification, with final assembly in Canada.

BEACONS Battery Prototyping Partnership: Focus has partnered with the University of Texas at Dallas, representing the BEACONS Battery Prototyping Facility, a U.S. Department of War-supported research and development center dedicated to strengthening North American energy and materials security.

Path to Commercialization: This initiative establishes the foundation for large-scale production of Quebec-sourced graphite from Lac Knife and Tetepisca, supporting Canada's goal of secure, allied, and sustainable critical-mineral supply chains.

This represents the largest federal award in the Company's history, supporting the development of Canada's first chemical-free continual fluidized electrothermal purification demonstration facility for natural flake graphite. The Project will use Quebec-sourced feedstock from Focus's Lac Knife and Lac Tetepisca deposits, two of North America's highest-grade natural graphite resources, to produce ultra-high-purity (>99.95% C) graphite, suitable for battery, aerospace, defence, nuclear and a host of advanced-material applications, including graphene. The Company may access the contribution funding up until March 2028.

The continuous electrothermal fluidized bed technology initiative will be carried out through collaboration with Ukraine's Thermal & Material Engineering Center (""TMEC""). TMEC will lead full project management for the demonstration unit, overseeing engineering design, construction, fabrication, system integration, and training. The company brings extensive experience in the design, engineering, and management of advanced high-temperature reactor systems and continuous fluidized bed technology development. American Energy Technologies Company (""AETC""), a recognized specialist in carbon materials, electrothermal purification, and fluidized bed furnace technologies, will continue providing processing and thermal purification services to support near-term customer sampling and product qualification.

Over the past several years, the Company has invested substantial time and capital to de-risk the purification pathway, working with U.S.-based AETC to validate the process on Lac Knife graphite feedstock. Detailed characterization confirmed that impurities in Focus's natural flake graphite occur predominantly along the flake boundaries rather than within the crystalline lattice, a feature that makes the material particularly responsive to high-temperature electrothermal purification. Using AETC's proprietary electrothermal fluidized-bed furnace, Focus successfully achieved over 99.999%+ C (five-nine purity or nuclear grade) without any chemical reagents. These results validated the scalability and environmental integrity of the process, laying the foundation for today's GPI-funded demonstration facility and its potential extension into rare earth element (REE) purification applications. As construction of the Canadian demonstration facility proceeds, Focus expects to continue working closely with AETC to purify additional material through its commercial-scale furnace, supporting near-term customer sampling, product qualification, and market off-take engagement. This parallel commercialization strategy ensures uninterrupted material availability while advancing the Company toward domestic electrothermal processing capacity.

This initiative will also strengthen several ongoing partnerships, including Focus Graphite's upcoming work with the University of Texas at Dallas's BEACONS (""BEACONS"") Battery Prototyping Facility, a U.S. DoW-supported research and development center dedicated to strengthening North American energy and materials security battery prototyping facility, which will accelerate the development, validation, and commercialization of this green purification technology. BEACONS will independently evaluate and qualify Focus's purified graphite and siliconized anode materials for defence and dual-use battery applications.

Collectively, these collaborations represent the first of several anticipated global partnerships, combining Ukrainian engineering innovation, Canadian critical-mineral resources, and U.S. defence-focused validation, as Focus Graphite advances its strategy to ship purified material worldwide for testing, validation, and qualification across commercial, aerospace, and defence markets.

""We are grateful to NRCan for its support and vision in assisting Focus Graphite and companies like ours in achieving our shared goal of securing North American supply chains for Canada and its G7 partners,"" said Dean Hanisch, CEO of Focus Graphite.

BEACONS Collaboration: North American Validation for Advanced Battery and Defence Applications

In parallel to its engineering partnership with TMEC, Focus has entered a non-binding Letter of Intent (""LOI"") on October 20, 2025 with The University of Texas at Dallas, representing the BEACONS Battery Prototyping Facility, a U.S. DoW supported research and development center dedicated to strengthening North American energy and materials security.

The project overview outlines a multi-phase validation program designed to demonstrate the performance of Focus's purified anode materials in U.S. DoW standard battery systems.

Phase I: DoW-Standard 18650 Cell Prototyping: BEACONS will fabricate and test 18650-format lithium-ion battery cells using Focus Graphite's purified natural flake graphite as the anode material. The program aims to generate statistically significant performance data including cycle life, energy density, and charge-retention metrics to establish a validated, North American source of graphite anode material suitable for integration into U.S. and Canadian defence and energy platforms

Phase II: Siliconized Graphite Development: BEACONS intends to collaborate further with Focus Graphite to develop a next-generation siliconized graphite anode, utilizing Focus's patent pending process and a North American-sourced, non-silane silicon feedstock. This program will prototype Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-standard pouch cells, with the goal of creating a commercially viable, high-energy-density anode that advances energy storage capabilities for both the U.S. DoW and Canada's Department of National Defence (""DND"").

Network-Wide Integration: Upon successful validation, the purified graphite will be made available through BEACONS' network of users which includes cell manufacturers, equipment developers, and academic researchers-for further testing with complementary cathode and electrolyte systems, reinforcing cross-border supply-chain interoperability.

This collaboration positions the Company at the center of North American anode-material validation, linking Canadian upstream resources to U.S. defence-grade testing and commercialization pipelines. Beyond these initial efforts, both parties recognize the potential to expand into testing and validation of additional advanced materials within BEACONS' network, creating a foundation for ongoing joint research and product development across the allied energy and defence ecosystem.

""We identified BEACONS as the ideal collaborator for this vertical given its DoW supported mandate to validate next-generation energy materials under real-world defence and flight-system testing standards,"" said Jason Latkowcer, VP Corporate Development. ""For investors and allied industries, this collaboration represents a gateway for Focus Graphite into North American and NATO supply chains, helping reduce dependency on adversarial sources and ensuring that critical defence and aerospace equipment are never reliant on foreign-controlled materials.""

""The G7's focus on critical minerals highlights the urgency of strengthening domestic energy infrastructure. This collaboration positions UT Dallas's BEACONS as a hub where innovative materials meet rigorous testing and validation, translating promising technologies into deployable solutions for the North American market,"" said Dr. Joseph Pancrazio, VP for Research and Innovation at UT Dallas.

Advancing Canada's Strategic and Environmental Independence in Critical Minerals

The GPI funding will help Canada strengthen secure and low-carbon critical mineral supply chains while reducing dependence on purification infrastructure currently dominated by other countries. Using electrothermal fluidized-bed technology, Focus will demonstrate a clean and scalable purification process.

This project aligns with the goals of Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy by establishing a domestic purification capability for Canadian-sourced graphite. It will create skilled jobs, support regional economic development, and enable Canadian-controlled production of battery-grade materials. By building this homegrown purification capacity, Focus is helping Canada and its allies process and qualify critical materials within North America, advancing environmental responsibility, energy security, and manufacturing resilience.

Expanding Allied Market Access and Global Qualification Pathways

Through this GPI-funded initiative, Focus will produce and distribute qualification samples to G7 and NATO-aligned partners. The project will also establish Canada's first commercial-scale graphite purification hub, offering mines, research institutions, and manufacturers a sustainable alternative to imported materials. This initiative directly addresses Canada's upstream bottleneck in establishing domestic large-scale purification capacity, and complements Ottawa's Critical Minerals Strategy. Focus looks forward to updating local First Nations communities as the Project advances, to explore opportunities for participation, collaboration, and shared economic benefits in the spirit of respect and partnership.

Focus's electrothermal platform is designed for clean, high-temperature purification of graphite and, over the longer term, may be adaptable to rare earth element (REE) purification. Current REE processing already uses thermal and pyrometallurgical techniques such as vacuum distillation, molten-salt electrolysis, and fluidized-bed calcination to achieve ultra-high purities. As the demonstration advances, Focus plans to collaborate with Canadian research institutions (e.g. the National Research Council of Canada) to explore how its electrothermal technology could apply to selective impurity removal and de-oxidation in REE flowsheets, potentially opening new avenues for clean, domestic processing of strategic materials.

A slow Western response In contrast, Western automakers — particularly in the U.S. — are slowing their EV plans.
Europe’s manufacturers, meanwhile, are warning of “industrial disaster” if Chinese EV imports continue unchecked.
In doing so, they’ve made the traditional strengths of Western automakers — decades of engine experience and dealership networks — largely irrelevant.
Using its controversial tariffs policy to keep Chinese cars out, the U.S. can delay the Chinese onslaught for a short while.","For more than a century, the global car industry has been defined by Western dominance — from Detroit’s muscle to Stuttgart’s precision to Tokyo’s reliability and efficiency. But in 2025, the center of gravity is shifting east once again. This time, it’s not Japan or Korea leading the charge. It’s China. And its automakers, led by BYD, Chery, Geely, GWM, and NIO — are executing a global electric vehicle offensive that has the potential to reshape the industry as profoundly as Toyota did in the 1970s.

A new wave of disruption

Across Europe, Southeast Asia, and Australia, Chinese EVs are arriving in droves — sleek, affordable, and technologically sophisticated. At last count, for example, at least 23 Chinese car brands were either on sale in Australia or due to go on sale within the next six months. Meanwhile, restrictive import policies—namely extremely high tariffs—by the US administration mean that not one Chinese brand has landed in American showrooms yet.

BYD, the world’s largest EV maker, has already overtaken Tesla in global EV sales. In markets like Australia and Thailand, its compact electric Dolphin and Atto 3 models are undercutting competitors by as much as 30 percent while offering longer ranges and higher-quality interiors. Meanwhile, Zeekr — a premium arm of Geely, which also owns Volvo and Polestar — is launching design-forward EVs in Europe that rival BMW and Mercedes-Benz on style and software. NIO, once dismissed as a Tesla clone, is expanding its network of battery-swap stations across Europe, offering five-minute “refuels,” or super quick battery swaps, that leapfrog Western charging infrastructure.

Chinese automakers are no longer playing catch-up. They’re outpacing Western brands on cost, speed, and innovation — and they’re doing so with a confidence that recalls the early days of Japan’s automotive rise.

The cost advantage that’s rewriting the rules

At the heart of this revolution is vertical integration. BYD, short for “Build Your Dreams,” controls nearly every stage of its supply chain, from raw lithium extraction to battery cell production to chip design. This structure, rare among established automakers, gives BYD a massive cost advantage. Analysts estimate BYD can produce an EV battery pack for less than $60 per kWh, compared to roughly $100 per kWh for Western competitors.

That gap translates directly into lower sticker prices — and higher profits. While Ford and GM struggle to make a margin on their electric lineups like the F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Equinox EV and Blazer EV, BYD’s profits per vehicle surged over 80% in 2024. The company’s Blade Battery, a long-lasting and fire-resistant lithium iron phosphate (LFP) design, is both cheaper and safer than most Western alternatives.

This cost efficiency, combined with scale, is what’s enabling BYD to flood export markets while others hesitate.

A slow Western response

In contrast, Western automakers — particularly in the U.S. — are slowing their EV plans. Ford and GM have delayed billions in electric car investments amid slowing demand and high battery costs. Tesla, once the defining disruptor, now faces price pressure from both ends: Chinese EVs undercut it on affordability, and luxury newcomers challenge it on quality.

Europe’s manufacturers, meanwhile, are warning of “industrial disaster” if Chinese EV imports continue unchecked. The European Commission has even launched an investigation into Chinese subsidies, fearing that Beijing’s state-backed automakers are dumping cars below cost to capture market share — much like Japan’s strategy in the 1970s.

But protectionism may not be enough. Even if tariffs rise, the technological and cost gulf between Chinese and Western automakers could widen.

Echoes of Japan’s 1970s takeover

The parallels are striking. In the 1970s, U.S. carmakers dismissed Japanese imports as cheap and underpowered — until Toyota, Honda, and Nissan redefined quality, reliability and efficiency. Today, Chinese EVs are following the same playbook: entering with budget models, refining quality, and moving rapidly upmarket.

Already, BYD’s Yangwang U8, a 1,200-horsepower plug-in hybrid SUV with its revolutionary 360-degree tank-turn capability—allowing it to turn a full circle on itself, shows China’s engineering ambitions aren’t limited to economy cars. And brands like Zeekr and NIO are being heralded in European media including Britain’s Autocar and Top Gear and Germany’s Auto Bild for their handling and ride quality, design sophistication and software refinement — once considered unthinkable for Chinese cars.

The new global order

If the 20th century belonged to Detroit, Stuttgart, and Tokyo, the 21st century may belong to Shenzhen and Hangzhou. China’s EV makers have leapfrogged the combustion era entirely, focusing on software-driven design, solid-state battery R&D, and over-the-air performance updates. In doing so, they’ve made the traditional strengths of Western automakers — decades of engine experience and dealership networks — largely irrelevant.

The disruption isn’t just industrial; it’s geopolitical. Electric vehicles are the backbone of tomorrow’s energy and trade policies, linking lithium mines in Africa, battery plants in Asia, and charging grids in Europe. As China seizes control of the EV supply chain, Western economies risk losing not just market share but strategic influence. And what of America? Using its controversial tariffs policy to keep Chinese cars out, the U.S. can delay the Chinese onslaught for a short while. But just like America was forced to enter WWII by the Japanese in late 1941, after maintaining an isolationist policy, the day will come soon when the U.S. will be forced to open the floodgates to Chinese cars.

Western carmakers are now where Detroit was in 1978 — slow, complacent, and vulnerable to a faster, leaner rival. The Chinese EV invasion has begun, and unless the West accelerates innovation and cuts costs dramatically, it may soon find itself fighting for relevance in an industry it once owned.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6908b9b95c59d1cbb22e569a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-03 12:13:02.907567

We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

THOUSANDS OF JOBS LOST — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: New York has lost more than 6,500 clean energy jobs and $2.5 billion in investments as a result of federal energy policies, Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters Friday.

Nearly 159,000 jobs and $52 billion in investment have been lost or delayed, impacting more than 300 energy projects across 34 states, according to a new report from the advocacy group Climate Power. Meanwhile, household energy prices have risen 11 percent on average since President Donald Trump took office.

“There’s no such thing as a Democratic job or Republican job,” said Brent Booker, president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America. “To hear this White House, this president … talking about, ‘We’re going to cancel Democratic jobs’ — that’s un-American.”

Booker said some of LIUNA’s members voted for Trump, but did not vote for losing their jobs.

“The chaos that’s coming out of Washington … is no strategy for energy independence. It’s no strategy for energy dominance,” Booker said.

A White House spokesperson pushed back against the report, stating that Trump is restoring jobs in coal, natural gas and nuclear.

“The president has also brought in trillions in investments through historic trade and peace deals, which have a significant focus on energy partnerships,” the spokesperson said. “By unleashing American energy, President Trump is lowering costs and securing investments that don’t need to be subsidized by taxpayer dollars.”

However, the coal, natural gas and nuclear sectors have benefited from government subsidies and tax breaks for decades. Between 1950 and 2016, coal received $112 billion and natural gas received $140 billion in federal incentives, according to a 2017 Nuclear Energy Institute report.

ATLANTIC OFF THE DRILLING TABLE — POLITICO’s Ben Lefebvre: The Interior Department has removed the federal waters off the Atlantic coast from President Donald Trump’s upcoming offshore drilling plan after Republicans in the region pressed to keep oil and natural gas rigs away from their shores, three people familiar with the latest moves told POLITICO.

The five-year leasing plan, aimed at reopening areas long closed to drilling, will still seek to allow rigs off the California coast, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations. That could create a conflict with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is trying to raise his national political profile in a state that opposes offshore drilling but also has some of the highest gasoline prices in the country.

The plan’s latest iteration will also include a portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico but provide a buffer around Florida, a Republican stronghold where politicians from both parties have long opposed drilling, these people said. It’s unclear whether the buffer would be large enough to avoid fierce objections from Floridians, who have battled against similar proposals in past decades because of fears that an oil spill would devastate their tourism economy.

What you may have missed

ON TO COURT: Nonprofits, homeowners and conservationist groups banded together to sue the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for reissuing a certificate FERC had granted in 2019 for the Northeast Supply Enhancement gas pipeline, Transco’s vacated project that spans across New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

This comes after plaintiffs filed a rehearing request in September urging FERC to reconsider the certification and for Transco to submit a new application that takes into account the current environmental impacts the pipeline would pose.

The groups argue in the suit that “there is no legal basis” for Transco to request the certificate’s reissuance because FERC had previously vacated the certificate in 2024, deeming the project “legally ‘dead.’” And since Transco’s application is now outdated, the request is not consistent with FERC standards, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Natural Gas Act.

Moneen Nasmith, Earthjustice’s director of national climate and fossil fuel infrastructure, called the certificate’s reissuance “a bunch of sorcery.”

“FERC doesn’t have the power to reanimate a zombie gas pipeline that the company abandoned years ago,” she added. “It can’t make up for its lack of statutory authority by pretending like nothing has changed in the more than six years since FERC last reviewed the project.” — Isa Dominguez

ADK BALLOT QUESTION AT RISK — POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney: The lone statewide ballot question this year will ask New York voters if they want to allow skiing and trail facilities on a 1,039-acre section of the Adirondack Park in exchange for 2,500 acres of new forest land. There’s no significant opposition to the amendment — but it’s not guaranteed to pass.

FUNDING PARKS: New York City allocates 1.2 percent of its total budget, or $1.4 billion, for parks in its fiscal year 2026 budget, according to a new report from the Citizen’s Budget Commission. That totals 1.6 percent of the city-funded budget (excluding certain state and federal funds).

But only 0.6 percent of the budget goes to the Department of Parks and Recreation for operations and maintenance, not including things like Parks employees fringe benefits, pension contributions and debt service.

While the share of city budget spending has held relatively steady for decades, the share of spending on supporting parks’ daily operations have declined three-fold from 2004 to 2024, according to the report.

The push for 1 percent: For decades, a coalition of advocates, including New Yorkers for Parks, New York League of Conservation Voters and District Council 37, have pushed a “1 percent for Parks” campaign in an effort to increase funding for parks.

Other major U.S. cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago dedicate 1.5 percent to 4 percent of their budgets, according to a report from New Yorkers for Parks.

“The CBC research confirms that the city only spends 0.6 percent of the budget on our parks operations and maintenance,” said Adam Ganser, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks. “[It] really calls attention to the fact that that budget hasn’t grown as a percentage in decades, despite the fact that we have many more residents living in New York City.”

The CBC thinks that things like pensions should be included in estimates of the city’s parks budget.

“The full cost … for the parks and recreational facilities that New Yorkers enjoy includes fringe benefits, includes pensions, and it includes debt service,” said Ana Champeny, CBC’s vice president for research. “We’re also trying to give folks a more complete picture of the resources.” — Mona Zhang

CLIMATE CONUNDRUM: Gov. Kathy Hochul plans to appeal a judge’s order to issue emissions regulations — and she again wants lawmakers to consider changes to New York’s landmark 2019 climate law.

“We’ll sit down with the Legislature. We have time to work it out,” Hochul said at a press conference.

An Albany County judge ruled that Hochul’s administration violated New York’s climate law by failing to issue regulations to cut emissions by January 2024. Environmental advocates sued earlier this year to force the state to take action.

Several environmental groups hailed the ruling, calling for Hochul to release regulations she halted this year that would put a declining limit on emissions and charge for pollution. Some of the money raised would be directed to rebates for lower-income New Yorkers

“The ruling is incredibly promising,” said Justin Balik, states vice president with Evergreen Action. “If implemented properly, this is a program that can lower costs for New Yorkers.”

Democratic state Sen. Liz Krueger, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, preemptively rejected Hochul’s overture on the climate law. The Legislature also rebuffed Hochul’s effort to change the climate law in 2023.

“I just can’t see that there will be any appetite in the Senate to kneecap [the law] this session,” Krueger said. “But there is definitely an appetite to implement critical affordability policies and investments to bring down New Yorkers’ utility costs while at the same time meeting our reality-based climate targets.”

The state has 30 days to file an appeal. That could buy the Hochul administration more time — the judge ordered regulations by Feb. 6.

Hochul said the judge didn’t understand how different circumstances are now compared to when the law was passed. She said private companies the state is relying on to build renewables aren’t as interested after the elimination of federal tax credits.

“There’s been less interest than there was perhaps in 2019 when this was enacted, not by us, but by the industries that make it happen,” said the governor. — Marie J. French

ENERGY MOVES: Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, a pro-gas group that previously organized a panel at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s annual conference that got some pushback, is gearing up to get more involved in New York. Former Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy, who currently heads up the Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce, and former Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr., are joining the group’s leadership council. Diaz is also co-chair of Actum, a political consulting firm employed by Natural Allies. The pro-gas group has ties to Williams Co., which is seeking approval for two pipelines in New York.

RELIABILITY WORRIES MEET COST CONCERNS: The state’s independent grid operator is advancing a reliability report set to trigger changes to planning aimed at shoring up New York’s electric system. A key New York Independent System Operator committee on Wednesday advanced the Comprehensive Reliability Plan that raises concerns about the ability of the grid to meet growing demand over the next decade. The report doesn’t find a reliability need that will require near-term action — which NYISO officials and some other market participants view as a potential problem. (A shorter-term reliability assessment has triggered a solicitation for anticipated shortfalls downstate as some peaker power plants filed to retire due to state environmental regulations.)

The report recommends the grid operator change its process for next year’s Reliability Needs Assessment. The potential changes — which would be worked out over the coming months and are subject to more debate — make it more likely that assessment will spur action to get additional generation online or take other steps to address potential supply shortfalls. NYISO officials want to be able to consider a range of “plausible scenarios” — like more large data centers coming online quickly or more of the state’s aging fossil fuel plants retiring — in their planning.

“We must implement a more proactive and expanded framework,” said Ross Altman, senior manager for reliability planning at NYISO, during Wednesday’s meeting. “Given the amount of risk that we’re finding with, again, all the assumptions we make on transmission, demand and resources, both existing and new, we find that really we shouldn’t be just having that one set of base case assumptions.” NYISO officials are also worried about relying too heavily on emergency operating procedures to maintain reliability, raising concerns that this might not be effective in the long term given other system constraints.

Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration shares the NYISO’s reliability concerns and has advanced policies open to gas plant repowerings to meet electricity demand as part of the draft state energy plan. NYSERDA supported adoption of the reliability report on Wednesday.

Not everyone is happy about the proposed changes. The Natural Resources Defense Council voted against the report. Some parties abstained, including Earthjustice, New York City, a group representing large energy users and the New York Utility Intervention Unit, which advocates for consumers. NRDC’s Chris Casey said NYISO was focusing too heavily on “worst-case scenarios” that are unlikely to materialize. Earthjustice’s Michael Lenoff also raised concerns about the push to act quickly on NYISO’s reliability concerns given the potential costs. “Maybe don’t go down this road,” Lenoff said. Or ensure it’s done in a “careful and cautious manner so that you’re not imposing exorbitant costs on New Yorkers to unnecessarily plan for worst-case scenarios,” he said.

Potomac Economics, the NYISO’s independent external market monitor, also raised some concerns — including about potential costs for consumers — in comments on the reliability report. Potomac’s Pallas LeeVanSchaick said the gap between what resources NYISO’s markets incentivizes and its planning processes find are needed will grow with the proposed changes. The adoption of “plausible scenarios” could result in retaining more generation capacity than is needed to supply demand either through market changes or out-of-market contracts, he said. “There are obviously ways to do that, but that would be very costly to consumers,” the market monitor said. He suggested that the NYISO should reconsider some assumptions about demand growth and generator retirements since those would be responsive to rising costs.

LeeVanSchaick also said NYISO should account for the likelihood that state policymakers will be sensitive to potential cost concerns and could slow electrification policies due to reliability concerns, easing pressure on the system. Hochul’s administration has already moved in this direction by giving school districts more time to comply with electric school bus mandates, delaying enforcement of clean car sales rules and consideration of a delay of electric building requirements.

The market monitor also said there’s concern about NYISO’s desire to reduce reliance on emergency procedures in its planning. “To just pretend that they don’t exist, or arbitrarily disregard their impact, is going to ultimately cause you to gold plate the system. It’s going to result in a lot of excess costs,” he said. NYISO should provide a clear rationale for why the grid operator wants to avoid emergency procedures, LeeVanSchaick added.

The NYISO’s board of directors is expected to finalize the Comprehensive Reliability Plan next month, kicking off more discussion of how to implement changes to the grid operator’s planning process. There are also plans to consider other changes to the markets to better align them with these reliability concerns, which several generator representative and others raised during the discussion. — Marie J. French

SUPPORT FOR GAS: Most New Jersey voters support building new natural gas power plants, according to a new poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University and the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey. The poll found that 64 percent of voters support new natural gas plants, while 22 percent think that the state should wait for other options.

Support, however, fell along partisan lines: Nearly 90 percent of Republicans support new natural gas plants, while only 46 percent of Democrats support them. Still, they outnumbered the 33 percent of Democrats who said that they oppose building new natural gas plants. — Mona Zhang",https://static.politico.com/3d/ee/f4d549cf4e548af6712990ce5b9e/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 11:09:08.938901

“Does Regulation Distort Exit Decisions?” Energy Institute Blog, November 3, 2025, https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2025/11/03/does-regulation-distort-exit-decisions/ —","New study shows regulated coal and gas units were 45% less likely to exit between 2011 and 2023.

(Today’s post is co-authored by Paige Weber.)

Hundreds of power plants have closed in the United States since 2010, including 130+ gigawatts of coal and 50+ gigawatts of natural gas. These exit decisions have important implications for electricity markets, grid reliability, and the environment.

A new Energy Institute working paper highlights the potential for regulation to distort this type of exit decision. Energy Institute Faculty Affiliate Paige Weber and I analyze 14 years of generator-level data to see whether exit behavior differs between investor-owned utilities, publicly-owned utilities, and independent power producers.

—

Ownership Mix

We include in the analysis all U.S. coal and gas units that were operating in 2010. As the figure below illustrates, this capacity was owned by a rich mix of investor-owned utilities (IOU), publicly-owned utilities (POU), and independent power producers (IPP).

—

Early Retirement for IPPs?

The table below shows the average age at retirement for regulated and unregulated units. For this table we define “regulated” as including both IOUs and POUs.

For the hundreds of regulated coal units that retired between 2011 and 2023, the average age at retirement was 55. For unregulated coal units, the average age was only 49. So unregulated coal units retired 6 years earlier on average .

The pattern goes in the same direction for natural gas. Regulated gas units retired at an average age of 47, compared to only 39 for unregulated gas units. So unregulated gas units retired 8 years earlier on average.

—

Controlling for Other Factors

The paper then turns to a hazard model that allows us to compare exit rates for regulated versus unregulated units, while controlling for other factors that affect exit behavior. Hazard models are useful for studying how different factors impact the time to an event, in this case, the time from entry to retirement. In our full specification, we control for unit capacity (e.g., 200MW), technology (e.g., combined cycle), vintage (e.g., built in the 1980s), and regional economic trends (NERC region).

You have to go to the paper if you want all the details, but here are the main takeaways:

Results are similar with and without controls.

Regulated units were 45% less likely to exit than unregulated units.

This pattern is similar for coal and gas.

The pattern is similar for IOUs and POUs. Both IOUs and POUs were much less likely to exit than IPPs.

The figure below shows the results visually. The black and blue lines show the cumulative probability of retirement for unregulated versus regulated units. For example, 60 years after opening, 39% of regulated units have exited, compared to 64% of unregulated units. This is a big difference, implying a difference in age at retirement of 8.4 years.

—

Mechanisms and Implications

Why is this happening? We interpret the results in the paper by pointing out that regulated and unregulated companies have very different incentives. Unregulated companies, i.e., IPPs, make exit decisions based on wholesale electricity prices, ongoing capital costs, and other standard market-based economic factors. In contrast, regulated companies are largely insulated from these factors and instead subject to the preferences and priorities of local regulators.

For IOUs, there is also a guaranteed rate-of-return, which creates in some cases a strong incentive to make and maintain capital-intensive equipment. Studies by economists have shown that IOUs tend to prefer capital-intensive technologies (e.g. here, here, and here). But whereas previous studies have mostly focused on new investments, our paper emphasizes that this same regulatory distortion also affects exit decisions.

We also tested whether regulated units were less likely to exit in states that are major producers of coal or natural gas. Our hypothesis was that in states like Wyoming, West Virginia, and Kentucky with significant coal production, you would expect to have coal producers exerting political pressure on state politicians and regulators to keep coal plants open. We do not find any evidence of this type of “regulatory capture”, but we would be very interested if readers have other ideas for how to test for the role of local priorities and preferences.

From Surplus to Shortage

Since 2024, the fortunes for U.S. power companies have changed dramatically. The increased demand for electricity from data centers has shifted the market overnight from surplus to shortage and left companies scrambling to add new capacity. One of the implications of this dramatic reversal is that units that did not exit in 2011-2023 are now more likely to remain open for the foreseeable future.

Moving forward, we are likely to also see a reversal of exit behavior, with unregulated units being less likely to exit than regulated units. There will also be pressure to keep regulated units operating, but it remains to be seen whether this pressure will be as strong as the profit motive for unregulated units. The broader point is that the effect of regulation on exit decisions can be either positive or negative, but that we should expect regulated companies to be at least partially insulated from whatever current economic conditions may be.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — November 3, 2025 — A new report from the STAT Network reveals that extreme weather events are jeopardizing the health, safety and economic prospects of Americans. Published today in partnership with the Federation of American Scientists and supported by The Rockefeller Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the report reveals first-of-its-kind data from state public health officials in 45 states and territories on the urgent need for state-led coordination. The report also spotlights innovations that are being adopted and scaled through the STAT Network despite drastic cuts in federal funding to public health.

“States are navigating a new normal of extreme weather crises—heat waves following floods, wildfires overlapping with hurricanes—while the federal support and data tools they’ve relied on are eroding. No state should be left to shoulder this alone. Through our Extreme Weather & Health group and this report, we elevate what’s working on the ground as states are leading the response and offer a practical roadmap for acting at the speed and complexity of today’s hazards” said Stefanie Friedhoff, Professor of the Practice and STAT Network Lead, Brown University School of Public Health.

The STAT Network, which supports state public health officials across a range of pressing public health issues, started a dedicated extreme weather and health group in August 2024, serving as an essential connection point for collective problem solving in a shifting landscape. Of 136 state respondents who participated in the STAT Extreme Weather & Health survey shared with states in summer 2025:

“Extreme weather events are no longer just natural disasters—they’re public health emergencies. From heat waves that overwhelm hospitals to floods that cut off access to care, Americans are feeling the strain in their communities. That’s why The Rockefeller Foundation launched the STAT Network at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic—to strengthen public health infrastructure through interstate collaboration and cross-sector partnerships. That same level of coordination is just as critical today as we face growing threats to health, safety, and economic opportunity” said Derek Kilmer, Senior Vice President for U.S. Program and Policy, The Rockefeller Foundation.

“One in three Americans report being personally affected by extreme weather in just the past two years – illustrating that extreme weather has become extremely common. The good news is that the negative health impacts of extreme weather are largely preventable. FAS is excited to partner with the STAT Network to help states step up as the federal government steps back, putting in place the innovative, evidence-based strategies we need to protect people and communities across the country,” said Dr. Hannah Safford Associate Director of Climate and Environment, Federation of American Scientists.

A changed landscape

Protecting the Health of Americans describes how extreme weather events have become more frequent, severe and widespread. From wildfires that quickly spiraled out of control in Maui and Los Angeles, to illness from extreme heat overloading emergency rooms across the Southwest, to sudden flash flooding from Hurricane Helene catching entire regions off-guard across Appalachia, it is clear that existing playbooks are no longer sufficient to respond to rapidly evolving threats. At the same time, cuts in 2025 at the Centers for Disease Control, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Weather Service and other federal agencies have removed the backbone of funding, data and technical assistance many states relied on.

States lead the way

Summarizing ongoing preparedness and response efforts across states, Protecting the Health of Americans offers three pillars for action and shares concrete, replicable examples that emerge from the STAT Extreme Weather & Health Network:

Collaboration. States like Minnesota and California are embedding public health voices in climate and infrastructure decisions, while North Carolina and Texas have demonstrated that shared frameworks like FEMA’s Community Lifelines can unite health, energy and emergency systems under one coordinated response. Partnerships break down silos and accelerate action.

Data. In North Carolina, advanced modeling now informs heat alerts based on real-time health and climate data; Illinois is developing predictive tools that warn hospitals before storms hit; and Alaska’s Local Environment Observer Network turns community observations into early-warning intelligence. States are making data more interoperable, localized and actionable.

Communication. Massachusetts amplified risk messaging on Triple E and West Nile via medical providers, community groups and local media. California is co-developing an interactive curriculum with community health workers on responding to poor air quality events. Kansas convenes a cross-sector Extreme Weather Events Work Group with community-based organizations to co-create practical toolkits. States are modernizing their communications capacity, building trusted messenger networks and moving past an over-focus on social media outreach.

The new report also includes case examples from states such as Oregon, Arizona and Texas that illustrate how housing insecurity, energy burden, medical dependence on electricity, and lack of access to timely, trusted information add additional burden for low-income, elderly and rural populations—and how systems-level interventions focused on energy resilience, targeted mitigation and partnerships with community-based organizations can save lives.

Insights from this report can serve as a pathway to building community resilience and protecting health from the impacts of extreme weather. Looking ahead, the STAT Network, the Federation of American Scientists and other collaborators look forward to working with state leaders and their partners to translate this roadmap into sustained progress.

The announcement comes ahead of the STAT Network’s participation in The Rockefeller Foundation and Heartland Forward’s “Big Bets for America” convening in Oklahoma City, where leaders across the public, private, and non-profit sectors will discuss opportunities to help communities flourish.

About the STAT Extreme Weather & Health sub-network and this report

The STAT Extreme Weather and Health Group was created in August 2024 and meets monthly. Over 480 state officials from public health, preparedness and related departments in 45 states and some countries have attended these sessions over the past year. Between May and July 2025, the Network also fielded a comprehensive Extreme Weather and Health survey, which yielded 136 responses (78% from state officials, 10% from local health officials, and 12% from federal, academic and other partners to state teams). Responses came from 34 states, with near equal participation across the political spectrum. The STAT team also met individually with state- and county-level teams in more than 25 states for in-depth conversations about ongoing response needs and innovations. Protecting the Health of Americans summarizes findings across overall network presentations and discussions, the dedicated state-level survey, and state-level interviews.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/fas-hiring.png,N,,2025-11-03 11:10:48.625851

The financing is guaranteed by the Spanish export credit agency, Cesce. This transaction with Iberdrola marks the inaugural use of a guarantee developed by the EIB and Cesce, to support green projects led by Spanish companies outside Spain, contributing to the European Union's climate action and environmental sustainability objectives.

The new project will generate clean energy for thousands of homes, accelerate Europe’s electrification and energy security, driving new employment, economic opportunity, and state-of-the-art renewable energy innovation.

Windanker will contribute 315 MW of offshore wind capacity—enough to supply renewable electricity to 600,000 people every year according to Iberdrola estimates.

""EIB’s €500 million financing for Windanker helps bring cutting-edge wind power technology to the Baltic Sea for the benefit of German consumers and local economies. The green electricity generated by the project will also take us closer towards securing Europe’s independence from fossil fuel imports,” said EIB Director General of Financing and Advisory Operations within the European Union Jean-Christophe Laloux.

""With this loan, Iberdrola not only strengthens its financial structure and diversifies its sources of financing but also consolidates the confidence of leading institutions such as the EIB and Cesce in our ability to deliver. This backing allows us to continue promoting projects such as Windanker, which is key to electrification, in line with our new transformation plan,” said José Sainz Armada Iberdrola's Chief Finance, Control and Corporate Development Officer.

Beatriz Reguero, area director for State Accounts at Cesce, said “Cesce is proud to support Spain’s leading companies as they drive the energy transition across Europe. The Windanker offshore wind farm demonstrates how long-term partnerships with public institutions like the European Investment Bank and Cesce can expand the capacity to support and back projects by Spanish companies that promote innovation and sustainable investment in projects that benefit local communities, strengthen economic growth and promote renewable energy for the future.”

The project is part of TechEU the EIB Group’s programme to accelerate EU innovation which aims to mobilise €250 billion in investments by 2027 for startups, scale-ups and innovative companies across Europe. Specifically, the project will contribute to the cleantech line of action of TechEU.

By increasing the share of clean energy in Germany’s grid, the project directly supports European and national goals to reduce carbon emissions, cut reliance on fossil fuels, and meet ambitious climate targets. Thereby the project is a strong contributor to EIB Group’s climate action objectives set out in the Group’s Strategic Roadmap for 2024-2027 and the Climate Bank Roadmap Phase 2 for 2026-2030 as well as the EIB action plan to support REPowerEU, the programme to increase energy security and speed up the energy transition by reducing the European Union’s dependence on fossil fuel imports.

State-of-the-art renewable energy for Germany

Windanker sets new standards for offshore wind technology, deploying 21 Siemens Gamesa SG 14-236 DD turbines, each up to 15 MW—among the most advanced and powerful offshore wind turbines globally.

These turbines feature a groundbreaking 236-meter rotor and direct drive technology, increasing reliability and operational performance, and enabling over 30% more annual energy production compared to previous models. Innovative engineering and construction techniques are applied throughout the farm to ensure maximum efficiency, safety, and sustainability.

The foundations, up to 84 meters long and up to 2,100 tons in weight, are being installed by Van Oord’s Svanen vessel. Construction started earlier this month with the installation of the first monopile. Turbine installation will follow in 2026, with full commissioning expected in the fourth quarter of 2026.

Supporting skilled green jobs in a cohesion region

Located in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, an EU Transition Region, the project will deliver a major economic contribution to the region, with around 2,200 person-years of employment generated during construction and up to 160 skilled permanent jobs sustained by ongoing operations.

The majority of new roles will emphasize technical “green skills,” fostering long-term local expertise and workforce development while reinforcing industrial cooperation between Germany and Spain.

Financing structure and guarantees

Windanker is Iberdrola’s third major offshore wind development in the German Baltic Sea and marks a significant step forward for the company’s Baltic Hub strategy.

The €500 million financing to Iberdrola is backed by a guarantee from the Spanish export credit agency Cesce, ensuring robust security for stakeholders.

Project contribution and sustainability

As a major contributor to Europe’s REPowerEU initiative and Germany’s National Energy and Climate Plan, the Windanker project will help accelerate the country’s energy transition, reduce carbon emissions by an estimated 672,000 tons CO2 annually, and support the national target to achieve 80% renewable share in electricity by 2030.

The majority of the renewable electricity generated will be traded through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) on the German market.

On Dec. 31, 2025, federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire. American Home Shield breaks down what is changing and how homeowners can ensure they lock in savings before the end of the year.

What was the Inflation Reduction Act?

The IRA of 2022 was a landmark act designed to address climate change by investing in clean energy and manufacturing through tax incentives, grants, and loan programs.

Tax credits authorized by the IRA have helped everyday American households and businesses afford energy-efficient upgrades, including HVAC systems and other big-ticket items.

According to Energy Star, homeowners can claim 30% of project costs up to $2,000 for qualifying energy efficiency home improvements like heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves, or up to $1,200 for qualifying water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and central AC units.

What has changed?

The IRA's federal tax incentives for energy-efficient installations and upgrades were originally supposed to last until 2032, but the federal government is ending them early. The program will now expire on Dec. 31.

There is now only a limited time left for homeowners to take advantage of these tax credits.

Why is it important to act now?

Qualifying HVAC systems must be purchased and installed by Dec. 31. Documentation is key - homeowners should keep invoices or receipts with dates, contractor plans and permits. They should be able to clearly show when the work was completed and when the service was turned on so that if audited, they can prove it was finished by the end of 2025.

What are some signs an HVAC needs to be replaced?

Even the highest quality HVACs will need to be replaced at some point, making the expiring federal tax credits even more valuable to act on now.

""AC units typically last 10 to 15 years. If homeowners know their unit is getting close to that timeframe, or there are signs of decline, they should start researching replacements,"" said Micah Sherman, a virtual HVAC expert with American Home Shield.

""A few signs to look out for include strange sounds coming from the unit, hot or cold spots in the house, or refrigerant leaks. Sometimes the cost of repairing these problems warrants considering a new system altogether,"" said Sherman.

The end of the federal tax credits program is a change consumers need to be aware of, but if they act quickly, there is still time to capture savings before it expires.

A changed landscape

Protecting Americans’ Health describes how extreme weather events have become more frequent, severe and widespread. From wildfires that quickly spiraled out of control in Maui and Los Angeles, to illness from extreme heat overloading emergency rooms across the Southwest, to sudden flash flooding from Hurricane Helene catching entire regions off-guard across Appalachia, it is clear that existing playbooks are no longer sufficient to respond to rapidly evolving threats. At the same time, cuts in 2025 at the Centers for Disease Control, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Weather Service and other federal agencies have removed the backbone of funding, data and technical assistance many states relied on.

States lead the way

Summarizing ongoing preparedness and response efforts across states, Protecting Americans’ Health offers three pillars for action and shares concrete, replicable examples that emerge from the STAT Extreme Weather & Health Network:

Collaboration. States like Minnesota and California are embedding public health voices in climate and infrastructure decisions, while North Carolina and Texas have demonstrated that shared frameworks like FEMA’s Community Lifelines can unite health, energy and emergency systems under one coordinated response. Partnerships break down silos and accelerate action.

Data. In North Carolina, advanced modeling now informs heat alerts based on real-time health and climate data; Illinois is developing predictive tools that warn hospitals before storms hit; and Alaska’s Local Environment Observer Network turns community observations into early-warning intelligence. States are making data more interoperable, localized and actionable.

Communication. Massachusetts amplified risk messaging on Triple E and West Nile via medical providers, community groups and local media. California is co-developing an interactive curriculum with community health workers on responding to poor air quality events. Kansas convenes a cross-sector Extreme Weather Events Work Group with community-based organizations to co-create practical toolkits. States are modernizing their communications capacity, building trusted messenger networks and moving past an over-focus on social media outreach.

The new report also includes case examples from states such as Oregon, Arizona and Texas that illustrate how housing insecurity, energy burden, medical dependence on electricity, and lack of access to timely, trusted information add additional burden for low-income, elderly and rural populations — and how systems-level interventions focused on energy resilience, targeted mitigation and partnerships with community-based organizations can save lives.

Insights from this report can serve as a pathway to building community resilience and protecting health from the impacts of extreme weather. Looking ahead, the STAT Network, the Federation of American Scientists and other collaborators look forward to working with state leaders and their partners to translate this roadmap into sustained progress.

The announcement comes ahead of the STAT Network’s participation in The Rockefeller Foundation and Heartland Forward’s “Big Bets for America” convening in Oklahoma City, where leaders across the public, private, and non-profit sectors will discuss opportunities to help communities flourish.

On Dec. 31, 2025, federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire. American Home Shield breaks down what is changing and how homeowners can ensure they lock in savings before the end of the year.

What was the Inflation Reduction Act?

The IRA of 2022 was a landmark act designed to address climate change by investing in clean energy and manufacturing through tax incentives, grants, and loan programs.

Tax credits authorized by the IRA have helped everyday American households and businesses afford energy-efficient upgrades, including HVAC systems and other big-ticket items.

According to Energy Star, homeowners can claim 30% of project costs up to $2,000 for qualifying energy efficiency home improvements like heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves, or up to $1,200 for qualifying water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and central AC units.

What has changed?

The IRA’s federal tax incentives for energy-efficient installations and upgrades were originally supposed to last until 2032, but the federal government is ending them early. The program will now expire on Dec. 31.

There is now only a limited time left for homeowners to take advantage of these tax credits.

Why is it important to act now?

Qualifying HVAC systems must be purchased and installed by Dec. 31. Documentation is key — homeowners should keep invoices or receipts with dates, contractor plans and permits. They should be able to clearly show when the work was completed and when the service was turned on so that if audited, they can prove it was finished by the end of 2025.

What are some signs an HVAC needs to be replaced?

Even the highest quality HVACs will need to be replaced at some point, making the expiring federal tax credits even more valuable to act on now.

“AC units typically last 10 to 15 years. If homeowners know their unit is getting close to that timeframe, or there are signs of decline, they should start researching replacements,” said Micah Sherman, a virtual HVAC expert with American Home Shield.

“A few signs to look out for include strange sounds coming from the unit, hot or cold spots in the house, or refrigerant leaks. Sometimes the cost of repairing these problems warrants considering a new system altogether,” said Sherman.

The end of the federal tax credits program is a change consumers need to be aware of, but if they act quickly, there is still time to capture savings before it expires.

Growth Energy’s comments encouraged EPA to finalize the supplemental proposal it released in September. This would ensure that the agency accounts for every lost biofuel gallon exempted by EPA’s August 2025 decision to grant several SREs for the 2023-2025 Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) compliance years. The comments also highlight the legal obligation EPA has to fully reallocate these gallons and the negative impacts to the industry and the rural economy if EPA decides to not reallocate, or to reallocate only a portion of the exempted volumes.

“Reallocating every exempted gallon is not just the right thing to do, or the smartest thing to do for the market — it’s also what the law clearly requires,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “EPA and this Administration made a promise to rural America to get the RFS back on track — reallocating any less than 100% of all the 2023-2025 SREs EPA has granted would break that promise, and farmers and rural communities would suffer because of it. We urge EPA to commit to full reallocation, and we look forward to continuing our work with the agency to increase American energy dominance through the increased use of homegrown biofuels.”

Background

Under the RFS, EPA sets the number of gallons of renewable fuels (such as biofuels) that must be blended into the nation’s total fuel supply each year. Those obligations apply to fuel producers (petroleum refiners) and importers. The law also allows EPA to grant SREs in rare circumstances when a refiner demonstrates “disproportionate economic hardship” in its efforts to comply with the RFS.

On August 22, 2025, the EPA released its decision on 175 pending SRE petitions, covering compliance years 2016-2024. In all, EPA approved a total of 140 petitions: 63 full exemptions and 77 partial (50%) exemptions.

EPA also announced that it would release a supplemental proposal to its proposed Set 2 RVO to reallocate exempt SRE gallons from 2023-2025 compliance years to the 2026 and 2027 compliance years covered by Set 2. Under this approach, refiners will be required to make up for lost gallons from those years, ensuring that SREs don’t compromise renewable fuel demand.",,N,,2025-11-03 11:09:45.209692

Career education in the skilled trades | KUNC,"Rae Solomon, www.kunc.org, rae-solomon",,,,,https://www.kunc.org/news/2025-11-03/the-latest-climate-solution-for-rural-colorado-career-education-in-the-skilled-trades,"This is the first story in a three-part series, ‘Greener Pastures,’ which explores climate workforce development in rural Colorado.
It’s part of a massive push by Colorado Mountain College to establish a local skilled trades workforce training system.
“What we hope to build with (Colorado Mountain College) is a resource here up in the mountains that (students) can still go home every night.
“We know that our rural communities are experiencing the impacts of climate change at an accelerated rate,” said Elizabeth Harbaugh, vice president of Lyra Colorado, a Northwest Colorado nonprofit in the education and climate space.
According to Harbaugh, that's why it’s important for these communities to be engaged in climate solutions, like training the emerging climate workforce.","This is the first story in a three-part series, ‘Greener Pastures,’ which explores climate workforce development in rural Colorado.

Coloradans take pride in knowing our mountain towns are little slices of paradise. But apparently, even heaven needs its industrial zones. In the town of Eagle, that's where you'll find the headquarters for R & H Mechanical, a building systems contractor serving the High Country, in a metal-sided building tucked in next to I-70.

On the upper level, service manager and instructor Josh McCarrel stood at the front of a long, narrow room that read like a cross between a classroom and a maintenance closet. Boilers, furnaces and exposed piping crowded the whiteboards and desks. But the odd design of the space suited his purpose well as a training facility for emerging HVAC technicians.

In this Level 1 HVAC course, McCarrel was lecturing about the basics of electricity.

“So, ‘AC’ stands for…. Anybody?” McCarrel prompted his class.

“Alternating current,” several students droned.

“Alternating current. Yes,” McCarrel confirmed. “’DC’ stands for…?”

“Direct Current,” the students responded.

In this simple way, McCarrel was laying the groundwork for his students to understand the complex world of heating and cooling technology. In a few months, they will turn their attention to working with heat pumps—super energy-efficient heating and cooling systems powered by electricity instead of natural gas.

Andrea Anderson, who works as a quotes administrator for R & H, was taking the class to improve her skills on the job. She planned to continue her studies through the end of the 4-unit course and expected a nice pay bump after mastering the material.

“When I started, I really knew nothing about heating and air conditioning,” Anderson said. “Over the years I’ve learned a lot. But now I just want to learn some more.”

Anderson and her classmates aren't just earning credentials and building their careers. According to Megan Christensen, the climate workforce development manager at the Colorado Energy Office, they are also becoming part of the state's big picture plan to combat climate change.

“Colorado is committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 2050,” Christensen told KUNC. “The state has a concrete multi-sector climate action plan to achieve this goal, which includes climate workforce development.”

In fact, Christensen said, getting more skilled tradespeople trained up is one of the top climate workforce priorities for the state of Colorado.

“In almost every single energy and climate action that our state has, the skilled trades are super essential to making sure that work gets done,” she said.

Talent in the high country

The skilled tradespeople needed for that essential climate workforce are in particularly short supply in Colorado’s High Country, and McCarrel’s HVAC Tech class is among the first major efforts to change that. It’s part of a massive push by Colorado Mountain College to establish a local skilled trades workforce training system.

“Up here in the mountains, the choice (has been) either to go to Denver or Grand Junction for a trade school,” McCarrel said. “What we hope to build with (Colorado Mountain College) is a resource here up in the mountains that (students) can still go home every night. They can maybe keep their job and get some formal training in a trade that is in high demand.”

It’s an important goal for Tim Braun, the vice president of operations at R & H Mechanical.

“Here in the mountains, it's been challenging to find new talent,” Braun said. “So, we have to grow our own.”

The company was so eager to grow their own talent that they partnered with the college to build the HVAC Tech course series McCarrel has been teaching, which provides graduates with nationally recognized credentials. Braun said he’s eager to hire technicians who have the advanced skills being taught in the classroom, like replacing gas-burning heating and cooling systems with heat pumps.

“There's been a big gap in our workforce development that we need to pick up,” Braun said. “More talent to be able to help with that transition in the future.”

Jim Jones, program director for skilled crafts and trades at Colorado Mountain College, is the force behind the school’s new, robust skilled trades program, which also includes pathways in automotive, welding, carpentry and ski area operations.

“Over the last several years, the institution has essentially grown its trades department 700%,” he told KUNC.

The trades courses have become so popular that there are now waitlists to enroll, and Jones has big plans to more than double capacity.

“We're broadening our reach for trades across the Central Rockies,” Jones said. “That's the call right now of the mountain communities. We're all looking for more tradesmen and women to take care of our mountain communities.”

The program wouldn’t just supply mountain towns with the climate workforce they desperately need. It would also supply more graduates with career paths that are lucrative and sustainable in notoriously expensive areas like Eagle Valley.

“You name the trade and there's people hiring and the pay is good,” Jones said. “From HVAC to automotive, to carpentry, to welding, all wages have gone up tremendously, just due to the fact that there's a severe shortage of workforce.”

Climate change as a rural issue

Developing a robust climate workforce is essential in Colorado’s rural areas because of the region’s high exposure to the effects of a warming climate.

“We know that our rural communities are experiencing the impacts of climate change at an accelerated rate,” said Elizabeth Harbaugh, vice president of Lyra Colorado, a Northwest Colorado nonprofit in the education and climate space. “It’s an issue that is impacting all parts of life and their economies.”

After all, Harbaugh pointed out, the state’s rural communities revolve around agriculture and outdoor recreation.

“We work with ranchers up in Northwest Colorado who can speak very openly about the lack of water and how that's changed their outputs over the past 10 years,” Harbaugh said. “Then when you talk about recreation, snowpack is a huge issue.”

The natural resources threatened by drought, excessive heat and wildfires don't just power rural economies, they define the region's culture and identity. According to Harbaugh, that's why it’s important for these communities to be engaged in climate solutions, like training the emerging climate workforce.

“Living and working in those communities means understanding the impacts that climate change is having,” she said. “Green jobs and green skills are that next frontier of understanding what it's going to take for all jobs to adapt in the face of a changing climate.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05cd45c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3684x1934+0+342/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2Fdc%2F540532744cdfab8c989e619bd1b3%2Fimg-2433-edit.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:24.157047

With continuous innovation in high-efficiency solar cells and expanding renewable targets worldwide, solar power manufacturing remains a promising and future-ready investment avenue.","Solar power is the use of sunlight energy to generate electric power from photovoltaic cells or concentrated solar power. It is one of the cleanest and least variable forms of renewable energy available and helps people rely less on fossil fuels. Solar panels perform conversion of sunlight directly to direct current (DC) electricity. Then the direct current's conversion happens to alternating current (AC) electricity for use in homes, industry and commercial buildings. This technology has become popular due to the increasing efficiency of the panel, decreasing installation costs, and increasing government policies for clean energy.

The solar power market is witnessing strong growth due to rising global emphasis on renewable energy, climate change mitigation, and energy independence. Government initiatives such as subsidies, tax incentives, and net metering policies are encouraging solar adoption worldwide. Continuous technological advancements, including higher-efficiency solar panels and energy storage solutions, are further reducing costs and improving system performance. Additionally, corporate sustainability goals and the declining cost of solar modules are making solar energy increasingly competitive with traditional power sources. The shift toward decentralized power generation and electrification of rural areas also contributes to the rapid expansion of the global solar power market.

On Dec. 31, 2025, federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire. American Home Shield breaks down what is changing and how homeowners can ensure they lock in savings before the end of the year.

What was the Inflation Reduction Act?

The IRA of 2022 was a landmark act designed to address climate change by investing in clean energy and manufacturing through tax incentives, grants, and loan programs.

Tax credits authorized by the IRA have helped everyday American households and businesses afford energy-efficient upgrades, including HVAC systems and other big-ticket items.

According to Energy Star, homeowners can claim 30% of project costs up to $2,000 for qualifying energy efficiency home improvements like heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves, or up to $1,200 for qualifying water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and central AC units.

What has changed?

The IRA's federal tax incentives for energy-efficient installations and upgrades were originally supposed to last until 2032, but the federal government is ending them early. The program will now expire on Dec. 31.

There is now only a limited time left for homeowners to take advantage of these tax credits.

Why is it important to act now?

Qualifying HVAC systems must be purchased and installed by Dec. 31. Documentation is key - homeowners should keep invoices or receipts with dates, contractor plans and permits. They should be able to clearly show when the work was completed and when the service was turned on so that if audited, they can prove it was finished by the end of 2025.

What are some signs an HVAC needs to be replaced?

Even the highest quality HVACs will need to be replaced at some point, making the expiring federal tax credits even more valuable to act on now.

""AC units typically last 10 to 15 years. If homeowners know their unit is getting close to that timeframe, or there are signs of decline, they should start researching replacements,"" said Micah Sherman, a virtual HVAC expert with American Home Shield.

""A few signs to look out for include strange sounds coming from the unit, hot or cold spots in the house, or refrigerant leaks. Sometimes the cost of repairing these problems warrants considering a new system altogether,"" said Sherman.

The end of the federal tax credits program is a change consumers need to be aware of, but if they act quickly, there is still time to capture savings before it expires.

The global energy sector has seen a diverse mixture of renewable energy projects commissioned over the past few years, and hydrogen has emerged as the most practical and viable form of energy that promotes the global energy transition away from fossil fuels.

Spain’s HVR is set to receive millions to integrate hydrogen into the nation’s mobility sector

As Europe embraces the renewable energy sector through a variety of projects that strengthen the energy security and independence of the region, the Official Credit Institute (ICO) of Spain has announced that it is set to allocate €7 million to Hidrógeno Verde Renovable SL (HVR) to construct a myriad of hydrogen filling stations around Spain.

This allocation falls under the framework of the European CEF-AFIF program (Connecting Europe Facility – Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility), which is managed by the European Commission through CINEA (European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency).

HVR has stated that the funds allocated by the ICO will specifically go to the ACTIVA project, which aims to strengthen the hydrogen infrastructure in Spain and promote initiatives that increase the reputation and practical usage of hydrogen in the nation.

The Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) aims to boost hydrogen usage in Spain and further afield.

The TEN-T aims to develop new initiatives for hydrogen in Spain and Europe. Crucially, HVR is set to construct 20 hydrogen filling facilities on existing fuel stations across the nation. This would be a cost-effective manner of integrating hydrogen into Spain’s existing mobility infrastructure. The new hydrogen filling stations will operate on an all-inclusive rental basis for specialized companies aiming to jump into the hydrogen pool.

HVR has become the cornerstone of the Spanish adoption of hydrogen in mobility

The company was formed with a singular purpose: to promote sustainable mobility through a strategically integrated hydrogen fuel system in Spain. In 2023, HVR began its long walk to hydrogen freedom when it launched its first-ever green hydrogen generation, storage, and supply plant in Madrid. This innovative project demonstrates HVR’s technical expertise and commitment to transitioning Spain’s energy sector towards hydrogen.

On top of the €7 million from the ICO, HVR has also received an additional €4.2 million from Europe to boost its plans for a hydrogen fueling system in Spain. Through the allocation of funds, the ICO has exemplified its commitment to shifting the energy sector in Spain towards the renewable energy market through pragmatic projects that align with global decarbonization goals.

Spain has big plans for the integration of hydrogen as a major energy resource

Spain is a member of the new and innovative H2Med project that aims to construct a hydrogen pipeline to foster cross-border transportation of the world’s most exciting energy resource. Enagas has reported that the H2med project is on track and making significant progress to be completed by the end of the decade.

The organization points out that the proposed regulation would consolidate the massive use of these substances instead of reducing it.

Furthermore, if approved, it would undermine the judicial precedents that established a security distance of 1000 meters.

The controversial agrochemical bill being analyzed by Congress and denounced by Greenpeace

The project currently under review by Congress was developed by the Network of Good Agricultural Practices (RedBPA), which includes more than 80 institutions from the agricultural sector.

Titled “Minimum Standards Law for the Application of Phytosanitary Products”, it is supported by UCR and Civic Coalition deputies, with backing from the agricultural sector.

According to the project’s proponents, it seeks to “harmonize criteria” and create a uniform regulatory framework for the application of agrochemicals, which Argentina currently lacks.

Despite the “good press” maintained by the agricultural sector and legislators, Greenpeace specifically denounces articles 7 and 9 of the project.

These establish exclusion zones of just 10 meters for ground and drone applications of agrochemicals, and 45 meters for aerial applications.

These values drastically contrast with the 1000 meters set by provincial courts based on official expert reports.

Thus, it would facilitate the use of substances with a proven toxic effect on organisms and ecosystems.

Greenpeace also criticizes that the proposal “does not reduce the use of agrochemicals nor plan their substitution, but rather consolidates their continuity and lowers existing protection levels“.

Additionally, the legislative project deliberately avoids the term “agrochemicals” and replaces it with “phytosanitary products”, a change Greenpeace considers political.

According to the organization, this modification attenuates the perception of risk to facilitate social approval.

Agrochemicals in Argentina: risks and judicial precedents

Greenpeace supports its denunciation with concrete data: studies detected glyphosate and atrazine in rain, air, and watercourses in Argentina.

Furthermore, research using biomarkers demonstrated genetic damage and respiratory impairment in the exposed population.

On the judicial front, municipal ordinances such as that of the Campana Municipality in Buenos Aires and rulings in Sastre and Piamonte in Santa Fe also established 1000 meters as a precautionary threshold.

If the new regulation is approved, these precedents would be undermined and jurisdictions would lose the ability to apply the precautionary principle.

Since 2011, Greenpeace has maintained its criticism of the Argentine agricultural model and the use of agrochemicals.

Its report “Glyphosate: a toxic strategy” indicates that the massive use of these products generates environmental pollution.

Additionally, it consolidates agriculture dependent on chemical inputs and transgenic seeds.

In turn, the expansion of monoculture in recent decades also has other consequences:

Loss of biodiversity;

soil degradation;

water pollution, and;

displacement of rural communities.

A worrying context: more freedom for agrochemicals

The legislative context coincides with governmental decisions that concern the organization.

For example, the Government recently freed up agrochemical imports.

It also reduced tariffs for their entry, lowering the cost of imported chemicals without introducing compensatory health or environmental criteria.

Greenpeace also questions the official discourse of “productivity” and “food security”.

According to the organization, Argentina does not use agrochemicals to produce food and supply its population, but to sustain the profits of exporting companies.

In this vein, the NGO recalls that the legislative process occurs while Atanor —one of the main local manufacturers of glyphosate— accumulates complaints for illegal discharges and environmental non-compliance.

In 2024, the company even suffered an explosion at its San Nicolás plant, highlighting failures in the national regulatory system.

Greenpeace’s proposal against agrochemicals

The organization demands the initiation of a process of progressive reduction and phase-out of the massive use of agrochemicals.

It proposes moving towards agroecological systems that prioritize health, biodiversity, and food sovereignty.

“The challenge is not to strengthen the legal framework of the agrochemical business, but to ensure the protection of people, water, and the environment“, concludes the Greenpeace document.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/02/aplicaciones-aereas-de-agroquimicos.webp,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:45.594347

The world is seeing a shift away from ambitious climate mandates and goals: The Paris Agreement’s implementation is losing momentum, the United Nation’s global shipping carbon tax has stalled, and major economies are softening their electric vehicle mandates.

These developments reflect that big climate mandates are costly, and it is challenging to reach international climate mitigation agreements in the existing fragmented geopolitical landscape – let alone implement them.

The next few years are likely to see more incremental and piecemeal climate policies and targets at the national and sub-national levels instead of big and ambitious climate regulations.

Introduction

The world is seeing a shift away from ambitious climate mandates and goals. The Paris Agreement’s implementation is losing momentum, the United Nation’s (UN) global shipping carbon tax has stalled, major economies are softening their electric vehicle mandates, and some of the world’s leading climate philanthropists are changing strategies.

These developments reflect that big climate mandates are costly, and it is challenging to reach an international climate mitigation agreement in the existing fragmented geopolitical landscape – let alone implement them.

The next few years are likely to see more incremental and piecemeal climate policies and targets at the national and sub-national levels instead of big and ambitious climate regulations.

This insight provides an overview of the significant recent developments in international climate policy and what they likely portend for such policies in the near future.

Recent Major Developments in Climate Policy

The Paris Agreement has lost momentum

A new UN report shows countries have made very limited progress toward the climate goals in the Paris Agreement—an international treaty adopted in 2015 by 195 jurisdictions aimed to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.

Under the agreement, countries are expected to submit their updated climate action plans every five years—the idea is to have more ambitious plans over time. Yet a decade after the adoption of the agreement, only 64 countries, about one third of the total countries, submitted their climate plans. The UN report acknowledges that the report itself is “limited in scope” and that “it is not possible to draw wide-ranging global-level conclusions or inferences from this limited data set.”

The report projects that if the 64 countries implement their plans successfully, their emissions would decline by 17 percent by 2035 compared to the 2019 level, which is significantly short of the 37 percent required to meet the goals in the Paris Agreement. Notably, the 64 new climate plans include one submitted by the Biden Administration but that will not be implemented by the Trump Administration.

Global shipping carbon tax stalled

Last month, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) failed to officially adopt the global carbon tax on shipping emissions which was agreed upon in a meeting in April this year. Instead, IMO decided to delay the decision on whether to adopt the policy by a year.

American Action Forum’s (AAF) previous analysis provided a detailed overview of the policy—a fuel standard and a two-tiered carbon tax, as well as awarded and transferable tax credits that can be carried forward.

This setback in the global shipping carbon tax was not a surprise, as the Trump Administration doubled down its opposition to the policy by releasing a statement through the Department of State the week before the October IMO meeting, threatening to retaliate against countries that support the policy with a variety of actions including imposing port fees, sanctions on officials, and investigating into potential anti-competitive practices.

Major economies soften targets on EVs

In the United States, the 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed all the electric vehicles (EV)-related tax credits established in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As of the end of September 2025, all EV tax credits included in the IRA have expired. AAF’s previous analysis concludes that this is an improvement to the IRA’s energy provisions as the EV tax credits are complex, inefficient, and costly.

Other major economies have followed the United States’ lead in rolling back policy support for EVs. Canada recently paused its 2026 EV sales mandate, which would have required 20 percent of new car sales to be EVs. The United Kingdom has maintained its 2030 Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate but has updated it to allow car manufacturers more flexibility to comply with the mandate. The European Union is under tremendous pressure to revise its 2035 EV mandate, with Germany and Italy recently jointly calling for easing the mandate.

Climate philanthropists change strategies

Bill Gates, a major advocate and donor for addressing climate change, recently published a letter calling for a new strategy to tackle climate issues. In the letter, Gates criticized the “doomsday view” of climate change—he believes that climate change will not lead to the end of civilization as some climate advocates have claimed. While emphasizing that climate change is a serious problem, Gates argues that it is imperative not to over-allocate resources to climate issues at the expense of funding for economic development and public health. For context, Gates has spent billions of dollars on climate-related projects including public policy, technology innovation, and climate adaptation. In March 2025, Breakthrough Energy, an organization funded by Gates to address climate issues, made significant budget cuts mostly driven by the Trump Administration’s shift away from decarbonization goals and policies.

Gates is not the only philanthropist that has cut back funding for climate issues. The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a London-based foundation, has decided to pause providing funding to U.S. non-profit organizations for climate issues due to the uncertainties in the Trump Administration’s treatment of the tax-exempt status of non-profit organizations.

What Are the Takeaways?

Massive mandates distort the market significantly and make it costly for both businesses and consumers to decarbonize. Arbitrary command-and-control emissions regulations such as the EV mandates are inefficient because they do not allow businesses to reduce emissions at the lowest cost compared to alternative policies such as a carbon tax. Additionally, regulators do not have all the information on the latest technological development, which makes it difficult to update the mandates to respond to technological changes.

Adopting an international agreement on climate mitigation in the existing fragmented geopolitical landscape is difficult. IMO’s decision to delay its vote on whether to officially adopt a global shipping carbon tax indicates how challenging it is. Individual countries’ considerations of domestic economic and political priorities affect their calculations on whether to join the international agreement. The timing of the IMO vote makes it especially tough, given the uncertainties from the Trump Administration’s sweeping tariffs on the rest of the world and concerns of retaliation from the United States.

Conclusion

It is difficult enough for a large number of countries to commit to a uniform climate target. But even if an agreement is reached, there is still much work to be done on design, implementation, and enforcement—as is clearly evidenced by the limited progress on the Paris Agreement a decade after its adoption.

Riyadh Launches Deepened Energy Alliance

The OPEC Fund for International Development and Saudi-based utility developer ACWA Power have entered a new five-year partnership agreement worth up to US$450 million to accelerate investment in clean energy, desalinated water, and green hydrogen projects across emerging markets.

The deal, announced at the 9th Future Investment Initiative (FII9) in Riyadh, strengthens both institutions’ shared objective of scaling sustainable infrastructure and advancing climate-resilient growth in the Global South.

OPEC Fund President Abdulhamid Alkhalifa described the expanded collaboration as a model of South–South cooperation, citing tangible results from earlier partnerships that delivered affordable, low-carbon energy to millions. “This new agreement takes our collaboration to the next level,” he said. “It expands our joint efforts across renewable energy, water, and green hydrogen to help partner countries achieve sustainable growth and resilience.”

Financing Expansion in Emerging Markets

Since their first collaboration in 2016, the OPEC Fund and ACWA Power have co-financed six major energy and water projects across Jordan, Egypt, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan. The OPEC Fund has already contributed nearly US$300 million in financing to those projects, helping governments diversify energy supply and increase reliability while cutting costs and emissions.

The new framework allows both organizations to scale investment through co-financing structures and innovative funding mechanisms. By leveraging concessional finance from the OPEC Fund alongside ACWA Power’s project development expertise, the partnership is expected to unlock greater private-sector participation in countries facing constrained access to climate finance.

For developing economies under rising fiscal and climate pressures, such blended models are increasingly seen as key to bridging infrastructure financing gaps and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Integrating Energy and Water Strategies

The agreement aligns with the OPEC Fund’s Green–Blue Connect initiative, which promotes cross-sectoral investment linking renewable energy and water security. By combining clean power with desalination and hydrogen production, both institutions aim to address interconnected challenges — energy demand, resource scarcity, and climate adaptation — within a single development framework.

ACWA Power, one of the Middle East’s leading energy developers, operates in more than a dozen countries and is targeting a tripling of its renewable energy capacity by 2030. It is also expanding its desalination and green hydrogen portfolio, including large-scale projects in Saudi Arabia’s NEOM region and Central Asia.

For the OPEC Fund, headquartered in Vienna with 12 member countries, the partnership supports its strategy to channel capital into climate-aligned infrastructure and strengthen the resilience of low- and middle-income nations.

Global and Regional Implications

The renewed collaboration comes as multilateral lenders and private developers face growing pressure to accelerate the clean energy transition in developing regions. Access to affordable capital remains a critical barrier, particularly for projects involving emerging technologies such as green hydrogen.

By formalizing a long-term framework, the OPEC Fund and ACWA Power are positioning themselves to drive a pipeline of projects that can attract further institutional investment. For policymakers, the model reinforces the importance of aligning public and private finance within credible transition pathways that balance energy security, affordability, and decarbonization.

As both entities expand their reach, the partnership reflects a broader strategic shift: using regional alliances to mobilize climate finance and build local capacity. In an era when energy and water challenges increasingly define economic resilience, such collaborations are set to play an outsized role in shaping the sustainable growth trajectories of emerging markets.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/OPEC-Fund-ACWA-Power-Sign-450M-Agreement-to-Accelerate-Clean-Energy-and-Water-Transition.jpeg,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:07.028923
,North Carolina Environment,2025-11-03 14:13:40+00:00,News From The States,Forest Service restarts effort to change decades-old Pacific Northwest forest policy,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/forest-service-restarts-effort-change-decades-old-pacific-northwest-forest-policy,"The Forest Service has been working on a Northwest Forest Plan amendment for a few years, holding dozens of outreach meetings with tribes, an advisory committee and the general public.
The agency published its proposed changes in a draft environmental impact statement in November 2024 and received over 3,400 public comments.
They’ve been calling on President Donald Trump for a complete overhaul of the Northwest Forest Plan.
“The Northwest Forest Plan is failing our communities and our environment,” said Matt Hill, executive director of the Douglas Timber Operators, in a March press release.
Initial efforts to amend the Northwest Forest Plan focused on getting input from tribes on how the federal government should manage their ancestral lands.","A yearslong endeavor to change logging and environmental policies for millions of acres of Pacific Northwest forests is getting a restart.

The U.S. Forest Service is going back to the drawing board with an update to the Northwest Forest Plan, a set of policies that broadly dictates where logging can occur on 25 million acres of forests in Oregon, Washington and northwest California. It came out of the timber wars of the 1980s and ‘90s.

Environmental groups worry new changes that could be made to this plan under the Trump administration will increase logging in mature and old-growth forests, potentially harming wildlife species that are already on the brink of extinction, including the spotted owl.

The Forest Service has been working on a Northwest Forest Plan amendment for a few years, holding dozens of outreach meetings with tribes, an advisory committee and the general public. The agency published its proposed changes in a draft environmental impact statement in November 2024 and received over 3,400 public comments.

Now the Forest Service under the Trump administration wants to issue a new draft.

Timber industry groups largely welcome restarting this Biden-era initiative. They’ve been calling on President Donald Trump for a complete overhaul of the Northwest Forest Plan.

“The Northwest Forest Plan is failing our communities and our environment,” said Matt Hill, executive director of the Douglas Timber Operators, in a March press release. “It’s time for a bold revision that prioritizes dynamic forest management and sustainable timber production.”

Agency officials say they are working on a “revised draft environmental impact statement.” No such term exists in national environmental policy.

In an emailed statement to OPB, an unnamed Forest Service spokesperson said the agency will publish a new draft amendment next fall, and that the Forest Service will allow people to review the draft and weigh in during a 90-day public comment period.

The spokesperson provided few details about what could be in the new draft. They said it will “consider additional or refined definitions of forest types to reflect ecological diversity, clarify commercial timber opportunities, analyze potential refinements to Survey and Manage, and make other updates based on the comments we’ve received.”

“Survey and manage” is a set of standards outlined in the current Northwest Forest Plan. It requires land managers to survey forest areas ahead of projects that could harm the environment, like logging or prescribed fires, in search of rare or vulnerable species. It’s a time-consuming process that often slows logging and prescribed fire projects.

Under the Biden administration, the Forest Service had proposed limiting the survey and manage program near residential areas to facilitate prescribed burns. Environmental groups worry a new draft out of the Trump administration could limit survey and manage efforts in mature and old-growth forests, harming vulnerable species.

“By targeting programs like Survey and Manage — which safeguard rare species before logging occurs— and emphasizing ‘commercial timber opportunities,’ the administration is advancing the timber industry’s agenda to expand logging — including clearcutting — on public lands,” Oregon Wild conservation director Steve Pedery said in an emailed statement.

Initial efforts to amend the Northwest Forest Plan focused on getting input from tribes on how the federal government should manage their ancestral lands. Forest Service officials created an advisory committee made up of multiple tribal representatives, as well as people representing environmental and timber interests, to guide its policies. They also held forums with tribes to gather input ahead of drafting proposed changes.

“It was a tribal-centric effort,” said Ryan Reed, a former advisory committee representative and a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe in Northern California. “That was the headliner of our work. It’s disheartening that they felt that wasn’t enough.”

Another former committee member who represents timber interests said he remains optimistic about this new process.

“We look forward to working with the Forest Service to improve the way we steward our federal forests in the Northwest to improve forest health, help reduce the impacts of catastrophic wildfires, protect communities, improve public access and recreation, and help sustain our world class forest products infrastructure,” said Travis Joseph, president of the American Forest Resource Council, a timber industry association.

In an emailed statement, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said he is working on legislation that would create environmental protections for old growth in the Pacific Northwest.

“The best way to address the needs of special places in the Pacific Northwest is to build coalitions of people who are for smart resource management in — and with — the communities directly affected, not from 3,000 miles away in Washington DC,” Wyden said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/heathermeadows1762178693.jpeg?h=4bf1c8f5&itok=0PNK9kG0,N,,2025-11-03 11:11:39.159633

If the definition of a “sound” business decision is challenged in a judicial context, this legislation allows more complex litigation to be tried in the Texas business courts system.
How has the tariff climate in 2025 affected the state’s business climate?
What are some business climate challenges you plan to address going forward?
The recognition of Texas’ business climate is not something that happens in a vacuum.","The eighth-largest economy in the world has the best business climate in the U.S. Texas has once again emerged as the state most likely to succeed when it comes to attracting capital investment from the private sector. That’s because from the governor’s office in Austin to economic development offices in communities large and small across the Lone Star State, those charged with marketing Texas know they have an easy sell — no corporate tax, sensible business regulations, business-dedicated courts, unbeatable logistics infrastructure and a huge labor force, among other factors. Their challenge is to keep it that way.

North Carolina finishes in second place by a mere single point, followed by Georgia. Virginia and Florida complete the top five states.

Rounding out the top five most important criteria for business executives from a list of options are ease of permitting and regulatory procedures, transportation infrastructure, workforce skills and quality of life. Survey respondents were asked to provide comments about what’s most on their minds as they consider state business climates they’re familiar with. Following are sample responses:

“Ease of process; expertise of state and local representatives in supporting economic development projects; location quality; workforce; thriving economy with growth sectors; port, transportation and incentives.”

“Customer demand, power availability and a potential workforce that can be leveraged.”

“Tax structure: The most significant advantage is its tax policy. Texas has no corporate income tax and no personal income tax. This provides a direct and substantial financial benefit, allowing companies to reinvest more of their earnings into their operations and expansion.”

“Large and growing workforce: The state boasts a large, diverse, and rapidly growing labor pool. This continuous influx of talent provides companies with the human capital they need to scale their operations effectively.”

“Business-friendly regulatory environment: Texas has a well-established reputation for having a predictable and streamlined regulatory framework. This reduces bureaucratic hurdles and makes it easier for businesses to operate and expand without unnecessary delays or costs.”

“Workforce, site readiness and availability of energy, infrastructure assets, pro-business tax and regulatory policies.”

“Pro-business climate, reasonable tax policies, speed to market, variety of ready sites.”

A recent addition to the Business Climate Ranking methodology is where the Inc. 5000 companies — the fastest-growing private companies in America — are located. Fast-growing companies can’t grow quickly where they will be burdened by over-reaching regulations, uncooperative state and local agencies or taxation schemes that stymie growth. The methodology recognizes states for total Inc. 5000 companies resident and the number located in-state per capita. See the charts on the following pages.

Since becoming the 48th governor of Texas in 2015, Greg Abbott has worked tirelessly to make his state companies’ first choice when considering locations for new or expanding facilities. It’s working. Having won Site Selection’s Governor’s Cup for total capital investment projects for the 13th consecutive year earlier in 2025, the governor and his economic development team, and economic development professionals throughout the state, once again can remind investors that Texas has the best business climate in the nation.

In the following interview, Gov. Abbott explains how Texas continues to outshine the rest of the country in keeping the state front and center on the radars of corporate site selectors.

In September, you named a director of the new Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office. What are the areas this office is charged with addressing?

Gov. Greg Abbott: Here in Texas, we operate at the speed of business, and the new Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office (TREO) will ensure we continue to foster economic opportunity and protect individual liberty. Earlier this year, I signed Senate Bill 14 into law establishing TREO, which is charged with reducing regulatory burdens, eliminating unnecessary rules and promoting economic growth by making Texas even more business friendly. By cutting red tape and rooting out unnecessary regulations, we will make ​state government more responsive and more efficient to serve the people and job creators of Texas.

What are some specific outcomes you are looking for it to achieve?

Abbott: TREO will work to increase transparency for Texas taxpayers and ensure that Texas remains the best place to start and run a business in the country. TREO will follow the work started by my Small Business Freedom Council that I launched in 2024 to review government efficiency for Texas businesses.

The office will review state agency rules and procedures and coordinate with an advisory panel of experts and stakeholders to solicit input from Texans and members of the community. TREO will help state agencies identify and cut unnecessary or ineffective rules, determine the regulatory costs placed on Texans, and issue best-practice guidelines for how state agencies adopt new rules and perform required analyses such as cost and employment impact statements.

Senate Bill 29 addresses business climate head on. It provides business decision-makers the certainty that sound business judgments made in the best interest of shareholders will not be second-guessed by courts. Is this an issue potential capital investors raised with you or the Office of Economic Development?

Abbott: Here in Texas, we have experienced unprecedented economic development success over the past decade, but we cannot become complacent. To remain the economic envy of America, we must continue to improve our leading business climate. That’s why I signed Senate Bill 29 into law to provide business decision-makers the certainty that sound business judgments made in the best interest of shareholders will not be second-guessed by courts.

Business decisions are to be made by the elected officers and shareholders, not by unelected judges. The new law codifies the business judgment rule and reforms derivative claims processes. It also creates a mechanism to pre-assess corporate director independence. This will help attract even more corporate registrations and relocations to our state while solidifying Texas as a premier global business destination.

Are there likely to be challenges about how “sound” is defined?

Abbott: This year, I also signed House Bill 40 into law to expand the jurisdiction of Texas business courts and the types of cases they can hear. After years serving as a Texas Supreme Court Justice and Attorney General of Texas, this new law will allow for the Texas judicial system to move more efficiently for businesses. If the definition of a “sound” business decision is challenged in a judicial context, this legislation allows more complex litigation to be tried in the Texas business courts system.

At the Waco State of the State luncheon in early September, you mentioned the 89th Legislative Session cut red tape and fortified Texas’ electric grid. What are some examples of red tape that was cut?

Abbott: In addition to signing the Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office into law, we also streamlined regulations and expanded opportunities for small businesses in Texas.

In June, I signed numerous laws to support Texas’ small business owners and workers and accelerate the process for starting a business by cutting unnecessary government regulations. These laws build upon the progress of my Small Business Freedom Council, which I launched in 2024, to review government efficiency for Texas businesses. I also directed state agencies to provide recommendations to cut unnecessary government regulations that hamper small business formation, operation or growth.

In terms of the electric grid, much is being made lately of rapidly increasing demand for electricity driven by so many new data centers and energy-intensive industrial products (semiconductors and EV plants) coming online. What should readers know about how Texas is addressing this?

Abbott: Texas is the energy capital of the world. We produce more energy and more electricity than any other state in the nation. As more people choose to raise their families and build their businesses in Texas, we continue to add more dispatchable power to our state power grid and make strategic investments in critical infrastructure. In fact, Texas voters approved $5 billion for the Texas Energy Fund for low-interest loans to support the construction of new dispatchable generation.

Earlier this year I signed into law Senate Bill 6 to help make transmission planning and approval even more efficient in Texas. The Public Utility Commission of Texas recently approved the state’s first 765-kilovolt transmission lines in West Texas, supporting the growing electricity needs of the region and the state.

Additionally, the weatherization requirements for critical grid and natural gas infrastructure that I signed into law have proven effective. Working together with innovators in tech and energy, we continue to add more reliable power to the grid to ensure every Texas home and every Texas business has the power needed to thrive.

How has the tariff climate in 2025 affected the state’s business climate?

Abbott: Texas stands ready to help companies navigate this global trade transition. We are working to help identify any opportunities to ensure that companies doing business here succeed globally.

As the number one exporter in the nation for the last 23 years in a row, Texas is strategically positioned to lead. Thanks to our central geographic location and state-of-the-art infrastructure, we are the gateway to global trade for the entire nation.

Our business-friendly climate is steadfast, and we are here as long-term partners for success to help companies revaluate and pivot during this new era of global trade. Texas is an economic development powerhouse, and we welcome new jobs and manufacturing from global businesses looking to expand or relocate their operations.

Dallas is quickly becoming a financial services hub, particularly where securities exchanges are concerned. Why has this sector seen so much activity lately?

Abbott: Home to the new “Y’all Street,” Texas is now the financial capital of America. In fact, Texas has the largest financial services workforce in the nation, even surpassing New York.

With the historic announcement of the Texas Stock Exchange in 2024 and the selection of Texas as the location for Nasdaq’s new regional headquarters in 2025, our state also recently celebrated the launch of NYSE Texas, a fully electronic equities exchange headquartered in Dallas.

With plenty of room to grow, many financial services companies are choosing to invest in Texas. Finance and insurance firms announced more than $137 million in new capital investment in Texas last year alone.

In 2021, Fortune 500 firm Charles Schwab relocated its headquarters from California to the North Texas city of Westlake to take advantage of lower costs and a business-friendly environment. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase has more employees in Texas than in New York.

Recently, Scotiabank, one of the largest banks in North America, announced a new major office in Dallas, creating more than 1,020 new jobs and more than $60 million in capital investment. Texas’ strength in financial services will only continue to grow as we expand our leadership in financial technology, data centers, AI, cybersecurity and more.

What are some business climate challenges you plan to address going forward?

Abbott: Here in Texas, we partner with our businesses. Because when businesses succeed, all Texans succeed.

With the eighth-largest economy in the world at more than $2.7 trillion, Texas is a beacon of freedom and opportunity that draws people and businesses from all over the world to our great state. We will continue to make strategic investments and partner with businesses to ensure that Texas remains the Best State for Business in the nation — a title we have held for the last 21 years in a row.

The recognition of Texas’ business climate is not something that happens in a vacuum. It takes the work of our state leadership and elected officials to ensure regulations continue to support the business-friendly climate that we are so proud of.",https://siteselection.com/media/Favicon-100x100.png,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:54.055203

ACTON, Mass., Nov. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Distributed Energy Infrastructure (DEI), a leading EPC provider for utility-scale solar and storage projects, announces the completion of a new 7.1 MW solar + 4 MW battery storage project located in Acton, Massachusetts. Formerly occupied by a chemical manufacturing facility, the project site was previously designated an EPC Superfund site due to significantly contaminated soil, including asbestos.

The innovative approach used by DEI and its project partners, owner Syncarpha Capital and racking provider Terrasmart, led Solar Builder to name this project a finalist in the publication's competitive Project of the Year 2025 Award for 1-10 MW projects. To construct safely on the site, DEI implemented strict environmental and health safeguards:

Crews trained in Hazwoper hazardous materials handling followed specialized health and safety protocols.

Excavation was minimized, with electrical infrastructure designed primarily aboveground to avoid disturbing contaminated soils.

The system was designed around existing structures, including old concrete slabs, to reduce site disturbance.

DEI coordinated with six regulatory agencies and established contingency plans to address any hazardous material discoveries.

When asbestos was discovered, certified specialists were brought in to analyze, document, and remove all hazardous material under regulatory oversight.

""Projects like Acton show what it takes to responsibly bring clean energy to communities while addressing the challenges of building on historically contaminated land,"" said Sean Harrington, President and CEO of Distributed Energy Infrastructure. ""By transforming a brownfield into a productive solar and storage site, we're expanding access to renewable energy, strengthening the local grid, and putting otherwise unusable land back to work.""

As a brownfield project located on formerly unusable land, the Acton project delivers significant community and environmental benefits. It repurposes a contaminated Superfund site for productive use, preserves farmland and open space, and created nearly 40 local jobs during construction. The project provides clean energy through a community solar model paired with battery storage, boosting local grid resilience. It also expands the town's tax base through new revenue and supports Massachusetts' SMART and Clean Peak Standard goals, since it reduces strain on the grid during peak seasonal demand times.

""Brownfield redevelopment is a powerful way to expand clean energy access while addressing the legacy of industrial contamination,"" said Graeme Dutkowsky of Syncarpha Capital. ""This project demonstrates how DEI's thoughtful, safety-first approach to building brownfield solar projects can turn an underutilized site into a long-term source of reliable power and local economic value.""

Canada Nickel Company Inc. (""Canada Nickel"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF) is pleased to announce an in-situ carbon sequestration pilot study at its flagship Crawford Nickel Project (""Crawford""), near Timmins, Ontario. The pilot is being conducted in collaboration with the U.S. DOE ARPA-E team, led by the University of Texas at Austin.

The pilot program follows bench-scale studies conducted by the ARPA team under the direction of Dr. Estibalitz Ukar, Research Associate Professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

Mark Selby, CEO of Canada Nickel said, ""We have been very pleased to work with Dr. Ukar and her team at the University of Texas at Austin as they developed a novel carbon sequestration approach to store large volumes of CO2 and create the potential, by pre-carbonating material before it is mined, to both reduce the costs and to improve the value from processing the material. We look forward to the results from this next stage of testing in a real-world field trial.""

Dr. Ukar, said, ""Canada Nickel has been an exceptional partner in this work, providing site access, geological data, and active collaboration. Their support of this pilot exemplifies their commitment to responsible mineral development, scientific innovation, and climate action. By advancing novel methods for permanent CO2 storage and supporting technologies that can scale globally, Canada Nickel is helping chart a sustainable path forward for the mining sector.""

Bench-scale studies of the Crawford ultramafic rocks have demonstrated that the magnesium-rich mineral brucite captures CO2 by transforming into secondary minerals such as magnesite and nesquehonite. Building on these findings, the month-long pilot will inject carbon-enriched water sourced from the Crawford site into a 400 metre-deep well within the ultramafic body to evaluate large-scale carbon capture under natural conditions.

The CO2-to-rock mineralizing process is anticipated to begin within hours of the injection, with most of the CO2 turning into solid rock within six months. The pilot will use various monitoring techniques, including groundwater sampling, seismic sensors, gas detectors, and satellite-based surface tracking.

This initiative is independent of Canada Nickel's In-Process Tailings (IPT) Carbonation Program and represents a key step in expanding the Company's carbon capture and storage capabilities. Results from this study will help guide future post-mining carbon sequestration strategies, further strengthening Canada Nickel's vision for a Zero-Carbon Industrial Cluster in Timmins.

Soybean and wheat futures were higher in overnight trading after the White House released details of the U.S.-China trade agreement struck last week.

China has agreed to remove all retaliatory non-tariff countermeasures taken against the U.S. since March 4, the White House said in a statement released on Saturday.

The Asian nation will purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the last two months of 2025 and at least 25 million tons of beans in each of the following three years, the statement said.

Beijing will also suspend implementation of export controls on rare-earth materials, issue licenses for exports of rare earths and other materials to the benefit of the U.S., and take measures to stem the flow of fentanyl, the White House said.

The U.S. will lower tariffs imposed to stem the flow of fentanyl to 10% from 20%, extend the expiration of certain tariff inclusions by a year to Nov. 10, 2026, and suspend for a year investigations into the Asian country for attempting to dominate the shipbuilding industry.

China is looking to purchase wheat from the U.S. for the first time in more than a year, according to a Bloomberg report.

Soybean futures for November delivery rose 3¾¢ to $11.19 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soy meal was down $1.30 to $320.30 a short ton and soybean oil futures lost 0.13¢ to 48.55¢ a pound.

2. EPA Need to Reallocate Refinery Waivers, NCGA Says

The Environmental Protection Agency should reallocate all of its small-refiner waivers via a supplemental rule-making process, the National Corn Growers Association said in a statement.

Doing so would ensure ""a strong, transparent, and balanced"" Renewable Fuels Standard, the association said.

EPA sets the blending volume for the RFS annually and has the authority to issue exemptions for small refineries that are able to show ""disproportionate economic harm"" from meeting the blending volumes.

""NCGA has long argued that a dependable Renewable Fuel Standard is critical to unlocking America's domestic energy potential, promoting ethanol growth, and driving corn demand,"" the group said in its statement.

Corn growers said in a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin that they appreciate EPA's proposal to require 15 billion gallons to be blended into fuels in 2026 and 2027, but actions by the agency show how complicated it is to balance refiners' needs with the integrity of the RFS.

""NCGA urges the agency to finalize the implied conventional renewable fuel requirement at 15 billion gallons for both 2026 and 2027, as proposed, and to manage SREs (small-refinery exemptions) in a way that upholds the market integrity and promotes growth for this essential market,"" the association said in its letter.

3. Dry Weather Forecast for Minnesota, Wisconsin

Dry weather is expected in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin this afternoon that could increase the risk of wildfires, according to the National Weather Service.

Winds from central Minnesota into western Wisconsin will be sustained from 10–15 mph and gust up to 30 mph, the agency said.

Relative humidity will fall to 25%.

""The combination of breeze winds and dry conditions will create elevated fire weather conditions today,"" NWS said. ""These conditions will work together to support elevated potential for rapid fire spread.""

The update was related by industry sources and initially reported by South Korean news outlets.

ESS batteries to be built at Samsung’s Indiana plant

As noted in a report from Korea JoongAng Daily, the demand for energy storage systems has been growing rapidly in North America, thanks in no small part to the surge in AI investments across numerous companies. With this in mind, Tesla has reportedly approached Samsung SDI about a potential battery supply deal.

The deal is reportedly worth over 3 trillion Korean won (approximately $2.11 billion) and will span three years, according to The Korea Global Economic Daily. A battery supply deal with Samsung SDI could make sense for Tesla as the company already has a grid-scale battery, the Megapack, which is perfect for industrial use. Samsung SDI could simply supply cells for the EV maker.

Production of the batteries would reportedly take place at Samsung SDI’s joint venture factory with Stellantis in Indiana, which is currently under construction. Samsung SDI recently announced plans to use part of that plant’s EV lines to produce cells for ESS, with a targeted capacity of 30 GWh by the end of next year.

Tesla and Samsung’s partnership

At present, only a handful of manufacturers, including Korea’s LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, SK On, and Japan’s Panasonic, are capable of producing energy storage-scale batteries domestically in the United States. A Samsung SDI official issued a comment about the matter, stating, “Nothing has been finalized regarding cooperation with Tesla.”

The possible energy storage system deal adds another layer to Tesla’s growing collaboration with Samsung, which is already in line as a partner in the upcoming production of Tesla’s AI5 and AI6 chips. Early sample manufacturing of the AI6 is expected to begin in South Korea, with mass production slated for Samsung’s Texas-based Taylor foundry when it starts operations.

The AI6 chip will power Tesla’s next wave of high-volume projects, including the Optimus humanoid robot and the autonomous Cybercab service. Musk has called the partnership with Samsung a “real collaboration,” adding that he personally plans to “walk the line” at the Taylor facility to speed up progress.

Tesla’s long-awaited and way underrated Solar Roof may finally be getting its moment. During the company’s Q3 2025 earnings call, Vice President of Energy Engineering Michael Snyder revealed that production of a new residential solar panel has started at Tesla’s Buffalo, New York facility, with shipments to customers beginning in the first quarter of 2026.

The comments hint at possible renewed life for the Solar Roof program, which has seen years of slow growth since its 2016 unveiling.

Tesla Energy’s strong demand

Responding to an investor question about Tesla’s energy backlog, Snyder said demand for Megapack and Powerwall continues to be “really strong” into next year. He also noted positive customer feedback for the company’s new Megablock product, which is expected to start shipping from Houston in 2026.

“We’re seeing remarkable growth in the demand for AI and data center applications as hyperscalers and utilities have seen the versatility of the Megapack product. It increases reliability and relieves grid constraints,” he said.

Snyder also highlighted a “surge in residential solar demand in the US,” attributing the spike to recent policy changes that incentivize home installations. Tesla expects this trend to continue into 2026, helped by the rollout of a new solar lease product that makes adoption more affordable for homeowners.

Possible Solar Roof revival?

Perhaps the most intriguing part of Snyder’s remarks, however, was Tesla’s move to begin production of its “residential solar panel” in Buffalo, New York. He described the new panels as having “industry-leading aesthetics” and shape performance, language Tesla has used to market its Solar Roof tiles in the past.

“We also began production of our Tesla residential solar panel in our Buffalo factory, and we will be shipping that to customers starting Q1. The panel has industry-leading aesthetics and shape performance and demonstrates our continued commitment to US manufacturing,” Snyder said during the Q3 2025 earnings call.

Snyder did not explicitly name the product, though his reference to aesthetics has fueled speculation that Tesla may finally be preparing a large-scale and serious rollout of its Solar Roof line.

Originally unveiled in 2016, the Solar Roof was intended to transform rooftops into clean energy generators without compromising on design. However, despite early enthusiasm, production and installation volumes have remained limited for years. In 2023, a report from Wood Mackenzie claimed that there were only 3,000 operational Solar Roof installations across the United States at the time, far below forecasts. In response, the official Tesla Energy account on X stated that the report was “incorrect by a large margin.”

Reports from China have indicated that the Tesla Shanghai Megafactory has become a notable player in China’s booming battery export market.

Located in the Lingang New Area of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, the Tesla Megafactory has been running at full throttle since opening in February. It produces Tesla Megapack batteries for domestic and international use.

Tesla Shanghai Megafactory

As noted in a report from Sina Finance, the Tesla Shanghai Megafactory’s output of Megapack batteries helped drive a notable rise in lithium battery shipments from the city in the first three quarters of 2025. This is quite impressive as the Megafactory is a rather young facility, though it has been steadily increasing its production capacity.

“The establishment of this benchmark factory has not only driven the rapid development of Shanghai’s energy storage industry but also become a new growth engine for foreign trade exports. Driven by the Tesla energy storage factory’s opening, Shanghai’s lithium battery exports reached 32.15 billion yuan ($4.5 billion) in the first three quarters, a 20.7% increase,” the publication wrote.

Ultimately, the Shanghai Megafactory has proved helpful to the city’s “new three” industries, which are comprised of new energy vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaic systems. Exports of the “new three” products reached 112.17 billion yuan ($15.7 billion), a 6.3% year-over-year increase during the same period. The city’s total trade volume grew 5.4% year-over-year as well, with exports up 11.3%, driven largely by the clean energy sector’s performance.

Energy storage is helping Shanghai

Since opening in February, the Shanghai Megafactory has been firing on all cylinders. In late July, Tesla Energy announced that the new battery factory has successfully produced its 1,000th Megapack unit. That’s quite impressive for a facility that, at the time, had only been operational for less than six months.

Speed has always been a trademark of the Shanghai Megafactory. Similar to Tesla’s other key facilities in China, the Megafactory was constructed quickly. The facility started its construction on May 23, 2024. Less than a year later, the site officially started producing Megapack batteries. By late March 2025, Tesla China noted that it had shipped the first batch of Megapack batteries from the Shanghai plant to foreign markets.

Tesla will recall Powerwall 2 units in Australia after a handful of property owners reported fires that caused “minor property damage.” The fires were attributed to cells used by Tesla in the Powerwall 2.

Tesla Powerwall is a battery storage unit that retains energy from solar panels and is used by homeowners and businesses to maintain power in the event of an outage. It also helps alleviate the need to rely on the grid, which can help stabilize power locally.

Powerwall owners can also enroll in the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) program, which allows them to sell energy back to the grid, helping to reduce energy bills. Tesla revealed last year that over 100,000 Powerwalls were participating in the program.

Tesla announces 100k Powerwalls are participating in Virtual Power Plants

The Australia Competition and Consumer Commission said in a filing that it received several reports from owners of fires that led to minor damage. The Australian government agency did not disclose the number of units impacted by the recall.

The issue is related to the cells, which Tesla sources from a third-party company.

Anyone whose Powerwall 2 unit is impacted by the recall will be notified through the Tesla app, the company said.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tesla-megapack-texas-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 10:05:26.799286

CTR's planned U.S. listing is aligned with the company's strategy to advance renewable energy and critical minerals production in the U.S.

IMPERIAL COUNTY, CA, UNITED STATES, November 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Controlled Thermal Resources Holdings Inc. (CTR) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved the formation and planned U.S. public listing of CTR’s subsidiary, American Critical Resources (ACR), which is expected to be publicly traded on either NASDAQ or NYSE in mid-2026.

The planned public listing marks a major milestone in CTR’s long-term strategy to advance renewable baseload energy and critical minerals supply essential to U.S. industry, technology, and national security.

ACR will include Stage 1 assets of CTR’s Hell’s Kitchen Project in Imperial County, California, and three additional lithium production facilities, providing a total output of 50 megawatts of renewable electricity and approximately 100,000 metric tons annually of lithium carbonate.

As independently validated by Idaho National Laboratory, the Hell’s Kitchen resource contains measurable concentrations of U.S.-designated critical minerals and rare earth elements. Beyond lithium, engineering is underway to unlock additional critical minerals, such as zinc, manganese, rubidium, and potash, further enhancing the project’s strategic importance and potential future revenue diversity.

The Hell’s Kitchen Project has secured California state permits, and federal permits are proceeding under the FAST-41 program, positioning it as one of the few near-term U.S. developments established to deliver renewable baseload power and strategic critical minerals at commercial scale.

CTR’s decision to advance the ACR listing aligns with U.S. policy, market momentum, and national security priorities.

The U.S. federal administration has issued multiple executive orders to reduce exposure to foreign critical minerals supply chains, and the recent U.S.–Australia Critical Minerals Framework also highlights an accelerating effort among allied nations to secure strategic resources. These measures, together with the private sector’s response, led by JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 trillion Security and Resiliency Initiative, and Orion’s $1.8 billion Critical Mineral Consortium, demonstrate the alignment of Washington and Wall Street in rebuilding domestic capacity across energy, technology, and critical minerals.

“After a decade of engineering, validation, and partnerships, CTR is positioned to help secure America’s energy and minerals future,” said Rod Colwell, CTR Chairman and CEO. “The planned listing of American Critical Resources will allow access to U.S. public market capital and accelerate development of a project that supports national priorities in energy security, manufacturing, and defense.”

ACR has appointed Hall Chadwick as its corporate advisor to lead its U.S. market entry, working in partnership with Cohen & Company Capital Markets on institutional financing and IPO execution.

“As one of Australia’s most established professional-services firms with a 138-year history, Hall Chadwick is proud to help bridge the Australian and U.S. critical minerals ecosystems,” Richard Albarran, Managing Partner at Hall Chadwick, said. “Australia’s new national reserve strategy and ACR’s Hell’s Kitchen Project share a common purpose - securing the materials that underpin energy independence, national security, and a diversified global supply chain.”

As part of the planned listing process, ACR will pursue additional capital raising in the private markets to strengthen its balance sheet and position the company for execution and U.S. public market readiness.

Peskoe told me to pay close attention to the regulatory fillings utilities make for their data center projects, not just what they tell the press or investors.","The “Supreme Court” of energy in Georgia

There are only 10 states in the country that hold elections for a Public Service Commission, a small group of regulators who oversee utility companies, and Georgia is one of them. As Charles Hua, the executive director of the nonprofit PowerLines, recently put it, these officials are the “Supreme Court justices” of energy. They preside over what kinds of infrastructure gas and electric utilities will build, where they’ll build it, and how much rates will go up as a result.

The election in Georgia is long overdue after being held up by a lawsuit the last two election cycles. Two of the five current commissioners have served three extra years without being re-elected by voters. During that time, the commission has approved six rate increases for customers of Georgia Power, the largest utility in the state, in part to pay for major cost overruns on new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle. Now Georgia Power is proposing a major expansion of natural gas power — about 10 nuclear reactors’ worth — mostly to meet data center demand.

The two seats are held by Republicans Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. They are being challenged by Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johson, who have vowed to push for Georgia Power to meet demand with clean energy.

Battle for the soul of electricity affordability in New Jersey and Virginia

Energy costs are at the center of the governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia this year, and Democrats and Republicans are making opposite arguments about how to lower them. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill has vowed to freeze utility rates and clear red tape to “open the floodgates on new cheaper and cleaner energy projects,” including solar, battery storage, and nuclear. Her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, thinks the key to lower prices is pulling out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 13-state cap and trade program that incentivizes cleaner power generation and raises money for climate-friendly projects. He also wants to repeal the state’s electrification goals for vehicles and buildings and ban offshore wind development.

A similar fight is playing out in Virginia, although there it’s tied more to the state’s rapidly multiplying data centers. Virginia is already home to 13% of global data center capacity, with more coming online. A recent state legislative report warns that customers are looking at increases of $14 to $37 per month by 2040 as a result.

The Democratic candidate for governor, former U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger, wants to expand solar and wind power and invest in building efficiency. She’s also advocated for data centers to “pay their fair share” of new energy infrastructure, and said she will encourage them to pilot advanced clean technologies like small modular nuclear reactors and hydrogen. She’s running against Winson Earle Sears, the current lieutenant governor of Virginia, who has questioned the reliability of renewable energy, arguing for an all-of-the-above strategy that includes “clean coal.” While “beautiful clean coal,” it may be one of Trump’s favorite energy sources, the reality is, it’s still just coal.

The governor’s seat isn’t the only one that’s up for grabs in Virginia. Whoever wins will need the House of Delegates on their side. Democrats currently have a razor thin 51-seat majority, and all 100 seats are on offer. Even a blue wave in the House doesn’t guarantee strong climate action, however, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Climate Cabinet. “Which candidates win will determine whether Virginia expands on” its climate law, the Clean Economy Act, “or backslides,” the group said in a “races to watch” memo.

Public transit for a fast-growing city

Voters in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the whole of Mecklenburg County, will be asked whether to increase their sales tax by 1% to fund new transportation projects. Roughly 60% of the estimated $20 billion raised by the tax will go toward the expansion of rail and bus service. Charlotte is among the fastest-growing cities in the country. During a legislative hearing this summer, State Senator Mujtaba Mohammad said an average of 130 people move to the area each day. “We are experiencing longer commutes, more car accidents, higher car insurance premiums, more pedestrian-related accidents and less revenue to address our crumbling critical infrastructure,"" he said.

The Charlotte Area Transit System finalized a new long-range plan this year to foster “transit-oriented communities,” by increasing bus frequency, extending service hours, adding microtransit options to underserved neighborhoods, and adding 43 miles of new rail. But the plan is only possible with funding from the sales tax.

Sales tax increases are a common way to raise money for public transit systems — legislators in California recently voted to put a sales tax increase on next year’s ballot to address a looming fiscal cliff for transit in the Bay Area. Illinois also voted last week to increase the sales tax in the Chicago area by 0.025% to raise money for its ailing transit system, among other measures.

Other fights to watch:

A few smaller elections where climate is also on the ballot this year, according to Climate Cabinet:

The Whatcom County Council, in Washington State, which in 2021, became the first local government in the country to prohibit new oil refineries, coal plants, and fossil fuel shipment facilities. There’s currently a slim 4-3 pro-climate majority on the council, and Climate Cabinet warns that if that majority holds, it will “send a signal to other pro-climate county leaders around the country that their courage won’t cost them their seats.”

Jacob Frey, the current mayor of Minneapolis, pissed off climate advocates earlier this year when he vetoed a local carbon fee passed by the city council, arguing it was not legally sound. The council overrode the veto, but the fee was ultimately scaled back from $452 per ton to $5 per ton after a study by city staff found the lower number to be safer from legal challenges. Climate Cabinet is watching for whether candidates for the mayor’s office and city council who support carbon fees will win or be punished, and “whether anti-climate candidates gain more of a foothold in the city.”

A full decade has passed since the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, and in that time the world has avoided the most catastrophic scientific projections. In 2015, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, projected that global average temperatures could increase by as much as 7.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century without significant shifts in policy and advancements in technology. Now, the Rhodium Group estimates that warming is highly unlikely to exceed 3.9 degrees by 2100, and could be limited to 2 degrees.

The numbers themselves are not hopeful. This is a vast range in terms of the potential impacts implied, and even 2 degrees of warming should not be considered “little.” The IPCC estimates that compared with a scenario that limits warming to 1.5 degrees, more than twice as many people would be exposed to severe heat at least once every five years in a world 2 degrees warmer; ice-free summers in the Arctic would occur 10 times more often; the number of plant, animal, and insect species that lose at least half their habitat would be two to three times larger; and crop yields and fisheries would suffer roughly twice the losses.

Putting those dire projections aside, what’s interesting is that this 2- to 3.9-degree range is about the same as what the Rhodium Group forecast when it published its first Climate Outlook report in 2023. Also relatively unchanged: a finding that global power sector emissions will peak within the next decade, and that total emissions will likely remain constant or subtly decline through 2060, but then go up again as Global South countries see more rapid economic development in the latter half of the century.

The reason the numbers haven’t changed much, despite some seemingly dramatic policy changes that have occurred in the interim, has to do with Rhodium’s unique approach to projecting the future.

Many of the reports that come out around this time, such as the UN’s annual Emissions Gap Report, try to assess where the world is headed based on currently enacted policies as well as pledges, such as the “nationally determined contributions” that countries submit to the UN. Those might include promises like, “We’ll build X quantity of renewable energy by 2030,” or “We’ll protect X amount of our forests.” The models assume that these policies and pledges are fixed. They do not contemplate future ramp-ups or potential reversals. They also use fixed assumptions about GDP and population growth, oil prices, technology costs, etc.

A recent report by Wood Mackenzie, for example, estimates that temperatures will climb to 2.6 degrees by 2060, and then models a few other potential discrete scenarios, including one that shows what it would take to limit warming to 2 degrees.

The limitation of this approach is that the trajectory for each variable these models use is deeply uncertain, Hannah Pitt, one of the authors of the Rhodium report, told me. “Even a small change in GDP growth can have really big implications for emissions — likewise for oil prices and renewable costs and all that,” she said. “We try to take into consideration the wide range of uncertainty we have in the future of those core drivers of emissions.” That requires modeling thousands of scenarios with different combinations of how those underlying drivers might evolve.

Then, rather than assuming that policies on the books today remain static, Rhodium uses data on how climate and energy policy has historically responded to economic inputs like oil prices and GDP growth, in different parts of the world to project how policy might change going forward, using a carbon price as a proxy for policy ambition.

This approach takes into account such a wide range of possibilities that the results aren’t likely to change much year to year. Both in 2023 and now, the modeling incorporated the prospect that a Trump administration or something like it could reverse some progress, and that energy demand could soar. “We are looking at the long-term evolution of policy, not the administration fluctuations,” Pitt explained. It would take a true step-change in policy or a major technological breakthrough to produce a noticeable change in the trajectory, she said.

What are those breakthroughs? At this point, they aren’t a mystery. Cheaper clean firm power — like advanced nuclear, fusion, or geothermal — would be a huge help. Solutions for decarbonizing flying and shipping are also on the list. We also need to make it affordable to produce iron, steel, cement, and petrochemicals with far fewer emissions.

On the policy side, bending the curve might mean something like stricter electric vehicle requirements. As mentioned earlier, economic development in the Global South is expected to shift emissions back upward later this century — in part because if policy evolves the way it has historically, and if more and more people around the world are buying cars, the cars may not be 100% electric, and emissions from transport will go up.

None of this is to say that the Trump administration’s actions will have no effect on warming. Recall the report’s expansive range of future warming scenarios of 2 to 3.9 degrees — it’s very possible that policies enacted today will push the world closer to one or the other. A separate recent Rhodium study that dives into the specifics of U.S. policies found that emissions in 2035 could be 0.8 to 1.2 gigatonnes higher than what the group projected in the same report last year, largely due to Trump’s policies.

It should be comforting that one administration can’t veer the world too far off course — although by that same logic, we can’t expect a single administration to shift projections in a positive direction, either. A ""breakthrough"" in something like decarbonized cement will likely happen over years, through a feedback loop of sustained policy support and technological development.

There is no “too late” when it comes to addressing the technology and policy gaps the report highlights, Pitt said “Of course, the sooner the better,” she said. “But the difference between a 2.8-degree future and a 2.5-degree future saves lives. So the effort to drive these technology costs down is worthwhile, even if it doesn’t happen on the timeline that we would hope.”

The project was announced Thursday by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who focused heavily on the projected economic benefits of the projects while attempting to head off criticism that it would lead to higher costs. In the first sentence of her press release, she said that the project will “create more than 2,500 union construction jobs, more than 450 jobs on site and 1,500 more across the county.” Also, it “will be one of the most advanced AI infrastructure facilities in the U.S., especially when it comes to its efficient use of land, water, and power.” Oh, and it “will not require any additional power generation to operate.”

The utility set to power the project, DTE Energy, released its quarterly earnings Thursday, as well, which described a 1.4-gigawatt project it had already executed. In a presentation for analysts and investors, DTE said that the new data center would pay for “required storage through a 15-year energy storage contract,” and that it would “support affordability for existing customers as excess capacity is sold.”

On a call with analysts, DTE Energy chief executive Joi Harris further asserted that the project has “meaningful affordability benefits to our existing customers.” As the data center ramps up, she explained, it can use existing excess capacity on the grid. By the time it reaches full strength, it will enjoy the benefits of “nearly $2 billion of incremental energy storage investments and additional tolling agreements to support this data center load.”

Who will pay for energy storage and tolling agreements? A DTE spokesperson, Jill Wilmot, clarified in an email that “DTE will meet the 1.4 gigawatts of demand from the data center with existing capacity,” and that “new energy storage will be built — and paid for by the customer” — that is, Stargate — “to help augment times of peak demand, ensuring continued reliability for all customers.”

Data centers help spread out the fixed costs of the grid more widely, Wilmot went on. “Data center development in DTE’s electric service territory will not increase customer rates,” she said, adding that “DTE is ensuring the data center will absorb all new costs required to serve them — in this case, battery storage. Our customers will not pay.”

That said, Wilmot did not answer a question about whether there would be any network or transmission upgrades necessary. She told me that she expected DTE would make a filing for the project with Michigan regulators later Friday.

Consumer advocates were skeptical of the utility’s claims. “When you are talking about new demand as massive as what would be created by this data center, we can’t afford to just take DTE at its word that other customers won’t be affected,” Amy Bandyk, the executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, told me in an email. She called for Michigan regulators “to require DTE and the data center customer to agree on a tariff specific to that customer that includes robust protections against cost-shifting and provisions that any incremental costs will be solely covered by this new customer.”

More utilities and data center developers are trying to explicitly head off claims that data centers are driving up electricity rates. In another recent data center announcement for a multi-billion-dollar project in West Memphis, Arkansas, Google and the Arkansas Economic Development Commission said that “Google will be covering the full energy costs for the West Memphis facility and will be ramping up new solar energy and battery storage resources for the facility.”

Drew Marsh, the chief executive of Entergy, the utility serving the project, confirmed on an earnings call earlier this week that Google “will protect energy affordability for existing customers by covering the full cost of powering the data center in West Memphis.” He also said that in Mississippi, where Amazon has announced a $16 billion project, “customer rates would be 16% lower than they otherwise would have been due to these large customers.”

So why are utilities — which, after all, get paid by ratepayers for the investments they make in their systems — telling their investors about all the money they’re not charging ratepayers?

In short, utilities and developers know they’re on political thin ice, and they don’t want to kill the golden goose of data center development by stoking a populist backlash to rising electricity prices that could result in either government-mandated slashing of their investment plans, caps on the rates they can charge, or both.

“Looking ahead, we anticipate the central issue will be how utilities protect residential customers from costs associated with large-load customers, or else face potential consequences from regulators,” Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell said in a note to clients earlier this week. “Data centers, and their associated load, have the potential” to “cause political push-back.”

This is already happening across the country. The frontrunner in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, for example, has promised to freeze electricity rates, which have seen a sharp runup in recent years. Indiana Governor Mike Braun, a Republican, said in a recent statement that “we can’t take it anymore,” in reference to rate hikes. Indiana has also rejected a number of proposed data centers, as I covered earlier this year.

This means that utilities will have to think carefully about how and to whom they allocate costs arising from data center development and operation.

“Allocation of cost will be pivotal as the current ’pocketbook issues driving a lot of the U.S. political debate could create some challenging regulatory outcomes should data centers put pressure on customer bills,” Crowdell wrote.

But what’s said in an announcement to the media or to investors may not always reflect the reality of utility cost allocation, Harvard Law School professor Ari Peskoe told me.

“Don’t trust a utility press release or comment from a CEO of a monopoly that says Hey, these rates are good for you,” he told me.

Peskoe told me to pay close attention to the regulatory fillings utilities make for their data center projects, not just what they tell the press or investors. “Are the utilities themselves actually making these claims as strongly as their CEOs are making them in investor calls? And then once we do have a regulatory process about it, are they being transparent in that regulatory process? Are they hiding a lot of details behind the confidentiality claims so that only the participants in that proceeding actually get to see the details?”

Peskoe also pointed to other costs that might be incurred in the course of data center development that get socialized across the rate base but aren’t necessarily directly tied to any one development, like the transmission and network upgrades, that have contributed to large price increases in the PJM Interconnection territory.

“What you’re looking for is a firm contract that ensures the data center is going to be paying for every penny that the utility is incurring to provide service, so that it’s paying for all the new infrastructure that’s serving it,” Peskoe said. Without that, all you have is a press release.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjAzNDI0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxODQwNzc4OH0.XbJ25MPq8ery7SGqxNCPmBzNCchrvZUoTKKwApK4fnk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:49.623786

Historical insights feature the legacy of the U.S. inception of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the 1970s that started to estimate the economic impetus of every environmental policy. Europe has a long-standing tradition to consider environmental aspects in economic productivity calculus—for instance—if one considers projects like the wider ‘Green Wave’ endeavors that tact economic flows in harmony with environmental conditions. Under the Joseph Biden administration the U.S. started the Green New Deal (GND). The European pendant is the European Green Deal (EGD) that incorporates green policies in every aspect of the governance of economic growth. In particular, the Next Generation European Union Sustainable Finance Taxonomy is measuring the economic impact of all major productivity sectors of the economy. The New European Bauhaus integrates sustainable and inclusive living in every aspect of human lives. The U.S. President Joseph Biden administration has launched a large-scale plan to bring nature into economics and assess changes in environmental and ecosystem services in cost–benefit analyses. The U.S. initiative to create environmental-economic statistics targets at measuring natural resources as economic assets. Modern satellite imagery empowering the Geographic Information System (GIS) advancements and geo-engineering are additional scientific advancements to cartograph and change natural conditions for economic outcomes. While the Donald Trump administration is pushing for efficiency in governmental endeavors, the corporate and finance world is taking over environmental concerns. In the finance and governance worlds, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment strategies have leveraged into a worldwide trend in most recent decades. In addition, the International Monetary Fund’s research unit investigates regional climate change economic impacts. Scientific advancements, like the Columbia University-housed Mapping Climate Justice project, calculates the expected economic changes due to climate change. On the global level, the World Bank’s Changing Wealth of Nations Report integrates natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions into international accounting. The Global Green New Deal (GGND) integrates many different sustainability aspects in industrial economic action and human living. The ambitious United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) round up the overarching environmental economics endeavors on the global stage. In their entirety, all these initiatives and efforts echo an appreciation of environmental protection in harmony with economic activity. In a climate of geopolitical tensions, it is to note that future wealth of nations can be based on the conservation of natural resources. Climate flexibility and environmental stability are key comparative advantages that countries can ground their economic prosperity on. In the eye of global warming, the age of wealth in nature is born indicating growing need to consider natural environments for strategic partnerships and alliances.",https://static-content.springer.com/cover/book/978-3-031-87971-5.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:12:58.251483

The strong Nordic focus on green energy has made the region a technological frontrunner with a high degree of green power in the mix. Municipalities are increasingly looking for private investors to help improve installations, particularly in fibre and district heating and cooling, creating opportunities for agile and local GPs.

The region is also ahead on carbon capture and storage, providing investors with exposure to a technology which may become a significant future asset class. Ultimately, the key to success in the Nordics is about keeping an ear close to the ground, says Erik Botnevik, Infranode partner and the GP’s country manager in

Norway.

Which Nordic assets face the most pressing need for external finance?

The average Nordic distribution system operator (DSO) has a regulated asset base, which will probably double in the next five years. The question is whether this need for finance will be met by current owners, which would typically be the municipalities or the counties, or if they might need to look to private markets. We’re slowly seeing more acceptance for the latter, and hence more opportunities to invest in the electricity grid sector.

In general, this is a fragmented and publicly owned market with a handful of large companies regionally and private capital to date predominantly in Sweden and Finland. Some might merge with a neighbour to improve earnings and credit but will still require external financing because the investment requirements are significant. Electrical grids are essential and sensitive, so the preferred investor tends to be local pension capital. But there are pockets of private ownership.

Waste incineration plants and bioenergy plants need investments to reach net-zero targets, basically by capturing the CO2 emissions and storing them, alternatively converting production to heat pumps. That requires significant investment and provides an opportunity for infrastructure funds and local institutions to invest.

Fibre is a different story. The fibre networks in Denmark, Sweden and Norway are very mature. These networks have been built since the early 2000s by local utilities who are now more open to monetise. This provides investible opportunities, especially for those willing to enter into co-ownership structures. In Finland, there’s a lower degree of fibre penetration, so the focus is more on build-out.

With all the Nordic countries now members of NATO, there’s also the new 5 percent target for annual defence spending. The vast chunk of accompanying investments will be defence-related and come out of national budgets.

However, there will still be a need to build infrastructure capacity. At the centre of this theme is the effect on the more usual core infra sectors such as digital, energy and transport, as well as what additional investment requirements we see – for example, in social infrastructure.

In terms of new sectors, there will be a need to provide garrisons, garages and depots as well as defence-related education. Denmark has been quite vocal about its intention to partner with long-term institutional capital for the capacity build-up, and similar considerations are emerging in the other Nordic countries.

How can infrastructure managers access public-private partnership deals in the Nordics?

Nordic governments are generally well-financed on a country level. The story is a little bit different at the municipal and county level where the vast majority of partnerships actually take place. When the municipal sector faces greater budgetary constraints and is required to ensure a higher level of resiliency during higher-interest-rate environments, it’s harder to get projects financed. They also need financing not only to meet the new requirements, but also to make up for a legacy of insufficient investment in maintenance.

To access these deals, first and foremost, you need to be present locally. Though you can access large assets from the outside, on the municipal level, you need to take the time to engage with municipalities. Bear in mind that Norway alone has more than 400 municipalities; Finland and Sweden have around 300; Denmark nearly 100; and Iceland 62.

Additionally, you’re dealing with a fragmented market as the Nordics comprise five countries with a population of 28 million in a region larger than the UK, Germany, Belgium and France combined. This region has 100 DSOs and each country will have maybe 50-100 heating companies and 3,000-4,000 schools. This makes the region a small-to-mid-cap market and investors need to be out there talking and building relationships with local energy and utility companies as well as municipalities.

Everything we do is done in collaboration with local authorities and regulators. When municipalities want to execute on extending the heating network or ensure that everyone has access to fibre, or if the goal is to reduce CO2 emissions from waste incineration plants, they tend to be quite pragmatic when looking for solutions. If that means teaming up with an infrastructure fund, they’ll do that.

One important asset class here is heating, which includes waste-to-heat and heat pumps, often in tandem. Key triggers for changing ownership and requirements, as well as seeking new and external capital, are usually the need for upgrades and improvements to an asset. Some want to include cooling solutions, which require investments, and many heating companies with incinerators or biofuel plants are working hard on their net-zero agendas. This creates good conditions for carbon capture projects which need financing.

From this comes an interest from the public side in seeking partnerships and alternative structures. We’ve seen this happen more and more over the past couple of years, and this will accelerate as more assets seek to remove or reduce their CO2 emissions and footprint, both from a regulatory and a commercial perspective.

What is the current market for Nordic carbon capture and storage?

It’s developing. For example, Infranode has already invested in the Hafslund Oslo Celsio district heating and cooling company, which has a waste-to-energy plant with carbon capture facility under construction. FID was taken earlier this year, and by 2029, CO2 will be captured from the plant and stored under the North Sea.

Further, three biomass plants with carbon capture technology (BECCS) are under construction: two in Denmark, Asnæsværket and Avedøreværket – both owned by Ørsted – and Stockholm Exergi.

Reverse auctions for carbon capture contracts are coming up in Denmark with awards scheduled for next April. Sweden had its first reverse auction earlier this year, which means that there’s likely to be another couple of very large carbon capture projects in the pipeline. And that’s likely to take FID over the next year or so.

The expectation is that more mid-sized projects will follow as the carbon capture value chain matures and there’s a clear facilitation of transport and storage of CO2. We expect to see many carbon capture-related projects annually in every Nordic market within a few years.

In common with other emerging green technologies, subsidies will be needed for the immediate future. However, waste incineration plants typically account for 15-20 percent of total emissions in a Nordic city. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to curb this source of carbon emissions.

As for the investment models, some utilities will want to invite investors in as partners, and some will want joint ventures for the carbon capture facility in isolation. This was, for example, what happened in Denmark.

Increasingly, the business case for investments in carbon capture and storage relating to district heating is about future-proofing the production cost of a heating company that utilises and owns a waste-to-heat incinerator. In Hafslund Celsio, this was made possible by a combination of government grants and selling carbon credits. This also reduced the risk for the owners of the incineration plant.

How do LPs rate the strong Nordic focus on sustainability?

Nordic LPs are very familiar with this approach and many are, for example, invested in companies currently building carbon capture plants.

Non-Nordic LPs also get the benefit of having exposure to the region. They get to learn directly from assets which are at the global forefront of the net-zero journey, such as carbon capture projects. They also get exposure to markets with some of the highest levels of electrification and digitalisation in the world, as well as see the impact on grids and power prices from that electrification. I truly believe this is widely appreciated and of particular interest to LPs.

How important is the presence of carbon credits for the waste-to-heat or biofuel-to-heat business case?

They are very important. Carbon credits from carbon capture projects provide a secure revenue stream, which means that these businesses are becoming more contracted in nature. At the moment, you can enter into very long-term contracts that are eight to 10 years in length. This term fits the risk profile of the overall business, and the contracts are also now of sufficient size to make a real difference.

In Hafslund Celsio, we’ve signed long-term agreements with the two leading buyers of carbon credits globally, which are Microsoft and the Frontier Consortium. The carbon credit market is currently voluntary and rather dominated by those two institutions. Nordic industrials have only invested in carbon credits to a limited extent so far, but this will happen.

We also believe there will be new projects as the development of the carbon credit market is combined with the lower construction costs as a consequence of scale, experience and more modular construction.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2025/10/T5_CO2.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:11:47.642046

Earlier this year, the EPA said in a news release that cuts across the agency had already saved $748.8 million.
Reductions to federal-level environmental research make it more difficult to systematically collect and analyze national data on pollution, climate-warming gases, and air and water quality.
Taking after their model, we could form an internationally funded climate initiative that brings together NGOs, research institutes, governments, and foundations to preserve environmental research.
Whether through state-led coalitions or partnerships with nonprofit organizations, we can ensure that critical environmental research continues.","Like many communities along the East Coast, the town of Crisfield, Maryland, has a flooding problem. As the climate changes, storms are growing more intense, and rising ocean waters are increasingly pushing into low-lying areas, causing chronic flooding.

Residents have been working on plans to address the problem, and starting in 2022, they received a boost from researchers at the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, E&E News reported (paywall).

“EPA’s research project in Crisfield identified marshes and other natural buffers that would help reduce storm surge and flood damages,” the outlet reported. “The work was critical, city officials said, as the city government has no engineer on staff and a limited budget.”

But the Trump administration halted EPA support for Crisfield and many other communities when it began eliminating the Office of Research and Development, or ORD, this summer, and launching a new environmental research arm in the Office of the Administrator. The reorganization was completed last month, an EPA spokeswoman told E&E News (paywall).

In its previous form, ORD employed more than 1,000 people and ran 10 national laboratories across the country that researched air pollution and other environmental threats. During the reorganization, many ORD scientists accepted early retirement, while others were reassigned to positions elsewhere across the agency.

Earlier this year, the EPA said in a news release that cuts across the agency had already saved $748.8 million.

However, these short-term savings come at far greater long-term costs, both financially and in terms of human health, infrastructure, and national security. Reductions to federal-level environmental research make it more difficult to systematically collect and analyze national data on pollution, climate-warming gases, and air and water quality. With fewer researchers, it becomes harder to justify or enforce regulations on major polluters. And without a robust scientific workforce, the U.S. will struggle to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies like wildfires, chemical spills, or extreme weather, putting more lives at risk.

“This is total victory for the polluters right now,” Thomas Burke, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University and former EPA science adviser, told ScienceInsider.

Solution: Establish an independent environmental science institute

One solution would be for a coalition of states, universities, and philanthropies to establish a nonpartisan scientific institution. Such a body could conduct independent climate and environmental research better insulated from political swings, and ensure that critical data and analysis remain available to protect public health and the environment.

This model is not unique. Canada’s experience shows how regional governments and independent institutions can step up when federal leadership falters. In 2012, Prime Minister Stephen Harper cut funding for the Experimental Lakes Area, a globally recognized freshwater research site. Rather than let the facility close, the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba partnered with the International Institute for Sustainable Development to take over funding and operations, keeping vital research on water pollution, climate change, and ecosystem health alive.

We may also take inspiration from an organization that was formed in response to an immunization crisis. When they realized that nearly 30 million children lacked proper vaccination in developing countries, a group of people (among them Bill Gates) decided to found the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, an internationally funded organization that researches vaccines and improves access to immunization around the world. In the past 25 years, they have helped vaccinate 1.1 billion children. Taking after their model, we could form an internationally funded climate initiative that brings together NGOs, research institutes, governments, and foundations to preserve environmental research.

Without the EPA’s research arm, we will be flying blind as we face threats from toxic hazards to rising seas. Whether through state-led coalitions or partnerships with nonprofit organizations, we can ensure that critical environmental research continues. In an era of proliferating climate threats, we have a moral obligation to preserve this scientific capacity.",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1125_flood_1600.png?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-03 11:11:43.360522

Comeau joins Torus after more than 25 years in the electric utility industry, including senior leadership roles at PacifiCorp, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary and one of the largest regulated utilities in the Western United States, serving more than 2.1 million customers across six states.

Most recently, he served as Vice President of Customer Experience and Innovation at PacifiCorp, leading several of the company's successful programs, including pioneering energy storage and grid flexibility initiatives. Under his direction, these programs helped customers save millions of dollars, reduced system load, and were recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as a leading example of the nation’s top virtual power plant — or VPP — program.

As a pioneer and thought leader in virtual power plants, Comeau led groundbreaking demand response programs that strengthened grid reliability during peak hours and advanced some of the country’s earliest large-scale VPP projects. This work gave him a unique perspective on how utilities and customers can modernize the grid together. Earlier in his career, he held positions at Commonwealth Edison in Chicago and has served on multiple industry and community boards, including the Salt Lake Chamber Board of Governors and Junior Achievement of Utah.

“Bill brings a proven playbook to our utility customer base that combines VPP best practices and a modern approach that enables utility operators to move quickly and install Torus systems on the grid economically,"" said Nate Walkingshaw, CEO and Co-founder of Torus. “He knows what utilities need to deliver reliable, affordable power while navigating the grid’s transformation. His track record of deploying grid-scale innovation and making it work for millions of customers makes him the ideal person to lead our utility strategy as we scale nationwide.”

In this role, Comeau will lead utility strategy and partnerships, working directly with utilities across the country to integrate Torus’ hybrid inertial-based battery systems into utility operations, grid planning, and grid-scale deployments. Torus systems combine high-speed mechanical flywheels with advanced batteries, delivering instantaneous frequency and voltage stability, and sustained energy support. His arrival comes as utilities nationwide face unprecedented pressure to add new capacity while maintaining grid stability — a challenge Torus technology is designed and engineered to address.

While Comeau’s initial focus will be on utility collaboration, Torus systems are also deployed for data centers and commercial and industrial customers that require highly reliable, non-combustion power solutions. This combination of utility and customer applications gives Torus a unique position in strengthening grid stability across both sides of the meter.

“I’ve seen firsthand how Torus technology strengthens the grid,” said Bill Comeau, Chief Utility Officer at Torus. “Utilities are looking for stable capacity they can deploy at scale and cost-effectively. Torus delivers that, and I’m excited to help utilities across the country deliver low-cost energy storage solutions.”

The announcement follows Torus’ expansion into GigaOne, its new 540,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, designed to enable large-scale production and delivery of its systems nationwide. Located in Salt Lake City near I-80, I-15, and major rail transport lines, the facility underscores Torus’ commitment to U.S. manufacturing and a secure domestic supply chain for critical energy infrastructure.

Despite this, global incentives remain misaligned: Fossil fuels received over $1.1 trillion in subsidies in 2023.

Outdated incentives hold back prosperity. With realigned incentives, governments not only bring the benefits of the clean energy economy to their countries but also address market distortions, provide predictable and aligned global policy and give businesses clarity and confidence to invest in clean technologies.

Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe are surrounded on all sides by reminders of their vulnerability to a changing climate.
It all came together last December when the Walker River Paiute Tribe was awarded $20 million in funding from the EPA’s Community Change Grant.
The Walker River Reservation spans 325,000 square acres across three Nevada counties – Mineral, Churchill, and Lyon – but nearly every home is built along the flood-prone river.
The median household income for the Walker River Paiute Tribe is around $40,000 – about 53% lower than the median household income for Nevada.","Joseph Frank was one of the first firefighters to respond to a massive wildfire that broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June last year.

Temperatures that month were well above average, according to the National Weather Service. It was 90 degrees in Schurz, Nevada that day – 5 degrees hotter than normal for the area – when a lead-acid battery from a Bureau of Indian Affairs building overheated and “kind of blew up,” said Frank.

Fueled by vegetation cooked by record heat and drought in the months prior, the fire quickly spread across 65 acres. It took two days to fully contain, cutting off a portion of the U.S. Route 95 and causing the evacuation of all the tribe’s administrative offices.

“We ended up calling out all the municipalities to help us, just because of how intense it was,” Frank said of the June 20 fire.

Wildfire risk in Schurz is higher than 60% of communities in the U.S., according to data from the U.S. Forest Service. But the Walker River Paiute Tribe’s current water system, built in the 1960s, wasn’t designed to provide the water pressure needed to combat the large wildfires the tribe sees now.

It’s one of the major infrastructure problems that could be solved with a $20 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded to the tribe last winter. But the funding would never come.

Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe are surrounded on all sides by reminders of their vulnerability to a changing climate.

They see it in the river banks eroded by record floods and the fire scorched landscape. They see it in the wilting pinon trees and waning pine nut harvest. They see it in the infrastructure that can’t keep up and rising power bills they can’t afford.

Those observations have also turned into plans, and those plans into grant applications for projects that would prepare the tribe and residents of Schurz for a more extreme climate.

It all came together last December when the Walker River Paiute Tribe was awarded $20 million in funding from the EPA’s Community Change Grant. The grant was one of hundreds awarded under the Environmental and Climate Justice Program – a $2.8 billion financial assistance program created by the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden.

With the funds, the tribe could execute a multi-year climate resiliency plan to deliver water, energy, and food infrastructure to about 1,200 tribal members who live on the Walker River Reservation.

In total, 150 homes would be weatherized and upgraded for energy efficiency and climate resiliency – about 30% of all existing homes on the reservation.

Swamp coolers that aren’t designed to work in 100 degree temperatures would be swapped out for central air conditioning. Insulation and windows that fail to keep out rising heat would be replaced. Rooftops would be repaired and covered in solar panels and battery storage that could keep medication and food refrigerated during summer blackouts.

No one would be left out. The funding would also cover the remaining cost of a planned Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub – a fully electric and solar powered building with battery storage to shelter the town’s most vulnerable residents during weather emergencies, like floods and extreme heat waves, while increasing food and medication security.

The grant would also fund the last leg of a water infrastructure project that would support dozens of new fire hydrants on the reservation and secure reliable clean water for 425 existing homes and over 100 future homes.

But the January inauguration of President Donald Trump brought new priorities, and a White House crusade against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs funded by his predecessor’s 2022 climate law.

Within five months, on May 1, the $20 million Community Change Grant was officially terminated by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, along with more than 780 other environmental justice grants as part of Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI across the government.

The tribe only used about $70,000 from the grant before losing access to funding that would have helped the rural community adapt to a rapidly changing climate.

Multiple nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the EPA, challenging the legality of abruptly terminating congressionally approved funds, but as the case moves through the court system it’s unclear when – if ever – the funds will be restored.

Fires and floods

Melenie McFalls, the newly elected chair of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, was a month into the job when the EPA first cut off the tribe’s access to the Community Change Grant on Jan. 29. It was one of several grants the tribe would lose in the wake of Trump’s efforts to slash spending and remake the federal government.

Hundreds of emails piled up as McFalls contacted every state and congressional leader she could think of to restore the tribe’s funding.

“I was focused solely on funding cuts, everything else was left on the table because we rely on grant funding. We had to fight for that,” McFalls said in her office, the one she had to evacuate during the wildfire last year with the rest of the tribe’s council.

“We were wondering ‘what else is going to get cut? What’s going to be next? What’s going to happen?’ We had no idea,” McFalls said.

Thirteen years ago, the last time McFalls was chair of the tribe, they didn’t have a climate adaptation plan or an emergency plan for major floods and wildfires. Since then she’s seen the impacts of climate change piling up on the reservation.

The year before the fire, on May 17, 2023, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) found that flooding on the Walker River caused by record-breaking rain and snowmelt created enough structural damage to the Weber Dam seven miles northwest of Schurz that it “could have potentially progressed into a life-threatening event” for the tribe.

The Walker River flooded for 48 consecutive days between May and June that year, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources. It was partially caused by a sudden mid-to-late May warm up that quickly melted record-breaking snowpack in the Walker Basin. By July, stream flows into the Weber Reservoir were seven times the average for the time of year.

About a month after finding the damage in the dam, the BIA told the tribe during a community meeting that if the dam’s spillway failed they would have to prepare for more than three olympic sized pools worth of flooding a minute until the reservoir leveled out. The whole town of Schurz would need to be evacuated within 24 hours.

“It just wiped out our riverbanks. Took most of the land around it. Water was going up to some peoples porches. It was kind of scary to see that happen,” McFalls said.

The Walker River Reservation spans 325,000 square acres across three Nevada counties – Mineral, Churchill, and Lyon – but nearly every home is built along the flood-prone river. That’s because the reservation’s water system uses a gravity-fed storage tank located at the top of a hill that can only move water down to the lowest point in the valley where the river runs.

Before it was terminated, nearly $2 million from the Community Change Grant was reserved for a planned water infrastructure project that would improve water pressure and allow more than hundred homes to be built at higher elevations further from the river.

“If we could build higher up and we’re out of the flood zone, that’s one less thing for us to worry about,” said Frank, the firefighter, who also serves as the tribe’s project manager.

Heat and energy

By the next year, the precipitation that flooded Walker River in 2023 was gone. Mineral, Lyon, and Churchill counties only received about a quarter of the rain and snow they typically do from April to June, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The drought was accelerated by record-breaking heat in 2024, the hottest year on record. But record-breaking heat is becoming the norm. The past decade has been the hottest in two centuries of record-keeping, NOAA reports.

Heat waves are also becoming the norm. Researchers at NASA found that summer heat waves in the U.S. have roughly doubled in number since 1980, increasing from an average of two to four per month.

Rising temperatures have helped Nevada claim two of the fastest warming cities in the nation – Reno and Las Vegas – but rural areas haven’t escaped the heat.When the fire broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June the nearest weather tower (about 25 miles away) recorded average monthly temperatures 5 degrees above normal.

Since 1950, average temperatures on the Walker River Reservation have increased by three degrees, according to Native Climate, a U.S. Department of Agriculture funded research project to support climate adaptation efforts in Native American communities.

Days over 100 degrees have also tripled on the reservation from an average of five days in 1950, to 20 days in 2025. If emissions continue on their current trajectory, there could be about 40 days over 100 degrees on the Walker River Reservation by the end of the century.

“You can see a huge increase in the number of degree days over 100 degrees,” said Maureen McCarthy, a research professor at Desert Research Institute, who led the Native Climate project.

“The extremes are becoming more extreme, in addition to the average temperatures changing,” McCarthy said. “That’s a big impact. We’re not designed to function at 100 degrees.”

The Walker River Housing Department reports that about 44% of homes on the reservation rely on swamp coolers, but evaporative-cooling appliances become less effective at 100 degrees and above. The cost of replacing one with central cooling is also a barrier for low-income households.

Ageing infrastructure only makes adapting to rising temperatures and extreme weather more difficult. The Walker River Housing Department reports that two-thirds of homes on the reservation built before 2000 have older, deteriorating roofs and windows that must be replaced to improve climate resilience.

Households on the reservation are already burdened with energy costs that are 24% higher than the state average, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Low-Income Energy Affordability Data tool. They also spend twice as much of their income on energy costs compared to the state average.

Replacing inefficient appliances that increase energy costs can also be difficult for lower-income households, including many on the reservation. The median household income for the Walker River Paiute Tribe is around $40,000 – about 53% lower than the median household income for Nevada. Unemployment is about twice as high, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.

Funding from the Community Change Grant would have covered the purchase of energy efficient heat pumps, water heaters, induction cooktops, electric ovens, and new dryers and refrigerators for 120 homes on the reservation.

“We were devastated when we started hearing all of our funding getting cut because we thought we were going to have these programs,” said Genia Williams, the housing director for the Walker River Paiute Tribe. “There was a lot of work put into it from my grant writers, past chairman, past administrators that worked hard to get this.”

The Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank created by state legislation — also worked with the Walker River Paiute Tribe to secure the Community Change Grant.

Since becoming the housing director a decade ago, Williams said persistent blackouts have also been a challenge for the rural reservation. The reservation sits at the end of an energy grid, and as demands for electricity rise with more intense summer heat blackouts rise too.

A joint survey by the bank and tribe found that 50% of households surveyed reported experiencing blackouts four to nine times per year, while a third reported experiencing blackouts more than 12 times per year. Two-thirds of households reported that power outages generally last between four and eight hours.

Unreliable power is especially hard on elders who have difficulty operating back-up generators, and medically vulnerable residents who rely on ventilators or need to keep medication refrigerated. The Community Change Grant would have allowed the tribe to install solar power and battery storage in 100 of the most vulnerable households.

“We’re just going to have to weather the storm and see what we can come up with and keep moving forward on these things,” Williams said.

Saving graces

The years of planning are not lost, and some of the tribe’s climate resiliency plans are moving forward, but on a smaller scale.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the tribe partial funding in 2022 to build a food distribution center that supports the tribe’s long-term food security and sovereignty plan.

Without the Community Change Grant it likely won’t be at the scale of the Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub the tribe envisioned. The solar panels, battery storage, walk-in refrigerators and freezers the grant would have funded won’t be included in the building, but it’ll take the tribe a step closer to their goal.

“We’ve come through a lot of storms. The one thing about our tribe and our community is that we’ve been able to overcome,” Williams said.

In September, the tribe also broke ground on a water infrastructure project that will add a second water storage tank and nearly 1,600 feet of water lines to the Walker River Reservation. The new “water loop” system will make it possible for about 30 new houses to be built on the reservation, allowing many of the 75 tribal members currently on the housing waitlist to live on their ancestral land and in their community.

Frank, the firefighter, took on the role of project manager for the tribe a year ago. When the EPA revoked the Community Change Grant he said it was “sickening feeling.”

When the EPA revoked the Community Change Grant the tribe had already completed engineering, procurement, and planning for the project. About three- fourths of the total $15.8 million needed for the project was secured from a combination of federal and state funds.

The EPA grant was the last piece of the puzzle. Without it, the tribe would have to dip into their limited reserves. If they didn’t, their remaining funds for the project would be lost.

“We had a deadline to meet the needs of certain funding requirements, and if this was not met, we would have lost the entire project,” said Frank.

The project couldn’t wait. The existing water systems were built like a tree with branches leading off to nowhere; water lines were not connecting to facilities, which led to some situations where hydrants failed to provide water during an emergency.

Frank, the volunteer firefighter, recalls how one of the fire hydrants on the reservation didn’t work during the 2024 fire that burned 65-acres of the reservation.

“These improvements are not just numbers on the page. They represent safer homes, stronger emergency readiness and peace of mind for every community member who depends on the system every day,” Frank said.

In 2019, the Indian Health Service also determined that low water pressure and stagnant water on the Walker River Reservation posed a public health threat in the form of cross contamination, bacterial diseases that breed in stagnant water from the ageing infrastructure.

The Walker River Paiute Tribe is deeply affected by persistent drought conditions and has lacked reliable access to domestic water supplies for generations. But the water loop project would allow the community to build long-term resilience to drought by increasing water reserves and improving the distribution system.

A 2022 report by the U.S. Geological Survey showed that drought has caused evaporation of the surface water levels of Walker River down to Walker Lake, limiting the recharge of groundwater levels. Groundwater in the area supplies at least half of the drinking water for the tribe, according to the EPA.

Generations of tribal members have left to pursue education with the goal of coming back and building up their community, but the infrastructure wasn’t there, said Williams.

“This is home for a lot of people. It’s where they grew up, or where their families grew up. Now they can come back,” Williams said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dsc07901-1024x6831762188615.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=uBs_WXxS,N,,2025-11-03 14:06:46.954529

The data comes from Cloud Theory’s Q3 2025 automotive industry report, “On the Horizon,” released on Oct. 28. The EV sales drop marks one of the sharpest short-term declines in the market’s recent history.

During the week of Sept. 22–28, dealers sold 22,997 EVs. Just one week later, between October 6–12, sales plummeted to 5,929 units.

Inventories Mirror Steep EV Sales Drop

EV inventories have also fallen significantly, shrinking from 196,255 units in June to 104,050 units by October 12—a 47% reduction. General Motors currently holds the largest EV inventory at 39,164 units, followed by Ford with 21,432 and Hyundai with 14,725.

Japanese automakers maintain far smaller EV stock levels, with Nissan holding 419 units, Toyota 435, and Honda 2,138.

“In the short term, domestic automakers are still sitting on sizable EV inventory levels, a result of aggressive investment and production ramp-ups that defined their prior philosophies,” said Rick Wainschel, vice president of data science and analytics for Cloud Theory. “Meanwhile, many foreign OEMs have taken a more cautious approach and have pulled back EV allocations to the U.S. amid policy uncertainty and margin/tariff pressures.”

Broader Market Trends Impact Sales

Cloud Theory’s report also reveals an overall reduction in total vehicle inventory, which dropped to 2.86 million units from a 12-month high of 3.3 million in December 2024. Monthly vehicle sales declined to 1.12 million units in Q3 2025, compared to 1.18 million in Q2 2025.

Despite the downturn, the average marketed price for new vehicles slightly decreased to $49,537 in Q3 2025, down from $49,887 in Q2 2024, according to Cloud Theory. Manufacturers have so far avoided steep price hikes despite tariff pressures.

“Despite a drop in supply over the past six months, Vehicle Movement has remained remarkably steady, leading to higher Turn Rates,” Wainschel said. “Dramatic price increases related to tariffs have not materialized. That has helped the automotive market stay resilient despite dynamics that have been volatile for much of the past year.”",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stock-sales-low-1400.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 11:13:23.564892

Joseph Frank was one of the first firefighters to respond to a massive wildfire that broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June last year.

Temperatures that month were well above average, according to the National Weather Service. It was 90 degrees in Schurz, Nevada that day – 5 degrees hotter than normal for the area – when a lead-acid battery from a Bureau of Indian Affairs building overheated and “kind of blew up,” said Frank.

Fueled by vegetation cooked by record heat and drought in the months prior, the fire quickly spread across 65 acres. It took two days to fully contain, cutting off a portion of the U.S. Route 95 and causing the evacuation of all the tribe’s administrative offices.

“We ended up calling out all the municipalities to help us, just because of how intense it was,” Frank said of the June 20 fire.

Wildfire risk in Schurz is higher than 60% of communities in the U.S., according to data from the U.S. Forest Service. But the Walker River Paiute Tribe’s current water system, built in the 1960s, wasn’t designed to provide the water pressure needed to combat the large wildfires the tribe sees now.

It’s one of the major infrastructure problems that could be solved with a $20 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded to the tribe last winter. But the funding would never come.

Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe are surrounded on all sides by reminders of their vulnerability to a changing climate.

They see it in the river banks eroded by record floods and the fire scorched landscape. They see it in the wilting pinon trees and waning pine nut harvest. They see it in the infrastructure that can’t keep up and rising power bills they can’t afford.

Those observations have also turned into plans, and those plans into grant applications for projects that would prepare the tribe and residents of Schurz for a more extreme climate.

It all came together last December when the Walker River Paiute Tribe was awarded $20 million in funding from the EPA’s Community Change Grant. The grant was one of hundreds awarded under the Environmental and Climate Justice Program – a $2.8 billion financial assistance program created by the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden.

With the funds, the tribe could execute a multi-year climate resiliency plan to deliver water, energy, and food infrastructure to about 1,200 tribal members who live on the Walker River Reservation.

In total, 150 homes would be weatherized and upgraded for energy efficiency and climate resiliency – about 30% of all existing homes on the reservation.

Swamp coolers that aren’t designed to work in 100 degree temperatures would be swapped out for central air conditioning. Insulation and windows that fail to keep out rising heat would be replaced. Rooftops would be repaired and covered in solar panels and battery storage that could keep medication and food refrigerated during summer blackouts.

No one would be left out. The funding would also cover the remaining cost of a planned Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub – a fully electric and solar powered building with battery storage to shelter the town’s most vulnerable residents during weather emergencies, like floods and extreme heat waves, while increasing food and medication security.

The grant would also fund the last leg of a water infrastructure project that would support dozens of new fire hydrants on the reservation and secure reliable clean water for 425 existing homes and over 100 future homes.

But the January inauguration of President Donald Trump brought new priorities, and a White House crusade against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs funded by his predecessor’s 2022 climate law.

Within five months, on May 1, the $20 million Community Change Grant was officially terminated by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, along with more than 780 other environmental justice grants as part of Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI across the government.

The tribe only used about $70,000 from the grant before losing access to funding that would have helped the rural community adapt to a rapidly changing climate.

Multiple nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the EPA, challenging the legality of abruptly terminating congressionally approved funds, but as the case moves through the court system it’s unclear when – if ever – the funds will be restored.

Fires and floods

Melenie McFalls, the newly elected chair of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, was a month into the job when the EPA first cut off the tribe’s access to the Community Change Grant on Jan. 29. It was one of several grants the tribe would lose in the wake of Trump’s efforts to slash spending and remake the federal government.

Hundreds of emails piled up as McFalls contacted every state and congressional leader she could think of to restore the tribe’s funding.

“I was focused solely on funding cuts, everything else was left on the table because we rely on grant funding. We had to fight for that,” McFalls said in her office, the one she had to evacuate during the wildfire last year with the rest of the tribe’s council.

“We were wondering ‘what else is going to get cut? What’s going to be next? What’s going to happen?’ We had no idea,” McFalls said.

Thirteen years ago, the last time McFalls was chair of the tribe, they didn’t have a climate adaptation plan or an emergency plan for major floods and wildfires. Since then she’s seen the impacts of climate change piling up on the reservation.

The year before the fire, on May 17, 2023, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) found that flooding on the Walker River caused by record-breaking rain and snowmelt created enough structural damage to the Weber Dam seven miles northwest of Schurz that it “could have potentially progressed into a life-threatening event” for the tribe.

The Walker River flooded for 48 consecutive days between May and June that year, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources. It was partially caused by a sudden mid-to-late May warm up that quickly melted record-breaking snowpack in the Walker Basin. By July, stream flows into the Weber Reservoir were seven times the average for the time of year.

About a month after finding the damage in the dam, the BIA told the tribe during a community meeting that if the dam’s spillway failed they would have to prepare for more than three olympic sized pools worth of flooding a minute until the reservoir leveled out. The whole town of Schurz would need to be evacuated within 24 hours.

“It just wiped out our riverbanks. Took most of the land around it. Water was going up to some peoples porches. It was kind of scary to see that happen,” McFalls said.

The Walker River Reservation spans 325,000 square acres across three Nevada counties – Mineral, Churchill, and Lyon – but nearly every home is built along the flood-prone river. That’s because the reservation’s water system depends on a gravity-fed storage tank located at the top of a hill that moves water down to the lowest point in the valley where the river runs.

Before it was terminated, a portion of the Community Change Grant was reserved for a planned water infrastructure project that would allow the tribe to build more than hundred homes at higher elevations further from the river.

Heat and energy

The precipitation that flooded Walker River in 2023 was gone by the next year. Most of Mineral, Lyon, and Churchill counties only received about a quarter of the rain and snow they typically do from April to June, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

It was also the hottest year on record in 2024. When the fire broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June the nearest weather tower (about 25 miles away) recorded average monthly temperatures 5 degrees above normal.

Those conditions are becoming the norm. The past decade has been the hottest in two centuries of record-keeping, NOAA reports. Researchers at NASA recently found that summer heat waves in the U.S. have roughly doubled in number since 1980, increasing from an average of two to four per month.

Rising temperatures have helped Nevada claim two of the fastest warming cities in the nation – Reno and Las Vegas – but rural areas haven’t escaped the heat.

Since 1950, average temperatures on the Walker River Reservation have increased by three degrees, according to Native Climate, a U.S. Department of Agriculture funded research project to support climate adaptation efforts in Native American communities.

Days over 100 degrees have tripled on the reservation from an average of five days in 1950, to 20 days in 2025. Native Climate researchers projected even more extreme heat days using data from NASA climate models.

Under the worst-case scenario “by the end of the century you’re looking at somewhere close to maybe 70 days over 100 degrees on the Walker River Reservation,” said Maureen McCarthy, a research professor at Desert Research Institute, who led the Native Climate project.

“The extremes are becoming more extreme, in addition to the average temperatures changing,” McCarthy said. “That’s a big impact. We’re not designed to function at 100 degrees.”

Ageing infrastructure on the reservation makes adapting to rising temperatures and extreme weather more difficult. The Walker River Housing Department reports that two-thirds of homes on the reservation built before 2000 have older, deteriorating roofs and windows due to harsh weather conditions. About 44% of homes on the reservation also rely on swamp coolers, but temperatures during heat waves are rising beyond what the evaporative-cooling appliance can manage.

Those factors have increased energy costs for households on the reservation. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Low-Income Energy Affordability Data tool, household energy costs are 24% higher on the reservation than the state average. Households on the reservation also spend twice as much of their income on energy costs compared to the state average.

Replacing inefficient appliances that increase energy costs can also be difficult for lower-income households, including many on the reservation. The median household income for the Walker River Paiute Tribe is around $40,000 – about 53% lower than the median household income for Nevada. Unemployment is about twice as high, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.

Funding from the Community Change Grant would have covered the purchase of heat pumps, water heaters, induction cooktops, electric ovens, and new dryers and refrigerators for 120 homes on the reservation.

The global lithium supply chain is experiencing unprecedented transformation as North American companies establish new pathways to reduce dependence on foreign processing capacity. The 18-year Stardust lithium offtake deal between Mandrake Resources (ASX:MAN) and Nasdaq-listed Stardust Power represents a groundbreaking commitment that extends far beyond typical industry agreements.

What Makes This Deal Structure Unique?

Most lithium offtake agreements in today's market span 5-10 years, making the Mandrake-Stardust partnership exceptionally rare with its potential 18-year duration. The agreement includes a firm 12-year base term with extension options through 2042, providing unprecedented security for both upstream producers and downstream processors.

The deal's structure reflects the massive capital investments required for lithium processing infrastructure:

• Annual supply volumes: Up to 7,500 metric tons of lithium chloride feedstock

• Base agreement term: Minimum 12 years with extension capability

• Total potential duration: 18 years extending to 2042

• Facility investment: Up to US$257 million in state incentives and funding

This extended timeline provides crucial financing security for Stardust Power's Muskogee facility development while guaranteeing Mandrake Resources long-term revenue streams from their Utah operations.

The Strategic Importance of Domestic Supply Chains

Current global lithium processing capacity remains heavily concentrated in Asian markets, creating supply chain vulnerabilities for Western manufacturers. This concentration has prompted governments and companies to prioritise domestic and allied-nation sourcing strategies.

Managing Director James Allchurch of Mandrake Resources highlighted the geopolitical drivers behind the agreement, stating that the United States is moving rapidly to eliminate geopolitical risks associated with sourcing critical minerals from potentially unfriendly international jurisdictions. The domestic location of Mandrake's Utah operations provided significant strategic advantages in securing this partnership.

The 18-year Stardust lithium offtake deal exemplifies how companies are restructuring supply chains to ensure security and reduce exposure to international trade disruptions. Furthermore, these developments align with broader Australian lithium innovations and international critical minerals energy transition initiatives.

How Does the Stardust Power Processing Model Work?

The Muskogee, Oklahoma facility represents an innovative approach to lithium processing infrastructure in North America, strategically positioned within the Port of Muskogee Free Trade Zone to maximise logistical and regulatory advantages.

From Feedstock to Battery-Grade Material

Stardust Power's processing model transforms lithium chloride brine from Mandrake's Utah operations into battery-grade lithium carbonate through a two-phase development approach:

Phase 1 Development Specifications:

• Target capacity: 25,000 metric tons per year

• Input material: Lithium chloride brine feedstock

• Output product: Battery-grade lithium carbonate

• Location advantage: Muskogee Free Trade Zone benefits

• Construction status: Ground-breaking completed January 2025

Phase 2 Expansion Framework:

• Ultimate capacity: 50,000 metric tons annually

• Implementation timeline: Subject to market demand and financing completion

• Total investment backing: Up to US$257 million through state incentives and funding programmes

• Job creation: Hundreds of positions across operations and support functions

The Economics of Lithium Processing

The transformation from raw lithium chloride to battery-grade lithium carbonate involves significant value addition at each processing stage:

The pressure on lawmakers is mounting, with many federal workers, farmers, business groups and service members pleading for Democrats to pass Republicans’ funding patch to reopen the government.

But serious obstacles continue to stand in the way, and the likelihood of a breakthrough in the coming days remains low. Democrats are still demanding a negotiation on health care, with premiums for millions of Americans set to increase this week.

“Republicans have brought the American people to the brink; Republicans have refused to do anything,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quipped Thursday.

President Donald Trump on Friday called Democrats “Crazed Lunatics that have lost all sense of WISDOM and REALITY.” He said on social media that Democrats’ demands on health care “will hurt American citizens, and Republicans will not let it happen.”

Still, the extended shutdown is forcing more Senate Republicans and Democrats to the table.

Leadership-level negotiations still are not happening in earnest, and Trump has not been involved at all, but rank-and-file senators are having conversations about the path forward and eyeing multiple options for getting out of the shutdown.

Those options include passing fiscal 2026 appropriations bills to reestablish some semblance of trust among lawmakers and get agencies back open one by one.

However, Democrats recently blocked one spending bill on the floor, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has so far rejected the possibility of bringing the House back into session for anything other than reopening the whole government.

Appropriators say they are continuing to work on full-year appropriations bills, but they have not made any discernible progress in weeks.

Trump last week called for Senate Republicans to scrap the filibuster in order to allow the GOP majority to pass its funding bill without needing Democratic support. But Republican leaders quickly shot down that possibility because of the precedent it would set.

Meanwhile, Republicans’ current funding proposal would reopen the government only through Nov. 21, leaving little time for Congress to process a longer-term funding plan.

In search of ‘critical mass’

Conversations between Senate Republicans and Democrats are ramping up, and senators said those conversations continued through the weekend, though there did not appear to be a meaningful compromise in sight.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that discussions had not yet reached a “critical mass.”

The South Dakota Republican also reiterated that Trump would be open to meeting with Democratic leaders on health care this week — but only if Democrats vote to open the government first, which has been a nonstarter for Schumer and his party.

“The government’s been open all year, up until the last few weeks, and they refused to work with us on [health care], so how are we supposed to believe that?” said Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.).

Trump remains the biggest X-factor for ending the shutdown. Democrats insist that the president must become involved in the discussions and give congressional Republicans the green light to negotiate on health care to create an off-ramp.

“I don’t think the Congress can reach agreement at this point without him, I just don’t,” said Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), a senior appropriator who attended one of Johnson’s daily press conferences last week, watching from the back of the room.

“This should be his first order of business, to call these leaders and get them to agree,” Kaptur said of Trump. “He’s a dealmaker. Make a deal.”

Thune has downplayed the possibility of serious talks with Democratic leaders, given their apparent intransigence, but he indicated that talks with rank-and-file Democrats could “be fruitful.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), another senior appropriator, has called for senators to stay in Washington until they work out a deal.

Pressure points

The shutdown’s worsening impacts on Americans could get more Democrats to break from their party leaders and vote for Republicans’ continuing resolution, but the Democratic caucus has not shown many signs of cracking yet.

Johnson and House Republican leaders have been using their daily press conferences to highlight the funding lapse’s impacts on national parks, farmers, air traffic controllers and other groups, while blaming Democrats for those repercussions.

Airlines and a major union representing thousands of federal workers have called on Congress to pass Republicans’ continuing resolution.

“Just vote for the CR, and people will stop getting hurt,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said Friday on CNBC.

Senators have proposed various bills to fund specific programs, such as nutrition assistance and to pay air traffic controllers as flight delays pile up.

However, Thune, Johnson and the White House have all dismissed those so-called rifle-shot bills. They say that strategy represents a patchwork approach that leaves most needs unaddressed while relieving pressure on lawmakers to end the shutdown entirely.

“They’re not going to get on the floor,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) of those bills. “The Democrats get right up to it and then they pull back. … Thune says he’s tired of playing the games; he’s not going to put them on the floor.”

Some observers also believe off-cycle elections this week in New Jersey and Virginia could provide an off-ramp for some Democrats to get behind the GOP funding bill, but Democrats have not taken any of the other off-ramps Republicans have eyed as potential dealmakers.

Progress on fiscal 2026 bills

Appropriators say they are continuing to work behind the scenes on finalizing full-year spending bills in hopes of Congress making some progress on fiscal 2026 spending.

“Every day the government remains shut, the risk to full-year appropriations grows,” House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said in a statement. “We are losing daylight fast.”

A three-bill package containing the Agriculture, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bills has already been informally negotiated. But Republican leaders are still looking for unanimous consent to send it to a bipartisan conference negotiation with the House.

“It’s really [about] working out something with the [Democrats],” said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), chair of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. “I think that’ll be part of it as we go to approps and to Defense approps, which is good. That’s what we should do.”

Democrats last week were gauging interest in various other potential spending bill packages, according to Punchbowl News, including one containing the Defense, Labor-HHS-Education, Transportation-HUD and Commerce-Justice-Science bills.

The Energy-Water bill is unlikely to be formally finalized or marked up anytime soon. Kennedy, the chair of that subcommittee, said last week that his understanding was the bill had been finalized.

However, Murray, the top Democrat on the Energy-Water Subcommittee, said Wednesday that she and Kennedy did not yet have a final agreement.

A spokesperson for Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) also said last week that the Energy-Water Subcommittee was continuing to work on the bill.

Eliminating the filibuster

The fastest way to end the shutdown would be for Senate Republicans to get rid of the filibuster, which prevents the majority from passing spending legislation without some buy-in from the minority.

But the idea has little support among Senate Republicans and faces stiff resistance from leadership to the rank-and-file — even with Trump calling for that approach.

“It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote on Truth Social last week.

Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) wrote on X that the filibuster “forces us to find common ground in the Senate.” He said, “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ba/a5/5cee1a024cee82d3ba0bada1c4bc/u-s-congress-40555.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 07:58:35.552978

S&P Global Mobility now expects “continued volatility” in EV sales and “a significant drop in adoption” through the end of 2025.","Ford CEO Jim Farley called it, and now the numbers prove him right. When the federal $7,500 EV tax credit expired on September 30, Farley warned that electric vehicle sales would take a major hit. Just one month later, that prediction has come true.

According to J.D. Power and S&P Global Mobility, the U.S. EV market share in October plummeted to around 5%, down from a record high of over 12% in September. That’s not only a steep month-to-month drop, but also a sharp decline from the 8% share recorded in October 2024. The last time EVs accounted for just 5% of American vehicle sales was back in early 2022.

S&P Global Mobility estimates that about 64,000 new electric vehicles were sold in October — less than half of the nearly 150,000 EVs sold in September, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the final days of the federal incentive. Plug-in hybrids suffered as well, dropping from 2.2% of sales in September to just 1% in October.

A Post-Tax-Credit Reality Check

“The automotive industry is experiencing a significant recalibration,” said Tyson Jominy, senior vice president at J.D. Power. With federal incentives gone, EVs are now competing on price and performance alone, and that’s proving to be a tough sell for many consumers.

The sudden decline, however, isn’t just about higher prices. Analysts say the market is also dealing with what S&P Global calls an “EV hangover” — a pull-forward effect caused by the summer buying surge. With so many customers rushing to buy EVs before the tax credit expired, the following months were bound to see a sharp dip.

Still, it could have been worse. “Manufacturer actions to reduce EV prices and increase discounts are helping maintain affordability,” noted Thomas King, president of J.D. Power’s data and analytics division.

Automakers Scramble To Keep EVs Moving

To keep inventory moving, automakers are now offering aggressive incentives. Hyundai cut prices for the 2026 Ioniq 5 by up to $9,800. BMW offered $7,500 lease credits through October. Other brands, including Ford, Nissan, and Volkswagen, have rolled out similar deals to offset the lost tax credit.

Even so, the broader EV landscape looks uncertain. The Trump administration’s rollback of emissions rules and the suspension of California’s EV sales mandate mean automakers no longer face penalties for delaying electrification. As a result, many are shifting focus back to their gas-powered best-sellers.

A Widening Pullback Across the Industry

Several automakers have already hit the brakes on their EV plans:

Acura axed its ZDX SUV after just one model year.

Ford paused production of the F-150 Lightning through year-end.

General Motors will build the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt on one shift instead of two, laying off 1,750 workers.

Kia delayed its EV4 sedan “until further notice.”

This wave of production slowdowns reflects broader anxiety about EV demand and profitability. S&P Global Mobility now expects “continued volatility” in EV sales and “a significant drop in adoption” through the end of 2025.

Short-Term Pain, Long-Term Potential

Most experts still believe the U.S. EV market will recover and expand over the next few years, though at a slower pace than during the Biden era. Technological progress, falling battery costs, and improved infrastructure will help, but in the near term, the road ahead looks rough.

For now, the EV boom has hit a speed bump — one that could reshape how automakers, policymakers, and consumers approach the electric future.",http://evdances.com/cdn/shop/articles/2026_Kia_EV4_First_Look.jpg?v=1762162987,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:07.018346

“Reallocating every exempted gallon is not just the right thing to do, or the smartest thing to do for the market — it’s also what the law clearly requires,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “EPA and this Administration made a promise to rural America to get the RFS back on track — reallocating any less than 100% of all the 2023-2025 SREs EPA has granted would break that promise, and farmers and rural communities would suffer because of it. We urge EPA to commit to full reallocation, and we look forward to continuing our work with the agency to increase American energy dominance through the increased use of homegrown biofuels.”

Comments from groups like Growth Energy and the National Corn Growers Association, encouraged EPA to finalize the supplemental proposal it released in September. This would ensure that the agency accounts for every lost biofuel gallon exempted by EPA’s August 2025 decision to grant several SREs for the 2023-2025 Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) compliance years. The comments also highlight the legal obligation EPA has to fully reallocate these gallons and the negative impacts to the industry and the rural economy if EPA decides to not reallocate, or to reallocate only a portion of the exempted volumes.

“A strong, transparent, and balanced RFS remains a cornerstone of America’s agricultural and energy success,” said National Corn Growers Association CEO Neil Caskey.

Under the Renewable Fuel standard, enacted in 2005, EPA sets the renewable volume obligations each year, specifying the amount of renewable fuel that refiners and importers of petroleum products must blend into the nation’s fuel supply.

Mike Braun’s post-election fundraising committees continue to draw major support from Indiana’s business community less than a year into his first term as governor, according to new Federal Election Commission filings.

While the latest reports show limited activity in one as it transitions into a political action committee, another has served as a major fundraising hub, routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to accounts linked to Braun and the Indiana Republican Party.

Team Braun — a joint fundraising committee for Braun’s state and federal campaign activities — reported $432,500 in total contributions so far raised this year, ending September with $77,943 cash on hand and no debt, according to FEC data.

The political action committee, or PAC, acts as a conduit for fundraising events that benefit multiple accounts, including the Freedom and Opportunity Fund, Mike Braun for Indiana and the Indiana Republican State Committee.

Story continues below.

Separately, Braun’s former campaign committee, Mike Braun for Indiana, officially renamed itself the Freedom and Opportunity Fund earlier this year and reported limited activity in the most recent reports. The move allows the governor to continue raising and distributing federal campaign funds in support of other candidates and political efforts now that he’s not running for federal office.

The account reported $18,207 in total receipts — meaning new money that came into the committee — between Jan. 1 and June 30, according to filings covering the first half of 2025. But there were no individual or committee contributions during that period.

Story continues below.

202509089789854351

Instead, the committee reported $3,991 in candidate refunds and $12,316 in spending, primarily bank interest and reimbursements from vendors for prior campaign-related expenses.

From June through September, the PAC reported $354,556 in total disbursements, including roughly $350,000 in transfers to affiliated committees, such as Team Braun. Operating expenditures — mainly administrative costs — totaled about $3,457. No independent expenditures, loans or contribution refunds were reported.

The Freedom and Opportunity Fund ended the quarter with $77,943 in cash on hand, and no debts owed to or by the committee.

Joint committee handled most fundraising and transfers

Most of Team Braun’s reported financial activity involved distributing money to its partner committees rather than spending it directly.

The latest FEC report shows the joint committee raised $70,000 in new contributions during September, bringing its year-to-date total to $432,500 — all from individual donors.

Federal filings detail $351,099 in total transfers, including:

$206,675 to Mike Braun for Indiana

$67,232 to the Freedom and Opportunity Fund

$62,252 to the Indiana Republican State Committee’s federal account

$4,980 to the state-level Indiana Republican State Committee

$9,960 to the Hoosiers for Opportunity, Prosperity and Enterprise Victory Fund, a separate joint fundraising vehicle

Other expenditures were small and technical — about $2,000 in fees to CMDI and Anedot Inc. for credit-card and software services, plus bank fees.

The filings also identify a wave of large donors in recent months, most giving $5,000 or more through Team Braun. Among them:

Viswanath Atluri of Carmel, president of VTSI – $12,500

Amar Venkata Bukkasagaram of Fishers, director at Alithya – $12,500

Jordan Caldwell of Shelbyville, executive at Caldwell’s Inc. – $10,000

Mark Elwood of Columbus, executive at Elwood Staffing – $7,500

John Engelbrecht of Evansville, CEO of South Central Inc. – $5,000

Robert Kersey of Muncie, executive at American Lawn Mower – $10,000

Gary Roberts of New Castle, owner of Roberts Pipeline Inc. – $5,000

Michael Merritt of Bloomington, co-founder and retired executive at Investcorp – $5,000

Herbert Likens of Anderson, partner at Likens Farms, now retired – $2,500

Earlier in the summer, the committee attracted several other high-profile donors, including:

James Cornelius, retired chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb – $50,000

Jeffrey Schwartz, retired executive of Simon Property Group – $20,000

Paul Thrift, president of Thompson Thrift Development – $20,000

Michael Coyle, owner of Coyle Automotive in Jeffersonville – $20,000

Christopher Reid, CEO of CRG Residential – $15,000

Janet Coyle, of Jeffersonville – $20,000

Daniel Fitzpatrick, CEO of Quality Dining in Mishawaka – $10,000

Braun’s growing political network

Neither of Braun’s federal committees reported any loans or outstanding debts, and both listed “$0” in obligations owed to or by the committees.

The Team Braun filings also show the committee as a clearinghouse for joint fundraising events — gatherings where donors can write a single check that’s divided among multiple Republican committees.

Each of the large transfers was described in filings as a “transfer of joint fundraising proceeds.”

The structure mirrors how other sitting governors with federal campaign histories have kept their donor networks active through PACs and joint committees. It also positions Braun to remain a player in Indiana Republican fundraising circles ahead of the 2026 and 2028 election cycles.

Both committees are next due to file quarterly reports with the FEC in January 2026, which will provide a fuller picture of Braun’s post-campaign fundraising and political activity.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01292025_SOTS_01-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:13:24.767305

The facility will also support companies accelerating the advancement of testing for energy storage systems, such as hydrogen and battery storage.

The Centre forms part of the Energy Central Campus, a collaborative partnership between ORE Catapult, Port of Blyth and Northumberland County Council and aims to support the clean energy sector by providing education, training, and pathways to employment in the local community.

North East Mayor Kim McGuinness said: “We now have even more great green energy jobs right here in the North East as this brilliant new facility opens its doors. It’s yet more proof we’re a world leader in this industry.

“Just a few months ago I officially opened the Energy Central Learning Hub in Blyth nearby. This is how we’re investing, not just in technology and innovation, but also in the skills our communities need to get jobs in green energy for decades to come. This is a turning point for our region, and it is crucial we continue to support and invest in facilities like this.”

The 1500sqm former paper storage shed and surrounding land was secured and converted with investment from the North East Combined Authority (£2m), the Blyth Town Deal (£2m), Innovate UK (£1.3m) and ORE Catapult (£1m).

Councillor Glen Sanderson, Leader of Northumberland County Council, said: ""This is another great day for Northumberland and the wider region, showcasing the cutting-edge innovation that the north east is famous for.

“Blyth is cementing its reputation as an international centre of renewable energy and advanced manufacturing growth, and this fantastic new facility is bringing new jobs and new opportunities to develop skills and is another step in the renaissance of the town.”

Environmental and social costs: the overlooked risks While the green energy transition demands critical minerals, it can also present a sustainability paradox.","Africa's mineral riches are vital to the global energy transition – but historic exploitation could repeat itself if they do not benefit local economies.

A new World Bank study outlines the potential environmental and social costs if this wealth departs elsewhere.

The study offers six pathways to ensuring these resources generate the millions of jobs needed by young Africans over the next decade.

For decades, Africa’s mineral riches have fuelled a paradox: Vast underground wealth paired with poverty above. Now the energy transition places the continent at the heart of global decarbonization. Africa holds 75% of global cobalt, 68% of manganese, and 59% of graphite reserves. Yet without deliberate action, these resources risk repeating history: Extraction that bypasses local economies and deepens inequality.

The stakes are generational. Over 360 million young Africans will enter the workforce in the next decade. Without bold action, more than half risk being shut out of productive work – despite sitting atop the very minerals needed to power clean energy technologies that are supposed to be at the vanguard of 21st-century industry.

A new era for resource power

This isn’t a commodity boom that will bust. Demand for energy transition minerals will triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040, fuelled by the structural shift to decarbonization and mounting climate pressures.

A new World Bank study across Eastern and Southern Africa, with deep dives into Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Malawi, South Africa and Zambia, makes the stakes clear: Without deliberate action, this transition risks becoming just another wave of extraction without transformation, deepening exclusion and igniting new fault-lines. The research charts both pathways forward and pressure points to avoid:

The study offers concrete strategies to ensure mineral wealth generates the 211 million jobs over the next decade that young Africans need:

1. Community voice in decision-making

Enforceable legal frameworks giving affected communities substantive roles in mining decisions, including employment commitments, training programmes and benefit-sharing arrangements; and accessible grievance mechanisms. Civil society support should enable communities to advocate effectively for local hiring and economic participation.

2. Strategic infrastructure investments

Investment in renewable energy, transport corridors (like the Lobito Atlantic Railway) and industrial zones that serve both mining operations and surrounding communities.

3. Inclusive workforce development

Technical training programmes co-designed with industry to match actual job requirements. Successful programmes combine classroom instruction with on-the-job experience and placement services. Such initiatives must intentionally address structural barriers preventing women, youth and minorities from accessing opportunities. Inclusion frameworks need teeth, including monitoring systems and leadership accountability.

4. Formalizing artisanal mining to preserve livelihoods

Rather than criminalizing artisanal operators, creating realistic pathways to formalization through affordable licensing, designated mining zones, access to formal markets, and technical and financial support. Gender-responsive strategies should ensure women’s participation.

5. Governance capacity that matches ambition

Building technical capability of regulatory bodies through sustained support, including tools, training and resources for independent monitoring. Transparency mechanisms, including public disclosure of mineral contracts, revenues and beneficial ownership.

6. Local content policies that work

Targeted procurement strategies incentivizing companies to source from domestic suppliers, particularly SMEs. Supplier development programmes, access to finance, capacity-building on industry standards. But these must be intentionally inclusive, as women-owned businesses and marginalized entrepreneurs remain locked out without deliberate targeting.

Critical pressure points that could derail progress on energy transition

Without deliberate action on these pathways, the study identifies critical pressure points where growing demand intersects with entrenched exclusion:

1. Environmental and social costs: the overlooked risks

While the green energy transition demands critical minerals, it can also present a sustainability paradox. Mining for these transition minerals can intensify environmental degradation, including land disruption, water scarcity, pollution and biodiversity loss – threatening ecosystems and communities alike. The social costs are equally significant: displacement of local populations, disruption of livelihoods, and human rights impacts often go overlooked amid the urgency for clean energy.

2. The employment squeeze: large-scale vs. artisanal mining

Across the region, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sustains millions of livelihoods and produces substantial mineral output. Yet governments and international buyers increasingly favour large-scale operations, viewing them as better aligned with ESG standards, even though they typically create fewer jobs per tonne of mineral extracted. The result? Growing tensions, confrontations and missed employment opportunities.

3. The value-addition gap

Raw ore leaves African ports. Finished batteries return as imports. This pattern persists because moving up the value chain, from extraction to processing to manufacturing, requires simultaneous advances in energy infrastructure, technical skills and policy coordination that most African nations have struggled to develop. Zambia and DRC are developing battery precursor facilities. South Africa’s manufacturing base positions it for component production. But the window is closing. Governments across Africa are now negotiating long-term mining contracts with multinational companies. The terms they accept, whether requiring local processing, technology transfer, joint ventures, or allowing simple extraction and export, will determine whether countries capture processing jobs or remain locked in pure extraction for another generation.

4. Skills mismatch and training gaps

Even when mining operations expand, jobs remain unfilled because workers lack required skills. Technical and vocational training programmes rarely align with industry needs. Without deliberate investment in education, technical training tailored to sector needs, and programmes that intentionally target women and marginalized groups, mineral development will create jobs that locals cannot fill; instead, they use imported expertise where local employment was promised.

5. Systematic exclusion

Women and marginalized groups face persistent barriers. In South Africa, women make up just 12-13% of the formal mining workforce and earn 40% less than men. In the DRC, it’s only 4%. Similar exclusions affect Indigenous communities, migrants and persons with disabilities, many of whom face legal and institutional barriers to formal participation. For example, in Malawi and Zambia, ASM licenses are restricted to citizens, barring migrant inclusion.

6. Communities without voice

Mining consultations do not systematically include the people most affected. In South Africa’s platinum belt, company consultations have largely excluded women, youth and farm dwellers, yet these groups bear direct impacts. In Zambia, where some

traditional leaders negotiate deals without broader community input, the result is

benefit-sharing agreements that don’t reflect local employment needs.

The choice ahead

Companies and governments now recognize that the fastest path to secure supply chains involves genuine partnerships with local communities that deliver measurable outcomes: local hiring, skills training, supplier development and quality jobs. Between 2021-2023, protests disrupted 334 mining sites across copper, cobalt, lithium and nickel projects, demonstrating that a social license to operate can now serve as veto power.

A lobbyist with close ties to the administration said fossil fuel companies want to sidestep utilities to power data centers.

It’s a clash months in the making, and one that could frustrate a range of major initiatives that affect hundreds of millions of Americans.

The Trump administration has been tearing down Biden-era energy programs and aiming to quickly deliver a dramatic overhaul to the U.S. electricity grid. It wants to jump-start a fleet of artificial intelligence data centers, keep fossil fuels on the electricity grid, boost next-generation nuclear reactors and stabilize electricity prices.

Electric utilities, meanwhile, are slow-moving machines that operate on the five- to 10-year planning cycles that are necessary to make sure there’s enough electricity for U.S. households and businesses.

“Utilities are trying to make investments in 60-year assets. If one administration does a 180 from the previous administration, it’s nearly impossible for utilities to make any such investments,” said Rob Gramlich, founder of the Grid Strategies consultancy.

The universe of utilities, which run the power lines and grid infrastructure that turn the lights on for Americans, is large and diverse. Some companies are private; others are publicly owned. They represent different geographies and different resource portfolios.

But according to interviews with 10 energy insiders, some of whom were granted anonymity to speak freely about private interactions with the White House, many utilities are concerned with the Trump administration’s push for hyperscalers to secure off-grid power and its use of emergency orders to keep fossil fuel plants running.

While utilities applaud the administration’s push for more electricity and permitting reform, some executives bristle at the administration’s anti-renewables policies, which include cuts to hundreds of millions of dollars in utilities grants from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and early expiration of tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.

All of that comes as utility bills skyrocket across the U.S. Utilities have requested or received approval for roughly $34 billion in rate hikes through September, according to a new report from the nonprofit PowerLines. Nearly 200 million Americans face higher utility bills, the study said.

In a message on Truth Social in October, President Donald Trump said electricity prices are on the ballot in gubernatorial polls Tuesday in New Jersey and Virginia.

“If you vote Republican, your Energy Costs are going to go down, tremendously!” Trump said. “If you vote Democrat, your Energy Costs are going to go ‘through the roof,’ making Energy virtually unaffordable for you and your family to pay.”

Democrats are also embracing electricity prices as a campaign issue.

Meanwhile, the U.S. faces an electricity demand surge unseen in a generation. Some analysis suggests demand could spike 50 percent by midcentury.

“For 30 or 40 years, electricity issues seemed rather dull. Many utilities had no real load growth,” said Theresa Pugh, a veteran energy industry consultant. “Now, there’s this perfect storm of ‘how fast can we build new manufacturing, semiconductor plants and data centers — all at the same time.’ I never in my lifetime expected electricity demand to increase the way it’s expected to.”

Spiking electricity demand

Much of the projected demand increases are driven by artificial intelligence data center projects. The Trump administration routinely says the U.S. must win the AI race with China; Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called AI the “Manhattan Project of our time.”

“Every megawatt of electricity is necessary to power the AI arms race, especially after Joe Biden’s Green New Scam forced power plants into retirement before the end of their useful life,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

But that demand is likely to spike bills, according to a range of analyses. To placate concerns about the impact of AI demand on consumer electricity bills, Trump, speaking at the White House recently, said data center developers are “building their own electricity,” a situation sometimes referred to as power co-location.

“They’ve become a utility, in a sense,” Trump said. “We’re letting them build their own electricity so we don’t have to worry about the grid.”

DOE is asking industry for advice to address the projected increase in demand — and the Edison Electric Institute, an influential lobbying group representing for-profit utilities, says it’s collaborating with the White House.

“We’re working regularly with officials across the Administration and share the same goals of making the grid more reliable and energy more affordable,” EEI President Drew Maloney, who served at the Treasury Department in Trump’s first term, said in a statement.

Still, many electricity experts say relying on off-grid power at data centers is impractical. Redundancy is needed in case of a disruption at a plant. And the grid helps to modulate electricity to help data centers run smoothly.

Some utility experts view the White House grid plans as a financial threat.

“For some utilities, co-location presents some concerns to the business model,” said a lobbyist who represents companies that oppose emissions regulations and was granted anonymity to speak freely. “The challenge is that the utility sector is on a five- to seven-year buildout schedule for any significant amount of generation, and the AI sector is in an 18-month demand cycle.”

The Trump administration, staffed heavily by oil and gas industry leaders, is short on utility veterans. Wright, for example, led hydraulic fracturing services company Liberty Energy before his confirmation to the Cabinet. A lobbyist with close ties to the administration said fossil fuel companies want to sidestep utilities to power data centers.

“The biggest conflict that’s emerging is the friction between the utility model and the oil and gas business model for these larger companies that want to get into the merchant power business of supporting data centers,” the lobbyist said. “The oil and gas folks say these guys are trying to stop us from innovating and keep us out of their market because they see us as an existential threat to their business model. And the White House is very sympathetic to that.”

For now, the industry is looking to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent agency, to nail down rules for data center co-location. Wright is calling on FERC to also craft rules on data center interconnections to the grid. He floated measures that include prioritizing projects that commit to curtailing consumption during peak demand.

Capstone, a consultancy, said recently that Wright’s directive to FERC is “largely negative for investor-owned utilities … which will likely fight to ensure states retain jurisdiction over large load interconnection processes.”

To make matters worse, utilities and hyperscalers don’t have much experience together, according to some in the industry.

“Utilities and technology companies still don’t speak the same language, and now we’re all in the same sandbox,” said Richard Ward, a senior policy adviser at Venable and a former lobbyist for EEI. “Collaboration isn’t optional anymore; it’s the only way forward.”

On top of that, many of the policies that directly determine electricity rates take place at state-level utility commissions.

“The hardest part is that most of this plays out at the state level. Washington can set the tone, but it can’t just flip a switch and solve everything overnight,” Ward said. “The federal government needs to stay focused on the looming energy supply gap. The shortfall everyone’s projecting isn’t theoretical—it’s coming fast.”

Renewable opposition and fossil fuel fiat

The Trump administration earlier this year tried to halt work on the 80 percent-complete Revolution Wind farm offshore of Rhode Island, and it has threatened to derail more wind projects.

And last month, the Trump administration canceled a review for a major solar project in Nevada that was approved by the Biden team. Across the board, the administration is frustrating permits for wind and solar farms on public lands.

Yet utilities in recent years have dramatically boosted plans for renewables. Solar accounted for more than half of electricity capacity added to the grid in the first half of 2025, according to an influential solar association. Batteries, meanwhile, are likely to account for roughly a quarter of all grid installations this year.

“Whether any given utility loves or hates renewables, most of them are relying heavily on renewables and storage for a large part of their portfolios to meet demand in the 2020s,” said Gramlich of Grid Strategies.

Experts in the energy sector fear a Democratic backlash in the future.

“There’s also the trepidation that eventually, at some point, Democrats will be back in the majority. Would we really want them doing the same thing to baseload or dispatchable resources?” said another energy lobbyist.

Meanwhile, the Department of Energy this year deployed emergency powers to keep a set of fossil fuel plants running, arguing the power is needed to stave off blackouts.

DOE, for example, ordered the Michigan utility Consumers Energy to continue operating the J.H. Campbell coal plant until at least Nov. 19, even though Consumers said the emergency order raised net costs at least $80 million this year.

Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September, Wright said utilities support the emergency orders.

“Now we’re just talking with utilities,” he said. “More utilities are coming out of the woodwork, saying, ‘Shoot, we got forced to agree to close our coal plants. Can you help us? We don’t want to close our coal plants.’”

Duke Energy, a major U.S. utility operating in the Southeast and elsewhere, is planning to delay retirements for three coal plants. But many experts say the administration is overreaching.

“A lot of these retiring plants tend to be very old,” said the lobbyist who spoke about a Democratic backlash in the future. “Utilities shouldn’t be forced to keep them open.”

Rogers, the White House spokesperson, said DOE “will continue using emergency powers to ensure American communities do not experience blackouts or brownouts.”

The foreseeable future is likely to be messy for White House plans on electricity. Still, some experts say the administration is a long-term boon for the utility sector.

“There will be tension and push-pull in the sausage making because utilities have made decisions to close plants or build renewables,” said Tom Pyle, president for the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group that advocates for limited government. “But the Trump administration is a bright spot for utilities of all types because he wants to expand the pie across the board.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/99/07/f52f387a4ecb937b9ca2c5cd2f8f/draft-dabbs-trump-vs-utilities.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 07:59:16.623194

Wells Fargo joins as tax equity partner for Enlight’s New Mexico project

Enlight’s fifth U.S. tax equity partnership brings total to nearly $1 billion in value

Quail Ranch, a 128 MW solar and 400 MWh storage project, is expected to reach COD toward the end of 2025

TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enlight Renewable Energy (TASE & NASDAQ: ENLT), a global renewable energy IPP and developer, announced today that its U.S. subsidiary Clēnera Holdings has closed a tax equity agreement with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (Wells Fargo) for the Quail Ranch project in New Mexico.

Under the agreement, Wells Fargo will provide tax equity financing, including a contribution following commercial operation (COD) of $131 million, expected to increase to nearly $150 million when including pay-go contributions over the first 10 years of operation.

The Quail Ranch project, a co-located solar and energy storage project totaling 128 MW of solar generation and 400 MWh of energy storage, involves a total investment of $275 million. The project is expected to achieve commercial operation towards the end of 2025. Once fully operational, it is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $24 million in its first full operating year and EBITDA of around $17 million. The project shares interconnection infrastructure with Atrisco, leveraging Enlight’s “Connect and Expand” strategy to utilize large interconnections for incremental capacity and cost efficiencies.

Quail Ranch benefits from a 20-year busbar power purchase agreement (PPA) with Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), an investment-grade offtaker, consistent with Enlight’s U.S. projects to date and providing stable, long-term revenues over the contract term.

The tax equity financing is expected to provide production tax credits (PTC) for the solar component and investment tax credits (ITC) for the storage component. Quail Ranch is also expected to qualify for the 10% Energy Community Adder under the Inflation Reduction Act. Quail Ranch is Enlight’s fifth tax equity deal in the United States. Altogether, the company’s U.S. portfolio has nearly $1 billion in tax equity arrangements.

“The Quail Ranch tax equity deal marks another step forward in scaling our U.S. platform,” said Adi Leviatan, CEO of Enlight. “Welcoming a top-tier institution like Wells Fargo as our partner affirms both the strength of the project and the robustness of our portfolio strategy. We’re proud to continue building long-term, trusted partnerships that expand access to reliable, affordable clean power at scale.”

“The Quail Ranch facility builds on our success in New Mexico,” said Jared McKee, CEO of Clēnera. “Our partnerships power that success and this tax equity arrangement with Wells Fargo is one more way we are executing our growth strategy in the U.S.”

Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that Prop 50 is likely to pass.
If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans shifted their direction in Texas earlier this year.
Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50.
Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said.","LOS ANGELES — Adelaide Stone Van Gessel says she doesn't agree with partisan gerrymandering in practice.

But she voted yes on Proposition 50, a California ballot measure that would allow the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily bypass California's independent redistricting commission and enact a more Democratic-friendly congressional map ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Van Gessel and others who back Prop 50 told NPR the proposal provides the Democratic-leaning state a rare opportunity to directly counteract President Trump and Republican efforts to redraw political maps in their favor in other states.

""What we're doing is gerrymandering to stop gerrymandering,"" she said. ""And that's not really the best solution, but it is something that we find ourselves in this kind of environment having to do.""

Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that Prop 50 is likely to pass. If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans shifted their direction in Texas earlier this year.

GOP lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have also enacted new maps, and a bipartisan deal reached last week in Ohio tilts that state's congressional map further to the right. Lawmakers in other states, including Virginia Democrats, could join the redistricting fight.

In Southern California, many left-leaning voters approving Prop 50 reported having mixed feelings about the measure, but ultimately felt that allowing a partisan gerrymander is one of the only options they have to stop Trump from shutting out a Democratic win in Congress next year.

""We can't play the game like decent people anymore,"" said Stephanie Eberstein, who, like Van Gessel, lives in the liberal LA neighborhood of Venice. ""I mean, those rules are out the window. So, we have to do what we have to do.""

In Orange County, Eva Hernandez agrees.

""We got to do something,"" Hernandez said. ""Can't just sit back and let things roll like they've been rolling. … California's got to do it. We're a blue state. We got to do what we got to do to counteract that.""

Republican voters in California fear losing representation

With surveys showing Prop 50 likely to be approved, it appears none of the opposition's arguments against the measure is truly landing in a state that is strongly Democratic.

A number of voters told NPR they're focused on the current proposal, and could not recall how they voted about 15 years ago, when the state's citizen-led, nonpartisan redistricting commission was enacted.

Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50. She lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, one of a few GOP-leaning enclaves in Southern California. She told NPR she thinks this special election and redraw are unnecessary.

""It's a waste of money,"" she said. ""Of good California money that we need.""

Betty Roth is another no vote. She says that as a Republican she already feels pretty powerless in the state.

Out of the 52 seats California has in the U.S. House, only nine are currently held by Republicans. Roth says she doesn't want the GOP to lose what little representation it has.

""They're trying to take away the vote from a good portion of the American people by, you know, gerrymandering,"" she said.

But a lot of Democratic voters don't feel much sympathy for this argument.

Aaron Leal, who also lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, says Republicans are trying to rig the midterms in their favor because they aren't sure they can win on policy. He says the party is practically forcing Democrats to react.

""If one side is going full force pushing their agenda, we cannot bring, as they say, like a knife to a gunfight,"" he said.

Leal says he also likes that the measure is temporary. After 2030, the state would go back to the independent redistricting commission.

""Somebody has to do something""

Polling shows the Democratic base has been largely frustrated with their leaders — mostly because they haven't been able to do much.

""The Democrats haven't really fought back and done anything to combat what's going on with the Republican Party and Trump,"" said David Checel in Culver City. ""So, yeah. I don't know what you're supposed to do on this, and I'm glad I'm not a politician.""

Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said.

Other Democrats say they are really excited to see their leaders fight back, including Reina Santiago in Venice.

""I'm glad that our state is taking the charge against this because somebody has to do something,"" she said. ""The GOP is totally complicit with Trump, and if we let them walk all over us, they'll do it. So that's what this vote is about.""

And while Jim Lind, who lives in Irvine, agrees with this sentiment, he said he's also pretty sad that this is what politics has become.

""It's unfortunate that any party, whatever it may be, has to stoop to a lower level to get things done,"" he said. ""You know, all my life I've probably been more idealistic as far as the honesty of people. And it's just not working out.""

The project transformed a former paper storage site into a cutting-edge technology hub, backed by combined investment from:

North East Combined Authority (£2 million)

Blyth Town Deal (£2 million)

Innovate UK (£1.3 million)

ORE Catapult (£1 million)

Councillor Glen Sanderson, Leader of Northumberland County Council, described the opening as a landmark for the region:

“This is another great day for Northumberland and the wider region, showcasing the cutting-edge innovation that the North East is famous for. Blyth is cementing its reputation as an international centre of renewable energy and advanced manufacturing growth.”

Supporting the UK’s Net Zero Ambitions

Dave Wilkes, Director of Innovation Ecosystem at Innovate UK, said the facility represents an important milestone in the UK’s renewable energy journey.

“For 12 years, Innovate UK has supported ORE Catapult in its mission to place innovative UK businesses at the heart of global offshore renewable energy supply chains. The investment in this new facility demonstrates the importance of the North East as a centre of excellence in this field of technology.”",https://www.manufacturingmanagement.co.uk/media/jldayvag/300165c7fa8448f48a8f5c75f9bf454b.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:31.658422

The funding pause comes as a list of proposed cuts by the Department of Energy has circulated in Washington, D.C. Its targets include Project Cypress in southwest Louisiana, a massive federally supported direct air capture project, as well as carbon capture projects by Entergy, Shell and Honeywell, among others.

It’s not yet clear whether the projects will ultimately be cut, and the Department of Energy declined to answer questions for this story about the list’s authenticity.

But the changes raise questions about whether Louisiana will continue to be a beneficiary of a national movement under former President Joe Biden’s administration to bring technologies like direct air capture to market. And the potential cuts come at the same time an unusual coalition of rural conservatives and environmentalists have banded together to push back against a wave of projects by petrochemical companies to store CO2 deep underground all across the state.

The DOE had already announced a round of $8 billion in funding cuts to clean energy in early October. Not long after, another list started circulating that proposed a second round of cuts, which include at least two university projects in Louisiana that have reported having their funding paused.

In all, the various cuts, pauses and proposed trims have led to an enduring state of uncertainty in parts of Louisiana’s burgeoning clean energy economy ever since U.S. President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year. The president hit the brakes on a wide array of spending, especially around clean energy and efforts to fight climate change.

“Every day, there’s a new list,” said Ramesh Kolluru, vice president for research, innovation, and economic development at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “It’s getting tough to keep up.”

Projects halted

Greg Upton, executive director at the Center for Energy Studies at LSU, was leading a project with Shell and the University of Houston to study the feasibility of a direct air capture project in southwest Louisiana. Direct air capture is a nascent technology that sucks CO2 directly from the air in a bid to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Those greenhouse gases, like CO2, are the primary cause of climate change, climate scientists say. They have linked warming global temperatures with worsening hurricanes, rainfall and extreme heat.

But after finishing the first phase of the project earlier this year, the Trump administration’s communications became “limited,” Upton said, and the group was uncertain if it would be reimbursed for more work.

In a quarterly report due Friday, Upton said the group informed DOE it is pausing work on the project and laying off its employee brought on to help until it gets more clarity.

Upton said the subsequent list of proposed cuts to other direct air capture and carbon capture projects is not a surprise, given the funding pause on his and other university-led projects.

“On one hand, the Trump administration is sending a signal they’re pro-carbon capture,” Upton said. “On the other hand, you see programs like this (being cut).”

He also noted that direct air capture is different from the traditional carbon capture projects being proposed by a wide array of petrochemical companies. Direct air capture is far more expensive and less commercially viable.

Shell, a partner on the project, declined to comment. Upton said a company could still take the work they’ve completed so far and use it as a jumping-off point for a direct air capture project, even if the grant is ultimately terminated.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette was awarded more than $3 million for two separate projects that are on the list of proposed cuts by DOE. The grants were announced in 2021 and 2023.

One, the Louisiana Solar Corps, is an initiative to bolster the state’s fledgling solar industry workforce. The plan was to train workers to build solar microgrids at churches, public buildings and National Guard bases to make the state more resilient after hurricanes knock out the power grid. The other, on carbon capture, was transferred to UConn and UL officials said they don’t know the status of it.

Kolluru, of UL, said the school “slowed” spending on the solar corps project after the DOE paused it, to avoid having to foot the bill for costs if the project is ultimately canceled. Funding is already sparse at UL, with the university recently announcing cuts to more than 70 positions as they try to chip away at a $25 million deficit.

While the school didn’t get a formal stop-work order for the solar corps project, Kolluru said, “it seemed like that was a project at risk.”

Carbon capture uncertain

A rush of companies have sought to build out a network of pipelines and wells in Louisiana to take CO2 from industrial emitters, pipe it to geologic formations around the state and inject it deep underground, a process known as carbon capture.

The reasons are twofold: Customers overseas are increasingly willing to pay more for products with a smaller carbon footprint. And the Inflation Reduction Act, one of Biden’s signature accomplishments, provided tax incentives for companies who successfully capture and store CO2.

Companies have filed 60 applications with Louisiana regulators to drill such carbon capture wells. But Gov. Jeff Landry recently signed an executive order that puts the brakes — at least temporarily — on all but six of them.

Direct air capture is further from reality. The IRA provided an even more lucrative incentive for that technology, and the DOE had allocated billions in direct federal aid to help the fledgling technology reach commercial viability.

Louisiana officials — both Republican and Democrat — have largely welcomed both technologies with open arms. And a flood of federal grant money from DOE was slated to go to companies looking to build both traditional carbon capture and direct air capture projects in the state.

The future of those projects is shaky, given the list of potential cuts that’s been circulated.

The federal government is slated to cut a project by Entergy to capture and store CO2 from its Lake Charles Power Station, a natural gas-fired plant. Other projects on the chopping block of federal grants include a plan by Honeywell to establish a plant to build battery inputs in Geismar; a Vale USA project to build an iron ore briquette facility in Convent to develop cleaner steel; and a series of grants to Battelle, part of a coalition of companies trying to establish a massive direct air capture hub in southwest Louisiana called Project Cypress.

Entergy declined to comment for this story. Vale said it was still working on its project and in communication with DOE. Honeywell didn’t respond.

Patrick Courreges, a spokesperson for the state Department of Energy and Conservation, declined to comment on the list, but said the agency hasn’t received any indication that projects running through it are on the chopping block.

It’s not yet clear which of the projects on the list — totaling more than $20 billion in federal spending — will ultimately be cut, and DOE press secretary Ben Dietderich declined to verify the list’s authenticity.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Dietderich said. “As Secretary Wright made clear, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

The DOE’s initial round of $8 billion in cuts largely targeted Democratic states, but the agency subsequently cut $700 million in battery projects on the second list, E&E News reported. Those projects spanned red states as well.

Vikrum Aiyer, head of global policy at Heirloom, one of the companies involved in Project Cypress, said, “We aren’t aware of a decision from DOE and continue to productively engage with the Administration in a project review.

“At this time, we’re proud to stand with the governor, state leadership, workforce development and economic development organizations and many others who are strong advocates for this project and its many economic benefits for the state. They understand that subnational governments and international jurisdictions are clamoring for DAC investments as part of the race for energy dominance, and this should not be America's lead to cede.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/cc/ecc024f7-a5ce-5251-a02c-c83205f4396b/637be462cb438.image.jpg?crop=1300%2C683%2C0%2C65&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-03 05:17:46.833987

Imagine a hyperscale data center — another facility with a massive cooling demand — colocating next to a refinery.","For most professionals in the mechanical and HVAC industry, the term “geothermal” brings to mind residential heat pumps or commercial variable refrigerant flow systems: reliable, efficient and increasingly common. What if the same fundamental principles could be applied to one of the largest, most challenging and overlooked sectors in our economy? What if the solution to a billion-gallon-a-day water problem was sitting right under our feet?

There is a colossal market hiding in plain sight: industrial process cooling. Specifically, the oil and gas refinery sector, an industry that underpins our modern world, is facing a dual crisis of heat and water that it is ill-equipped to handle. For the forward-thinking mechanical contractor, this crisis represents an unprecedented opportunity to deploy our industry’s expertise on a transformative scale.

The twin liabilities: Heat and water

To understand the opportunity, we must first grasp the sheer scale of the problem. A typical refinery is a massive heat engine, constantly generating an enormous surplus of thermal energy — often estimated at more than a billion BTUs per hour. This isn’t useful, low-grade heat; it’s a massive liability that must be continuously rejected to maintain stable operations.

For decades, the default solution has been the wet cooling tower. These colossal structures use the principle of evaporative cooling to dissipate heat. In doing so, they consume staggering volumes of water. According to industry data, more than 70% of the water pulled into a refinery’s cooling system is lost to the atmosphere as steam. This can amount to millions of gallons of water per day for a single facility.

For years, this was considered a simple cost of doing business. However, in an era of increasing water scarcity, tightening regulations and rising utility costs, that view is becoming dangerously obsolete. Water is no longer just a consumable; it’s a strategic liability. A drought or a new water rights regulation could cripple a refinery’s operations overnight.

This is where geothermal exchange transitions from a green technology to a critical tool for industrial resiliency and financial stability.

Applying a familiar solution to an industrial giant

At its core, geothermal exchange is simply about using the earth as a massive, stable thermal battery. As HVAC professionals know, the earth maintains a nearly constant temperature only a few feet below the surface year-round. This provides a perfect heat sink — a place to reject unwanted heat — that is vastly more efficient and reliable than the fluctuating ambient air.

Instead of evaporating millions of gallons of water, a geothermal system rejects a facility’s waste heat into the ground through a closed loop of buried pipes or a series of wells. The concept is identical to the commercial geothermal systems we install every day, only engineered for a much larger thermal load.

The advantages of this approach are immediate and profound:

• Drastic water reduction. By eliminating the need for evaporative cooling, geothermal exchange can reduce a refinery’s cooling water consumption by more than 90%. This directly addresses the core risk of water scarcity, insulating the facility from drought and regulatory pressure.

• Enhanced resiliency. Geothermal infrastructure is buried and protected. It isn’t vulnerable to hurricanes, winter storms or other extreme weather events that can damage or disable cooling towers, leading to costly shutdowns.

• Improved efficiency. Geothermal systems operate with unparalleled efficiency, significantly reducing the parasitic energy load required for cooling and lowering the facility’s overall peak electricity demand.

• Public health and safety. It eliminates the chemical treatments required for cooling tower water and removes the risk of Legionnaire’s disease associated with aerosolized water drift.

The financial tipping point: The IRA changes everything

While the technical and operational benefits are clear, the financial case has been transformed by the Inflation Reduction Act. This legislation has significantly reduced the risk associated with capital investment for industrial-scale geothermal projects.

The key mechanism is the Investment Tax Credit. For geothermal projects meeting standard prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the IRA provides a 30% tax credit as a starting point. However, the real power is in the “stackable” bonuses. A 10% bonus is available for projects located in designated “energy communities” — a definition covering most refinery locations. Another 10% bonus can be added for using domestic iron, steel and manufactured components.

Suddenly, a project can qualify for a tax credit covering 50% or more of its total upfront cost.

Furthermore, the IRA’s “transferability” provision allows a facility to sell its tax credits to an unrelated entity for cash. This creates a liquid market for the credits, meaning the project owner can monetize the incentive immediately to help finance the construction, rather than waiting years to apply it against future tax liability. The economics have never been more favorable.

The future vision: From liability to community asset

The vision extends beyond simply solving a problem within the refinery’s fence line. By capturing the facility’s massive waste heat, rather than rejecting it, a refinery can transform itself from a thermal polluter into a valuable community energy anchor.

This is the concept behind thermal energy networks. The recovered waste heat from the refinery can be piped to a shared thermal loop, providing low-cost, carbon-free heating for nearby buildings, data centers, industrial parks or even greenhouses. The refinery not only saves money on water and energy, it creates an entirely new revenue stream by selling its waste heat.

This symbiotic relationship is already being explored. Imagine a hyperscale data center — another facility with a massive cooling demand — colocating next to a refinery. The data center can draw on the refinery’s geothermal cooling loop, while the refinery can use its waste heat to power absorption chillers, creating a virtuous cycle of efficiency and shared infrastructure.

For the mechanical and HVAC industry, this is more than a new application; it’s a call to lead a fundamental shift in how we think about energy. We have the technical expertise in heat pumps, hydronics and large-scale system integration. We are the ones who can design, build and maintain these transformative systems.

The oil and gas industry is facing a challenge it cannot solve with its traditional toolkit. It’s time for us to demonstrate that the solution is, and always has been, right beneath its feet.",https://www.phcppros.com/ext/resources/2025/10/29/PE1025_oil-refinery.jpg?height=635&t=1761742960&width=1200,N,,2025-11-03 11:10:28.252340

At a study session, Boulder city staff and leaders of Xcel Energy reviewed five years of the city's franchise and energy partnership and discussed wildfire mitigation, targeted undergrounding projects and progress toward local renewable and emissions targets.

City officials said the partnership, which took effect Jan. 1, 2021, includes a 20-year franchise with opt-out checkpoints at the five-, 10- and 15-year anniversaries. Council and staff framed the meeting as an update to inform whether the city needs additional analysis to decide whether to continue the franchise.

""Tonight's study session is an important opportunity to reflect on the city of Boulder's partnership with Xcel Energy as we marked 5 years since the franchise agreement was signed,"" City Manager Nuria Rivera Vandermeid said at the start of the presentation. Jonathan Cohen, director of the city's Climate Initiatives Department, told the council staff's goal was ""to provide an update on the partnership activities, where we are today, looking at some opportunities for improvement, and again...look to the future state of the partnership to make sure we continue to serve the needs of Boulder residents, businesses, as well as Xcel.""

City staff and Xcel officials reviewed the governance and program work that has flowed from the agreement. Carolyn Elam, senior manager overseeing the partnership for the city, outlined projects funded through the agreement's undergrounding program and other partnership initiatives. She said the city and Xcel have advanced multiple undergrounding projects timed to public works work, noting North Broadway, 19th Street and East Arapahoe projects, and a new Chautauqua project the city described as focused on community resilience and wildfire-risk reduction. Elam said those projects, together with others, ""will represent at least the 16 plus million dollars that were part of the first 5 years.""

Xcel executives described how wildfire mitigation, system hardening and communications were being advanced across their service territory, and how those tactics fit into broader decarbonization plans. Robert Kenny, president of Xcel Energy's Colorado operating company, said Xcel has grouped its wildfire work into situational awareness (weather cameras and detection), system hardening (targeted undergrounding, covered conductor and conductor upsizing), and operational mitigations (enhanced power-line safety settings and the public-safety power shutoff or PSPS). ""We've only employed PSPS once,"" Kenny said, and he acknowledged that communications after the single April PSPS event ""had significant opportunity for improvement,"" which Xcel said it has tried to address in its wildfire mitigation plan.

Xcel emphasized a number of other partnership accomplishments and plans discussed in staff materials: the city's targets for 100% renewable electricity and 100 megawatts of local installed generation by 2030, an inventory of partnership focus areas (efficiency, electrification of buildings and transportation, local generation and storage, and resilience), and partnership projects including a Department of Energy-funded virtual power plant pilot in Boulder. Xcel also outlined its distribution-system planning and an electric resource ""Just Transition"" solicitation that it said could add thousands of megawatts of new wind, solar and storage to replace retiring coal plants.

Council members pressed Xcel on several topics. Multiple council members cited the April PSPS event and asked how Xcel will shorten restoration times and provide better advance notice. Kenny said Xcel's intent is to give layered notice (72, 48 and 24 hours as forecasts firm up) and to preposition crews and use drones so that restoration will be faster and safer, but he added that exact restoration timelines depend on the scope of any event and the number of line miles to be patrolled. Several council members also asked for additional clarity on costs and pace of undergrounding: Xcel said undergrounding costs vary widely by topography and whether lines are distribution or transmission.

Council members and staff also asked Xcel for more information on a short list of items staff and council said they needed to evaluate the franchise at five years, including:

- a clearer, Boulder-specific list and schedule of wildfire mitigation and undergrounding projects that affect the city;

- more precise estimates of customer cost impacts over time tied to specific project and resource portfolios, including how tax credits and avoided fuel costs affect rates; and

- whether Xcel will provide additional monitoring and reporting for the Valmont ash cleanup and any other environmental remediation projects that affect Boulder residents.

Xcel said it would follow up. Regarding federal funding, Kenny said the DOE virtual power plant grant was in hand and under way, and he described federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act as an important driver of project economics. Xcel described its clean heat plans and other filings to expand electrification programs and said it had included substantial funding in a recent filing to support customer electrification and beneficial electrification programs.

City staff and council members said they will use the next weeks to identify any additional analyses they need to inform a future decision on the franchise opt-out available at the five-year checkpoint. Council members asked staff to return with a clearer timeline for the opt-out process and with the list of Boulder-specific projects and further economic and operational detail from Xcel.

What happens next: staff said they will consolidate council's requests for more information and follow up with Xcel on specific items (air and groundwater monitoring for the Valmont project, an itemized Boulder project list and more specific cost and timeline estimates for undergrounding and resilience projects). Xcel said it would provide follow-up materials after the presentation and looked to continue the partnership work on the items identified tonight.

Ending: Council did not take a formal vote on the franchise at the session; the meeting was an informational study session and staff said additional information and follow-up briefings will be provided to the council to inform any future decision about the franchise.

Of the 98,345 heat pumps sold last year, 32,920 were produced in the UK, representing a 40% increase on 2023 figures.

The HPA says the growth underscores the growing role of British manufacturing in the clean energy transition. The Government’s Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan, published in June, highlights heat pumps as a key growth industry, with the wider heating and cooling sector projected to contribute £4.8 billion annually to the economy by 2050, including £900 million from exports.

Industry experts say the UK’s strong foundation in boiler and HVAC manufacturing provides a natural springboard for scaling heat pump production, with shared engineering expertise, components, and supply chains offering a clear pathway to boosting domestic output and securing high-value, long-term jobs, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research.

To support this, the Government’s £30 million Heat Pump Investment Accelerator programme is backing large-scale investments in UK-based manufacturing. Two projects have already received nearly £10 million in funding, with further details on a second phase expected under the forthcoming Industrial Strategy.

However, the HPA emphasised that sustained growth will depend on stronger market confidence, particularly through timely implementation of the Future Homes and Buildings Standard, and addressing the imbalance between electricity and gas prices.

The release of figures coincided with Heat Pump Day, an annual event celebrating the role of heat pumps in Europe’s energy transition.

The European Heat Pump Association (EHPA) has also reiterated its call for clear, long-term policy frameworks to drive demand and strengthen local production.

Charlotte Lee, Chief Executive of the HPA, said: “As the heat pump market in the UK matures, it’s great to see the sector investing in on-shoring supply chains to increase resilience and responsiveness. Confidence in the market is crucial to secure further investment, and we call on the Government to publish the Future Homes and Building Standard without delay. This no-regrets step clearly sets the direction for the heating transition, and shouldn’t be underestimated in its importance to strengthen the supply chain.”

Minister for Energy Consumers Martin McCluskey added:“These figures show the clean power mission in action, with skilled, homegrown jobs in the clean technologies of the future. The British public have shown record demand for heat pumps as more and more families take up our offer of a £7,500 grant. Which is why, to help meet the growing demand, we have already committed almost £10 million to boost homegrown heat pump production in the UK.”

EHPA Director General Paul Kenny commented: “This new UK data is yet more proof that confidence and a stable market are crucial to ensure the local demand that drives local production.

Editor's note: Yasiru Ranaraja, a special commentator on current affairs for CGTN, is a researcher on maritime affairs and an expert on Belt and Road Initiative development. He is also the founding director of the Belt & Road Initiative Sri Lanka, an international development organization and think tank in Sri Lanka. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

In July 2023, at the National Conference on Ecological and Environmental Protection, Chinese President Xi Jinping restated his intention to accelerate the advancement of modernization of the harmonious coexistence between human beings and nature, an ambitious and forward-looking commitment. This pledge goes beyond political rhetoric, as it reflects a revolutionary concept based on the doctrine of ecological civilization.

Through record advances in pollution reduction, nature restoration and clean energy growth, China has become a world leader in green development. Nevertheless, the way toward full ecological modernization is still a challenge, with key fields needing fresh urgency and greater international collaboration.

In the last decade, China has experienced an environmental shift of historic proportions; the ratio of days with good air quality in 339 major cities rose from 63.3 percent to 87.5 percent, and the density of PM2.5, a particulate matter that is the primary driver of severe respiratory illness, averaged more than a 50 percent decline, according to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

China's green transition is also driven by its leadership in renewable energy, and it accounted for nearly half of global renewable energy investment in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. The country's total installed renewable energy capacity is now over 1.45 billion kilowatts.

A major force behind the shift is the systematic integration of environmental protection into governance. Flagship policies have set sector-specific emission reduction pathways. The ecological protection redlines formally integrated into national policy through the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020), aim to preserve biodiversity, maintain ecosystem services and ensure ecological security, which now covers over 25 percent of China's territory, safeguarding key ecosystems from encroachment.

Moreover, China has formally released the first draft of its historical environmental code, marking a major step in consolidating its ecological governance. Unveiled on April 27, 2025, during a session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the draft comprises an extensive 1,188 articles across five chapters: general provisions, pollution prevention and control, ecological protection, green and low‑carbon development, and legal liability and supplementary provisions.

Legal scholars in both China and abroad applaud this move for unifying fragmented environmental regulations, enhancing enforcement clarity and filling legislative gaps ultimately reinforcing China's commitment to sustainable development and ecological civilization.

China is also extending its green ideas abroad in spite of these domestic challenges. As a champion of global environmental governance, China has made ecological civilization a pillar of its foreign policy.

Through the Green Silk Road, an environmental spinoff of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China is helping developing countries adopt greener infrastructure models, transferring technological expertise and building environmental management capacity. An example is the China-Laos Railway, which was designed to have as little ecological impact as possible. More than 60 percent of its route is constructed on bridges or through tunnels to avoid disrupting local wildlife and sensitive landscapes.

These international inputs point to a deeper reality: The building of a greener China is not just an issue of national rebirth; it is also an obligation to offer a different model of harmonizing ecological protection and economic development while emphasizing that protecting the ecological environment is a global responsibility.

The synthesis of traditional Chinese ecological philosophy, such as the Daoist belief in the interdependence of all living things, with modern regulatory and financial innovation makes up a ""green code"" that resonates beyond China's borders. It is a code based on long-term planning, technological scale and state coordination, and a tool that many emerging economies are looking for in dealing with the climate crisis.

Looking ahead, there are a number of key areas that require fresh attention. First, China needs to start phasing in a cap on the growth of coal projects and introducing definitive sunset clauses on fossil fuel subsidies. Furthermore, Sustainability education, particularly for young people and rural communities must be integrated into national curricula.

Moreover, nature-based solutions, ranging from the conservation of wetlands to agroecology, must be given precedence for their low-cost, high-impact advantages. Lastly, China should further engage with international agreements like the Paris Agreement, the UN Environment Programme and the Global Methane Pledge, and foster South-South cooperation on green technologies.

By interpreting China's green practice, the world not only learns about one nation's transformation but is inspired toward a more sustainable and equitable planetary future. It will require courage, innovation and collaboration to arrive there but the green trajectory, once initiated, cannot be reversed.",,N,,2025-11-03 05:58:19.345630

States are the best place for action and progress, in large part because so much of energy policy lives at legislatures and state agencies.","While the federal policy and regulatory landscapes in 2025 are, to put it mildly, full of uncertainty and outright antagonism — from the cancellation of programs like Solar for All to the rapid drawdown or outright elimination of the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives for technologies like solar, storage, wind, and electric vehicles — the choice for the industry is either to wait and hope for better political tides in Washington or to adapt and fight to meet the moment.

“It is very easy to get overwhelmed by this moment,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy at Advanced Energy United (United), an industry association representing many of the leading solar, wind, storage, and demand and distributed energy companies. “You could go into the zone of just being flustered and become part of that chaos. Or you can figure out a construct where you can continue leading and focus on a solutions-oriented path.”

The choice for Rai and United was simple. Founded in the aftermath of the 2010 failure of the federal Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, United was built from the start to engage deeply with state policymakers and regional regulators to educate them about the benefits that advanced energy technologies can deliver to citizens and the grid.

United has achieved a long list of legislative and regulatory achievements over its decade-plus of state and regional engagement. Most recently, United championed California’s passage of the “Pathways Initiative” bill, which grants the state’s independent system operator authority to collaborate with other Western states to create an entirely new day-ahead energy trading market for the Western region — a move that is expected to bolster clean energy deployment and save participants upwards of $1.2 billion annually.

Meeting the moment with practical, available solutions

Despite the headwinds from the nation’s capital, United continues to make progress for the industry in state capitals. Recently, the association leveraged its deep experience to develop a playbook that the entire industry can use to further this progress. “The playbook is a way to organize the solutions available to decision-makers and a guide to leaders of any political stripe and in any state about how to think about the urgent challenges they face today,” Rai said.

The challenges are significant. Electricity demand is projected to surge in coming years, driven by data centers, artificial intelligence, electrification, and industrial reshoring. At the same time, energy costs are spiking, supply chain constraints and tariffs are slowing energy infrastructure development, and extreme weather events are straining grid resilience.

State leaders find themselves caught between rising and understandable citizen concerns about energy costs and the urgent need to meet explosive load growth while maintaining grid reliability. Unlike hyperpartisan Washington, state capitals remain a venue for problem-solving. “We have had these conversations with lawmakers that are across the map — rural, urban, Republican, Democrat, Independent,” Rai explained. “The beauty of this playbook is it applies in Texas, and it applies in Pennsylvania, California, Indiana, or Virginia.”

State and local decision-makers understand that they are accountable to constituents who expect the lights to stay on and bills to remain affordable. The advanced energy technologies available today — from large-scale solar, wind, and storage to distributed resources like virtual power plants and advanced efficiency innovations such as smart thermostats and building energy management systems — offer immediate, deployable solutions. Unlike new gas plants and pipelines that take years to build and also risk becoming stranded assets, these technologies can be deployed quickly to meet urgent reliability needs while containing costs.

A three-pillar framework for action

United's playbook organizes solutions around three core objectives that address the full spectrum of state energy challenges:

Build it: To meet projected load growth, states can accelerate deployment of least-cost energy projects by reforming generation and transmission development processes. This includes streamlining planning, siting, permitting, interconnection, and procurement procedures to build a stable pipeline of projects that will meet growing future residential, business, and industrial needs.

California's Pathways Initiative exemplifies this approach. The landmark legislation, nearly a decade in the making, enables Western states with vastly different energy portfolios to work together on market expansion, making it easier to boost transmission capacity, get more clean energy projects connected to the grid, and create efficiencies that will benefit affordability and reliability across the region.

United has also been working on improving energy markets in other parts of the country. For instance, the organization has been leading efforts to have PJM Interconnection — the nation’s largest grid operator, serving 13 states and D.C. — make significant reforms to address the massive backlog of projects waiting to connect to its grid, a critical bottleneck preventing clean energy deployment and keeping prices sky high. These regional efforts complement the statewide developments in siting and permitting legislation that United recently helped secure in Michigan and Massachusetts.

Make it flexible: States can maximize existing grid infrastructure by scaling up distributed energy resources, energy waste reduction, virtual power plants, and advanced vehicle and building electrification solutions through state-led programs, plans, and rates. These technologies help grid operators manage costs in real time while preparing the system for increased demand.

Following Winter Storm Uri's devastating blackouts in 2021, state leaders in Texas recognized the value of flexibility, energy waste reduction, and consumer participation. Recent legislation in Texas has expanded opportunities for those demand-side programs to help shore up the grid. ""Texas has showcased that these resources can actually keep the lights on and help strengthen the grid system,"" Rai said. ""We don’t need to wait 20 years to solve all of our problems. These are solutions that can actually be deployed immediately.""

Make it affordable: States can ensure public utilities are planning, optimizing, and delivering the right types of energy investment at the lowest possible cost while identifying least-cost financing avenues for projects both big and small. This includes avoiding investments in infrastructure that may become a stranded asset.

Colorado leads the way in comprehensive energy system planning. The state has implemented country-leading electric distribution system planning that accounts for how distributed resources can play an increasing role in grid reliability, and Colorado has one of the strongest frameworks for containing costs on the gas pipeline system. As a result, the state’s utility regulators are currently reviewing a proposal to save Coloradans $150 million by investing in efficiency, electrification, demand flexibility, and a small liquefied natural gas facility instead of the traditional gas-only solution.

A path forward

The United playbook recognizes a fundamental truth: There is no single answer to America’s energy challenges. The energy system is complex and interconnected, and decision-makers must assess how different technologies combine to keep prices low, secure the economic opportunities represented by data centers and AI, and ensure a resilient and reliable grid.

States are the best place for action and progress, in large part because so much of energy policy lives at legislatures and state agencies. ""The urgency right now is making sure that state leaders have a path for action and are not stuck in the chaos and noise of the moment,"" Rai said. “This playbook provides a constructive path that works despite the chaos people are seeing at the federal level — a focus on action, not just talk.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KM6JudXXoTCPJW5k2jrV6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/aa3f1668645f0a437e471d8e5cb191dd,N,,2025-11-03 04:57:41.097428

He added, “In 2019, India’s module manufacturing capacity stood at six gigawatts. With the ALMM scheme, it has now increased to 120 gigawatts in just three years”.

The Solex CMD’s comments come amid efforts by solar companies to reconfigure supply chains to maintain access to US markets affected by tariff measures.

Innovation and collaboration

On trade diversification, Shah said that shifting global dynamics have created new opportunities for India and Europe to collaborate. “As an Indian, we see a lot of opportunities. We were inventors in the past, we lost it, and now it is time to regain it again,” he said.

Solex Energy recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with ISC Konstanz, Germany, for advanced R&D and technological cooperation in solar cell manufacturing. Shah noted that future growth for Indian manufacturers will rely on balancing innovation and affordability.

Commenting on US tariffs, he described them as “temporary”, noting that “the US has no choice — they don’t have any manufacturing”. He added that India could benefit from the geopolitical situation as global markets increasingly seek cost-effective alternatives from India and China.

Many investors in green stocks will still remember seeing the sector sink at the end of the pandemic.","A dramatic rebound in clean-tech stocks has investors in the green economy hoping they can finally turn the page on years of punishing underperformance.

The timing is somewhat unexpected. Even as President Donald Trump has canceled many US government programs dedicated to boosting wind, solar and electric vehicles, green stocks have become one of this year’s most lucrative bets.

Those equities have significantly outpaced most other stock indexes. The S&P’s main gauge tracking clean energy is up about 50% this year; the MSCI World Index has gained less than 20% in the same period.

Much of that development is pegged to a near-insatiable demand for energy to power the data centers feeding artificial intelligence. It also reflects China’s relentless drive to build out its low-carbon economy. For investors, those factors have outweighed Trump’s attacks on what he often calls the “green scam.”

Analysts at Jefferies have seized on the moment to declare this the “glory days” for green investors, even dedicating an entire client event to the idea.

Aniket Shah, global head of sustainability and transition strategy at Jefferies, says investors have been too distracted by Trump’s anti-green rhetoric in the US. Instead, they should look at the global level of capital piling into clean technologies: the $2 trillion dedicated to low-carbon spending last year is an “insane number” that indicates the green economy is enjoying a “wonderful moment,” according to Shah.

He points to a whole array of factors, including the stunning ascent of China’s green economy and its clean-tech exports to the developing world. And then there are the so-called hyperscalers driving AI, such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, all of which Shah says is “very much a sustainability story.”

The new mood of euphoria among green investors also comes with a layer of irony, however. Electricity demand tied to AI is on track to quadruple within a decade, and though renewables will play a huge role in powering that development, fossil fuels will also be a big part of the mix, pumping up emissions in the process, according to BloombergNEF.

So as world leaders prepare to gather at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, Shah says it’s important to acknowledge that even with this year’s green rebound, the planet is on track to miss not only the critical temperature threshold of 1.5C, but also 2C. “You have to keep both of those stories in your mind at the same time,” he said.

But not all investors are convinced the green stock rally is solid. And some worry that too much of it is tied to AI, around which bubble speculation persists.

Tim Bachmann, a climate-tech portfolio manager at the fund management unit of Deutsche Bank AG, DWS, says investors should be prepared for another “Deepseek moment,” referring to the Chinese startup that stunned the world earlier this year after it unveiled a low-cost, energy efficient version of AI.

The idea that it might be possible to power AI with considerably less energy than assumed in the US was “a shock not only in the data-center operators, but also in the suppliers of cooling, ventilation equipment, cables, transformers,” Bachmann said.

Alex Monk, a portfolio manager for the global resource equities team at Schroders, says the alternative energy sector would likely be dragged down by a bursting AI bubble.

Deirdre Cooper, head of sustainable equity at Ninety One Plc, says the Anglo-South African asset manager is being “careful to avoid the hype” around parts of the green rally. It’s clear that some clean-tech stocks have been “caught up in the speculative end of the AI trade,” she says.

And Renaud Saleur, founder and chief executive of Anaconda Invest, a Geneva-based boutique hedge fund that specializes in the energy sector, says that some of the stocks that have outperformed are “not really the quality ones.”

He also questions whether the insatiable energy needs of the data centers powering AI can ever be met. “The extra demand for AI is impossible to fuel,” Saleur says. The end game will be “a lot of disappointment.”

The best-performing company in the S&P Global Clean Energy Transition Index is Bloom Energy Corp. The company, which makes solid-oxide fuel cell systems that can generate electricity where it’s needed, is up almost 500% this year.

Bloom Energy, which agreed in July to provide on-site power to Oracle Corp.’s AI data centers, is planning to double its manufacturing capacity by the end of 2026 to meet demand. And with the construction of new power plants proving slow, combined with a shortage of gas-fired turbines, Bloom’s fuel cells – which have a deployment time as short as 90 days – have generated considerable interest.

“Their product is very much tailored and levered to the whole AI data center demand dynamic,” said Christopher Dendrinos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “That has been a huge driver for the stock,” Dendrinos said.

And because Bloom Energy’s fuel cells are — for now, at least — largely powered by natural gas, they actually benefit from Trump-administration incentives that didn’t exist under the Biden administration.

But others urge caution. Analysts at Bank of America Corp. say Bloom Energy’s “fundamentals don’t justify” its share price gains, according to a September note sent to clients.

Michael Tierney, Bloom’s head of investor relations, says the company’s valuation is based on both strong anticipated demand for electricity and an improving financial condition, including revenue that’s expected to climb more than 30% this year to almost $1.9 billion.

“We’re not a startup anymore,” he said. “We have a significantly better balance sheet than in the past.” Tierney says that positions Bloom Energy for sustained growth, which is attracting investors.

Many investors in green stocks will still remember seeing the sector sink at the end of the pandemic. And even after this year’s rebound, clean-tech equity indexes are far off the highs of 2020 and 2021, when interest rates were at crisis lows and Covid-19 lockdowns stifled demand for traditional sources of energy.

But this rally feels different, according to some of the biggest asset managers investing in the sector.

Natalie Adomait, chief operating officer for Brookfield’s renewable power and transition unit, says demand for low-carbon energy sources to power AI is strong, “not only because they’re cheap and abundant, but critically because they’re quick to bring online.”

Brookfield Asset Management recently announced it had raised $20 billion for the world’s biggest private fund dedicated to the clean-energy transition. And Brookfield just agreed to invest as much as $5 billion to deploy the fuel cells of Bloom Energy at new data centers that operate AI.

Among money managers predicting a near-limitless need for energy to power data centers is Apollo Global Management, whose outgoing chief sustainability officer says the demand gap “will not be closed in our lifetime.”

Even in the US, where Trump’s anti-green sentiment dominates policy, low-carbon energy sources look to be emerging as a popular bet for powering data centers. And Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill has proved less punitive for US solar and wind than many investors initially feared. The upshot is that demand for clean energy won’t necessarily be powered by ideological views on climate change, but by the economic benefits.

“If you’re offering green electrons to a company, they can be agnostic as long as you can promise the delivery of the electricity when they need it,” says Timothy Ho, European utilities and renewables analyst at Amundi SA, Europe’s biggest asset manager.

Trump’s policies remain “quite challenging” for certain renewable energy segments such as residential solar projects, says Joseph Osha, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities. So the huge gains in some clean-tech stocks are best explained as a “recognition that the business can survive,” he says.

For example, after triple-digit percentage gains this year, both SunRun Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. are “still trading at a fraction of their historic highs,” Osha says.

Amundi’s Ho says the green sector should still be treated with some caution.

Investors need to be aware that “sometimes, when you have these broad thematic flows, you can detach a bit from valuations,” he says. And that means markets “can end up detaching a bit from fundamentals, at least temporarily.”

On the eve of a highly anticipated federal budget, a central pillar of which is said to be a climate competitiveness strategy, comes a flagship report from the One Canadian Clean Economy Task Force.

Launched last month, the task force is made up of members representing companies across critical minerals, batteries, clean transportation, clean buildings, energy efficiency, forest products, clean electricity, and clean technology.

The One Canadian Clean Economy Task Force believes Canada can simultaneously safeguard its economy from the trade and tariff shocks of today while setting itself up to compete for the long term, ultimately reaping massive economic advantage from the global energy transition.

Accordingly, Our North Star Action Plan lays out 30 solutions aimed at this government’s biggest priorities: selecting strategic projects of national significance, reducing internal trade barriers (for which a November meeting of ministers is approaching), Indigenous reconciliation, and of course tomorrow’s climate competitiveness strategy.

This task force was brought together precisely to identify many of the roadblocks to realizing these goals—and critically, how we can clear the way for Canada to build up the best version of its clean economy. To name just a few:

Regulatory approval processes can be lengthy and complex, often with overlapping jurisdiction and duplicative requirements, adding cost to and slowing down clean economy projects. Streamlining processes with earlier Indigenous engagement and prioritizing clean growth projects in nation-building efforts are among the vital solutions needed.

Workers face barriers in the clean economy, from inconsistent education and training standards to outdated approaches to workforce planning. Governments should prioritize clean economy trades and regulated professions in labour mobility and target new federal reskilling investments toward clean economy jobs.

A lack of coordinated electricity planning between provinces and inadequate transmission infrastructure means our industries don’t have access to the clean electricity they want, and thus Canada is more reliant on U.S. power. It’s time for a “United Canada” grid initiative and more interregional planning.

Canada’s clean economy sectors need better access to capital to retool and scale up. Finalizing the clean economy investment tax credits and ensuring Canada’s strategic tariff response measures are deployed in ways that enhance climate competitiveness can help Canada attract clean investment, especially as those dollars flee the U.S.

For the full list of 30 recommendations, organized within eight key focus areas, read the One Canadian Clean Economy Task Force’s North Star Action Plan. Our aim: responsibly eliminate barriers and build up Canada’s essential clean economy—and a stronger, competitive Canada.

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states.
This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed.
If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.
It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs. The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago.

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

West Virginia: +27.71%

Ohio: +30.11%

Pennsylvania: +30.85%

Virginia: +19.78%

Kentucky: +17.66%

North Carolina: +24.17%

Texas: +27.58%

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69% capacity all the time or forego the ability to recoup future costs. The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and solar farms. The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market. The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid — coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total Generation – 87,551 megawatts (MW)

Natural Gas – 33,469 MW (38.22%)

Nuclear – 28,371 MW (32.41%)

Coal – 13,197 MW (15.07%)

Renewable Energy – 10,043 MW (11.47%)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August 2025, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per MWh (megawatt hour), while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh – nearly 50% more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69% when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed. Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need — or want — to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity — ultimately increasing your power bill.

However, notwithstanding these initiatives, India’s cleantech manufacturing sector continues to face significant challenges.
Dependence on imported upstream components, technologies, and raw materials highlights the need for technology-sharing agreements and the enhancement of domestic manufacturing capabilities.
In alignment with India’s climate objectives, the mission emphasises cleantech manufacturing, promoting domestic production and strengthening supply chains for critical clean energy components.
Collectively, these government-led initiatives underscore a strong commitment to advancing clean technology manufacturing in India.","India is at a critical juncture in its transition to clean energy. The nation has set ambitious targets: achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, sourcing 50% of its energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030, and ensuring that 30% of new vehicles sold by 2030 are electric. Currently, India’s total installed energy capacity stands at 442 GW, with renewable sources comprising 33% and hydropower contributing 11%. Due to the rapid expansion of renewable energy installations, India remains confident in meeting its 2030 clean energy objectives ahead of schedule.

India’s progress has primarily stemmed from clear and targeted policy incentives. Between 2010 and 2023, the country’s renewable energy capacity grew eightfold, driven by supportive government policies and declining costs of solar and wind technologies. These policies, alongside financial innovations, have encouraged more venture capital investments and created more opportunities for startups and MSMEs. As a result, cleantech expenditure reached USD 68 billion in 2023, a 40% rise compared to the average from 2016 to 2020.

However, these ambitions bring their own set of challenges—chief among them is reducing India’s reliance on imported cleantech components. India’s cleantech manufacturing import dependence across renewable energy, electric mobility and other cleantech sectors’ value chains vary from 20% to 90%; specifically, 80% in Solar, 60% in Wind, 75-90 % in Battery Energy Storage Systems, 60-70% in E-mobility (EV motors and controllers), 90% in Green Hydrogen, and 20-30% in Bio-energy sectors. Without decisive policy action, India’s cleantech imports could surge to USD 85–110 billion by 2030 and as high as USD 140–300 billion by 2040, rivalling the country’s current oil import bill. Reducing this dependence and capturing the economic benefits of the green transition requires indigenizing supply chains and establishing a robust domestic manufacturing base. Policy must address capital costs, supply chain bottlenecks, and constraints in local technology expertise to seize this opportunity. This dependence is more than economic; it is strategic. In a world of techno-nationalism and fragmented supply chains, clean technology has become the new oil. Nations are weaponising critical minerals and tightening export controls. For India, relying on foreign hardware to fuel our green economy is a risk we cannot afford to take. That is why our green transition must be Made in India. As Prime Minister Modi has rightly emphasised, the path to Atmanirbhar Bharat and Viksit Bharat runs through Swadeshi innovation.

To achieve its clean energy objectives, India must realign its policy priorities to expand domestic manufacturing across all relevant sectors. This calls for comprehensive, well-structured interventions throughout the cleantech value chain, including incentivising private investment, expediting adoption among local manufacturers, and addressing areas with lagging progress. By adopting this approach, India can not only advance its energy transition but also enhance economic autonomy and support broader socio-economic development. The nation’s strategic assets, its favourable geographic location, competitive labour costs, and rapid growth in renewable energy, provide a strong foundation for becoming a leading cleantech hub. However, realising this potential requires closing supply chain gaps and maintaining cost-competitiveness in domestic production. Developing a robust cleantech manufacturing ecosystem will rely on advanced local technology, economies of scale, reliable access to raw materials, affordable inputs, sufficient financing, and a skilled workforce. While existing policy measures and private sector initiatives have produced encouraging initial outcomes, a more integrated and large-scale effort is necessary.

The international landscape is undergoing a significant transformation. As nations have pursued “China Plus One” strategies to diversify global supply chains, India has encountered intense competition from other emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. To differentiate itself, India should not only strengthen its own capabilities but also adopt an “India Plus Many” strategy, cultivating alliances with like-minded economies to develop diversified, secure, and resilient supply networks. Establishing strategic partnerships will improve India’s competitiveness, expand market opportunities, and reinforce its position as a reliable provider in the cleantech sector. A new approach of going “Swadeshi with Partnership” may be the optimal way forward. Global alliances on finance, technology transfer, and market access should bolster our Swadeshi efforts.

Substantial policy-driven investments are currently underway, exemplified by the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes that have stimulated domestic output across critical sectors, including solar photovoltaics (PV), advanced battery storage, e-mobility, and green hydrogen. Notably, the solar PLI initiative, with an allocation of USD 3.21 billion, has facilitated integrated manufacturing spanning modules, cells, and wafers. Supplementary strategies, such as safeguard duties and manufacturing-linked auctions, have contributed to a decrease in import reliance, while annual cleantech investment reached a record high of USD 68 billion in 2023.

However, notwithstanding these initiatives, India’s cleantech manufacturing sector continues to face significant challenges. There is an urgent need to promote indigenisation at competitive costs by overcoming hurdles related to infrastructure, raw materials, logistics, and associated expenses—this can be achieved through supply chain partnerships and investments in research and development of affordable climate technologies. Financing remains a significant barrier, as high capital costs and unfavourable risk-return dynamics deter investment. Therefore, establishing long-term, innovative financing mechanisms is crucial to attract both domestic and international capital. Additionally, the sector faces a skilled workforce deficit, making it vital to enhance green skill development and improve the industry’s appeal to talented professionals for roles in supply chain management and emerging cleantech domains.

Furthermore, insufficient investment in research and innovation hinders the development of affordable, locally relevant solutions, underscoring the need for targeted initiatives and collaborative approaches. Dependence on imported upstream components, technologies, and raw materials highlights the need for technology-sharing agreements and the enhancement of domestic manufacturing capabilities. Finally, limited access to advanced machinery and manufacturing technologies continues to constrain the country’s production potential.

National Manufacturing Mission 2025 – including a focus on Cleantech Manufacturing

The National Manufacturing Mission, introduced in the Union Budget 2025, aims to advance India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative by providing comprehensive policy support, strategic execution plans, and a robust governance framework to coordinate activities among central ministries and state governments. In alignment with India’s climate objectives, the mission emphasises cleantech manufacturing, promoting domestic production and strengthening supply chains for critical clean energy components. These components include solar PV cells and modules, electric vehicle batteries and parts, hydrogen electrolysers, wind turbines, ultra-high voltage transmission equipment, and grid-scale batteries. This initiative aims to reduce India’s reliance on imports, enhance energy security, and accelerate the country’s transition to renewable energy.

The mission is structured around five principal pillars, each addressing a critical area of implementation. Its primary objective is to ease the process of doing business by optimising regulatory frameworks and offering incentives to support domestic production. The initiative seeks to develop a future-ready workforce via targeted skill development programmes and collaborative partnerships between industry and academia. Additionally, the mission aims to foster a robust and dynamic MSME sector with increased access to capital and enhanced supply chain integration. Further emphasis is placed on advancing technology through the promotion of research and development, innovation, and technology transfer. Finally, it seeks to elevate quality standards in manufacturing through recognised benchmarks and certification systems, thus enhancing global competitiveness. Collectively, these government-led initiatives underscore a strong commitment to advancing clean technology manufacturing in India.

We have the talent. We have the market. We have the urgency. Now we need clarity of direction and rapid execution. It is time to shape India’s green economy with Indian climate solutions—Make in India, Solve for the World. The Government of India must expedite the unveiling of the institutional architecture of the Manufacturing Mission and get its wheels in motion.",https://indiafoundation.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3.-Picture-for-article-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:19:48.183774

I&M’s Tips to Fight Back I&M recommends multiple practical steps to reduce phantom energy: Unplug small electronics when not in use — phone chargers, game consoles, etc.
Bottom Line Phantom energy may not be the most visible component of your utility bill — but it can be a silent drain on your wallet and on the environment.","FORT WAYNE, Ind. (Oct. 2025) – What looks like a powered-down home may still be costing you money. Utility company Indiana Michigan Power is urging customers to beware of so-called phantom energy — the electricity consumed by devices and appliances that are plugged in but not actively in use.

What is Phantom Energy?

Also known as “vampire load” or “standby power,” phantom energy is the small yet continuous power draw from electronics when they appear switched off but remain plugged in. According to recent studies, this hidden drain can account for 5% to 10% of a household’s total energy use. For example, smart TVs in standby mode have been measured drawing up to 40 watts.

Why It Matters

Even a few watts of wasted power, when multiplied across dozens of devices in a home and across thousands of homes in a region, adds up — in dollars paid and environmental impact.

For consumers, the cost can reach tens or hundreds of dollars per year. One estimate: if phantom loads represent 5% of average household energy use (the U.S. average ~10,791 kWh/year), the annual cost might be $90–$180 or more depending on local rates.

For utilities and the grid, wasted standby power means avoidable demand, increased infrastructure strain and extra emissions from power generation.

I&M’s Tips to Fight Back

I&M recommends multiple practical steps to reduce phantom energy:

Unplug small electronics when not in use — phone chargers, game consoles, etc.

Use advanced power strips or smart plugs that cut power flow when devices aren’t active.

Replace old or inefficient appliances with ENERGY STAR® models that draw very little standby power.

For customers equipped with smart meters, I&M says they should regularly review their Weekly Energy Update reports in their account — helping spot unusual usage patterns.

Smart Meters & Usage Tracking

I&M’s rollout of smart meters enables customers to monitor energy usage in 15-minute increments, often through the online account portal or mobile app. By reviewing detailed usage data, households can identify when devices may be drawing power unnecessarily — for example, during “off hours” when everything should be asleep.

Real-World Impact & Consumer Example

According to the U.S. Dept. of Energy and other sources, phantom loads can add up to 10% of home electricity use, which translates to significant cost over time.

One scenario: A typical home might have 40 devices drawing even a small standby wattage each; combined, that could lead to hundreds of extra kilowatt-hours per year.

While each device’s draw might be modest, the cumulative effect is real — and preventable.

Why Many Homes Let It Slide

Many consumers assume that “off” means “zero power,” but that isn’t always true — especially for devices with standby modes, remote-control capability, network connection or digital displays.

Unplugging everything manually can be inconvenient, so tools like smart plugs or power strips that shut off groups of devices are often more practical.

Some devices continue to draw minimal power by design (for memory retention, remote access, clock displays), so complete elimination may require new equipment or changing habits.

What to Do Today

Walk through your home and identify devices that stay plugged in continuously but are rarely used.

For each: Ask “Does this need to be plugged in all the time?” If the answer is no, unplug it or plug it into a switchable strip.

If you have a smart meter through I&M, log into your account and review the Weekly Energy Update. Does usage drop during known “quiet” periods (overnight, work hours)? If not, investigate what could be drawing power.

Consider investing in smart plugs (especially for entertainment systems) or advanced power strips with auto shut-off features.

When replacing major appliances, look for models with low standby power draw (check specs for standby watts) and buy ENERGY STAR rated when available.

Bottom Line

Phantom energy may not be the most visible component of your utility bill — but it can be a silent drain on your wallet and on the environment. With thousands of homes under I&M’s service area, the combined savings from reducing standby power could be substantial. The good news? Simple adjustments + smart monitoring can make a real difference.

For I&M customers, checking your smart-meter data, unplugging unused chargers, and using switchable power strips are easy steps you can take today. Over time, those small actions add up — both in dollars saved and carbon emissions reduced.",https://wowo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Power-lines.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:02:02.595913

Labour’s newly published Clean Energy Jobs Plan is a million miles away from where we’d be with Reform. It’s a credible plan to double the jobs in the clean energy sector within five years. It’s a plan that sets out routes to provide up to 20,000 more jobs in Yorkshire alone, making thousands of new jobs in construction, engineering, electronics and applied science.

And these aren’t jobs for elites or distant promises. These are secure futures for existing workers and the promise of good futures for real people in their own towns. It’s a plan for you and your family. This is a plan for economic security of a type we’ve not seen here for decades.

Farage would scrap all this. Reform’s rhetoric of ‘net stupid zero’ is a promise to take away your future, to pull the rug from under thousands of workers and young people, and plunge Yorkshire into futureless contemplation of a lost chance at reindustrialisation.

The clean energy economy is already growing at twice the rate of the wider economy, and this plan both increases that growth and scoops up our people to ride it out. These clean energy jobs come as standard with good wages, stability, and reliable career trajectories. They’re the kind of jobs you can put down roots with; jobs you can build families on.

Reform votes against improving workers’ rights. Reform is the party of zero-hour contracts, unfair dismissal, and fire and rehire. They’re the party of the past.

Labour works with trade unions. That’s why this plan includes commitments to grow pay packets, standardise good conditions, and ensure trade union recognition in clean energy industries. Good work builds strong industries and strong communities. This plan offers our working-class communities a future to be proud of.

We now have a roadmap that leads to a thriving clean energy sector right here on our doorstep.

Clean energy means we slow climate change, prevent flooding in our communities, stave off deadly heatwaves, reduce climate migration turmoil, and ensure stable food supply and pricing.

But with this government’s commitment to building the kind of clean energy sector that trade unions are fighting for, clean energy also means prosperity for Yorkshire and the Humber, a stop to the brain drain from our towns, resolidified coastal and rural communities, and work to be proud of.

The trade union movement wants these things. And we’re, on this at least, largely in step with Labour.

Reform doesn’t want you to have a slice of this future. Reform wants our communities to absorb climate chaos in higher insurance costs, more heat deaths, dangerous and insecure work. And Reform wants you to blame someone else for their ideological choice to sell your future down the river.

Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Climate Agreement, says the EU must learn from China’s clean tech strategy, which has seen it establish a commanding manufacturing dominance in solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles.

Tubiana, who is CEO of the European Climate Foundation and was appointed the COP30 special envoy to Europe by the summit’s Brazilian president, was in Luxembourg in September to address a forum organised by the Chamber of Commerce.

In a press briefing she argued that the EU’s defensive industrial policy on clean tech and electric vehicles from China was the wrong approach. As recently as 22 October, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the bloc must learn lessons from the way it lost out on being a global leader in solar energy to “heavily subsidised Chinese competitors”.

That was a “a cautionary tale that we must not forget,” von der Leyen told MEPs the day before a council meeting of EU leaders in Brussels agreed to move ahead rapidly – before COP30 – with setting a 2040 target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to 1990 levels.

They ambitiously want to finalise the appropriate amendment to the European climate law at a meeting of environment ministers in the Belgian capital on 4 November, just two days before the COP Heads of State Summit in Brazil.

Von der Leyen insists that the shift to a clean economy is Europe’s chance to revitalise industries and cut reliance on imports from China.

Strategy could create jobs and help develop new skills

This is contrary to what Tubiana wants to see from the EU leadership. She said that seeking agreements with China that create the conditions for joint ventures, investment, and technological cooperation was a smarter approach, especially if such a strategy could create jobs and help the workforce develop new skills.

Tubiana is supported in her views by fellow climate experts Emmanuel Guerin and Bernice Lee. “Europe and China must find common cause on clean trade and investment – one of the few areas where strategic self-interest and global public goods still converge,” they wrote in an article for Project Syndicate.

But Luxembourg is not biting. Not publicly, at any rate. In response to a query from Luxembourg Times, Luxembourg’s ministry for foreign affairs and foreign trade said that “as a general rule” it “does not comment on policy outlines and recommendations of individuals in academia.”

Tubiana has argued that Europe must show humility in recognising that technological leadership has shifted. “The transfer of knowledge must be reversed,” she said. “Rather than merely hosting Chinese manufacturing, Europeans should consider what they can learn from it, just as China did from European and American firms in earlier phases of its industrial rise.”

Indeed, as The New York Times pointed out in an article this summer, “China applied for more than twice as many high-quality clean energy patents as the United States in 2022, the most recent year of complete data.” These include what the NYT called “new, groundbreaking versions” of widespread clean energy technologies that were pioneered elsewhere.

That article cited Jenny Wong Leung, an analyst and data scientist at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who said that the sheer volume of Chinese investment in clean tech has been significantly larger than in the West. “It meant they [the Chinese] could build industries from the ground up, all the way through the supply chain,” Wong Leung said.

Luxembourg-China trade

Bilateral trade between Luxembourg and China, including Hong Kong, reached a total volume of €5.69 billion in 2024, placing China 12th among Luxembourg’s individual trading partners according to state statistic office Statec.

“Luxembourg is among the countries in the world where China is not among the three biggest trading partners,” the ministry of foreign affairs and trade told Luxembourg Times.

If grouped by trading bloc, China comes 5th as Luxembourg’s top export and import destination - behind the rest of the EU, US, UK and Switzerland.

Trade between the two countries has grown consistently, by 62.5% over the past decade, while Luxembourg’s overall foreign trade has nearly doubled (+99.1%) during the same period.

But, as Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel pointed out in his annual address to parliament last week, while China is the world’s largest producer of green technology it is also the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. Its emissions from fuel combustion made up 32.1% of the global total in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.

Luxembourg must maintain dialogue with China

Bettel, who together with Economy Minister Lex Delles led a delegation to the Middle Kingdom last year with a focus on clean tech and the automobile sector, said that Luxembourg must maintain dialogue with China, “even if we are not of the same opinion or if subjects are difficult,” he told MPs last week. “We shouldn’t be afraid to say anything.”

There have been suggestions that Chinese clean tech could pose security risks, for instance by exploiting cyber vulnerabilities in supply chains, alongside a slew of warnings that AI platform DeepSeek and social media app TikTok could serve as a tool for mass data collection and surveillance. Luxembourg seems to think it has such threats in hand.

“Any personal data transfers from the EU to third countries — including China — are strictly regulated under the GDPR,” the foreign ministry said in an email. “Luxembourg’s data protection authority, CNPD, and the other EU independent supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring the application of this regulation.”

And the ministry also said that Luxembourg, along with its EU partners, will continue to “maintain a balanced and independent approach in its relations with both the United States and China.”

This comes after new US Ambassador to the Grand Duchy Stacey Feinberg issued a warning during evidence she gave to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in July that she believed Luxembourg was blind to what she called the “nefarious” intentions of China. She said that she would “humbly like to educate” Luxembourg about how to scrutinise China’s intentions and argued that the Grand Duchy should “decouple” from China.",https://img.wort.lu/public/wirtschaft/p8j7yc-33888336.jpg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/33888336.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:20:05.924264

Solar’s long-term economics are simply too strong to ignore, even without the tax credit.

To me, this isn’t the end of residential solar; it’s a reset.","When Congress and the president cut the 30% residential solar tax credit last July, ending it 10 years ahead of schedule, it sent shockwaves through the solar industry.

Homeowners and installers alike have been racing to get systems energized before Dec. 31, knowing it’s their last chance to claim the 25D credit.

There’s no question we’ll see a slowdown in residential installations once the year ends. But I believe it will be temporary. Solar’s long-term economics are simply too strong to ignore, even without the tax credit.

Utility rates continue to climb nationally, with residential electricity prices rising 11% between January and August, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And as Bret Biggart (CEO of TXSES Platinum Business Members Freedom Solar) explained on Doug Lewin’s “Energy Capital” Podcast, “Every utility in Texas that we operate in estimates a 5% increase in electricity prices next year ... and probably a lot more ... even in municipal utilities like Austin Energy or CPS. And in Austin Energy, it’s a five-year, 5% step-up ... so in a couple of years, we work back to a price of power being pushed up where the 30% tax credit is sort of offset.”

In other words, at this pace, the savings from going solar will soon make up for the lost tax incentive.

48E tax credit use through

third-party ownership The good news is that there’s still a workaround for those who miss the deadline, and it comes through third-party ownership, or TPO. Instead of buying a system outright, homeowners can host one that’s owned by a developer or financier. The company installs, maintains and operates the panels, and the homeowner simply pays for the power it produces (through a power purchase agreement) or for the right to use the system (through a lease).

Because the developer owns the system, they can claim the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, which remains available through 2027. That credit covers up to 30% of project costs, and potentially more for projects that meet domestic content or labor standards.

Developers can pass those savings on to homeowners through lower monthly payments or discounted energy rates.

This approach isn’t new. TPO already makes up about 45% of residential solar installations in the U.S. But it’s about to become much more important. Analysts expect the TPO market to grow by 25% in 2026, driven by companies like Sunrun, Palmetto and GoodLeap that are already leveraging the 48E credit.

A temporary setback, not the end Yes, there are hurdles — domestic content and foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions — but some developers are finding creative ways to adapt.

Nonprofits like Georgia BRIGHT are even offering “Safe Harbor” programs that lock in 48E eligibility through 2029 for projects that purchase at least 5% of their equipment this year.

To me, this isn’t the end of residential solar; it’s a reset. Rising utility prices and innovative financing models like TPO mean solar will continue to thrive, even without the 25D credit.

If you’re planning to go solar this year, make sure your system will be fully interconnected and energized by Dec. 31 to ensure you get the 30% credit. After that, third-party ownership may be the best path forward in a post-tax-credit world.",https://static2.boernestar.com/data/wysiwig/logo/social%20media%20logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:59:07.424691

The Scheme aims to significantly increase appropriate end-of-life battery disposal and recycling in Australia.
Interested parties have raised broader policy issues around battery stewardship, including that participation should be made mandatory, and the scope and operation of the Scheme.
“It is also not the ACCC’s role to determine public policy outcomes or broader policy issues, including regulation reform to make battery stewardship mandatory.
More information, including the ACCC’s draft determination, is available online on the ACCC’s public register at Battery Stewardship Council.","The Battery Stewardship Council (BSC) has been granted an exemption for the next five years by the ACCC to allow it to continue to operate its B-cycle Battery Stewardship Scheme (Scheme). Following the decision, BSC members and industry participants can continue to operate the Scheme without breaching competition laws.

The Scheme aims to significantly increase appropriate end-of-life battery disposal and recycling in Australia.

“We consider the Scheme is likely to result in environmental benefits by diverting batteries from landfill as well as reducing fire risks in the collection, transport, sorting, and processing of end-of-life batteries,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.

“It should also support some increased research, development and innovation in the disposal and re-use of end-of-life batteries in Australia.”

The ACCC's role is to assess the application put before it and to determine whether the proposed conduct is likely to result in an overall public benefit, which was satisfied in this instance.

The ACCC recognises that in part, due to the voluntary nature of this Scheme, participation rates and therefore the number of batteries collected and recycled has been relatively low.

Interested parties have raised broader policy issues around battery stewardship, including that participation should be made mandatory, and the scope and operation of the Scheme.

“The ACCC recognises that higher rates of participation in battery stewardship would substantially increase public benefits from greater collection and recycling of batteries. However, it is not our role to develop such a scheme,” Mr Keogh said.

“It is also not the ACCC’s role to determine public policy outcomes or broader policy issues, including regulation reform to make battery stewardship mandatory. This is a matter for governments”.

“Minimising the safety risks associated with storing button batteries must continue to be a priority,” Mr Keogh said.

“Therefore, we have imposed a condition in our authorisation that the BSC continues its Button Battery Safety Strategy, which aims to educate consumers and mitigate the risks associated with button batteries, such as the serious injuries they can inflict on children when ingested.”

The ACCC recognises that the BSC has undertaken broad consultation with industry stakeholders on approaches to the Scheme’s design and protocols.

However, to ensure this dialogue continues, the ACCC has imposed a condition requiring the BSC to create, publish and implement a consultation protocol outlining the consultation process with Scheme participants should certain changes to the Scheme be made throughout the authorisation period.

To ensure sufficient transparency and effectiveness of the Scheme, the ACCC has also required an annual report on key Scheme outcomes and targets to be published by the BSC. An independent review of the Scheme’s performance, governance and financial position must be undertaken in three years’ time.

The ACCC considers a three-year timeframe to commence an independent review allows sufficient time for the BSC to implement its proposed improvements to the Scheme and for measurable outcomes to be assessed.

Interested parties have proposed a shorter authorisation period of two to three years due to uncertainty around the introduction of mandatory product stewardship legislation.

“The ACCC does not consider the authorisation replaces or diminishes government's role or ability to act in relation to product stewardship arrangements for batteries as the two processes are largely independent of each other” Mr Keogh said.

More information, including the ACCC’s draft determination, is available online on the ACCC’s public register at Battery Stewardship Council.

Note to editors

The ACCC is not an environmental regulator or policy agency. The ACCC’s role as Australia’s competition regulator includes assessing applications for authorisation. ACCC authorisation provides statutory protection from court action for certain conduct by competitors that might otherwise raise concerns under the competition provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Act).

The ACCC must not make a determination granting authorisation unless it is satisfied, in all the circumstances, that the conduct would likely result in a benefit to the public and that benefit would likely outweigh any potential detriment from the conduct. In this instance, authorisation is proposed in respect of Division 1 of Part IV (cartel conduct), section 45 and section 47 of the Act (contracts, arrangements or understandings that restrict dealings or affect competition, and exclusive dealing).

Background

Product stewardship is an environmental management strategy that means whoever designs, produces, sells or uses a product takes responsibility for minimising that product’s environmental impact through all the stages of its life cycle.

The BSC is a not-for-profit entity established to operate and oversee the Scheme, which promotes the safe collection, recycling, and disposal of end-of-life batteries. The Scheme does not cover automotive lead-acid batteries or batteries already included in other recycling programs.

The proposed conduct also adds an annual review process to set the levy and rebates using eco-modulated formulas based on battery type to cover the increased costs and risks of battery collection and recycling. The BSC’s proposal seeks to raise sufficient revenue that it can continue to implement public awareness campaigns to increase participation in battery recycling.

On 4 June 2025, the ACCC granted interim authorisation with a condition for the BSC to continue operating the Scheme with the ability to increase levies to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index since the Scheme’s commencement. The BSC is also able to progress the development of new levy arrangements involving an eco-modulated levy to reflect the different costs of collecting and recycling different battery types, until the substantive authorisation comes into effect.

Regulatory developments

On 16 October 2025, the NSW Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA) released the proposed regulation under the Product Lifecycle Responsibility Act 2025 (NSW) (PLR Act) for public consultation. The draft regulation provides the legal framework for the proposed mandatory NSW product stewardship scheme for end-of-life batteries, where brand owners who supply batteries into NSW will be required to be a member of a product stewardship organisation that has an agreement with the NSW EPA. The draft regulation would also require product stewardship organisations that enter into an agreement with NSW EPA to comply with that agreement (potentially with penalties for non-compliance) and:

prepare and publish an action plan detailing how they intend to meet requirements in the regulation and their agreement with the NSW EPA

keep records and report quarterly/annually on a range of performance and financial measures.

The battery types in scope of the NSW draft regulation include standard size batteries used to power household items, button and button cell batteries, removable rechargeable batteries weighing 5kg or less, and portable power banks weighing 5kg or less. The draft regulation also captures e-micromobility devices where it is not practicable to remove a regulated battery from an e-micromobility device. NSW EPA’s regulatory impact statement for the proposed draft regulation states that it has engaged extensively with other Australian states and territories to discuss opportunities to put in place similar legislative frameworks to achieve a nationally aligned approach and reduce the impact on the common market.

NSW EPA is seeking feedback on the proposed regulation by 14 November 2025 and expects the regulation to commence in mid-2026.",https://www.accc.gov.au/sites/www.accc.gov.au/themes/acccgov_theme/images/og-image.png,N,,2025-11-03 03:18:05.143556

Though it is tempting to suggest the reason is purely a matter of GM’s overeagerness to catch up to the electric vehicle push, the reality is a bit more complicated.

At the company’s Ultium Cells battery cell plant in Lordstown there are expected to be approximately 550 cuts and 850 temporary layoffs, according to a report by CNBC. There will also be approximately 700 layoffs at the Ultium Cells plant in Tennessee.

Those gleefully pointing to the staffing cuts as evidence that the electric vehicle movement is failing should be quickly silenced by the reminder that these are hundreds upon hundreds of Buckeye State residents being laid off or losing their jobs entirely, less than two months before Christmas — and in the middle of a federal government shutdown that has put all kinds of resources in jeopardy.

And this isn’t about reassessing Americans’ desire to drive electric vehicles.

“In response to slower near-term (emphasis ours) EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said in a statement. “Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint … ”

One of those changes is a planned upgrade of the facilities in Ohio and Tennessee, which will allow it to resume operations at both sites in the middle of next year, according to CNBC. Meanwhile, the company is also cutting hundreds of jobs at its global tech campus near Detroit, and working through that “evolving regulatory environment” — i.e. uncertainty about which way the wind will blow from day to day in Washington, D.C.; and continued slow spending growth as families remain cautious about how they use their money.

Companies don’t make this kind of decision based on political whims. They’re interested in numbers, facts … what will make them money AND be best for the company and its employees.

“We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, … but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,” CFO Paul Jacobson said on CNBC.

GM isn’t giving up on EVs. It’s changing the way it thinks about producing them. While it goes through those growing pains, the rest of us should steer clear of political cheap shots and remember instead that GM’s workers are experiencing pain, too.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.tribtoday.com/images/2016/10/11191558/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 01:01:25.720115

Panelists discussed efficiency upgrades, clean energy programs and C-PACE

AI’s role in managing energy demand and predictive maintenance is growing

As part of NJBIZ’s latest virtual discussion, panelists spoke about current trends and issues relating to energy, infrastructure and innovation in New Jersey.

Moderated by NJBIZ Editor Jeffrey Kanige, the Oct. 28 program featured:

William Heller, of counsel at Newark-headquartered law firm Genova Burns LLC

Tiffany Lewis, outreach manager for TRC Cos. Inc., a global consulting, engineering and construction management firm specializing in environmentally focused, digitally powered solutions

Laurie Weigand-Jackson, president and CEO of Utility Advantage, a Woodstown-based energy consulting and services firm

Matthew Fazelpoor, energy and infrastructure reporter at NJBIZ

During the 90-minute roundtable discussion, panelists addressed the significant energy rate hikes New Jersey consumers have experienced this year and how to offset those cost increases, using AI to optimize energy efficiency, demand and maintenance, and protecting critical energy infrastructure from cyber threats.

In June, New Jersey consumers saw significant energy rate hikes, with residential electricity bills rising between 17% and 20%, or roughly $22 to $28 more per month for an average household.

The increases were largely driven by higher wholesale and capacity costs in PJM Interconnection LLC’s regional power market and a supply that is outpaced by demand. To ease the impact, state regulators approved a temporary $60 summer bill credit and extended protections against shut offs for low-income and vulnerable customers.

On the campaign trail

Fazelpoor described it as a “prominent issue” in the Nov. 4 gubernational election between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

“In other campaigns, energy’s mentioned, but not always. Property taxes and affordability in New Jersey is always top of mind,” he said. “If not the top issue right now, it is one of the top two, three issues in the state that’s being discussed everywhere.”

“It hits into all the other things going on – cost of living, health insurance, mortgage rates, everything,” he said. “And just the timing of it hitting June 1 right before summer, it definitely made an impact.”

Weigand-Jackson said, “I think what the business community is dealing with right now is just trying to understand why? And are we going to see this for the next couple of years? Is this just a one-off? I think from our perspective, this is going to be for a couple of years.”

Weigand-Jackson went on to explain that recent electricity price hikes and supply constraints stem largely from issues between PJM and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For years, the back-and-forth over how to run capacity auctions disrupted the usual three-year planning cycle, making it hard for power generators and developers – both fossil fuel and renewable – to plan new projects, she said.

Not an overnight fix

As a result, generation hasn’t kept pace with rising demand driven by data centers, AI and cryptocurrency. She also blames PJM’s backlog of unprocessed renewable projects, higher natural gas prices, and outdated federal rules that kept some clean-energy projects out of the market — all of which have combined to tighten supply and push prices higher.

“There’s a lot happening in the market that over the past five or six years led to this point. So, it wasn’t as if one thing caused it, and it’s not something that’s going to get fixed overnight. But fundamentally, the issues relate to the fact that we do not have enough supply to meet demand,” she said.

She went on to say, “The grid absolutely needs to be modernized. Our grid is this grid that we’ve had a hundred-plus years … And we have been investing in upgrades to the grid, but not specifically to support where this new generating assets would be coming online per se. And that’s why PJM has this really long queue of projects because what they’re doing is assessing the impact on the transmission system. It is tied together – both transmission and generation – but we don’t know what the transmission upgrades are until PJM does their analysis.”

“They’re the ones that are responsible for this. They manage and operate that power grid from Illinois to Jersey to West Virginia. This massive grid – the biggest in the country is operated by PJM – and they’re the ones that have to do these analyses, approve transmission projects or submit them up. And then FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] also gets involved because it’s interstate commerce. So, there is a combination of the need for transmission upgrades, but where do we upgrade the transmission system? Well, we have to know where the generation is going to be.”

Surge of support

Lewis said, “All of the utility companies throughout the state are really investing to support customers with decreasing their energy use. So, they’re putting more teams out there in terms of engagement and community engagement and doing outreach to really connect with the customers and ensure that even underserved communities and UEZ [Urban Enterprise Zone] zones are receiving that additional support so that they can help fund projects that will help decrease their utility bills.”

“There are individuals where their utility bills are a significant portion of their expenses … there’s a sector of our state here that is really struggling with these high energy costs and I’m appreciating what is happening right now to try to alleviate some of that specifically for our most affected consumers,” Weigand-Jackson said.

Lewis went on to encourage all rate payers – whether they are homeowners, renters or businesses – to connect with utility companies to learn about the range of available resources, such as energy audits and financing support, to fund energy efficient upgrades.

She also pointed out that the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is actively investing in clean energy programs by offering funding and credits for municipalities and commercial facilities that look to add technology or undertake projects to save energy and strengthen resilience.

“Part of the goal is to decrease the customer’s energy use so that we can decrease that demand on the grid to support with less power outages and these issues while the utilities are still upgrading their infrastructure because they have a long way to go,” said Lewis, who works with JCP&L (FirstEnergy company Jersey Central Power & Light) through her role at TRC.

Getting energized

While offshore wind development in New Jersey remains at a standstill, panelists spoke about growing adoption of solar power across the state in recent years. For example, Heller, a former senior vice president and general counsel of the New York Giants NFL team, noted that when NRG became a sponsor of MetLife Stadium about a decade ago, it added a ring of 1,350 solar panels on the roof of the East Rutherford property.

Because New Jersey lacks large open land for massive solar farms, the state’s focus is on smaller distributed energy projects placed strategically where the grid can support them, according to Weigand-Jackson.

She emphasized the need to improve energy efficiency and expanded distributed resources, like solar, battery storage and demand management, as a way to reduce consumption and costs. “I do think the solution is more distributed energy solutions and not large-scale plants,” Weigand-Jackson added.

As for public-private partnerships to help spur development of such systems, Fazelpoor said he hasn’t heard of much happening in that area.

“And even if a company were going to make an investment right now, the timeline is many, many years out,” he said. “Given that the problem is already at our doorstep and likely to grow with the demand of data centers and AI, it’s all kind of colliding with those factors in place.”

And, with energy becoming such a political issue in New Jersey, he believes that will make it “even harder to get anything done right now.”

Data center demands

Additionally, participants reflected on the issue of data centers.

In New Jersey, development and construction of facilities involved in AI operations and cloud computing is typically focused in the central and southern parts of the state. But the massive amounts of electricity and cooling required for the sites has led to local concerns. Much of the opposition centers on how that high-energy demand can strain the grid and raise electricity prices. Environmental impacts, like noise, water use and land consumption, have also been flagged.

Weigand-Jackson said data centers should fund their own energy generation or infrastructure upgrades rather than passing those costs to all ratepayers.

“We can absolutely require them to do that. We can develop rate structures specifically for data centers. We can put policies in place that is something the state can control,” she said, noting that Ohio recently began regulating such sites more closely after rapid growth in the industry.

As of July, Ohio’s utilities commission requires large data centers to pay for at least 85% of their subscribed electricity capacity, even if they use less, to prevent higher costs for other customers. Regulators also created a special tariff class for data centers and ended a temporary moratorium on new connections once those rules were in place.

At the same time, the Buckeye State continues to offer tax incentives to attract data center development, such as sales tax exemptions for major investments, while managing its grid impacts.

‘The time is now’

Panelists also agreed that how energy is used and managed is key.

Lewis explained that an important step for ratepayers right now revolves around energy management, such as upgrading systems and optimizing equipment to reduce peak energy use. Utilities are also offering incentives and training for businesses and contractors to help meet energy-saving goals while batter storage and distributed energy are still being developed.

Lewis continued, “There are funds available … the time is now. Please reach out and there is a wealth of resources and support available.”

One such resource is the Garden State Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) Program. Through the state-run initiative, commercial, industrial, agricultural and certain nonprofit owners can receive financing toward clean energy, water conservation and resiliency improvements.

Through C-PACE, power consumers can access long-term, low-interest financing for improvements such as solar panels, HVAC upgrades or flood protection, and repay the loan through a special assessment on their property tax bill. The financing stays with the property, not the owner, if it’s sold.

After the New Jersey Economic Development Authority approved the offering in October 2024, it began accepting project applications this past summer.

However, for property owners to use the program, municipalities must opt into it. As of August 2025, only six of the state’s 564 towns are active participants – Hackensack, Lakewood, New Brunswick, Oldmans Township, Plainfield and Woodbridge.

Weigand-Jackson said, “If you think this is something that would be good for your business, go talk to your municipality and ask them where they’re at … They probably all have heard about it, but they may not know enough or think that the demand is even there to go through the process of becoming a C-PACE municipality. But it is a financing mechanism that’s been operating all around the country successfully and ultimately is now here.”

‘Incremental steps’

“For a lot of business owners, they say, ‘Yeah, OK, that sounds great, but I don’t have the capital to replace this equipment right now. And if I’m going to put the money in, I’m going to put it into the main purpose of my business and not upgrading my heating or cooling or lighting or refrigeration equipment.’ But now we have either 0% or very low percent financing on your utility bill. It’s never been easier for businesses to take advantage of both the incentives and the financing. Energy efficiency is definitely something every business that’s listening should be looking at,” Weigand-Jackson added.

“Take a look at your utility bills, try to understand them, reach out to professionals who can help you understand them and start looking at energy as a manageable expense. It isn’t something you just have to take. You can actually do things to manage those costs,” she said, adding, “I would encourage people to be looking at energy efficiency and renewable energy. They’re cost-effective solutions and they are not too expensive, they’re viable today.

“Maybe 10, 15 years ago, things like solar were expensive. Now, it’s very commercially available. Very cost-effective. Battery storage? Not quite yet. But we will get there. That doesn’t mean don’t do battery storage — it just means that the cost is going to come down over time. So, it’s really a financial decision on your part at this point. But these are the things that you can do to help yourself at these times of volatile and rising energy costs,” Weigand-Jackson said.

“I think it’s even a better approach to talk to people about incremental steps. It’s important to have goals, I get that, but we need to be realistic. We don’t know how long it takes for technology to evolve and so I think it’s better to have the shorter-term ones of what we can do in the next three to five years and then keep working toward something,” she said.

AI-powered

The use of AI to manage energy is only increasing. According to business consulting firm Grand View Research, the global market is expected to rise from about $11 billion in 2024 to nearly $55 billion by 2030, as more adopt AI for grid management, forecasting and efficiency.

Driven by the need for cost reduction, greater efficiency and clean energy integration, utility and energy firms are using the tech for grid optimization, predictive maintenance and demand forecasting.

Just some of the tasks that AI is tapped for include: predicting energy demand so utilities can balance supply; optimizing building systems to use less energy automatically; detecting inefficiencies or equipment problems to prevent energy loss; and coordinating renewable sources, such as wind and solar, by forecasting output and adjusting usage.

The energy industry is also focused on collaborating with tech companies, like Microsoft, and research institutions, such as the Electric Power Research Institute, to scale AI, share data, develop models and modernize the grid for reliability and decarbonization.

“It is a tool and it’s a good tool, but it cannot be the sole tool because it generates the wrong information,” he said. “Many, many people are affected by the adoption of an AI-generated solution.

Mr. Gates’s path to becoming a climate authority is rooted in the same disruptive ethos that defined his technology career.","For more than a decade, Bill Gates’s views have come to define the respectable centre of climate discourse for the American elite. His words have carried the weight of authority and his ideas have bridged science, capital, and philanthropy in a distinct technocratic register.

Around 2019-2021, Mr. Gates’ climate messaging leaned towards apocalyptic urgency as he issued dire warnings of collapsing ecosystems, mass displacement, and a narrowing window for the world to achieve net-zero. The rhetoric helped spur public concerns but also reproduced the pitfalls of climate alarmism, which is to overstate catastrophic inevitability without also emphasising adaptive capacity and human agency. Alarmism can mobilise communities in the short term but in the long-term it invites disbelief and political backlash.

Now, Mr. Gates appears to have overcorrected. In a recent memo, he said that while climate change will have serious effects, it won’t threaten humanity’s survival. He also suggested that reducing poverty and disease would better equip vulnerable populations to face a warming world. The differences between “not apocalyptic” and “not severe” are crucial yet easily lost in public discourse. He assumed the audience would parse gradations of scientific probability; in reality it mainly registers tone.

A dangerous pivot

Mr. Gates’s position on climate adaptation has long been defined by the belief that technological innovation, investments, and systems engineering can decouple growth from emissions. While this view helped raise considerable funds for low-carbon energy research, it also perpetuated certain political tensions.

The foremost issue was that the optimism could be autocratic in practice. Mr. Gates’s philanthropic model channels private wealth into setting priorities for entire governments, and in his pre-recalibration era, these were technically sophisticated measures to limit the amount of carbon in our environs without addressing the human and natural processes that put it there. His philanthropy often bypassed democratic deliberation, so his approach to “solving” climate change could crowd out alternative discourses, especially those emphasising structural change.

Even now, Mr. Gates has said the world has made significant progress on cutting emissions. This isn’t strongly supported by data. The Global Carbon Project and Carbon Brief states that global fossil fuel emissions reached record highs in 2022-2024, although their rate of growth slowed from about 3% per year in the 2000s to roughly 0.5% per year in the last decade. Emissions due to land-use changes have decreased by 28% since the late 1990s but this progress is outweighed by continued growth in emissions, particularly in China and India.

There are also uncertainties in emissions accounting. Land-use change emissions estimates are uncertain due to incomplete data on forest degradation and regional data gaps, especially in tropical regions. Even where declines are reported, revisions between datasets shift cumulative global emissions by tens of gigatonnes. Year-to-year changes also have wide error ranges. Taken together, these uncertainties mean that while the rate of emissions growth may have slowed and land-use emissions likely decreased, it is premature to claim progress in emissions reduction.

Likewise, Mr. Gates’s pivot to prioritising global poverty and health also risks being read, especially by Western or corporate audiences, as the more convenient “we can keep burning now if we vaccinate the poor later”. This logic of substitution undermines the systemic simultaneity that climate adaptation action demands.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s reaction to Mr. Gates’s memo, claiming he had “won the war on the climate change hoax”, unsurprisingly reduced a re-evaluation to a hollow political victory. The more important consequences lie in the ripple effects of Mr. Gates’s own shift.

Ripple effects of the shift

While it was commendable, two facts complicate its perception. First, Mr. Gates continues to occupy an outsized place in the global climate discourse as he translates science into a sort of climate common sense for the elite. His moderation carries both symbolic and practical weight. Second, his first alarmist position raised the stakes to untenable levels, then lowered them in the face of conflicting evidence, setting up a textbook example of why brinkmanship is bad. Even if stepping back from the brink is laudable, it will fuel overweening denialists such as Mr. Trump, who have trouble differentiating moderation from retreat.

Mr. Gates’s path to becoming a climate authority is rooted in the same disruptive ethos that defined his technology career. He did not conquer the computing world with perfect, high-end products but by strategically pushing software and hardware that simply made computing more accessible. Ironically, he protected this dominance and opposed the open-source movement because he viewed it as a direct threat to Microsoft’s business model. But as the technology landscape evolved with the rise of the internet and cloud computing, Microsoft’s stance began to turn under new leadership. Mr. Gates himself acquiesced after it became clear the new paradigm would not cramp his business model.

In a world where great wealth and success are seen as a license to arbitrate on all critical societal issues, it is almost inevitable that Mr. Gates would become a climate seer — and that his opinions can’t be dismissed out of hand.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/xq6cwc/article70233869.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/California_Wildfires_Palisades_Investigation_15709.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 03:57:54.345873

When people feel confident in the technology, more drivers will be willing to make the switch from polluting gas-powered cars.","A German company has developed an innovative battery coating that can withstand extreme heat, potentially solving one of the major safety concerns for electric vehicle drivers.

The issue Axalta's creation solves is called thermal runaway. According to Interesting Engineering, it's a rare but serious event where a single battery cell overheats, triggering a chain reaction that can lead to a fire.

While statistics show that electric cars are far less likely to catch fire than gas-powered ones, scary stories can stick in people's minds.

""High-profile incidents and misinformation continue to impact public perception,"" Dr. Robert Roop, an executive at the company Axalta, told the publication.

Axalta's solution is a pair of new coatings that act like a super-powered fire blanket for batteries. One of the coatings, Alesta e-PRO FG Black, is designed for extreme heat protection and can withstand direct flames at temperatures up to an incredible 2,192 degrees Fahrenheit without producing any smoke.

This helps to delay or even prevent a fire from spreading, giving passengers crucial time to get to safety.

""The new coatings reflect our commitment to innovation and to partnering with customers to meet the challenges of next-generation mobility,"" Dr. Roop said.

This breakthrough is part of a huge wave of innovation happening in the EV battery world. For instance, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are exploring ways to recycle and repair old batteries instead of just melting them down.

In Africa, a new project is developing sodium-ion batteries to create a local supply chain that doesn't rely on lithium. Meanwhile, another team in Germany has developed a new laser welding technique to build stronger, crack-resistant battery housings.

Of course, switching to an EV already saves drivers a lot of money on gas and maintenance. Those savings get even bigger when you can charge up at home using energy generated via solar panels.

For homeowners looking to get a clear sense of the costs of solar panels, EnergySage is a trusted source that makes it easy to compare quotes from trusted local installers.

As for EV batteries, all of these improvements work together to make EVs safer, more reliable, and more accessible for everyone.

When people feel confident in the technology, more drivers will be willing to make the switch from polluting gas-powered cars. That means cleaner air in our communities, which is a huge win for public health.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/axaltaalestae-pro.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 03:18:08.922600

The group issued the call after monitoring plastic waste scattered across public and private cemeteries in Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, and Metro Manila — including the Manila North and South cemeteries — from October 31 to November 2.
Among the single-use plastics observed were plastic bags, bottles, cups, cutlery, straws, and polystyrene food and beverage containers, according to EcoWaste.
“We urge our lawmakers to prioritize the enactment of a law that will phase out and eventually ban the production and consumption of SUPs,” EcoWaste campaigner Ochie Tolentino said in a statement on Monday.
“This long-overdue pollution prevention legislation will surely help reduce the volume as well as the toxicity of what we throw away every day, especially during Undas and other cultural celebrations,” he added.","MANILA, Philippines — Pro-environmental group EcoWaste Coalition has called on Congress to enact a law that would phase out and eventually ban single-use plastics (SUPs) to help reduce the country’s growing volume of garbage, following this year’s observance of Undas (All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day).

“This long-overdue pollution prevention legislation will surely help reduce the volume as well as the toxicity of what we throw away every day, especially during Undas and other cultural celebrations,” he added.

EcoWaste noted that while less litter was observed inside cemeteries due to the efforts of street sweepers and regular cleanups, streets outside cemetery compounds from November 1 to 2 were still littered with assorted garbage, including food packaging and leftovers.

“Less litter and less garbage will be generated in the future Undas if SUPs are phased out, if local government units effectively enforce existing plastic ban ordinances, and if RA 9003-compliant waste management systems are implemented inside and outside cemeteries, memorial parks and columbaria,” the group said.

Republic Act No. 9003, also known as the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, aims to protect public health and the environment by promoting sustainable waste prevention and reduction practices, including source reduction, reuse, recycling, composting and proper disposal.

But Tolentino emphasized that simply placing trash bins for mixed waste in cemeteries is not enough, as garbage still needs to be properly segregated to ensure efficient recycling, prevent contamination, and minimize the amount of residual waste that ends up in landfills.

“As most cemeteries lack ecological solid waste management plans and adequate personnel to carry them out, especially during Undas when thousands visit their departed loved ones, it is best for visitors not to leave any trash behind, no matter how little,” he added. /apl",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2025/11/Manila-North-Cemetery-1-3-scaled-e1762144670969.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 23:57:49.048498

The fight for science and human progress can only take place through the building of a socialist movement in the working class.","Changes in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), run under the direct control of the president since it was established by Richard Nixon in 1970, will transform the mission of the agency from protecting human health from environmental toxins to directly serving the profit interests of corporate polluters. Field workers and scientists are being terminated by the Trump administration, and the leadership of EPA divisions is being replaced by corporate flunkies.

Earlier this month, President Trump declared that during the federal government shutdown, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought would decide “which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.” Trump added, “I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.”

In July, the EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) was closed and replaced by the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES), which has been systematically staffed with Trump-aligned administrators after previous officials were forced out.

In an October 21 article, environmental reporter Hiroko Tabuchi of the New York Times summarized articles she has written exposing the restaffing of the EPA with former industry lobbyists whose careers were made fighting the agency’s anti-pollution measures:

David Fotouhi has been installed as EPA deputy administrator under Administrator Lee Zeldin, himself a former Army intelligence officer and Republican congressman. Fotouhi is a lawyer who has fought the banning of asbestos on behalf of corporate interests.

Alex Dominguez, the new deputy assistant administrator, is a former petroleum industry lobbyist.

Aaron Szabo, who heads the Office of Air and Radiation, was a lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry trade association.

Nancy Beck, who is overseeing the approval of new chemicals for the EPA, was an executive of the American Chemistry Council.

Lynn Dekleva, formerly a director of the same industry organization, who lobbied against the regulation of formaldehyde, is now leading the EPA chemical safety office.

Steven Cook was an attorney for the chemical industry and is now working to repeal cleanup rules for PFAs, known as “forever chemicals.”

Kyle Kunkler has been placed in charge of pesticides policy. Previously he represented the soybean industry, promoting the unrestricted use of the weed killer dicamba. The latter is a controversial chemical sold by Monsanto, BASF and DuPont that is tailored to boost genetically modified soybean plants but can damage neighboring crops when it drifts into the air. Within weeks of Kunkler’s appointment, the EPA recommended a rollback of restrictions on dicamba.

In late June, hundreds of EPA scientists submitted an open letter of protest titled a “Declaration of Dissent.” Addressed to Zeldin, the letter centered on “Five Primary Concerns” over policies that “recklessly undermine the EPA mission:”

1. Undermining public trust

2. Ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters

3. Reversing EPA’s progress in America’s most vulnerable communities

4. Dismantling the Office of Research and Development

5. Promoting a culture of fear, forcing staff to choose between their livelihood and the population’s well-being.

The letter of protest cited Trump’s OMB director, Russell Vought, the co-author of Project 2025, which declared that EPA employees should be in a constant state of terror. It stated:

When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can’t do all of the rules against our energy industry... We want to put them in trauma.

The response of Trump to the protest was to retaliate. An investigation was carried out to identify the signatories, including those who signed the letter anonymously. Some 140 employees, including drinking water field workers, were subsequently placed on administrative leave.

The signatories are to be permanently fired. The Trump administration announced a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting the administration’s agenda.”

The attacks on the EPA express the drive of the capitalist establishment to destroy any and all measures that stand in the way of its pursuit of corporate profit.

In a statement distributed to the “Stand Up for Science” demonstrations held in March of this year, titled “The defense of science requires a fight for socialism!”, the Socialist Equality Party wrote:

Modern science and technology have made it possible to wipe out hunger and disease, vanquish ignorance and mysticism, and provide a high standard of living for every human being on the planet. Moreover, the revolutionary developments in transportation and communications, most recently through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, have shattered the barriers to human interaction and made possible the education and integration of all humanity on a scale never before seen in history.

The fight for science and human progress can only take place through the building of a socialist movement in the working class. Scientists are experiencing the same process of proletarianization now affecting doctors, teachers and other professionals. Scientists must recognize their common interests with all workers facing attacks on their living standards, jobs and democratic rights. No matter your education level or salary, to the oligarchy that rules America, you are as expendable as any other worker.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/d2b2f2b8-5b26-4485-8914-a2efdda24529?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-11-03 02:20:50.471253

We will not allow these activist organizations to push misguided policies that can’t win at the ballot box and inflate prices for Florida consumers.”

The letter to the U.S. Plastics Pact focuses on the organization’s “Roadmap to 2025,” which requires member companies to meet four central goals: eliminating problematic plastics, ensuring all packaging is recyclable or compostable, recycling or composting 50 percent of plastic packaging, and incorporating 30 percent recycled or biobased content in products. The attorneys general argue that such uniform targets could artificially alter output and quality across industries, violating prohibitions on agreements not to compete.

A similar letter to the Consumer Goods Forum raises concerns about the group’s “Coalition of Action on Plastic Waste,” which promotes its “Golden Design Rules” for packaging and seeks to align corporate members on circular economy principles and extended producer responsibility policies. The coalition asserts that these efforts represent coordinated market behavior rather than independent business decisions.

The letter to the Green Blue Institute’s Sustainable Packaging Coalition echoes those concerns, noting the group’s stated goal of “harnessing the power of industry” to drive new packaging strategies across the “entire value chain.” The attorneys general said this type of collaboration may constitute an “agreement to make a product of inferior quality,” which courts have recognized as an unlawful output restriction.

The attorneys general requested responses and supporting documents explaining how each organization’s activities comply with competition and consumer protection laws.",https://i0.wp.com/thecapitolist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-08-at-4.31.05-PM.png?fit=1200%2C697&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-02 23:57:54.174081

For years, Virgin Islanders have fought for Maroon Ridge and Annaly Bay on St. Croix to be protected, and a deal finalized in August by the administration of Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. has made that possible.

""This investment is about conservation and about honoring the struggles of those who came before us,"" Bryan said. ""It ensures that future generations of Virgin Islanders will have access to lands that tell our story, reflect our heritage and strengthen our pride.""

Kristina ""Kitty"" Edwards, the director of the Division of Territorial Parks and Protected Areas, added, ""Today is a victory for [advocates] and for everyone who values our natural and cultural heritage.""

According to a press release, the land acquisition cost $69 million. It was funded through the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.

The vast expanse of land, known as Maroon Sanctuary Territorial Park, will extend the Territorial Parks System and be managed by DPNR's Division of Territorial Parks and Protected Areas.

The newly protected area of Maroon Ridge holds cultural importance, as it was once a settlement for enslaved Africans who escaped bondage, as GoToStCroix.com detailed.

This surge appears to be driven by strong second and third quarter results, as well as expectations that solar power orders will increase in response to rising electricity demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

Previously, on October 27, HD Hyundai Energy Solution, a company specializing in the production and supply of solar cells and modules, announced its preliminary consolidated results for the third quarter of this year: sales of 121 billion won and operating profit of 14.7 billion won. Compared to the same period last year, sales jumped by 20.3% and operating profit soared by 328.8%. Although the company posted a loss in the first quarter of this year, it has delivered strong results for two consecutive quarters in the second and third quarters.

Meanwhile, the market expects that as the construction boom for AI data centers-especially in the United States-drives a surge in various types of electricity demand, solar power orders will also increase. A testament to this is the recent large-scale solar power purchase agreement signed by Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, for nearly 1 GW (gigawatt) of capacity. One gigawatt is equivalent to the output of a nuclear power plant, enough to power approximately one million households simultaneously.

According to IT media outlets such as TechCrunch on October 31 (local time), Meta recently signed an agreement to receive power from a new 600 MW (megawatt) solar power plant being built by the North American subsidiary of French energy company ENGIE in Lubbock, Texas, with operations set to begin in 2027. Meta has also entered into a contract with another power provider, Trittioak Clean Energy, to receive 385 MW of solar power generated in Louisiana after 2027.

Unlike thermal power, which is experiencing turbine supply bottlenecks, or nuclear power, which takes a long time from order to completion, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, as well as fuel cell power generation, can be built within one to two years. This advantage is expected to lead to continued orders as a source of electricity for the rapidly increasing number of data centers.

It's also no surprise to learn that almost everything, in terms of valuation, now rides on robotaxis and on achieving the aim of making publicly available unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software a reality. However, what's less discussed is that CEO Elon Musk just doubled down on the recent earnings call, which is making the stock riskier.

Why robotaxis and unsupervised full-self driving matter

The importance of robotaxis and publicly available unsupervised FSD (the two are not the same thing, and the latter is likely to lag the former) can't be overstated. They are the key to unlocking value for both investors and Tesla EV owners.

Not only will their success create a long-term stream of highly lucrative recurring revenue for Tesla via ride-per-mile charging, but they will also drive future sales of Tesla's dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab. In addition, the ability to transform a Tesla into a robotaxi using unsupervised FSD will boost the value of Tesla EVs and the adoption rate of FSD.

Tesla investors are patiently waiting for both things to come to fruition while eagerly monitoring the robotaxi rollout as it expands from Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area to Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, as Musk expects by the end of the year.

Elon Musk doubles down

But here's the thing. Tesla is now aggressively adjusting its operations on the assumption that it will succeed with robotaxis and achieve its unsupervised FSD goals. Musk couldn't have been clearer on the recent earnings call, stating that he was ""reticent"" to expand Tesla's production ""until we had clarity on achieving unsupervised full self-driving. But at this point, I feel like we've got clarity, and it makes sense to expand production as fast as we reasonably can.""

However, this isn't just a mission statement; it's a call to arms for production:

According to Musk, ""our intent [is] to expand as quickly as we can our future production.""

Musk also confirmed that the ""single biggest expansion in production will be the Cybercab, which starts production"" in the second quarter of 2026.

CFO Vaibhav Taneja said management is projecting a substantial increase in capital spending in 2026, from an estimated $9 billion in 2025, to prepare the company for growth, including investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and Optimus robots.

Why these plans increase risk

It's fair to assume that Tesla's internal projections for earnings and cash generation in 2026 are based on the same assumptions Musk is making over EV and Cybercab sales; otherwise, what is the point of expanding production ""as fast as we can""? The question then turns to how feasible Tesla's production and sales plans are, not least given the recent expiration of EV tax credits in the U.S.

Much depends on Musk's feeling of ""clarity"" over robotaxis and achieving unsupervised FSD. If these aims aren't achieved, then the ramp-up in production, notably with Cybercabs, coupled with the pre-commitment to increasing capital spending to fuel growth, could compromise the company in 2026.

There's no reward without risk

On the other hand, if Musk is right about robotaxis and unsupervised FSD, then it would be a major mistake not to ramp up production in anticipation of future demand. As such, Tesla's preparatory actions are increasing the potential reward for investors, and its robotaxi rollout and FSD development are also potentially increasing the value of Tesla EVs.

It's possible this thinking is also causing some reticence to deliver lower-cost (say $25,000) vehicles, as robotaxis and unsupervised FSD should increase Tesla EV values anyway.

How to think about Tesla stock

It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming more risk means a less favorable stock proposition. It doesn't; at least it might not, if the potential reward has increased, too. Consequently, the best way to think about the recent events is that Tesla is becoming a higher-risk/higher-reward proposition.

That might not suit all investors, but it's likely to suit investors looking to buy a stock to fill a position at the aggressive end of their portfolio, and the stock will be somewhat derisked if Tesla achieves Musk's aim of eliminating safety drivers in robotaxis in Austin in due course -- something to look out for.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/840164/two-teslas-in-a-line-driving-on-road.png,N,,2025-11-02 22:18:19.846964

These consist largely of captive coal projects in Indonesia, India, Laos, Zimbabwe, and Zambia.
This loophole casts a growing shadow over the progress made in ending China’s overseas coal investments.
To-date, China’s overseas captive coal projects have added an estimated 1.5 billion tonnes of lifetime CO₂, which comes to almost half of all emissions currently in operation.
Policy recommendations CREA and PACS propose the following policy recommendations to expedite the implementation of President Xi’s 2021 pledge to phase-out China-backed overseas coal projects, including but not limited to:","More than four years after President Xi Jinping pledged to end China’s financing of overseas coal projects, the annual assessment from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and the People of Asia for Climate Solutions (PACS) finds that while some progress has been made, the rise of privately owned off-grid captive coal projects for industrial needs, particularly in Indonesia and Africa, is a growing concern.

While many coal plants have been cancelled, others continue to move forward, especially privately funded, off-grid projects for industrial use, revealing that implementation gaps and loopholes persist.

The assessment analyses five categories — cancelled; pre-permitted; permitted; under construction; operational — and adds a new project category that has emerged this year for idle plants that could return to service at any time without entering a formal permitting process: mothballed.

As of July 2025, the total capacity of overseas coal projects in the pipeline has dropped to 31.4 gigawatts (GW), down from nearly 50 GW in 2024. Cancellations have also accelerated, after a slowdown in 2024, with 16.4 GW of new capacity cancelled in 2025. Since the 2021 pledge, a total of 59.3 GW of projects have been cancelled, which is equivalent to 6.1 billion tonnes of avoided lifetime carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions.

Despite these positive trends, operational projects have grown by 4.1 GW in 2025. Most of these projects were under construction in 2024 or about to be commissioned, demonstrating that once a plant enters the construction stage, it is unlikely to be cancelled.

Although the pace of construction has slowed in 2025, 12.1 GW of capacity remains under construction across 14 projects. These consist largely of captive coal projects in Indonesia, India, Laos, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. These are off-grid facilities that serve industrial needs and are owned by private Chinese companies. This loophole casts a growing shadow over the progress made in ending China’s overseas coal investments. See report annex for further details in the field studies.

To-date, China’s overseas captive coal projects have added an estimated 1.5 billion tonnes of lifetime CO₂, which comes to almost half of all emissions currently in operation. The current projects under construction could add a total of around 3.4 billion tonnes of potential lifetime CO₂ emissions upon completion.

The REGO tranche, meanwhile, has been touted as the successor to the Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme, which is currently being phased out by 2030.
The CER says the REGO will provide an “enduring and extended framework” for the certification of renewable electricity in Australia, verifying when, where and how renewable electricity was generated.

The Guarantee of Origin (GO) is designed to verify the use of renewable energy and low emissions products and has been developed by the federal government to be a key plank of its Future Made in Australia program to boost local clean manufacturing.

It will launch under two branches: Renewable Electricity Guarantee of Origin (REGO) and Product Guarantee of Origin (PGO).

Under the PGO side of the scheme, certificates will record the emissions intensity and key attributes of Australian made products like green hydrogen and metals. It also enables access to government incentives like Hydrogen Headstart and the Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive.

The REGO tranche, meanwhile, has been touted as the successor to the Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme, which is currently being phased out by 2030.

The CER says the REGO will provide an “enduring and extended framework” for the certification of renewable electricity in Australia, verifying when, where and how renewable electricity was generated.

Initially, the REGO will be open to eligible renewable electricity generators, including power stations already accredited under the RET scheme, and energy storage systems. It will later expand to include aggregated systems like virtual power plants.

Assistant federal energy and climate minister Josh Wilson says the scheme will give Australian producers the confidence and credibility they need to compete in a global economy that’s rapidly decarbonising.

“The GO Scheme will help Australia to realise the full economic potential of the energy transition by supporting jobs and investment in a Future Made in Australia,” Wilson said on Monday.

“A key tool in the Albanese Government’s energy transition toolbox, GO will catalyse the development of renewable hydrogen to the scale we need to power the growth of new industries and jobs, and to decarbonise critical but hard-to-abate industrial sectors.”

CER Chair David Parker says the establishment of a “robust certification system” for emerging low-emissions products is key to enabling their growth and building trust across the supply chain.

“Transparent, high-integrity digital certificates issued under the GO scheme will enable Australian businesses to differentiate their products as low-emissions or renewable, gaining a competitive edge in both domestic and export markets,” Parker said on Monday.

“For example, low-emissions hydrogen produced through electrolysis can provide effective methods for decarbonising high-emitting operations like ammonia and iron production and it will be important that those products are able to verify their low carbon status.”

For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption.","In recent months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations. These include the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel, a “golden share” in U.S. Steel, and profit sharing on Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales in China. The deals have astonished and unnerved economic analysts across the political spectrum. Commentators from The Wall Street Journal editorial page to MSNBC have decried them as “unprecedented” and amounting to “socialism,” “corporatism,” or “state capitalism with American characteristics.”

In truth, Trump’s actions are rooted in a long history of presidents from both parties taking temporary control or ownership of systemically important companies. However, until now, most of these interventions have been temporary and involved either wartime emergencies or too-big-to-fail corporate collapse. Under Woodrow Wilson, the federal government took temporary ownership of the railroad industry to support troops during World War I. During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration directed much of the corporate industrial sector. In 1980, Jimmy Carter’s administration extended loan guarantees to Chrysler in exchange for stock warrants. After the company recovered and repaid its loans, the government earned $311 million in capital gains. During the financial crisis, Barack Obama’s administration provided the auto industry with tens of billions of dollars in exchange for equity stakes and commitments for substantial restructuring.

Trump’s moves also build on recent industrial policy interventions by his and Joe Biden’s administrations. Until now, those policies stopped short of the government seeking direct influence over corporate governance through golden shares or equity stakes. During his first term, Trump primarily conducted industrial policy through targeted tariffs and trade actions to promote American industry, and by jawboning corporations to boost domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration went further, providing computer chip and clean energy companies with hundreds of billions of dollars—and detailed requirements for how they could be spent—as part of a long-term post-neoliberal industrial strategy for national security. Those actions were consistent with, though a major step beyond, Trump’s first-term trade policies, just as Trump’s second-term corporate dealmaking is an advance on Biden’s (even if neither president would admit it).

So, while Trump’s dealmaking spree is not unprecedented, it ventures into new territory reflecting his strongman tendencies: He has claimed for himself concentrated power to oversee and influence corporate decision-making, authority thus far ceded to him by Congress and the courts. He has operated outside the law through handshake deals that corporations often cannot afford to refuse, endowing the presidency with powerful—and dangerous—economic tools for routine use.

This is unlikely to be a mere Trump-era aberration. Presidents typically don’t forego inherited powers. Today’s novelty policies may become tomorrow’s precedent, as the last decade has shown. Some elements of industrial policy with Trumpist characteristics may become long-term features of American governance. But Congress and the judiciary should assert democratic and constitutional control over American industrial policy now and in the future to prevent its abuse and, potentially, its collapse.

Here’s a rundown of Trump’s corporate dealmaking thus far:

U.S. Steel: In June, the White House greenlit Nippon Steel’s takeover bid for the American steelmaker U.S. Steel. Trump overturned Biden’s blocking of the deal—on the condition that the government receive a “golden share” of the company, allowing it to veto major corporate decisions, such as offshoring jobs and closing plants.

MP Materials: In July, the Department of Defense announced an investment in MP Materials, the country’s only active producer of certain rare earth minerals used for military equipment. The deal provided government support for the company, guaranteeing a minimum price for its products and providing a guaranteed buyer—the federal government—for all its output for the next 10 years. The feds also extended a $150 million loan and purchased $400 million in company stock, making it MP’s largest shareholder.

Japan: Also in July, the White House announced a trade deal with Japan that purportedly included Tokyo creating a $550 billion investment fund for the administration to use toward its industrial policy priorities, including energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, critical mineral supply chains, pharmaceutical production, and shipbuilding. Japan quickly contested the administration’s description of the deal, explaining that the investment fund would be nearly entirely composed of loans the U.S. would need to repay.

Nvidia and AMD: In August, the administration agreed to allow the semiconductor makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell certain modified chips in China, reversing national security restrictions. The companies also agreed to give 15 percent of all profits earned in China to the U.S. government.

Intel: Later that month, the administration took a 10 percent equity stake in the chipmaker Intel. The deal converted billions of dollars in grants the company was due under the CHIPS and Science Act into equity stakes, making the federal government Intel’s largest shareholder. That conversion also, without any legal authority, dispensed with CHIPS Act taxpayer safeguards that required Intel to reach milestones toward completing new domestic manufacturing sites to receive federal funding.

Trump’s economic interventions bear a number of distinctive qualities that expand on industrial policy precedent, but five stand out.

1. Unilateralism: Trump’s industrial policy has been personalist, flowing from and controlled by the president himself. Unlike the Biden administration, which shepherded industrial policy bills through Congress, Trump relies exclusively on executive action. His industrial policy has at times been colored by favoritism and personal relationships. The Nvidia export agreement, for instance, came after meetings between Trump and CEO Jensen Huang. The president himself asked Huang for a share of the company’s Chinese profits. In other cases, bargained-for benefits have been structured to accrue directly under Trump’s control. The Nippon Steel agreement gave control of the golden share not to the office of the president but to Trump himself; only after he leaves office does the share transfer to the secretaries of treasury and commerce. Finally, the (contested) $550 billion pot from Japan would be, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, a fund to be spent however Trump wished—part of “a national security and economic fund managed by Donald Trump.”

2. Public ownership in the absence of a fiscal crisis or national security justification: While direct government ownership of industry is not unheard of in American history, the Trump administration has been uniquely eager to wield it as a routine industrial policy tool. The MP Materials and Intel deals both gave the government equity ownership of private companies, and the U.S. Steel approval netted the government special, powerful veto rights over that company’s decision-making. After announcing the (contested) terms of the Japan trade deal, administration officials even contemplated using the deal’s (disputed) investment fund to build government-owned factories that could then be leased to private companies.

3. Bullying individual companies: Trump has a quid pro quo mentality of wanting a cut of any private gains he feels he has facilitated—he has openly compared his presidential dealmaking to waiving property rights on his real estate for the benefit of a third party, in exchange for a fee. When he agreed to grant Nvidia export licenses to sell modified chips in China, Trump told its chief executive, “If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us something.” Or as Lutnick described the Intel equity stake, “If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.”

4. Leveraging government power: Beyond just flexing the rhetorical might of the presidential bully pulpit, Trump has used the levers of government to offer firms deals they can’t refuse. The administration has created or exploited bargaining power to induce targeted firms to relent to its demands. Under export control regulations, Nvidia and AMD needed the administration’s permission to sell chips in China, forcing them to acquiesce to Trump’s profit-sharing demand. Nippon Steel could not take over U.S. Steel without approval from the government’s foreign investment review committee. Shortly before Intel agreed to the equity deal, Trump ratcheted up the pressure by calling for its executive to be fired and withholding its CHIPS Act grants.

Two other examples illustrate Trump’s leverage power plays. In May, he issued an executive order instructing pharmaceutical companies to agree to adhere to “most-favored-nation price targets … to bring prices for American patients in line with comparably developed nations.” The order threatened that the administration would put the squeeze on pharmaceutical companies that don’t comply, through newly authorized competition from drug imports, restrictions on their own exports, antitrust scrutiny, reconsideration of FDA approvals of their drugs, and loss of National Institutes of Health grants. And in August, the administration announced that it would impose high tariffs on semiconductor imports—but would exempt tech companies that made new domestic investment pledges. The administration thus imposed tariffs to create leverage and offered relief from those tariffs to advance its industrial policy goals.

5. Legally dubious boundary pushing: Much of Trump’s industrial policy has operated in legal gray zones. To bypass routine federal contracting and procurement laws that typically require competitive bidding, the administration’s investment in MP Materials relied on a little-used provision of the Defense Production Act authorizing transactions “without regard to the limitations of existing law.” Trump’s profit-sharing deal with Nvidia and AMD flouts prohibitions on export taxes and fees under both the Constitution and federal law. There is also no firm legal basis under the CHIPS Act to convert Intel’s grants into equity (nor was there to withhold its grants in the first place).

Trump has avoided legal constraints by relying on “regulation by deal,” rather than legislation or agency rulemaking. (He’s also been firing the regulators who would otherwise shape such government interventions.) Companies have acquiesced to White House demands that may not otherwise withstand legal scrutiny to avoid lost business opportunities, the cost and time of litigating against the federal government, and the general ire of the Trump administration. This has insulated much of Trump’s industrial policy from administrative procedure, due process, and judicial review.

Some elements of Trump’s approach are likely to endure. The wraparound support for MP Materials, for example, could well become a model for how the U.S. government cultivates strategically important domestic production. The type of golden share Trump obtained in U.S. Steel could be on the table for future mitigation agreements between the federal government and foreign companies seeking to invest in critical domestic sectors.

As I have written for this magazine, there are also compelling reasons for the government to insist on a direct return on its industrial policy investments. Taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies funded by the CHIPS Act was originally a Bernie Sanders proposal. When used in the right context, equity stakes ensure that industrial policy returns upside revenue to the public, instead of merely socializing profits for corporations.

External trends may also lend Trump’s industrial policy approach greater staying power. As policymakers seek new revenue sources beyond traditional taxation, they may increasingly look to levers like equity stakes, profit-sharing agreements, and royalties. Congress’s tendency toward gridlock and paralysis has long spurred administrations to seek creative executive workarounds, but the courts have increasingly limited the discretion given to the administrative state. That may steer administrations toward regulation-by-deal as a flexible means for the executive branch to regain power from the judiciary.

It’s not hard to imagine where Trumpist industrial policy may be headed. White House advisers have said they will seek equity stakes in other companies receiving federal grants and loans to seed a sovereign wealth fund. Moreover, if Intel cannot right its ship, it may be forced to revisit previous discussions of spinning off its semiconductor factories to a foreign firm like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The Trump administration, which has opposed such a move, could, as Intel’s largest shareholder, dictate the terms of such a deal. (Indeed, the Intel agreement included a poison pill to stymie the sale of its foundries.) Plus, any such sale must win the administration’s approval through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. One could imagine the administration negotiating on economic and national security grounds for government ownership of Intel’s factories, which could then be leased to another chipmaker.

Trump’s industrial policy toolkit may empower future administrations with different priorities. For instance, federal policies—steep tariffs and national security exclusions—are sparing U.S. automakers from a flood of low-cost, cutting-edge Chinese electric vehicles. A future administration could condition that continued industry protection on American carmakers offering more affordable low-emissions vehicles and ramping up their research and development investments.

A future administration could use the specter of the government’s statutory powers to limit or override patents on federally funded technologies to negotiate long-term profit-sharing agreements with artificial intelligence companies. It could also use similar authority to negotiate price reductions from pharmaceutical companies and leverage the Medicare Advantage market to acquire golden shares in health insurance companies, with veto power over major corporate decisions.

A future Democratic administration could grant targeted tariff reductions to countries or companies that decarbonize their energy grids and production processes—and dangle extra reductions to those that use American-made clean energy technology. It could use the Defense Production Act’s preemption power to expedite clean energy and new housing development around other legal impediments. If the industrial policy arc from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration is any guide, the next Democratic president will make fulsome use of these kinds of Trump-inspired tools.

So sheer inertia may well propel Trumpist industrial policy forward. But there are several stark and urgent reasons Congress and the courts should pump the brakes and reconsider major elements of Trump’s approach. For one, this approach may simply yield worse industrial policy. Absent exceeding care and deliberation, go-it-alone executive branch industrial policy can overreach and implode without the safeguards and democratic legitimacy of operating through Congress. Even if Trump’s deals successfully evade the courts, a subsequent administration could deem some contrary to law and declare them null and void—regulation by deal has far less long-term durability than regulation by regulation, let alone legislation. Such whipsawing will make the U.S. government a less reliable, more tumultuous economic actor.

For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption. Pay-to-play regimes for exporting sensitive technologies to foreign adversaries jeopardize fair competition and national security. Personalist policymaking is a recipe for cronyism, corruption, and favoritism for well-connected dominant firms. As The New York Times reported, Trump’s family was directly benefiting from billions of dollars of investment in its crypto company by the United Arab Emirates—at the same time it agreed to provide the UAE with highly sensitive and valuable advanced semiconductor chips.

It is all too easy to foresee more future gambits redounding to the private benefit of the Trump family (like the Paramount merger with Skydance, which routed $16 million into the Trump presidential library). Moreover, while leverage can be useful for achieving policy aims, marshaling the vast regulatory state as one big pressure cooker to coerce concessions from targeted companies risks undermining other vital policy interests. We’re already seeing that regarding antitrust. Companies seeking merger approvals have won favorable treatment from the Trump administration by making side promises for domestic manufacturing investments. The potential for Trumpist misuse of industrial policy risks poisoning the whole enterprise.

That’s where Congress and the courts come in—or where they should. Congress was a true coequal branch during the Biden administration’s major industrial policy programs, shaping and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act through normal legislative processes. It could again instill democratic prerogatives and guardrails for industrial policy. Congress could determine when the government should take equity stakes in private companies. It could set ground rules around taking golden shares, like which corporate decisions may be subject to a government veto and which are off-limits. It could set standards around appropriate uses of revenue-sharing deals with the federal government. It could stipulate where the revenue generated from industry policy investments should go and how it should be spent. It could set rules preventing the government from unduly favoring companies where it has taken equity stakes in competitor firms. It could establish safeguards to ensure that industrial policy is not used to enrich public officials. Meanwhile, the courts may need to revisit legal doctrines like standing to ensure that some party can contest deals of questionable legality, like the Nvidia revenue-sharing agreement or the Intel equity swap.

If Congress fails to act, it could be understood as blessing Trump’s mode of industrial policy by one-man dealmaking. That doesn’t just invite corruption, but is also a recipe for managerial disaster. The Obama administration’s masterful overhaul of Detroit is arguably less remembered today than the failure of Solyndra. After receiving an Energy Department loan, the solar panel firm’s bankruptcy led to a series of high-profile investigations that ultimately uncovered no criminal wrongdoing or corruption but soured the public on Obama’s nascent clean energy industrial strategy.

With Trump’s state capitalism, the hands-off market fundamentalism era is over. The question is whether the government’s new terms of engagement with industry will be dominated by the president or deliberated on by Congress and the courts. Acquiescence by the other branches to Trump’s deals, warts and all, risks heralding the unchecked and unbalanced industrial policy of the unitary executive. Activation by them, however, could lead to a whole-of-government effort to sand away the roughest edges of Trump’s approach to craft an industrial policy that is both powerful and responsible to effectively guide the country forward.",https://washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nov-25-IndustrialPolicy-Dodge.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:14.017369

The IRA didn’t just spur investment in battery manufacturing; it helped create over 133,000 decent blue-collar jobs in battery production in just two years.
The nascent American battery industry hasn’t had enough time to relocate its supply chain.","In July, Donald Trump’s administration announced a staggering 93.5 percent tariff on Chinese graphite—a material essential to battery production. China not only dominates graphite mining but also controls 96 percent of the global supply of processed anode-grade graphite, a key component of lithium ion batteries. The move sent shockwaves through the already fragile battery supply chain and all but guarantees higher costs for U.S. manufacturers. It’s only the latest in a string of irrational policies that make it harder, not easier, to bring manufacturing back home.

This summer, congressional Republicans passed the president’s massively unpopular budget bill, rolling back Joe Biden’s signature clean energy legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While much of the attention on the bill’s energy components has focused on the damage to the wind and solar industries, the legislation will also upend the booming battery business, gutting one of the economy’s fastest-growing and strategically vital industries. While the Biden administration made substantial progress in building a domestic battery supply chain, Trump is kneecapping battery manufacturing in the U.S. by crushing demand and hiking up input costs.

The contradictions in Trump’s “America First” strategy are hard to miss: The White House pushes policies to streamline critical minerals production while dismantling the industries that need such minerals; it taxes essential imports without supporting adequate domestic replacements; and it proclaims its mission to bring back American manufacturing jobs while enacting policies that shut down factories.

America’s clean energy transition cannot be stopped, but it can be slowed. Trump and the Republicans have decided to do just that—even if it means fewer jobs, higher prices, and more energy dependence.

The industrial policies passed under Biden ushered in a resurgence in American manufacturing by employing carrots (tax credits) and sticks (tariffs and domestic content requirements). The IRA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the CHIPS Act jump-started a clean energy boom, using targeted public investment to catalyze trillions in private capital.

The Biden administration strategically designed an industrial policy for batteries. Tax credits “derisked” investment and improved the cost-competitiveness of domestic battery manufacturing, while Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions penalized companies that continued to rely on imported battery components. Those restrictions were set to tighten gradually, giving American firms more time to build out a domestic supply chain.

It worked. According to the Clean Investment Monitor, Biden’s green industrial strategy tripled quarterly investment in clean manufacturing from 2022 to 2025. Since the IRA was passed, more than 380 clean tech factories have been announced, with 161 already operational. Of the $115 billion in manufacturing investment the IRA attracted, batteries led the way, accounting for 69 percent. In a short time, the Biden incentives made U.S. battery production cost-competitive with China—which dominates over three-quarters of the global battery supply chain—and put the nation on track to meet all of domestic battery demand with a Made in America battery manufacturing industry by 2030.

But then the Republican Party returned to power.

Trump’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed in July, guts the tax credits that help American manufacturing catch up to China, while his administration continues to impose tariffs in a blunderbuss manner. The main outcome of this so-called economic “strategy” will be higher inflation and persistent shortages of foreign goods and commodities. And the effects of Trump’s tariffs are only beginning to reach consumers.

Since Trump’s inauguration, more than $27 billion of investment in clean energy manufacturing has been canceled, bankrupted, delayed, or scaled back, taking nearly 19,000 jobs. More EV manufacturing facilities, including battery plants, were canceled in the first three months of 2025 than in all 2023 and 2024 combined.

The elimination of the EV tax credit and the EPA’s move to rescind Biden-era tailpipe emissions regulations deals a blow to EV adoption, but it will cripple America’s battery manufacturing. A report by Princeton’s ZERO Lab estimates that not only could these repeals result in the cancellation of an eyepopping 100 percent of planned battery facilities, but they also potentially threaten to shut down up to 72 percent of battery manufacturing plants. Withdraw market incentives, and the market dries up. EV sales could also fall 30 percent by 2027 and 40 percent by 2030. That translates to 8.3 million fewer EVs, and 8.3 million fewer batteries needed to power them.

The IRA didn’t just spur investment in battery manufacturing; it helped create over 133,000 decent blue-collar jobs in battery production in just two years. Within the first five months of Trump’s presidency, more than 6,000 of those jobs were wiped out.

With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, the nonpartisan energy policy think tank Energy Innovation projects that 31,000 battery jobs will evaporate by 2030. But the more profound tragedy is the number of American jobs—approaching 1 million—in manufacturing, supporting industries, and local economies that will now never materialize.

These aren’t workforce reductions for a dying industry. They are layoffs in the sectors of tomorrow—cuts to a technology that makes a more resilient, affordable energy system for America possible.

Trump and the GOP are doubling down on fossil fuels as the economics of renewables—even paired with the costs of battery storage—make that strategy irrational. Batteries absorb electricity during the day while prices are low and discharge it during peak demand hours, improving grid reliability and cutting energy costs for consumers.

Look at Texas, the country’s largest deregulated electricity market, where battery storage is booming to take advantage of dirt-cheap solar power. The growth of solar and batteries there has significantly reduced the risk of grid emergencies for which the Lone Star State had become infamous. Solar provides power during the hottest hours of the day, while batteries store the excess and release it as the sun sets. In California, where battery capacity has exploded 30-fold since 2018, record discharges of battery power during last year’s extreme heat meant that the state didn’t need to issue a single energy conservation alert.

Ironically, battery storage provides precisely the type of dispatchable energy that Trump administration officials claim they want. A recent report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a nonprofit regulatory authority that sets and enforces grid reliability standards, found that battery expansion improved overall grid reliability even as the rapid uptake of data centers increases strain on the system.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has pulled support for long-duration battery storage projects and cut funding for scientific research into advanced battery technologies. As one former senior Department of Energy official told The Guardian, “If you stop any research for next generation solar or battery technology, or wind or geothermal or other pieces, what you’re effectively doing is compromising a huge range of technology that has the potential to reduce costs.”

For all its talk about American energy dominance and lower prices, raising energy costs is exactly what the Trump administration’s policies are accomplishing. Since January, thanks to Trump’s tariffs, short-term battery storage costs have risen 56 percent to 69 percent. Unsurprisingly, deployment of battery storage on the grid is expected to fall 30 percent over the next decade. The Trump administration likes to harp constantly about supporting “affordable, reliable, and secure energy”—they forget to add “as long as it suits my party’s ideological priors.”

This comes as Trump and the GOP rail against U.S. dependence on Chinese batteries and the need to reshore American manufacturing, after passing a bill that decimates the domestic battery industry.

While the final version of the GOP mega bill technically retains the advanced manufacturing tax credit for battery producers, new FEOC rules (read: China) impose unworkable domestic content requirements that make the credits inaccessible. Both complex and overly restrictive, the FEOC provisions will require regulatory guidance from the Treasury Department—a process that took two years under Biden. Until then, it’s unlikely that companies will invest without knowing whether they’ll qualify for the credits.

Meanwhile, the GOP is aggressively deregulating extractive industries. While boosting critical mineral production can support the buildout of a domestic supply chain, it makes little sense to simultaneously undercut the high-value-add industries like battery manufacturing that create the very demand for those minerals.

Yet Trump is doing just that. He has leaned on the Cold War–era Defense Production Act to boost investment in critical mineral production. The Department of the Interior is streamlining permitting processes for lithium mines. Trump strong-armed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky into granting the U.S. sweeping economic privileges over Ukraine’s mineral resources. However, these resources are critical because they serve the transition to clean energy. Why produce more lithium if not to make more batteries?

Trump announced a 50 percent tariff in July on copper imports, citing the critical need for the conductive metal in everything from semiconductors to ships to batteries. But the U.S. imports 40 percent of its copper, and there’s no alternative path to achieve copper self-sufficiency in the near or long term. Whereas a new battery plant can come online within two years, a new mine can take over 20 years to open up production. In the U.S., the average development time to open a new copper mine takes up to 32 years. Investors can hardly expect American trade policy to remain stable for 30 days, let alone during the remaining three-plus years of Trump’s term in office. Ultimately, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have been pursuing policies to expand domestic mining, refining, and processing of critical minerals—arguably worthy goals, but not if you’re simultaneously destroying the manufacturing of products derived from such resources. They are ceding the lead in clean tech to China so the U.S. can become a raw materials exporter like so many Third World nations trapped in the cycle of extraction without development.

Justin Wolfers, the University of Michigan economist, accurately sums up Trump’s “plan” to restore U.S. manufacturing: “Raise the price of inputs like steel, aluminum & copper; create shortages of rare earths; invite retaliatory tariffs; cut R&D; raise borrowing costs by blowing out the budget; and … cover it all in a thick cloud of uncertainty.”

The 50 percent tariff on imported steel has doubled the price of domestic steel, yet many companies still import because even inflated foreign steel is cheaper. The nascent American battery industry hasn’t had enough time to relocate its supply chain. China still dominates the global market for key battery components, which U.S. companies must depend on until suitable (and competitive) domestic alternatives emerge. Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff wars don’t guide investment—they paralyze it.

Trump returned to office partly under the dubious promise to “Make America Great Again” by reviving domestic manufacturing and restoring high-wage blue-collar jobs. Now he and the GOP aren’t just breaking that promise, they’re spitting in the face of the Americans who believed them.",https://washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nov-25-Battery-Hassett.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:18.284647

Liberty Energy Investment Narrative Recap

For Liberty Energy, the core investment thesis rests on the company's ability to deliver innovative oilfield services and power solutions amid shifting demand for onshore oil and natural gas. The recent dual listing on NYSE Texas could elevate Liberty's profile and improve share liquidity, but it does not materially alter the most pressing short-term catalyst, customer completions activity, or mitigate the risk of margin pressure from declining rig counts and lower service pricing into late 2025.

One of the most relevant recent announcements is Liberty's modest dividend increase to US$0.09 per share, declared alongside softer third-quarter earnings. This comes as the company braces for challenging market conditions, underlining its intent to reward shareholders even as visibility into near-term profit growth remains limited.

However, despite higher trading access, investors should be aware that increased exposure to market fluctuations could amplify the impact of ongoing pricing headwinds and...

Liberty Energy's outlook projects $4.3 billion in revenue and $41.3 million in earnings by 2028. This assumes a 1.8% annual revenue growth rate and a decrease in earnings of $175.5 million from the current $216.8 million.

Long Beach received notice from the Washington State Department of Commerce on Oct. 8 that its application to install solar panels at the city’s fire station at 701 Washington Ave. N, was selected to receive $316,185 in grant funding. The city is required to cover 5% in matching funds for the project; around $16,000.

The funding comes through the department’s Clean Energy Grants program, which prioritizes construction-ready projects aimed at increasing access to reliable and affordable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aligning with state energy strategies. More than $41 million was initially awarded to 49 projects across the state, the majority of which were solar-related.

The city’s application was not originally selected to receive funding, according to Long Beach Deputy City Administrator Ariel Smith, but was ultimately awarded after further funding became available through the grant program. The contract was formally signed in late October, allowing the city to start incurring costs.

The installation of solar panels at the fire station will reduce electricity costs and make the building more energy-efficient, said Smith and David Glasson, the city’s administrator. While noting that he’s still reading up on the final agreement with the PUD, Glasson said the intention is for the fire station to be “net metered” — meaning the city will receive billing credit for the power the solar panels generate, with any usage that the exceeds what the solar panels generate being billed on the “net.”

“We will generate a surplus during most days and have to use power at night or during inclement weather,” said Glasson, adding that the fire station’s electricity bill ranges from a low of about $250 during the summer months to a high of more than $1,000 in the colder months.

In all, Glasson estimates that the city has paid about $9,000 annually for power at the fire station over the past three years.

Long Beach was also looking at installing solar panels at its wastewater plant during the same funding cycle for Commerce’s clean energy grant program, Glasson said, “but the application wasn’t going to score well, so we decided the fire station was the better option.” With the grant program only requiring a local match of 5%, he added that the city would like to add solar panels at both the water and wastewater plants because of how much power they require to operate.",https://chinookobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/Chinook-Observer.png,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:22.017803

Banpu Power Plc, the power generation arm of Banpu, announced earlier it is preparing to venture into the BESS business in the US.
The company is also expanding its renewable energy portfolio by investing in solar and wind power businesses to benefit from decreasing renewable energy costs.","This year marks the first for energy conglomerate Banpu Plc's ""symphony"" of businesses seeking to accelerate the company's transition to clean energy.

Under its six-year ""Energy Symphonics"" strategy from 2025 to 2030 the company intends to deal with key energy challenges to achieve business sustainability.

Energy Symphonics refers to a synchronised approach to creating new and sustainable energy solutions to address the world's surging energy demand, while also looking after the planet, according to chief executive Sinon Vongkusolkit, who unveiled this strategy late last year.

""We are passionate about tackling the energy trilemma head-on,"" he said, referring to Banpu's ongoing efforts to balance energy security, equity and sustainability.

This strategy replaced the ""Greener and Smarter"" strategy implemented during the previous five years, paving the way for more serious efforts to combat climate change.

Banpu has pledged to achieve a net-zero target, meaning a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and absorption, by 2050, 15 years ahead of the government's goal of 2065.

PURSUING SUSTAINABILITY

The company continues to adjust its businesses to be less dependent on fossil fuels and focus more on new sources of energy.

Banpu wants to be part of global efforts to ensure energy needs are met and, through improved environmental protection, maintain the ability of future generations to meet theirs, said Mr Sinon.

Over the next two years, the company plans to seriously reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions from its businesses, said Jirameth Achcha, head of Banpu's corporate services and activities.

The company mines coal and produces natural gas, as well as operates power generation facilities using fossil fuels and renewable energy. Banpu also offers smart energy solutions, focusing on new energy technologies that support the transition towards clean energy.

""The company is trying to avoid injecting a large portion of money into businesses that emit a high level of greenhouse gases,"" said Mr Jirameth.

Banpu plans to reduce investments in coal businesses, with the aim of cutting the share of coal earnings to less than half of total revenue in a shift towards sustainable energy development, he said.

Revenue from the coal trade, which comprised 65% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation last year, should be reduced to less than 50% by 2030, according to Mr Sinon.

The company operates coal businesses in Australia, China and Indonesia.

Banpu is making its coal mines more environmentally friendly by replacing oil-powered vehicles used at its mines with electric vehicles (EVs), said Mr Jirameth. The company is also less reliant on coal by using more biomass fuel at its power plants, he said.

A shift towards other natural resources supports Banpu's campaign to promote clean energy. For example, the company is pursuing a new opportunity related to nickel mining in Indonesia.

Nickel is a key component in batteries used to power EVs, helping to reduce tailpipe emissions from oil powered-vehicles. The element can also be recovered from old batteries for reuse.

PT Indo Tambangraya Megah Tbk, a subsidiary of Banpu, invested in the nickel mining business by acquiring in July this year a 9.62% stake in PT Adhi Kartiko Pratama Tbk (AKP), which is listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

AKP operates a nickel mine in North Konawe in Southeast Sulawesi province.

This investment in nickel mining accounts for 20% of the company's five-year investment budget of US$3 billion, said Mr Sinon.

The spending plan is scheduled to be implemented from 2025 to 2030 under the Energy Symphonics strategy.

Some 60% of the budget is to support natural gas and power businesses, while the remaining 20% funds the company's renewable energy business.

ENERGY RELIABILITY

Banpu is addressing concerns over unsteady electricity supply from renewable energy sources by adopting battery energy storage systems (BESS).

This stationary form of battery serves as back-up power for users to ensure electricity from renewable power generation facilities is always available for use.

The sun and wind are intermittent sources of energy generation making them dependent on weather conditions and seasons. These renewable energies cannot produce electricity all the time, so a BESS can ensure a more reliable supply.

A BESS can be developed by using a battery farm, ensuring a stable supply of clean energy.

Banpu Power Plc, the power generation arm of Banpu, announced earlier it is preparing to venture into the BESS business in the US.

The company already pursued a similar opportunity in Japan, where it developed a battery farm.

Banpu Power proposed the second BESS project to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees and manages the electrical grid in most of the southern US state, said Issara Niropas, chief executive of Banpu Power.

He stressed the need to catch the growing trend in utilising BESS as demand for renewable power is rapidly growing.

Electricity demand in the US is rising, driven by the development of data centres and greater use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, according to the company.

In Japan, Banpu Next, Banpu's energy technology arm, operates a 58-megawatt-hour BESS farm in the city of Tono. The facility is designed to supply electricity to 5,800 houses.

The company plans to expand its BESS business to other Asia-Pacific nations, said Mr Issara.

GREATER AFFORDABILITY

To make energy prices more affordable, Banpu devised various approaches to control its expenses, diversify energy sources and adopt technologies to enhance productivity.

Despite the challenges of a volatile energy market, Banpu is confident its Energy Symphonics strategy will drive growth and create long-term value for shareholders, said Mr Sinon.

Regarding mining, the company plans to adopt AI and smart mining technology to reduce operating costs and enhance productivity, he said.

According to Banpu, the company does not depend on a single energy source to avoid price volatility.

The company's businesses use both traditional and cleaner forms of energy.

In the US, Banpu is focusing on gas production as an alternative to coal and because it allows the company to better manage costs from the source, said Mr Sinon.

The company is also expanding its renewable energy portfolio by investing in solar and wind power businesses to benefit from decreasing renewable energy costs.

The investments should help the company reduce the total cost of energy generation in the long term, he said.

Banpu also utilises high efficiency, low emissions (HELE) technology to reduce power generation costs.

The technology is applied to its Temple I combined-cycle power plant with electricity generation capacity of 768 megawatts.

HELE increases the facility's thermal efficiency through the use of both a gas turbine and steam turbine, allowing the plant to produce more electricity from the same fuel input, thus reducing fuel costs per megawatt-hour.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/11/03/5835318_700.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 18:18:18.333466

The lobby group said the change could add as much as £300 to the annual charging bill for some people if the cost is passed on to the customer.
Business rates are taxes paid on most commercial properties in the UK to fund local services, but charging bays have not yet been added to lists of rateable properties.
That might mean that the first bill for the current financial year could be more than double the £100m.
The Conservative government in 2022 exempted charging equipment from business rates, but the parking bays themselves were not included.","The UK charging industry has said it could face a £100m bill as the government considers making public charger operators pay business rates for the first time, at a time when slower-than-expected electric car sales have put pressure on the sector.

ChargeUK, an industry body, said that its estimates suggest that operators will have to pay business rates on as many as 64,000 parking bays beside chargers which have not, up to now, been liable for the taxes. The lobby group said the change could add as much as £300 to the annual charging bill for some people if the cost is passed on to the customer.

The number of public chargers has soared during recent years to cater for more than 1m battery electric cars on British roads. There were 86,000 public chargers at the end of September, an 18% increase on the 73,000 at the end of 2024, according to data company Zap Map.

Business rates are taxes paid on most commercial properties in the UK to fund local services, but charging bays have not yet been added to lists of rateable properties. The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) has told the charging industry this will change next April – meaning charging companies will have to pay the taxes for the first time.

Ian Johnston, the chief executive of Osprey Charging, said that his business would consider closing some sites and slowing down investment because of the extra costs – particularly away from London, which has the highest number of electric cars.

“Large, high-power hubs in certain regions of the Midlands and north [of England] are more likely to be loss-making because we have built ahead of EV uptake,” he added.

ChargeUK said it believed that the VOA’s own assumptions of a £25m cost for the sector were too small, because it had underestimated how many bays would be rateable, and the average rents paid.

To make matters worse for the charger companies, the bill may be backdated as far as 1 April 2023 as the VOA works out the final details of its review. That might mean that the first bill for the current financial year could be more than double the £100m.

The Conservative government in 2022 exempted charging equipment from business rates, but the parking bays themselves were not included. The VOA said that individual bays in larger charging sites and standalone EV charging sites would probably be added to ratings lists, because the operator tends to have exclusive occupation of the spaces.

ChargeUK argued that the bays should also be exempted, given the government’s desire to promote the uptake of electric vehicles to meet its legal obligations to cut polluting carbon emissions. The Treasury would have to exempt the sector in the budget on 26 November.

Vicky Read, the ChargeUK chief executive, said: “The cost pressures the sector is bearing are tough, with business rates threatening to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. We need government intervention to remove this unexpected burden, alongside action to address sky high standing charges [on electricity] and inequitable VAT.”

A VOA spokesperson said it would engage with the charging companies, and added: “We have a statutory duty to maintain non-domestic rating lists. If any property meets criteria in line with legislation and rating law, we must assess it and assign it a rateable value.”

The Treasury was approached for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5fb3040d17a8fb58e70942562025b76af0fb878/833_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0aad082998a2a8d81759a18967c65998",N,,2025-11-02 18:18:36.706668

Greenwashing can occur (or be alleged) at various points along the supply chain—from claims about sourcing practices, to emissions impacts from product transportation, and to the composition of a final product. Some forms of greenwashing allegations, such as those from plaintiff classes and environmental groups, have become commonplace. Two recent sets of allegations are, well, green: utilizing greenwashing claims to obtain competitive and political benefits. Companies should stay aware of old and new greenwashing trends and take practical actions to guard against such claims.

Green Guides

The “Green Guides,” found at 16 C.F.R. § 260, serve as the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) “current views about environmental claims.” Included in the Green Guides are several examples of what the FTC deems impermissible greenwashing related to general environmental claims, as well as specific claims such as carbon offsets, certifications, “free-of” claims, non-toxic claims, recyclability, and claims related to renewable energy and materials. Notwithstanding these examples, to date the FTC has avoided specifically opining on claims related to the life cycle of a product—the product’s “environmental impact through all the stages of its life.” The FTC only suggests marketers “may need to consider the significant environmental impacts of a product or service through its lifetime.” While the Green Guides themselves are mere “administrative interpretations of law,” many states have referenced or incorporated at least portions of the Green Guides into their respective consumer protection and advertising statutes.

Greenwashing claims as a business and political tool

Take a manufacturer of cleaning products for example, who reached a settlement with a plaintiff class alleging their products were “falsely and misleadingly” labeled as “Non-Toxic” and “Earth Friendly.” As part of the settlement, the defendant agreed to remove the “Non-Toxic” labels and add an asterisk to the “Earth Friendly” label to further qualify the claims.

These greenwashing claims follow common molds: a plaintiff class alleging deceptive environmental marketing led them to purchase a product they otherwise would not have, and an environmental group alleging a company is failing to live up to its products’ environmental claims.

But the universe of greenwashing claims may be expanding.

For starters, a manufacturer of hearing protection products filed a greenwashing suit against a competitor claiming it “intentionally misled and deceived distributors, downstream purchasing companies and end users” through “unqualified” claims about their earplugs such as that they are “eco-friendly,” “sustainable,” “bio-based,” and part of an “eco-series.” As part of its complaint, the plaintiff claims it independently tested the earplugs for “bio-based content” and found that at most, the earplugs were 40% bio-based, significantly less than the claimed 82% bio-based content. The plaintiff is seeking an injunction against the allegedly unlawful conduct, as well as an order directing the defendant to issue “corrective advertising” to address “consumer deception.”

Second, the attorney general of Montana and 15 other Republican attorneys general delivered a letter to several technology companies seeking information related to the companies’ “claim[s] they are 100% powered by renewable energy” based upon the use of renewable energy certificates. According to the letter, the companies claiming to commit to 100% renewable power places pressure on utilities “to move away from fossil-fuel-generated baseload power” to attract those companies as customers. This pressure has allegedly led to early retirements of coal and natural gas power plants, which in turn, threatens grid reliability. (While unstated, these retirements may also reduce demand for coal from Montana’s Powder River Basin.)

Rather than seeking to recover damages for purchases of a greenwashed product, or align a defendant’s environmental practices with its claims as is typical with greenwashing suits, the plaintiff is instead alleging the defendant is using “a calculated ‘greenwashing’ scheme to capture market share from competitors,” and the attorney generals’ greenwashing claims appear designed to serve as leverage to incentivize large technology companies to back away from all-renewable targets and to maintain demand for fossil fuels to support regional energy industries. Together they represent a new front in the use of greenwashing for business and political objectives.

Protecting against greenwashing claims

With these new developments in the greenwashing arena, it may seem as though greenwashing claims can come from many angles. While it is not possible to guarantee that one’s company will never find itself facing greenwashing claims, there are practical steps that can be taken to minimize the risk of liability.

· Familiarize yourself with the Green Guides. While the FTC’s materials are not binding and would not serve as the basis for a cause of action in and of itself, many states expressly or implicitly follow the Green Guides as part of their consumer protection schemes. Moreover, courts will give varying degrees of persuasive weight to the Green Guides.

· Familiarize yourself with the state laws and common laws in areas where your products are sold. From coast-to-coast and internationally, each jurisdiction will have different variations of consumer protection and false advertising laws. Companies should be aware of these differences and consider whether it makes strategic sense to ensure compliance with the most stringent applicable laws, regardless of jurisdiction.",https://img.sdcexec.com/mindful/acbm/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/10/francesco-scatena-adobestock-781192496.LIjzXwzoyo.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-11-02 17:18:16.424481

“It’s deeply unsettling to have a neighbor that’s disrespectful and intimidating,” said Williams, Michigan City resident and executive director of Just Transition Northwest Indiana. “It’s not at all right. We already have a history of dealing with environmental issues across the city and a legacy of injustice, and this just exacerbates it.”

Just Transition Northwest Indiana has launched its “30 Days of Accountability” campaign, which encourages Michigan City residents to come together and express concerns about the data center.

According to JTNWI’s website, residents interested in assisting the campaign can be a community observer and document what they see at the site, volunteer with the organization and support efforts through outreach, research or public speaking.

“We deserve better, and we know we deserve better,” Williams said. “We’re calling for them to do this. We’re asking for folks to join us, from academics, business owners, anyone and everyone to join us.”

In September, the Michigan City Council passed four resolutions that would allow the construction of a data center at 402 Royal Road, which is currently owned by Phoenix Investors, according to Post-Tribune archives. A representative for Phoenix Investors was unable to immediately respond to a request for comment.

Resolutions provided multiple tax abatements, designated the area as an economic revitalization area and approved a taxpayer agreement for “Project Maize,” also known as the data center location. The data center operator has yet to be announced, but Williams and other JTNWI members believe the end user will be Google.

“We call on the Michigan City Common Council to demand an immediate halt to construction, full site remediation, and a comprehensive impact assessment at 402 Royal Road, and to revoke the tax abatements and hold Phoenix Investors accountable for exposing residents and our youngest generations to these hazards, so we can start to make things right,” Williams said.

Residents, including Williams, spoke during public comment at multiple council meetings regarding the data center, voicing environmental, public health and financial concerns.

A previous Phoenix Investors presentation said Michigan City is an ideal location for a data center because reusing an empty facility allows for a sustainable approach, its proximity to a NIPSCO substation, the available capacity for water supply and sanitary discharge, a low latency for users, it’s disaster-safe, and it has site-specific designs and a skilled workforce.

The presentation also said the final economic impact for the city would be $26.1 million, and the city would feel about $6.6 million in the first 90 days. Chris Johnson, Michigan City Water Works Director, previously said the city has “more than enough” capacity left to supply water for a data center. Rick Calinski, director of economic development and public affairs for NIPSCO, said the utility will not raise customers’ electric rates to power the data center.

Councilwoman Nancy Moldenhauer, D-6th, consistently voted against the resolutions out of concern for residents in the sixth ward, which is where the data center will be located.

“I am concerned about pollution at brownfield sites like the Royal Road property and how it is handled, yet Michigan City is coordinating with (the Indiana Department of Environmental Management) and the develop to (ensure) Phoenix sets up a full information website of all permits, citations and responses for everyone to examine ongoingly,” Moldenauer said in an email to the Post-Tribune.

Moldenhauer told the Post-Tribune that she doesn’t believe data centers belong in urban areas, but because the area is zoned as light industry, there wasn’t much the city could do to prevent a data center.

In her email, Moldenhauer said the city has made several accomplishments to address data center concerns, such as an ordinance that sets the maximum sound level at 60 decibels instead of 65, which was originally proposed by the developer. The Michigan City Sustainability Commission also passed a resolution that requires “all Michigan City outdoor light fixtures be fully shielded with no light escaping above the horizon and that they be 3,000K or lower,” Moldenhauer said, adding that the developer also agreed to install sound level monitors by the roadside.

Williams said JTNWI’s campaign launched after IDEM, on Oct. 9, cited Phoenix Investors with a violation letter at the data center site. The violation letter followed a Sept. 24 inspection that found violations in the uncontaminated soil policy, Williams said.

According to the violation, IDEM found trichloroethylene, or TCE, which the National Cancer Institute defines as a “volatile, colorless liquid organic chemical” that can be found in air, water and soil. Williams said TCE has been linked to cancer, kidney disease, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cardiac defects.

“They were transporting contaminated dirt and soil through our communities and past schools, where children, businesses and families all have potentially been exposed,” Williams said. “We felt very validated to see those violations handed down because it validates what our community has been saying all along.”

Eileen Mark, another Michigan City resident, is involved with JTNWI’s accountability campaign. Mark’s concerns not only lie with the environmental and public health effects, but also with workers’ safety. According to a police report, a worker at the facility fell through the roof on Oct. 9.

Mark owns an Airbnb in Michigan City, and she’s worried that the data center might impact her business, she said.

“It could deter people from coming if the air smells like gas, or if there’s other issues,” Mark said. “Fortunately, I’m not very close to (the data center site), but I care about my neighbors and the ones who are close. It’s terrible that they’re going to have to live with this.”

Dominic Yanke, a Michigan City resident and member of JTNWI, lives about three-quarters of a mile away from the proposed data center site, he said.

Yanke has spoken about his concerns with the data center at Michigan City council meetings, detailing issues with dust that makes it difficult to drive down Royal Road and communicating with workers at the site about residents’ worries.

“I’m concerned about the air quality for the most part,” Yanke said. “I have asthma, and there’s already days where the ozone’s too bad or other pollutants in the air are so high that I can’t even go outside. Or if I am outside, I start having trouble breathing.”

Residents have been told that the data center will run backup generators once a month, Yanke said, which he said is “too much to have diesel fumes everywhere.” Although the noise at the data center will be lower than first expected, Yanke said it will “still be annoying” for those who live nearby.

Yanke’s role in the accountability campaign includes taking photos of violations and environmental and public health concerns. He believes documenting issues will help residents build a better case against the data center.

Through the accountability campaign, Mark said she plans to help with canvassing and encouraging people to watch More Perfect Union’s videos that show the negative effects of data centers.

“It talks about Indiana being a target state for these data centers,” Mark said. “Since then, we’re seeing a lot of positive things happening in the way of shutting these down and sending them away. Where they’re going to go, we don’t know, but we have to fight for our own communities.”

Mark would like to see more of a response from elected officials, including those in Michigan City and throughout the state of Indiana.

“The opposition is going to continue growing,” Mark said. “When this thing’s up and running, and people can’t sleep because of the noise and light pollution, and the kids are on the playground breathing in diesel particles, and people start to get sick, people are really going to have opposition.”

In a July 14 statement, Michigan City Mayor Angie Nelson Deuitch said city government officials were made aware of a potential data center development. Nelson Deuitch’s administration and council members entered into non-disclosure agreements to review the concept in a confidential executive session.

The $800 million capital investment would come with “limited job creation and no assurances of community reinvestment or substantial tax impact,” Nelson Deuitch’s statement said.

No formal agreement was reached at the time, the statement said, and it did not present binding commitments to ensure lasting benefits to Michigan City residents.

“Michigan City welcomes innovation and responsible investment, but our administration will always advocate for economic growth that is equitable, transparent and in the public interest,” Nelson Deuitch said in her statement.

As the data center construction continues, Williams said it’s important for JTNWI members and Michigan City residents to stay vigilant and hold developers accountable. She wants more community members to see how big technology affects their lives.

Williams would also like for JTNWI to be a resource for other communities that later have a data center.

“A community doesn’t have to accept a data center, and they don’t have to be taken advantage of,” Williams said. “There’s other opportunities for the future of municipalities, so it’s important to stay vigilant and continue to provide all these platforms for people to take action.”

That's according to Politico's E&E News, which reported that growing data center power demand caused ratepayer utility bills to jump $4.3 billion last year.

It's a scenario that showcases the importance of cleaner solar energy, noted by Reuters to be one of the cheapest and fastest power sources to develop. When deployed on rooftops, it gives homeowners control over their electricity supply.

What is driving the electricity demand?

E&E's story spotlighted PJM Interconnection, the outfit that coordinates electricity movement in a roughly square-shaped territory from western-most Ohio to the East Coast, and from the Pennsylvania/New York border to southern Virginia. Washington, DC, and Northern Virginia's ""Data Center Alley"" are included, according to PJM.

The story said that massive energy needs are mostly attributed to data centers, where powerful computers are fulfilling our search inquiries and artificial intelligence work orders, per the report.

""By 2028, an average family in the region will be paying around $70 a month extra on their electricity bills because of forecasted data center growth,"" the Natural Resources Defense Council estimated.

Leasing solar panels through Palmetto's LightReach can protect homeowners from spiking monthly power bills. The program bypasses upfront costs associated with buying an array. Homeowners pay a set monthly fee and use all of the electricity generated, helping to offset price hikes. Palmetto is responsible for setup, installation, and eventual panel removal.

Why is the demand important?

Runaway computer power use is well-documented. Goldman Sachs said that data center-related energy requirements are forecast to rise 165% by 2030. As a result, NPR reported that electricity rate spikes are outpacing inflation.

E&E's story noted that leaders consider AI development an international race that the United States needs to win, incentivizing even more computing. In response, tech giants are in some cases building their own power plants using dirty fuels to power the operations, according to the Texas Tribune.

Microsoft is reopening a portion of Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island nuclear site in one of the more unusual scenarios. And Meta has invested in cleaner solar to help offset its electricity use. It's an energy source free of heat-trapping air pollution. That's important because NASA linked our planet's warming to increased risks for severe storms that further complicate the power supply with line-downing weather events.

E&E cited forecasts that have projected rate increases in PJM's territory to hit $163 billion through 2033. Price caps, such as one negotiated in Pennsylvania, limit some immediate impact. But once the cap is lifted, the rates soar, per the story.

NRDC said the process is based too greatly on speculation, and there is some fear that demand estimates could be too high. Regardless, ratepayers will suffer unless the system is refined.

""As a final twist of the knife, PJM residents will be on the hook for skyrocketing prices, even if these data centers don't get built,"" NRDC reported.

How can solar help?

Home solar removes some of the variables associated with the grid supply since the electricity is generated and used onsite. Battery backups, such as a Tesla Powerwall, save the electricity for later use.

Buying a rooftop array can reduce or eliminate household utility bills if leasing isn't right for you. EnergySage can help overcome upfront costs with quote comparisons, finding the right installer, and securing tax rebates before they expire on Dec. 31.

Musk said demand for Tesla vehicles is large, but many who want one now can't afford them.","Tesla says it will cut the cost of its next generation of vehicles in half, largely by using innovative manufacturing techniques and smaller factories.

CEO Elon Musk and other executives outlined the goals during a 3 1/2-hour investor day presentation at Tesla's Austin, Texas, headquarters Wednesday as they presented the company's third master plan.

The changes could bring the cost of a new generation of vehicles to around $25,000. Many investors were hoping to catch a glimpse of the next generation vehicles, but Musk said they wouldn't be shown until a proper product unveiling.

""We'd be jumping the gun if we answer your question,"" about the new vehicles, he told an analyst.

Shares of Tesla fell nearly 6% in after-hours trading during the presentation that ended just after 8 p.m. Eastern time.

Musk announced that Tesla plans to build a new factory in Mexico near Monterrey. Company executives said it will not take production from any other factories, where Tesla expects to expand production. They said the Mexican plant would build the next generation of vehicles, which also will be built at other factories.

It's likely that the next generation vehicles will be smaller than the current ones to bring the prices down, but that wasn't clear from the presentation. Many automakers build smaller vehicles in Mexico to save on labor costs and preserve profit margins.

CFRA Analyst Garrett Nelson attributed the drop in Tesla's stock to the lack of details on the new vehicles as well as the company's history of seeing its share price rise ahead of big events, only to fall when the actual news is made.

He said the company's long-term focus may have disappointed some investors, but he sees Tesla's vision as justifying its high stock valuation versus other automakers.

What they outlined really made the case that it deserves to trade at a big premium to the rest of the industry,"" he said.

Franz Von Holzhausen, Tesla's design chief, said the company must make another sharp reduction in costs in order to reach its ambitious electric-vehicle production target of 20 million vehicles per year by 2030. Tesla expects to manufacture 1.8 million this year.

The company, he said, will build the cars in smaller modular units, then bring those units together. The system uses less space. Executives said as a result, its next electric powertrain factory will be half the size of the one Tesla just built in Austin, costing 65% less.

That also means we can build more factories at the same time,"" said Tom Zhu, who leads Tesla manufacturing.

Chief Financial Officer Zachary Kirkhorn said the company cut costs in half between the early Models S and X and the second generation, Models 3 and Y. It's planning to do that again for the next generation, but also will improve the cars at the same time, he said.

The company also said it would design vehicles so they have fewer wires and transistors, and use fewer expensive rare-Earth metals in the batteries.

As we improve affordability, the number of customers who have access to our products increases,"" Kirkhorn said.

Musk said demand for Tesla vehicles is large, but many who want one now can't afford them.

Executives said Tesla is unique from other automakers because all the people involved in vehicle design and manufacturing are in the same room. The company also designs and makes many of its parts and software while others rely on tiers of parts supply companies.

The company also said it has opened 10 of its supercharger stations to owners of other electric vehicles as of Wednesday. And it plans to offer a package of unlimited home charging for $30 per month in Texas using wind as the power source.

Kirkhorn said the new master plan includes product advances, rapid volume growth and technology advancement.

Musk began the session saying there is a clear path to sustainable energy on Earth, but it will take changing just about everything from fossil fuel power to electricity generated by renewable sources. The Earth can support more people than it does now without destroying natural habitats or huge austerity, he said.",https://mynews4.com/resources/media/e8327a67-f735-4ea4-b079-2c69284adb83-AP23055699592659.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 18:18:43.549590

ExxonMobil Is Thriving in the Current Environment.,"Matt DiLallo, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/02/lower-oil-prices-no-problem-exxonmobil-is-thriving/,"While lower oil prices tend to negatively impact oil company earnings, ExxonMobil (XOM 0.29%) isn't your average oil producer.
Here's why Exxon is thriving amid lower oil prices.
This cost-saving strategy enables Exxon to make more money at lower oil prices.
It boasts a sector-leading 9.5% net-debt-to-capital ratio, backed by a substantial $13.9 billion cash balance.
The company is earning more money at lower oil prices.","Crude prices have slumped this year. Brent oil, the global benchmark price, is currently in the mid-$60s, down about $10 a barrel from this time last year. While lower oil prices tend to negatively impact oil company earnings, ExxonMobil (XOM 0.29%) isn't your average oil producer.

That was abundantly clear in the oil giant's third-quarter financial results. ExxonMobil generated $7.5 billion, or $1.76 per share, of earnings during the period and $14.8 billion in cash flow from operations. That was the highest earnings per share the company has produced compared to similar oil price environments. Here's why Exxon is thriving amid lower oil prices.

Drilling down into Exxon's third-quarter financial results

Exxon delivered record-setting production in Guyana and the Permian Basin. The oil giant started its fourth development in Guyana (Yellowtail), which came online four months early and under budget, boosting its average crude oil output to 700,000 barrels per day. Meanwhile, the company grew its production in the Permian Basin to 1.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, fueled in part by the expanded use of proprietary technologies that are boosting well recoveries by up to 20%.

Yellowtail was one of eight major capital projects Exxon has started up this year. It has two more on track to come online by the end of 2025. ""No one else in our industry is executing at this scale, with this level of innovation, or delivering this kind of value,"" stated CEO Darren Woods in the third-quarter earnings press release.

Exxon also continues to execute its structural cost savings program. It has achieved an additional $2.2 billion of savings this year, pushing its cumulative total to $14 billion since launching this initiative in 2019. Exxon aims to increase the total to $18 billion by 2030. This cost-saving strategy enables Exxon to make more money at lower oil prices.

Exxon's strong financial results are allowing it to continue returning significant cash to shareholders. The oil giant returned $9.4 billion to investors via share repurchases and dividends. That brought its year-to-date total to $27.8 billion, comprising $12.9 billion in dividend payments and $14.9 billion in share repurchases. Even with those cash returns, Exxon maintained a fortress-like balance sheet. It boasts a sector-leading 9.5% net-debt-to-capital ratio, backed by a substantial $13.9 billion cash balance.

""ExxonMobil had a strong third quarter,"" stated CEO Darren Woods in the earnings press release, ""continuing to demonstrate that we are truly in a league of our own.""

Building toward an even better future

The energy giant continues to invest heavily to build an even better company. Capital spending totaled $8.6 billion in the quarter, including $2.4 billion in growth acquisitions. Exxon acquired an additional 80,000 net acres in the Permian Basin to expand its presence in this core area. Additionally, the company bought key assets from Superior Graphite, advancing its entry into the battery anode materials market.

The company is investing heavily to expand its upstream and downstream businesses. Exxon plans to increase its upstream oil and gas production to an average of 5.4 million BOE per day by 2030 (up from its current level of 4.7 million BOE per day). It aims to derive more than 60% of its future production from advantaged assets (its lowest-cost, highest-margin areas, such as the Permian and Guyana), up from the current level of 50%. Exxon is also investing significantly to expand its downstream product solutions businesses, which include refining, chemicals, and advanced materials. By 2030, Exxon aims to deliver $4.5 billion of annual earnings from this segment, up from $1.6 billion year-to-date.

Add the incremental earnings from these investments to the company's cost-savings initiatives, and Exxon expects to produce significantly higher earnings by 2030. That positions the company to continue returning more cash to investors. Exxon is on track to repurchase $20 billion of its shares this year and intends to buy back a similar amount next year. It also increased its dividend by another 4%, extending its growth streak to an industry-leading 43 consecutive years.

The best just keeps getting better

Exxon's strategy of investing heavily to grow its best assets while simultaneously stripping out structural costs is paying big dividends. The company is earning more money at lower oil prices. The oil giant plans to continue leaning into this strategy over the next five years, positioning it to produce even higher earnings in the future. Exxon's ability to thrive in any market environment makes it one of the best oil stocks to buy and hold for the long term.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/840603/xom.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 17:02:44.705169

The solar project, Turkey Creek Solar Ranch, went online in 2022 on a 750-acre property.","LANCASTER, Ky.—It is unusual to have a utility-scale solar array in Kentucky, and even more unusual that the grounds crew here is a live-in flock of more than a thousand sheep.

On a recent afternoon, the sheep lounged beneath the shade created by solar panels, supervised by three dogs: Honey, Junior and Roxy.

The property is a farm and a power plant, and the developer, Silicon Ranch, is using this site to test how to maximize the income from both businesses. The work is part of an effort by solar companies and farmers searching for ways to efficiently utilize the hundreds of millions of acres in the United States used for livestock grazing.

Nick de Vries, Silicon Ranch’s chief technology officer, walked along a row of panels, explaining that his company and others have largely figured out how to integrate sheep farming and solar. The next step is to replicate the process with cattle, he said.

Silicon Ranch developed a system to work with cattle. The company provided details on the system, called CattleTracker, ahead of a public announcement coming at a later date.

The combination of solar and cattle could transform the renewable energy landscape, opening up vast stretches of land for solar development, contributing to a transition away from climate-warming fossil fuels.

It also would address concerns about solar encroaching on food production and agribusiness, de Vries said. That’s an important factor in Kentucky, which ranks in the bottom 10 in the country in utility-scale solar installed capacity.

Silicon Ranch’s system shows progress on cattle and solar that would help the industry move from a few small pilot projects to the potential for commercial scale.

Inside Climate News visited this farm to discuss CattleTracker and check on the progress of agrivoltaics—the integration of solar and agriculture—at a time when the Trump administration is eliminating renewable energy subsidies and cutting budgets for research grants.

Developing solar with cattle presents a major opportunity to expand solar energy, given the vast size of the U.S. beef industry, but it also poses some significant challenges.

“They’re very large animals,” de Vries said. “They scrape on things. They like to rub.”

He has become an authority within the industry on mixing livestock and solar, which is often called solar grazing, and its practitioners have a trade group, the American Solar Grazing Association.

He views the challenges with cattle as surmountable. He stepped to a nearby row of panels and pointed out which parts can withstand contact with a cow, and which are vulnerable.

The main idea behind CattleTracker is that panels are vulnerable when turned at close to vertical angles because they are then low enough for cows to bump into them. The solution is to adjust the tracker system—the machines that tilt the panels throughout the day to capture the sun—so that the panels stay at close to a horizontal angle when cows are present.

On a typical ranch, workers move the herd to a different part of a property every few days so the animals can have fresh grass and avoid manure pileup. Solar panels can operate with normal tracking most of the time when cows are away, and with limited tracking when cows are present. The system has controls to set the mode.

Silicon Ranch initially plans to use CattleTracker at some solar projects that it owns and operates, starting this year with a project in Christiana, Tennessee, about 40 miles south of the company’s Nashville headquarters. The privately held company, founded in 2011, has about 150 projects, most of which are spread across the Southeast United States.

An inevitable part of the conversation is that animal agriculture and Americans’ meat-heavy diets are major contributors to climate change. Solar grazing is an attempt to marry a climate solution to a climate problem, with the expectation that the result is a net positive.

People doing the work to expand solar grazing say they are driven by environmental and economic imperatives.

Silicon Ranch’s work on CattleTracker includes determining how to manage biodiversity and increase the land’s capacity to store carbon.

“I don’t think that grass-fed, rotationally grazed livestock [is a] a climate disaster,” de Vries said.

He drew a contrast between concentrated animal feeding operations, which are bad for the environment and bad for animal health, and the kinds of projects his company is pursuing.

Peer-reviewed research has not provided clear answers about the climate ramifications of solar grazing, partly because this kind of development is so new. A paper published in February in the journal Small Ruminant Research found that “knowledge gaps persist” in assessing the benefits and downsides of combining solar and sheep.

The History and Future of Solar Grazing

Solar grazing started with sheep, with some of the earliest U.S. examples coming online in the early 2010s.

It’s a natural fit. Sheep are small enough that they’re unlikely to come into contact with panels. The panels provide shade and the animals eat grass, reducing the need for mowing.

“I just can’t even stress how awesome this opportunity is,” said Daniel Bell, the farmer whose sheep live at the Silicon Ranch solar array in Lancaster.

The solar project, Turkey Creek Solar Ranch, went online in 2022 on a 750-acre property. It has a generating capacity of 70 megawatts.

Bell raises Katahdin sheep, a breed of “hair sheep” that have short hair instead of wool and are raised for their meat.

He has a smaller farm nearby with some sheep but there isn’t enough space for a larger flock. He connected with Silicon Ranch, which allowed him to use the space around the solar panels for grazing and awarded him a contract to maintain the property’s grass. The sheep do most of the work keeping the grass trimmed; Bell and his son mow about once per year.

Of 617 agrivoltaic projects in the United States, more than half focus on growing crops next to solar, according to a database maintained by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Of the 248 projects with livestock, 237 have sheep, eight have cattle and there is one each for horses, goats and a mix of llamas and alpacas.

The American Solar Grazing Association published a census this year that shows Texas has more than half of the country’s acreage for sheep grazing and solar, which isn’t surprising since the state is the leader in sheep farming and is in a virtual tie with California for the lead in utility-scale solar. The census lists 506 solar grazing projects nationwide, more than double the number in the NREL database, which indicates differences in how each report defines a project and how it gathers its data.

Whatever the number of solar grazing sites, it is clear that the sheep industry is small compared to the cattle industry, underscoring the growth potential if solar grazing becomes more popular with cattle farmers. Last year, meat producers slaughtered 138.9 million pounds of sheep, down 9 percent from five years earlier, according to the government’s National Agricultural Statistics Service. The total for beef was 27 billion pounds, which was essentially flat compared to five years ago.

Another reason solar companies are looking to expand into cattle is that the renewable energy industry may already have fulfilled much of its growth potential with sheep farming.

“We’ve hit a bit of a saturation point temporarily with sheep grazing,” said Joe Lawrence, a dairy forage systems specialist at Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, about the projects he’s observed in New York. “I think there are future opportunities, but I feel like the low-hanging fruit, so to speak, was there four or five years ago.”

He works primarily with dairy cows and sees solar grazing with cows as a promising opportunity to expand agrivoltaics. The main challenge is protecting the equipment from the animals.

“Depending on if it’s a dairy or beef cow, it could weigh 1,500 or 2,000 pounds,” he said. “You could certainly see a scenario where they, especially younger animals, would bump into something inadvertently.”

The current examples of solar grazing with cows are all small, designed mostly for research. BlueWave Solar of Massachusetts has three projects in that state, none of which is larger than 20 acres, which is small for utility-scale solar.

One of the three, Grafton Solar, is a partnership with the energy company AES and includes crops, livestock and solar. AES is a large utility and solar developer with projects across the country, so its work with solar and cattle could signal a larger trend among major players in the industry.

Other projects with solar and cows include university-managed test farms near the campuses of the University of Minnesota Morris and Rutgers University in New Jersey.

One common approach is to mount panels high off the ground so there is little chance of contact with cows. But this has downsides in terms of cost, as the developer needs to spend much more on the pylons that support the solar racking.

Silicon Ranch has found that it makes more sense financially to put the panels closer to the ground and use trackers to avoid contact with cows. This is part of a larger company-wide process to examine the totality of a cattle-grazing operation and determine how it can work alongside solar.

In at least one way, the timing of Cattletracker’s rollout is not ideal. It’s the kind of system that may have received substantial interest from federal government agencies in the Biden administration.

But the Trump administration is phasing out and cancelling many of the programs and grants that helped to subsidize renewable energy, including initiatives at the Department of Energy and Department of Agriculture.

Silicon Ranch has benefitted from help in the form of government-funded research at universities and national labs to better understand the effects of solar grazing on soil and other environmental and animal health factors.

But de Vries downplayed the harm of having less government support.

“I don’t think that there should be agrivoltaic subsidies,” he said. “You should strive for a good business solution, and then find what’s going to make it replicable, not limited to grants.”

de Vries and his company are confident that the combination of cows and solar will be good for business—and will soon learn if they’re right.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Silicon-Ranch-CattleTracker-Christiana-Solar-TN-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 15:18:28.026689

The Ministry of Mines and Energy has set a new ambitious target to increase the share of renewable energy in its total installed power capacity to 70 percent by 2030.

Keo Rattanak, Minister of Mines and Energy confirmed the target at the 3rd annual 2025 World Green & Sustainability Summit in Phnom Penh last Thursday.

The announcement underscores the government’s commitment to a sustainable energy future and its goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.

“The Royal Government’s ambition for the use of clean energy is to expand to 70 percent by 2030 to contribute to a sustainable world, especially for the future of Cambodia itself,” Rattanak said.

The government intends to use this green energy to attract more new investments because new industries, investors are keen on green energy, tourists want green energy, and people want green energy, which is also an opportunity to create new jobs for young people, he added.

The government has recently approved a number of new clean energy projects. Cambodia’s 70 percent target by 2030 significantly surpasses the collective regional clean energy goal set by the ASEAN.

Bottom Line 1: The incomplete and biased picture of climate science in the National Academies’ study does a disservice to the public.
Sadly, the Academies’ report isn’t that.","Steven Koonin writes in the WSJ, the The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recently issued a report on the effect of GHG emissions. It depicts dire consequences for the nation’s climate, health and welfare.

The study—put together in less than two months—was obviously meant to bolster the scientific basis for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s 2009 finding that GHG emissions threaten the nation’s well-being. It plays down or ignores any evidence undermining that conclusion.

This agenda is evident from the first sentence, which invokes the terrible flood of the Guadalupe River in Texas in July. The report doesn’t mention that similar events have been recorded since the late 19th century and show no detectable trend to the present, even as emissions have soared.

Assessments of climate science often minimize, or even ignore, natural variability to make recent climate trends or weather events seem unusual and hence a consequence of greenhouse-gas emissions.

The Academies’ report is no exception. It describes a recent acceleration of global sea-level rise observed by satellites without mentioning a comparable acceleration during the 1930s.

There are similar failures in the report’s coverage of US heat waves—which aren’t more common in recent decades than they were in the decades around 1900. And North Atlantic hurricanes show no long-term trends in frequency or intensity.

The report deceptively shapes its discussion of models used to project climate changes, gushing about how the models are improving. But it give no quantitative sense of how deficient even the improved models are.

It also omits some important but inconvenient topics. Readers won’t learn of humans’ demonstrated ability to adapt and reduce vulnerability to a changing climate, or of the projected minimal net effect of warming on the US economy.

Bottom Line 1: The incomplete and biased picture of climate science in the National Academies’ study does a disservice to the public. Flawed pronouncements that support advocacy by minimizing or ignoring scientific disagreements feed public distrust.

Botyom Line 2: Complete and transparent analyses of the risks of climate change are overdue. Sadly, the Academies’ report isn’t that. The gov’t would do well to stop funding their climate studies until they get their house in order.

Our Take 1: It’s telling that the Academies’ report cites the Texas floods—arguably the result of poor state governance—even as it fails to mention two North Atlantic hurricane seasons in a row that have produced storm landfalls far below historical averages and inconsistent with increasing chances of Hurricanes smashing into US shores due to climate change.

Our Take 2: We, like Koonin, seriously doubt the Texas floods are as statistically significant climate events as is the mild hurricane activity of the last few years. But the latter are not scary, so they’re ignored.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!IgGD!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fecea8495-ec05-49a5-9011-3217e9424f25_200x200.jpeg",N,,2025-11-02 13:59:01.986475

Trump campaigned on affordability, promising to lower prices ""on Day 1"" and narrowly winning the popular voting by roughly 1.5 percent.
In an article published by The Guardian on November 2, journalist cpoints to Jeffersonville, Ohio as an example of a midwestern town where tariffs are having a negative impact.
In Fayette County, Ohio, Trump won 77 percent of the vote in 2024.
We've had more and more people who have voted for (Trump) show up and say: 'This is not good, this is not what we voted for.'""","In 2024, Donald Trump became the first president in U.S. history to win an election despite four criminal indictments — one of which resulted in a conviction on 34 counts — and two impeachments. And the thing that did the most to get Trump past the finish line was the economy. Trump campaigned on affordability, promising to lower prices ""on Day 1"" and narrowly winning the popular voting by roughly 1.5 percent.

But Trump's steep new tariffs, according to Paul Krugman, Robert Reich and many other economists, are making the United States less, not more, affordable.

In an article published by The Guardian on November 2, journalist cpoints to Jeffersonville, Ohio as an example of a midwestern town where tariffs are having a negative impact.

""A host of Trump Administration policies — tariff measures and the end of clean vehicle tax credits worth thousands of dollars to car buyers — are causing multinational manufacturing companies to consider pausing hundreds of millions of dollars in future investments, a move that would hit small, majority-Republican towns such as Jeffersonville especially hard,"" Starr reports. ""Moreover, a raid by ICE immigration officers on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Ellabell, a small town in south-east Georgia in September that saw more than 300 South Korean workers detained and sent home, has sent shockwaves through places like Jeffersonville and the C-suites of international companies alike.""

In Fayette County, Ohio, Trump won 77 percent of the vote in 2024. And according to resident Amy Wright, the county is hurting.

Wright told The Guardian, ""The construction process has been slowing down…. Tariffs are affecting everything…. We've had more and more people who have voted for (Trump) show up and say: 'This is not good, this is not what we voted for.'""

According to Starr, ""What’s happening in Jeffersonville is being mirrored across the Midwest.""

""In Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere, global giants Toyota and Stellantis have spent billions of dollars in small communities, much of which came in the form of clean energy tax breaks from the Biden Administration's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022,"" Starr explains. ""Toyota's biggest production facility on the planet is in a small Kentucky town called Georgetown, where the company employs more than 10,000 people and has invested $11bn in the local economy since the late 1980s. These workers churn out nearly half a million vehicles and hundreds of thousands of engines every year…. In Indiana, one of the largest employers in the state, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche is reportedly considering pulling out of $50bn worth of investment in the coming years if Trump follows through on his executive order to target companies that don’t reduce drug prices.""

Michael Hicks, who teaches economics at Ball State University, warns that economically, the worst is yet to come in the Midwest.

Hicks told The Guardian, ""So, the bulk of tariff price increases will hit in the coming months. This matters, because factory employment is a major share of rural counties in the Midwest — about 30 precent in Indiana, and similar in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. These things will clearly have a political effect, but my hunch is not fully for several months. Overlaying all this is the risk of a significant (economic) downturn, where tariffs combine with a financial bubble that would surely hit rural — red — communities very hard.""",https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=56556977&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C32%2C0%2C32,N,,2025-11-02 13:59:46.594990

Year by year, TAM Europe has regained its vitality and reemerged as an active player on the European manufacturing stage.
The newly launched 70 MPa hydrogen fuel low-entry city bus marks another milestone in TAM’s new energy production line.
The model integrates Hyundai’s hydrogen fuel cell system, hydrogen storage tanks, and power control system.
Some hydrogen fuel cell buses have entered operation in Seoul and Vienna.","As the morning light gilded the gates of Slovenia’s pillar automaker on the outskirts of Maribor, the country’s second-largest city, brand-new hydrogen fuel cell buses slowly rolled out of TAM Europe, marking the official rollout of the company’s latest clean-energy vehicles.

In late October, dozens of hydrogen-powered commercial vehicles were delivered from TAM Europe to Seoul, South Korea, and Vienna, Austria, the first batch of hydrogen-powered buses produced by the Slovenian manufacturer.

The company currently has an annual production capacity of 500 electric commercial vehicles. During the Paris Olympic Games, TAM Europe supplied 24 electric buses to Paris Charles de Gaulle International Airport. Over the next three years, it plans to produce around 100 hydrogen-powered vehicles annually.

Founded in 1947, the Maribor Automobile Factory (TAM) was once renowned for producing trucks, trailers, and military vehicles. However, severe challenges amid market changes and economic restructuring eventually forced the company into bankruptcy in 2011.

After the infusion of Chinese investment and technology, production resumed in 2013, and the company retained its original brand. Year by year, TAM Europe has regained its vitality and reemerged as an active player on the European manufacturing stage. It has become a driving force in advancing green and sustainable urban transport through its hydrogen and electric buses.

The newly launched 70 MPa hydrogen fuel low-entry city bus marks another milestone in TAM’s new energy production line. The model integrates Hyundai’s hydrogen fuel cell system, hydrogen storage tanks, and power control system. Emitting only water vapor during operation, it marked a major step forward in the decarbonization of urban mobility.

“Our breakthroughs in environmental protection and technology upgrading have been key to our entry into the high-end European market,” said TAM Europe CEO Ma Fuxiong, adding that the rollout demonstrates the factory’s sophisticated craftsmanship and lean management in complex new energy assembly.

“It fully embodies the forward-looking layout and strong cross-border collaboration driven by Chinese capital in global green technology and high-end manufacturing – a vivid example of how ‘Chinese wisdom’ connects with global resources,” Ma added.

Li Minghai, vice president for technology and manufacturing at TAM, highlighted the transformation brought by Chinese investment. He said that through strategic investment and resource integration, this green manufacturing project has gained strong momentum in the heart of Europe.

“It ensures efficiency at every stage – from technology alignment and supply chain management to production implementation,” Li said.

FuelCellsWorks, a professional platform for the hydrogen and fuel cell sector, analyzed in an article that the successful rollout carries dual significance: it consolidates TAM’s position as a European hub for specialty vehicles and new energy manufacturing, while also exemplifying the deep integration and synergy between Chinese capital and European industrial capabilities in green technology.

Some hydrogen fuel cell buses have entered operation in Seoul and Vienna. Li said, “Our brand recognition is growing steadily, with customers now across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.”

At present, the company employs nearly 200 local workers. It regularly sends local employees to its plant in China to learn new technologies, while Chinese technicians also visit the Slovenian plant to provide on-site guidance.

“This is not only the success of a company but also a testament to win-win cooperation in green development,” Li added.",https://www.macaubusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/mb-logo@2x.png,N,,2025-11-02 17:18:37.552114

The global community has grown weary of the old-school fossil fuels that have ravaged the environment and resulted in catastrophic damage to the climate. The EU leaders came together recently at a summit to contemplate the impact of the geopolitical landscape on their electrification goals for the energy sector through renewable energy.

EU leaders are aiming to strengthen the region’s energy security and competitiveness

In a world dominated by calls for more work to be done in integrating the renewable energy sector into the global grid, Europe’s leaders have come together to discuss and plan the way forward for the continent in the energy biosphere. And the message is simple. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.

The overarching consensus among the litany of EU energy ministers is that Europe should keep to what is working and not aim to “simplify” the regulations for new wind projects. Introducing new policies may disrupt the already long line of new wind projects in approval limbo.

At the recent summit that brought together relevant stakeholders in Europe’s energy sector, they discussed a potential plan to fast-track the EU’s 2040 climate target, as well as any possible methods to simplify growth in the wind power sector.

The plan is to simplify the approval process for new wind power projects in European nations

That is the framework discussed between the litany of EU leaders that attended the summit. Europe needs to end the bureaucracy surrounding the approval process for new projects, which has become a serious problem as Europe sees a long list of projects navigating regulatory hurdles. The continent has become the spiritual home of the renewable energy sector, but leaders have lamented the slow progress made.

Wind power has emerged as the most cost-effective form of renewable energy production

Wind is cheap, readily available, and, most crucially, the kindest form of energy generation across the vast, potentially transformative renewable energy sector. For far too long, the world has stagnated in the embrace of wind and other renewable energy production methods. Now, Europe’s leaders have come together to figure out a new process that fosters a simpler regulation process.

Additionally, on the discussion table at the summit was also the EU’s 2040 greenhouse gas reduction target, which the EU leaders aim to agree on soon. Europe has needed to establish clear guidelines on how to effectively reduce the vast amounts of greenhouse gases being emitted by the continent’s energy sector.

Europe’s Electrification Action Plan will play a key role in reshaping the continent’s energy sector

The EU’s Electrification Action Plan is due to be released in the first quarter of 2026. As Europe grapples with rising costs and regulatory hurdles in the wind sector, the consensus among the EU’s leaders is that a more pragmatic approach is needed to foster growth in the wind power sector on the European continent.

That’s the dilemma that has plagued us since the sudden dawn of the nuclear age. Should we split atoms for peace or to rain destruction on our enemies? In the space of a single human life we’ve done both, killing hundreds of thousands in two atomic bomb attacks on Japan and then building nuclear reactors to provide light, power and medicine.

Radioactivity was discovered just more than a century ago, when Wilhelm Roentgen detected X-rays. In high school textbooks, most of us saw the ghostly radiograph of his wife Anna’s skeletal hand with wedding band, “Hand mit Ringen.” The image — the first X-ray — prompted Anna to remark, “I have seen my own death.” In 1913, science fiction writer H.G. Wells predicted both nuclear power and weaponry, in “The World Set Free.” In 1938, the trio of Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann were first to recognize that uranium atoms split when bombarded by neutrons. When physicist Leo Szilard confirmed fission, according to author Edward A. Friedman, he said ”the world was headed for sorrow.”

In 1939, Szilard and Albert Einstein sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt advising that fission could be used to create a powerful new bomb. The scientists feared the Nazis were already working on such a device, and their letter helped spur creation of the secret Manhattan Project, which eventually resulted to the test firing of the first atomic bomb in a remote part of New Mexico in 1945. Three weeks later came the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.

The Cold War began shortly after, and by 1949 our former allies, the Soviets, had their own nuclear weapon, too.

Later we created nuclear weapons stockpiles ready to kill hundreds of millions more and built dozens of nuclear generating plants to provide about 20% of the American electrical supply. One of those plants, Wolf Creek, owned by two regional utilities, has been online in Kansas since 1985.

Now comes a firm founded by one of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates, with the lure of bringing “advanced” nuclear power to Kansas. TerraPower announced a partnership last month with the state’s Department of Commerce and Evergy, one of the owners of Wolf Creek, to explore placing a natrium reactor somewhere in the utility’s service area of eastern Kansas.

TerraPower is already building a $4 billion pilot natrium reactor site in Wyoming, with half of the funding from the US Department of Energy. Some of the projected energy may power AI data centers. The company promises clean and safe power through its innovative technology, which uses molten salt (natrium is Latin for sodium) to cool the 345-megawatt reactor instead of water, as is done at Wolf Creek and every other commercial nuclear plant in the U.S.

A few Kansas communities in Evergy country have already tossed their hardhats in the ring to host the natrium reactor, including my home city of Emporia. The city commission, along with the county board and a regional development association, signed a letter of support for the project. Commissioners in Coffey County, home to the Wolf Creek plant, have also expressed interest, as have officials in Hutchinson.

TerraPower claims it will only place reactors where they are wanted, but there’s not been time for any substantive public discussion yet on the issue. Nobody asked Kansans whether we want a second nuclear plant or not. Another firm, Deep Fission, is working with an undisclosed partner to place reactors at the bottom of mile-deep holes in Kansas to supply power-hungry AI centers, but it’s not answering questions about details or whether it has sought state approval.

The gold rush for new nuclear is on.

We are, according to current U.S. policy, on the verge of a “new nuclear renaissance.” Old fears spawned by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are receding in popular memory. There is now public and bipartisan support for expanding nuclear power, according to a Pew Research Center poll.

It is understandable why leaders in a community like Emporia — which logged the state’s highest unemployment following the closure of Tyson meats — would find TerraPower’s projected 1,500 construction and 500 permanent jobs attractive.

But those vying to bring TerraPower jobs to their communities might want to cool their enthusiasm long enough to consider the safety and security risks presented by natrium reactors.

These risks were described to me by Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group. Lyman is an expert on nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and safety and security. He’s also one of the authors of “Fukishima: The Story of a Nuclear Disaster.”

“I have signifcant concerns,” Lyman said, “related to safety and security as well as for the economics. … It’s inexplicable to me why there’s so much enthusiasm for this type of reactor.”

When I spoke with Lyman on Tuesday, he’d just finished monitoring a multi-day Nuclear Regulatory Commission advisory committee meeting reviewing the preliminary safeguard assessment of the TerraPower’s Wyoming reactor.

It is important to note that TerraPower refused my repeated requests for an interview. “TerraPower will have to politely decline participation in this opportunity at this time,” public relations specialist Brooke Leader said on behalf of the firm.

The problems with the natrium reactor, Lyman said, are inherent in the design of any sodium-cooled reactor. The molten sodium bursts into flame upon contact with air or water, he said, and these types of reactors have historically been expensive to build and prone to leaks. But, he said, the most worrying thing about the natrium reactor is that it uses fuel enriched to up to 20% of the isotope Uranium 235. This fuel is called HALEU, for high assay low enrichment uranium, and it’s just below the threshold for weapons-grade material.

Conventional nuclear reactors use fuel that is between 3 and 5% enriched.

Natrium reactors require HALEU to make them smaller and more efficient, Lyman said, but there is no domestic source of this fuel available in the quantities needed. In addition, security at natrium reactors would have to be beefed up compared with conventional reactors, because HALEU is attractive to terrorists and rogue states. Enriching uranium to 20% represents most of the effort required to make weapons-grade material.

In addition, there’s the problem — inherent with every reactor currently operating or planned in the United States — that there’s no long-term storage solution for spent fuel. Work on the Yucca Mountain geologic repository was halted in 2010. All waste is stored on-site, in cooling ponds and dry casks. It will remain hazardous for much longer than there has been recorded history — tens of thousands of years.

We can’t even keep the government running year-round or provide reliable food and health care to our poorest Americans. How can we expect to keep the distant future safe from us?

The immediate risk with a natrium reactor, Lyman said, is fire.

Molten sodium “is a highly reactive material, so you have to keep it away from the air and water at all costs,” Lyman said, “or you could end up with a sodium fire. And having a nuclear reactor where the coolant itself can catch on fire just sounds like a bad idea. It really is. So they have to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent any exposure of the coolant to air or water.”

This adds a level of unneeded complexity, he said. Even though TerraPower claims that natrium reactors are safer than light water-cooled reactors, Lyman said just the opposite is true. The time to respond to accidents is much shorter, he said, and there is no containment structure — the familiar dome-shaped vessel — as additional backup to contain leaks.

“The Department of Energy is trying, with Congress’s help, to stimulate and stand up a whole production program for this kind of (HALEU) material,” Lyman said. “But the demand is very unclear. The investments are on the order of billions and billions of dollars for an infrastructure to make this fuel. It’s a risky proposition, and it’s not clear that TerraPower is going to have the amount of fuel it needs just for the first plant.”

Because TerraPower would not speak to me, I will rely on author Edward A. Friedman, in his 2025 book “Nuclear Energy: boom, Bust, and Emerging Renaissance,” to make the case for next generation reactor technology.

“The promise for successful realization of (advanced) technology was significantly enhanced with the groundbreaking of the TerraPower sodium-cooled natrium reactor,” Friedman writes. Bills Gates’s company, TerraPower, began construction June 10, 2024, at Kemmerer, Wyoming, “of the natrium fast-neutron, liquid sodium-cooled reactor (SFR) that uses an associated liquid salt storage system. This fail-safe, small modular reactor (SMR) will be the first model in the world for cost-effective replacement of a coal-fired power plant with a nuclear reactor.”

The reactor is expected to become operational in 2030.

Gates hopes for hundreds of coal-to-nuclear transformations in the future, according to Friedman. Indeed, the vision of replacing fossil fuel that drove Gates to found TerraPower in the first place.

“There’s no scenario in which we keep adding carbon to the atmosphere and the world stops getting hotter,” Gates wrote in his 2021 book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”

“The hotter it gets, the harder it will be for humans to survive, much less thrive,” Gates wrote.

Nuclear is the only carbon-free energy source, he said, that can reliably deliver power day and night through any type of weather on a large scale. It’s also one of the few practical ways to bring electricity to the poorest of countries, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to energy is highly correlated to wealth and happiness.

“It’s no secret that nuclear power has its problems,” Gates wrote. “It’s very expensive to build today. Human error can cause accidents. Uranium, the fuel it uses, can be converted for use in weapons. The waste is dangerous and hard to store.”

Yet, nuclear represented our best hope of stopping global warming, he claimed. There was nothing more important than halting the rise in temperature if we were to avoid catastrophe.

Recently, Gates has changed his tune on climate.

In a memo to COP30, the United Nations climate change conference scheduled for next week in Brazil, Gates abandoned his previous “net zero” views. He criticized “doomsday” climate scenarios and suggested that people will be able to “live and thrive” in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. It’s time to put “human welfare” at the center of climate strategies and improving agriculture and health in the poorest countries.

“Climate change is a serious problem,” he said, “but it will not be the end of civilization.”

The memo sounds like nothing short of a retreat from climate activism from a man who had spent personal billions on a quest for net zero. In the case of his push for advanced reactors, Gates may have been so driven by his desire to stop global warming that he swallowed the nuclear pill.

His sudden redirection must be having some effect on TerraPower, the company he founded. But his memo will have no effect on the U.S. delegation to COP30, because there will be no official American presence there. Donald Trump had already pulled the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The world has now blown past the agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming, with more climate suffering to follow.

Trump recently directed the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing, something we haven’t done since 1992. There is not yet a name for this arms race, but it is on as surely as the seas are rising. I am reminded of Damocles from Greek mythology, who was taught the dangers of power by the sword dangling above. So let us call this the Age of Damocles, because nothing is happy for those wracked by anxiety.

It is no coincidence that we embrace a new arms race at the same moment we accelerate the regulatory process to approve and deploy new types of nuclear reactors that use disturbingly enriched fuel. While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears. Troubling issues remain.

Opposition to nuclear power that curbed the U.S. nuclear power program from the 1980s until recently was based not only on fictional movies like 1979’s “The China Syndrome” but in real-life accidents like Fukishima in 2011, in which an earthquake and tsunami shut down the power grid and made it impossible to cool the reactors. More recently, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, has caused alarm because it’s been damaged and sometimes cut off in the ongoing war with Russia. Movies that might contain some inaccuracies, such as the 2019 HBO miniseries “Chernobyl,” are not causes of our nuclear jitters but expressions of them.

This is the global context in which we find ourselves pondering whether a new type of nuclear energy is good for Kansas or just a costly experiment that will risk accident or murderous mayhem. We live in a new period of global instability, one driven by all the old forces — greed, ignorance, haste, denial — that have plagued us since the ice receded. The communications from TerraPower have been carefully curated to present a sanitized version of a techno billionaire philanthropist’s dream of a nuclear renaissance.

I’m cold to the idea of spending billions on nuke plants to power, in large part, electricity-hungry AI data centers. It seems immoral when so many Americans go hungry and are without health insurance. Beyond that, there’s just too many unanswered questions about next-generation reactors.

But I’m opposed to the TerraPower plan for a natrium reactor in Kansas not because of the unknowns — where, how much, how long? — but because of what we do know. The HALEU fuel, in the amounts needed, presents an unacceptable risk of nuclear proliferation.

It’s about time, given that the average existing U.S. nuclear power plant was built based on 1980s technology.

A major reason for the virtual standstill in nuclear energy development in the U.S. was the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s near-maniacal effort to reassure a skittish public that they would not issue permits to any nuclear power plant that had the potential for public harm.

The shot heard round the world signaling a change in U.S. nuclear energy policy was the summary firing of NRC Commissioner Christopher Hanson, whose divinity school background may have contributed to a perception he viewed his job as more a gatekeeper for regulatory control than a partner in building a U.S. nuclear future.

As Senate Environment and Public Works Committee chair Shelley Moore Capito (R, WV) said, “For decades, the NRC took too long, cost too much, and did not have a predictable and efficient process to approve new licenses or modernize outdated regulations.”

Newly installed NRC Chair David Wright has called the Trump directives not “just regulatory reform” but a “cultural transformation that positions the NRC to be a forward-leaning, risk-informed regulator for the future.” The agency’s internal culture is being reshaped into a more efficient and modern agency without sacrificing public safety, Wright said.

But it’s not just the NRC that is being transformed. Under presidents from Carter to Biden, nuclear was largely relegated to the closet as the primary focus was the media-driven “green energy” crusade. Wind and solar permits were issued without the cleanup requirements and prepayments mandatory for nuclear and fossil fuel facilities. Nuclear was deemed “dirty.”

The first Trump term was so mangled by political infighting (both intra-party and cross-party) that any real nuclear energy agenda lay buried among the lawsuits. In the interim, however, artificial intelligence made giant leaps and the demand for electric power for fast-growing data centers was exploding. Wind and solar cannot be relied upon by entities dependent upon 24/7/365 power – and nuclear is still viewed as the “cleaner” option vis-à-vis natural gas.

Even before Trump’s reelection, tech giants were busily signing nuclear energy deals to power their data centers. Last September the owner of the long-shuttered Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear power plant announced plans to restart operations in 2027, thanks to a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft for a nearby AI data center.

Last October Amazon and Google both announced they would be investing in small modular reactors for AI data centers. Two months later Meta said it planned to follow suit. The amazing thing is the uncertainty that the SMR manufacturers will be able to deliver as quickly and as affordably as the tech giants demand. The simple reason? They have no track record yet. But energy demand is so high that waiting is not an option.

In the last few weeks, what was already a fast train picked up even more speed. On October 16 the U.S. Army unveiled its next-generation nuclear power Janus Program for the deployment of small modular reactors to support national defense installations and critical missions. Commercial microreactor manufacturers will partner with the Army’s Defense Innovation Unit with a goal of an operating reactor by September 30, 2028.

On October 26, Hyundai Engineering & Construction announced a basic design contract with Fermi America to construct four large nuclear reactors on a 8.1-square-mile property outside Amarillo, Texas. The Hyundai-designed AP1000 nuclear reactors will generate 4 GW for the HyperGrid complex, the world’s largest integrated energy and AI campus. The 11-GW project also includes 2 GW from small modular reactors, 4 GW from gas combined cycle plants, and 1 GW from solar and battery storage systems.

The integrated license application for the $500 billion project, the brainchild of former Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Fermi co-founder Toby Neugebauer, is currently under expedited review by the NRC. Meanwhile, Hyundai E&C is working on design tasks and preparations for the main construction phase, with finalization anticipated for an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract by spring 2026.

On October 28, Westinghouse Electric Co. joined Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management in a new strategic partnership with the U.S. government to accelerate the deployment of nuclear power. The government has committed to construction of at least $80 billion of new reactors using Westinghouse’s nuclear reactor technology to reinvigorate the U.S. nuclear power industrial base.

The government says this partnership will facilitate the growth and future of the U.S. nuclear power industry and the supporting supply chain. The entire project, which will deploy two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 reactors, is expected to create more than 100,000 construction jobs and support or sustain 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs across 43 states.

These are only a sampling of the active and planned contracts for nuclear power plant construction that have sprung out of the unplowed ground with the change in philosophy at the NRC and the White House. All systems are brightly lit green – but obstacles remain in the road.

Even with greatly shortened licensing timeframes, it will take time to complete site designs, obtain permits and licenses, and begin delivering much needed electricity to tech giants and other customers. Yet the biggest problem may be finding enough nuclear fuel at affordable prices to meet the mushrooming demand.

One option, says Curio CEO Ed McGinnis, is recognizing that spent nuclear fuel (including that from nuclear weapons) can safely be turned into fresh usable nuclear fuel and valuable rare metals and materials (like rhodium, palladium, krypton-85, and americium-241).

McGinnis, once a top nuclear energy official with the Department of Energy, says that only about 4% of the energy value has been used after five years of operation, and that fissioning uranium generates a plethora of other highly valuable isotopes that can be used for medical purposes, space exploration, and industrial processes.

Curio’s dry electrochemical and pyro-processing system separatees isotopes and fission products and also separates metallic elements like uranium and plutonium – each of which can be used as reactor fuels – enough, says McGinnis, to produce up to a third of the U.S. nuclear uranium feedstock a year from one facility. To boot, reprocessing dramatically shortens the half-life.

U.S. production of uranium oxide in 2024 jumped exponentially to 677,000 pounds from just 50,000 pounds in 2023, and exploration and development activities in 2023 were the highest in a decade. On a down note, anti-nuclear activists have been waging a campaign to shut down the White Mesa Mill in Utah that processes uranium ore – and in the U.S. today only about 5% of nuclear fuel has been processed domestically.

The nuclear fuel conundrum is but one of the obstacles in the path of the massive U.S. nuclear power industry growth that is also a vital component of the growth of AI data centers and other emerging electricity-hungry technologies that are shaping our future. But all systems are go – and that is the giant step that had to be taken first.

However, following a report from Hydrogen Europe, the continent has been warned over the danger of missing its 2030 green hydrogen goal, which the report states is over 90% below previous targets for this year. Hydrogen has emerged from the dust of the renewable energy sector as the most efficient form of energy production, and Europe is facing a reality where the goals it has set for itself to integrate the sector are falling way behind expectations.

Europe has been warned by Hydrogen Europe that it is on track to miss its 2030 green hydrogen goal

Hydrogen Europe is an effective barometer for measuring the progress made in the sector, and the organization has warned Europe that it is way off the mark in meeting its self-imposed goals for increasing green hydrogen production by the end of the decade.

The EU bloc’s target of reaching 10 million tonnes of renewable H2 annually by 2030 has failed to materialize in the face of a slow and stagnating embrace of hydrogen on the continent. Europe planned to increase its hydrogen production to promote the renewable energy sector while also importing a further 10 million tonnes of renewable H2 in the years to follow 2030.

A lack of investment, as well as a less-than-favorable regulatory environment, has slowed the embrace of hydrogen in Europe

Hydrogen has emerged as the most efficient and promising form of renewable energy in a sea of possibilities. However, Europe has seen several regulatory hurdles slowing the adoption of the sector, which has led to a serious warning from Hydrogen Europe. Crucially, Europe will need to foster a more welcoming environment for potential investors and close the bureaucratic guardrails that have existed for generations.

Hydrogen Europe recently released its Clean Hydrogen Monitor 2025, and the outlook for the sector is not good at all

Hydrogen Europe recently released its annual Clean Hydrogen Monitor for this year, and the forecast is that Europe is lagging so far behind the pace of adopting the hydrogen sector that not even Usain Bolt could pick up the slack left behind by the continent.

EU member states have been hesitant to place any type of obligations or expectations on companies aiming to do business in the region, citing a less-than-ideal investment environment as well as concerns over market competitiveness. The report from Hydrogen Europe states that EU member states may need to reach out to import enough energy resources to meet demand as the cold winter months approach.

Europe needs to pick up the pace and develop the hydrogen sector into a dominant force in the energy industry

Several European nations have stepped up their game to advance the hydrogen sector, like Spain, which recently held discussions to acquire a stake in a French energy company’s project that would foster growth in the sector. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and deserves a lot more attention from the international energy sector.

Attorneys general in Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota targeted Small Refinery Exemptions over alleged manipulation. They accused small refiners of claiming economic hardship to obtain relief.

Additionally, they argued these exempt refiners tell investors they remain financially strong. Oklahoma Energy stakeholders monitor the push because refinery policy shifts impact fuel blending in Mid-Continent markets.

The fuel exemptions have been a flashpoint in renewable policy fights.

AG Letter to Regulators

AGs from Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota urge federal regulators to investigate small refineries for allegedly manipulating Small Refinery Exemptions by claiming they face economic hardship while telling investors they are thriving.

Meanwhile, these challenges place direct pressure on federal enforcement posture tied to the renewable fuel standard.

Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird sent a letter to federal regulators Thursday urging an investigation into refineries that receive exemptions for renewable fuel blending standards.

Additionally, this escalates Midwest political alignment against refinery exemption discretion.

Bird, who was joined by attorneys general from Nebraska and South Dakota in the letter, said some of the small refineries that are eligible for Small Refinery Exemptions are “manipulating” the program and feigning they face “disproportionate economic harm” while publicly telling investors they are “financially thriving.”

“The possibility that refineries are gaming the system to receive government handouts when they don’t need them hurts Iowa farmers,” Bird said in a statement. “They should be investigated by the federal government to ensure that all refiners are following the rules.”

Renewable Fuel Framework

Each year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sets the renewable fuel standard which dictates a volume of renewable fuels that must be blended with, or must replace fossil fuels used for transportation, home heating and jet fuel.

Therefore, this remains one of the most contentious regulatory levers in liquid fuels.

Fuel refiners and importers satisfy these standards by either blending renewable fuels like ethanol or biodiesel into their products or by purchasing credits to offset the gas they produce.

Also, EPA compliance costs vary widely based on market structure, refinery configuration, and credit pricing.

Where Exemptions Fit

Under the same program, EPA allows refineries that handle less than 75,000 barrels of crude oil input each day to apply for Small Refinery Exemptions.

Additionally, this threshold remains the core dividing line between mandatory compliance and hardship application relief.

If the refinery shows it would experience “disproportionate economic hardship,” it can be exempted from complying with the renewable fuel standard.

Finally, demand destruction and legislative fights remain intense because every exemption affects the national blend pool.

Our little team, the herpetology technician, a Trout Unlimited project manager and another volunteer like me, were finishing up the first in a series of nearly a dozen fake beaver dams on a creek on the west side of the Snowy Range Mountains in southeast Wyoming. They’re technically called beaver dam analogues — since with their complex patterns of sticks and mud, they’re supposed to imitate real beaver dams. Although I’m not sure my noisy rubber boots really compare to the efficacy of the beaver tail.

The dams’ purpose, as the name implies, is to slow streamflow, lightly flooding banks and providing the water more time to seep into the ground.

If we’re lucky, a family of beavers will come along and make this analogue their home, even tearing out our handiwork to construct something they like better that’s more permanent and sturdier. Beavers are, after all, professional furry engineers, who perfected their craft over millennia.

Our fake beaver dams aren’t meant to last forever. They’ll be maintained annually for about five years (unless real beavers take over earlier), but the result when established in the right place can be remarkable, restoring and rejuvenating wetlands, replenishing the water table, keeping water higher up in systems longer in the year, and providing habitat for everything from insects, frogs and toads to elk and moose, and yes, even beavers.

Stream restoration experts like Steve Gale, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s aquatic habitat biologist, can and do extoll the benefits of beavers and beaver dams. And while the rest of us standing in the stream bed see their utility, we also agreed with Gale when he said: “Who doesn’t want to play in the water with mud and sticks?”

Bigger than just beavers

Before European settlers streamed onto this continent, bringing an insatiable demand for beaver pelts, the rodents lived in streams, creeks and rivers almost everywhere. They dammed any flowing water they could find and had a hand in shaping large swaths of the nation.

While beavers can be a nuisance, falling ancient cottonwoods in parched areas and flooding creeks and irrigation ditches, they’re also one of the best examples of ecosystem engineers, Gale said, and their services have been missed. Without beavers and beaver dams, rivers run faster and cut down into the soil, they wash away sediment and move water faster from headwater states like Wyoming to other states downstream.

Biologists have tried reintroducing beavers across the country — the Army Corps of Engineers even famously airdropped beavers into an Idaho wilderness area — with mixed success.

So now watershed managers are turning to contraptions like the ones a team of nearly 20, including Game and Fish employees and volunteers from all over the state, helped build in mid-September.

We stood on the banks of the South Fork of Lake Creek in the Pennock Wildlife Habitat Management Area and listened to Gale walk us through the process. In the last few decades, the South Fork of Lake Creek had cut deeper and deeper into the earth, ultimately sinking lower than the floodplain and as a result offering little water to surrounding vegetation. When runoff hit each spring, the water rushed down as plants sat parched on the banks.

“We lost riparian habitat and riparian width, which is important for calving areas,” he said. “We’re doing this work primarily for the deer, elk and moose.”

Beavers had been reintroduced here before, but even the industrious rodents had a hard time building dams and ponds deep enough to keep them alive and safe through winter.

We were here to help, hopefully. We would spend the bulk of the day pounding posts made from trees across the width of the creek over a quarter-mile-long stretch and then weaving bendy willow branches through the posts. After building a wall of willows, we would use buckets of mud and sod to fill in the cracks. With any luck, water would begin backing up almost immediately, eventually filling and slowly trickling over the tops.

Life or death

As beaver dam analogues become increasingly popular, biologists with state agencies and nonprofits are teaming up to place them in streams across the landscape.

Austin Quynn, the Trout Unlimited project manager helping direct our team, worked with groups of youth corps members over the last couple summers building, maintaining and repairing hundreds of analogues on a stream called Muddy Creek southwest of Rawlinsto help habitat for four native fish species: flannelmouth and bluehead suckers, roundtail chubs and Colorado River cutthroat. Last summer, beavers came from miles downstream and tore out dozens of analogues in one stretch. He sounded amused that his work was destroyed, because in its place, they’d built a massive dam that must have been what the beavers wanted and needed.

Some of the dams blew out from spring runoff, scouring the creek bed of sediment and leaving behind gravel that cutthroat trout could use for spawning.

Deep pools created by the analogues — and eventually beavers themselves — also offer fish refuge from the heat on mid-summer days.

On the east side of the Snowy Range, Wendy Estes-Zumpf, Game and Fish’s herpetological coordinator, and others built eight analogues in a creek which contains one of the last boreal toad populations in southeast Wyoming. It had been a stronghold for the creatures, but in the absence of beavers, the creek became incised, leaving little wetland habitat for toads to breed and survive.

A few seasons after Estes-Zumpf’s team erected the fake beaver dams, boreal toad populations have started to come back. She counted as few as four toads on past spring surveys and found almost 30 this spring including multiple age classes.

Beaver dam analogues aren’t a silver bullet for a drought-stricken West, Gale said, but for some species and some creeks, they could be the difference between life and death.

Illinois Set to Lift Ban on New Nuclear Plant Construction

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker pledged to sign a sweeping clean energy bill that includes incentives for energy storage and removes the state’s ban on new large nuclear plants.

Pritzker said the bill creates market certainty for future generation developers and expands technology lanes for next-generation infrastructure. Supporters said large utility-scale storage paired with advanced nuclear gives utilities more dispatch optionality as peak load volatility grows.

Xcel Energy’s chronically troubled coal plant Comanche 3, scheduled for retirement by the end of 2030, hasn’t been working since mid-August and could be out of service until next summer.

The coal plant in Pueblo County experienced elevated vibration levels Aug. 12, resulting in an equipment malfunction and damage to the unit, Xcel Energy spokeswoman Michelle Aguayo said in an email. The company is working with consulting engineers to determine what caused the problem and to resolve it. Aguayo said Xcel won’t have an estimated time for returning the unit to service until the investigation is completed. “The preliminary working date for the unit’s return to service, however, is June of 2026.” With Comanche 3 out of service, Xcel is adjusting the operation of its other generating units, Aguayo said.

Cindy Schonhaut, director of the Colorado Utility Consumer Advocate office, said in an email that customers shouldn’t bear the burden of covering Comanche 3’s repair costs. And the costs of “replacement power should also not fall in the lap of customers,” she said. Ensuring safe and reliable power is at the forefront of the utility’s responsibility, Schonhaut said. To the extent that Comanche 3 being down affects Xcel’s ability to meet that responsibility, the advocate’s office “has a heightened sense of concern.” The advocate’s office, which represents the public before the PUC, said it will review Xcel’s cost-recovery requests submitted to the PUC.

Comanche 3 is one of three units on the 700-acre campus of Xcel Energy’s coal-fired generating power station about 11 miles southeast of Pueblo. One unit was closed in 2022 and another will be shut down this year. The third unit, which would be Xcel’s last coal plant, is scheduled to close by the end of 2030. Xcel, Colorado’s largest electric utility, has proposed replacing the coal plant with wind and solar power, battery storage and natural gas generation.

Comanche 3 started operating in 2010 and originally was expected to run until 2070, but it has been plagued with problems and has experienced numerous outages through the years. A 2021 report by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission said the coal unit averaged 91.5 days per year of outages over a decade and was out of commission for all but a handful of days in 2020. A quarterly report by Xcel to the PUC showed eight outages at Comanche 3 in July.

The unit has been “a problem child” from the beginning, said Parks Barroso, an attorney and Colorado Clean Energy Manager for the conservation organization Western Resource Advocates. “I think the Xcel system in Colorado has been planning for a life without Comanche 3 for quite a while now and the system and the renewables on the system have shown that we can meet the system needs without that coal unit,” Barroso said.

Other Xcel Energy coal plants struggled to stay online this summer, according to an analysis by the PUC staff. The report highlighted what Xcel called a “code orange” event, meaning there was a realistic possibility of not having enough power to meet the demand for electricity. The utility asked customers to conserve energy Aug. 7 to avoid managed, rotating blackouts.

The PUC staff said factors that contributed to strain on the electric grid that day included significant outages at other fossil-fuel power plants, sustained high temperatures and lower-than-typical renewable power production levels. Over 80% of the power that was unavailable on the Xcel system Aug. 6-9 was associated with coal resources, the PUC staff said. Eleven units experienced unplanned outages.

Erin O’Neill, the PUC’s deputy director of fixed utilities, attributed some of the issues to the fact that the coal plants are being phased out. “We have been trying to make sure we don’t overinvest on maintenance on units that are being converted to other fuel or are reaching their retirement date,” O’Neill said during a recent PUC meeting.

Although the renewable energy generation levels were lower than what’s typical for the time of year, Neill said in an email that they were consistent with the levels used by planners looking to meet demands during peak periods.

However, Xcel Energy overall was short 643 megawatts of its planning target for the summer, or the amount of electricity needed to meet anticipated demands. The target includes a reserve margin to cover possible outages or other contingencies. A one-megawatt facility could power about 340 homes.

The PUC report said that responses to Xcel’s call for conservation Aug. 7 saved about 525 megawatts of electricity during the hours of peak demand. The measures included people using smart thermostats to lower the draw on air conditioning and commercial customers lowering demand.

Aguayo said Xcel Energy has taken several steps through the years to meet the growing need for more resources, including expanding power plants, approving short-term extensions of agreements with other power providers and a recent request to speed up approval of renewable energy projects to take advantage of federal incentives being phased out.

For Amy Wright, policies coming out of the White House are having a clear effect on residents of rural Ohio.","For decades, a line of storefronts in Jeffersonville, Ohio, a town of 1,200 people 40 minutes south-west of Columbus, lay empty.

But now locals are hard at work renovating the downtown and paving streets in anticipation of a potential economic boom fueled by a huge new electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant.

Two miles south of Jeffersonville, Korean and Japanese companies LG Energy Solution and Honda are in the midst of sinking $3.5bn into a facility that is expected to begin production in the coming months.

Hundreds of people have been employed in the construction of the plant, and more than 525 people have been hired to work in engineering and other manufacturing roles at the facility. In total, about 2,200 people are expected to be employed on a site that, until several years ago, was open farmland.

But some locals are concerned.

A host of Trump administration policies – tariff measures and the end of clean vehicle tax credits worth thousands of dollars to car buyers – are causing multinational manufacturing companies to consider pausing hundreds of millions of dollars in future investments, a move that would hit small, majority-Republican towns such as Jeffersonville especially hard.

Moreover, a raid by ICE immigration officers on a Hyundai-LG battery plant in Ellabell, a small town in south-east Georgia in September that saw more than 300 South Korean workers detained and sent home has sent shock waves through places like Jeffersonville and the C-suites of international companies alike.

“The construction process has been slowing down. My fear is that the whole thing is going to stop, and we’re left with just unfinished concrete out there,” says Amy Wright, a Fayette county resident, of the under-construction battery plant.

“What’s more, a lot of the people hired to do the construction of the plant are not locals. They are from out-of-state; I’ve met them at the gym.”

While in last year’s presidential election, 77% of voters in Fayette county backed Trump, recent polls suggest his popularity in rural America has taken a nosedive.

One poll suggests that his approval rating among rural Americans has slipped from 59% in August to 47% in October. Others chart his net approval rating in states he won in last year’s presidential election – Ohio, Michigan and Indiana – in negative territory by as much as 18.9 points.

Wright says her son, who works for a local company that supplies Honda with parts, recently received notice that a prior promise of overtime work was being rescinded. She says she believes Honda is reeling in spending due to US government policies.

“Tariffs are affecting everything,” says Wright.

What’s happening in Jeffersonville is being mirrored across the midwest.

In Kentucky, Michigan and elsewhere, global giants Toyota and Stellantis have spent billions of dollars in small communities, much of which came in the form of clean energy tax breaks from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Toyota’s biggest production facility on the planet is in a small Kentucky town called Georgetown, where the company employs more than 10,000 people and has invested $11bn in the local economy since the late 1980s. These workers churn out nearly half a million vehicles and hundreds of thousands of engines every year.

However, in August Toyota warned that it faced a $9.5bn financial hit to it and its suppliers due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, the largest estimate of any automotive manufacturer. In July, Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, said Trump’s tariffs were undermining investments in the state such as Toyota’s, calling them “chaos”.

Sixty-three per cent of voters in Georgetown’s Scott county backed Trump in last year’s presidential election.

Last April, Stellantis laid off 900 workers at locations across the midwest due to Trump’s tariffs.

In Indiana, one of the largest employers in the state, the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche is reportedly considering pulling out of $50bn worth of investment in the coming years if Trump follows through on his executive order to target companies that don’t reduce drug prices.

“No [manufacturer] wanted to alienate customers, but those days are past. So, the bulk of tariff price increases will hit in the coming months. This matters, because factory employment is a major share of rural counties in the midwest – about 30% in Indiana, and similar in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin,” says Michael Hicks, an economist and professor at Ball State University in Indiana.

“These things will clearly have a political effect, but my hunch is not fully for several months. Overlaying all this is the risk of a significant [economic] downturn, where tariffs combine with a financial bubble that would surely hit rural – red – communities very hard.”

Still, others believe that the tariffs will benefit small American towns in the long run.

“Toyota is doing fine and I don’t see [tariffs] as being a big hurt for us here in Georgetown,” says Robert Linder, co-owner of the Porch restaurant that’s situated a mile north of the huge facility, and who worked at the plant for 29 years.

In April, Toyota suggested it might move more vehicle production to Georgetown to beat the tariffs, though that move could be years in the making. Sales of Toyota brands in the US have been growing this year, with the company thus far eating the cost of tariffs rather than passing it on to consumers.

“They just announced a $10bn investment in the United States for more Toyota plants. If Toyota was worried about [tariffs] they wouldn’t be expanding,” says Linder. Recent reports, however, suggest the $10bn figure referred to previously announced investments.

However, large multinationals have a track record of announcing major projects only for reality to play out in a very different way.

In Wisconsin, the Taiwanese tech company Foxconn claimed it would spend $10bn on a facility outside the town of Mount Pleasant. Instead, local taxpayers today find themselves on the hook for $1.2bn spent on highways, attorneys and other infrastructure for a facility that has never transpired.

In Arizona, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), backed directly by Trump, has been plagued with lawsuits related to safety and other issues, and missed project deadlines following promises to become a major employer of local talent.

Despite Ohio’s governor, Mike DeWine, recently claiming there was no need to worry about the future of the LG-Honda battery plant, on 28 October, Honda announced it was reducing production at plants across Ohio due to a semiconductor chip shortage.

While more than two dozen jobs are available at the Jeffersonville site, according to the LG-Honda plant’s hiring website, it’s a far cry from the more than 2,000 positions cited by officials previously.

For Amy Wright, policies coming out of the White House are having a clear effect on residents of rural Ohio. As an organizer of four local No Kings protests against Trump’s policies she’s noticed a change in the people who are coming to the rallies.

“We’ve had more and more people who have voted for [Trump] show up and say: ‘This is not good, this is not what we voted for,’” she says.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/832f791a27ccbc1298ed44a6d0c2add30e52fb76/381_0_3813_3050/master/3813.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0122c2a1fc32a95437c5f185fde65d4e",N,,2025-11-02 08:59:30.090431

Anish Thakkar and Patrick Walsh met nearly twenty years ago at the University of Illinois. Back then, they weren’t dreaming of building the world's largest off-grid solar company. They were just two curious students trying to make a difference in entirely different ways.

Patrick was deep in engineering, working on a nonprofit project in India through Engineers Without Borders. He was in the state of Orissa, building biofuel microgrids for villages that had never known what steady electricity felt like.

Anish was walking a different path. He was running a nonprofit called Illini 4000, a student-run cycling organisation raising funds for families battling cancer across the U.S. His work was about people, about finding light in dark times, in the most human sense.

But their paths crossed in a tech lab, where Patrick was drilling holes into PVC tubes, fitting LEDs through them, and experimenting with how to build a prototype solar-powered lantern he could actually sell to families in India who didn’t have electricity.

Anish was drawn in, not just by the idea, but by its humanity. “It was the first time I realised,” he says now, “that engineering could do more than design gadgets. It could change lives.”

That small dream would grow into Sun King, the world's largest off-grid solar company, powering over 100 million lives across Africa and Asia.

From prototype to purpose

By 2007, the idea had outgrown the lab, and SunKing was born. The goal was to design solar products that worked for off-grid homes, were cheap, and reliable.

But the dream was fragile. They had prototypes, ambition, and not much else.

""We realised early on that just having the right product wouldn’t solve the problem. We also need a way to reach the people who need it most. And you need to make it affordable.” Anish narrated.

ADVERTISEMENT

That realisation changed everything. Anish quit his consulting job at ZS Associates and went all in. Funding was needed, and he was bold enough to go looking for it in unusual places.

The first yes

At his company's 25th anniversary party, Anish spotted one of ZS Associates’ co-founders, Dr. Prabha Sinha, across the room.

He cornered him and gave him a one-minute pitch. “He asked if I was still an employee,” Anish laughed. “I told him no, I had quit a week earlier and was moving to India to start this business.”

Sinha, who had grown up in India studying under kerosene lamps himself, understood the problem he presented. He didn’t just believe in it, he backed it. Sinha later became their first seed investor, and he has stayed a mentor and board member ever since.

“That was the validation we needed,” Anish said. “Someone who had lived through that experience believed in us, and in the idea that a for-profit social business could make energy accessible to everyone.”

Patrick nods. “It’s been crucial that Anish and I remain in control of the board, founders still directing the mission, without decision-making being overly diluted. That’s how we’ve stayed true to what we set out to do.”

With that early support, they set up operations in Mumbai and built a direct sales network to distribute their first Sun King solar lamps to rural families.

Soon, their network of Sun King Saathis (local agents) was delivering solar light across Indian villages. From there, they looked west.

Building across borders

Their next frontier was Africa, where the need was massive. Nearly 600 million Africans live without access to electricity. But affordability was the real challenge. Most families simply couldn’t afford to pay up front, even for something that would change their lives.

So they flipped the model. Sun King invented its own financing system — pay-as-you-go solar (PAYG). Customers could pay small amounts daily or weekly through mobile money or cash collection. As long as they paid, the lights stayed on. Eventually, they owned the system outright, and it changed everything.

Today, Sun King operates the world’s largest direct-to-consumer PAYG solar distribution network, having provided over $1.3 billion in solar loans to homes and small businesses.

SunKing has connected 25 million households, adding over 300,000 new users every month, and installed 195 MW of solar capacity across 11 African countries.

“What started as a product company became a full financing and service ecosystem,” Anish said.

Funding the future

Raising money for climate tech in Africa hasn’t always been easy. The space has grown, but it’s still catching up to the urgency of the need.

In 2025, though, the tide is shifting. Africa: The Big Deal reports that 39% of all startup funding this year, out of $2.2 billion total, went to climate-focused startups.

Sun King has been a key player in that movement. The company has raised over $400 million in equity and $300 million in debt.

“We used to think we’d always depend on foreign investors. But that’s changing fast. We’ve now raised over $450 million in local currency debt from African banks, Stanbic, Absa, and others. That’s huge.” Patrick said.

Those loans directly power solar purchases for millions of customers in shillings, kwacha, and naira.

“It’s no longer just donor money or Western capital,” Anish adds. “It’s African banks fueling Africa’s green transition.”

Their landmark $156 million local-currency securitisation in Kenya, the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa outside South Africa, proved just how far that model could go.

“The key was showing banks that solar customers are incredibly reliable. In some cases, their repayment rates are stronger than those of higher-income borrowers. That helped unlock major financing for Africa’s clean energy future,” Anish said.

Patrick calls it “a quiet revolution in finance. “Securitisation is something you usually see in advanced economies. Now it’s helping rural families in Kenya and Nigeria access cheaper solar power. That’s transformative,” he said.

Local light, local hands

For companies serving a market as vast as Africa, the question often arises. Should production stay global, or come home?

Sun King just took the local route, opening its first major manufacturing hub in Nairobi, Kenya.

The facility will assemble solar-powered televisions and smartphones built to work seamlessly with Sun King’s off-grid systems. With a starting capacity of 700,000 units annually, and room to scale, it’s a major leap toward a fully localised supply chain.

Patrick said plans are also underway to set up a local assembly plant in Nigeria, producing not only solar kits but also the appliances they power, TVs, radios, and refrigerators, designed for homes where electricity remains unreliable.

“We’re building the next generation of green jobs,” said Anish. “Over 35,000 field agents, 3,000 employees. That’s 38,000 careers created. These are the green energy jobs of the future.”

Patrick added proudly, “Ninety-nine per cent of our 3,000 employees are African. That’s not by accident. It’s the whole point.”

“It’s trust,” Patrick said simply. “We’ve been through good times and brutal ones. He’s one of the most important people in my life.”

Anish nods. “It’s been an incredible journey. From soldering solar lanterns in a campus lab to powering millions of homes. But the mission is still the same: light every home that needs it.”

That friendship has become Sun King’s quiet backbone, shaping a company culture built on humility, long-term thinking, and shared purpose. “We just feel privileged to work with people who care this deeply,” Patrick said.

As the US tariff landscape continues to evolve, the implications for energy markets across the Americas are profound.

Designed to bolster domestic manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports, the tariffs have inadvertently led to significant disruptions in clean energy supply chains.

As such, the tariffs are expected to complicate the renewable energy transition across the Americas, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.

GlobalData’s latest report, “North and South America Renewable Energy Policy Handbook 2025,” reveals the US tariffs have created ripples across the country and has affected trade dynamics within the American continent.

Energy producers, suppliers, and consumers need to remain flexible in adapting to these changes, which requires a revaluation of supply chain strategies, contractual arrangements, and domestic production capabilities.

Sudeshna Sarmah, Power Analyst at GlobalData, comments: “The tariffs expansion has introduced punitive duties on a range of clean energy components, including solar modules, wind turbines, transformers, and battery-related parts. While the intention behind the tariffs is to stimulate domestic production, the reality is that the current manufacturing capacity in the US falls short of meeting the burgeoning demand for utility-scale developments. This mismatch has resulted in inflated prices and significant delays in project timelines.”

The tariffs have also strained regional trade relationships, particularly with Canadian and Mexican exporters.

The imposition of stringent domestic content and origin requirements has led to punitive duties on cross-border transactions, complicating energy cooperation initiatives.

Q: How did your family and your background as a Muslim South Asian woman shape your love of the outdoors?
As I got older, I started making my way back to the outdoors.
Why are you making the outdoors political?” It’s consistently white people who say that.","Author, activist, and outdoorswoman Ambreen Tariq was born in India but found her passion in the American wilderness.

A 42-year-old senior program director at the nonprofit educational organization Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, Tariq started camping with her family after they immigrated to Minnesota when she was 8 years old.

Later, she moved to Wayne, New Jersey, where she went to high school and adopted what she calls an exemplary Garden State accent. Now based in Washington, D.C., the nonpracticing attorney, who worked for both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Labor, is a well-known outdoors activist who started the website @BrownPeopleCamping, among other pursuits.

She also wrote a semi-autobiographical children’s book, Fatima’s Great Outdoors, which follows a young girl from an immigrant family as they embark on their first camping trip in the Midwest.

Q: Why did you start @BrownPeopleCamping?

A: I’ve always been super passionate about environmental justice, which is the concept that low-income communities, and often people of color, bear the brunt of environmental degradation and environmental crimes. But in all those spaces, whether it was law school, working at the EPA, or even a climate march, it’s so predominantly white.

The country’s demographics are moving in a completely different direction. And that’s the problem: If we had to pass the Clean Water Act of 1972 now, it wouldn’t pass. There isn’t enough people power. So for me, a clear link between the two problems is that if you’re not falling in love with nature, you’re never going to stand up and fight for it.

It became obvious that there needs to be a bigger push for folks who identify with me to be represented. That got me started with @BrownPeopleCamping.

At first, it was really tongue in cheek. I wanted people to ask why I named it that, so we could have the conversation. And I went in with a pretty simple formula: I love photography and I love telling stories, so I’m just going to be my own storyteller. It doesn’t need to be complicated. I’m going to say what I saw, why I like it, and why I want more people to come out and experience it. Let’s talk about why the outdoors looks the way it does, who’s not out there and why, and how we change that.

Q: How did your family and your background as a Muslim South Asian woman shape your love of the outdoors?

A: We stumbled into camping when we came to the United States because we were trying to learn how to be American, and in Minnesota, the outdoors is a huge part of the culture. We were like, “This is what we do now. We’re American.”

But I think regardless of where you are on the economic spectrum, being an immigrant is really f—ing hard, especially for children. For me, it was such a difficult time. But when we went outdoors, it was calm. And when I look at memories of my childhood, when my parents were smiling or laughing, I think about when we went camping. I can’t imagine we went more than five times, but it became this rallying point in my brain — this feeling that when I’m out there, all I have to do is adventure, discover, be curious and just be a kid.

It became a very sentimental lighthouse for me. No other part of our lives was like that. We were latchkey kids. My parents worked two jobs each.

As I got older, I started making my way back to the outdoors. And it was almost startling as an adult to be like, “Whoa, I feel like I’m a 10-year-old in Minnesota again.” Every part of my life is drenched with diversity. Nothing is homogeneous. But when I went camping, it was a time warp. The country had changed, but that hadn’t. As a grown adult, I don’t have to just accept things the way I see them.

Q: Why don’t more people of color enjoy the outdoors?

A: As an immigrant, I have a different relationship to the land. I’m trying to gain entrance. I don’t really have a sense of possession or entitlement. It’s not mine; it never was. I don’t have lineage here.

But Indigenous peoples’ relationships are very complicated. It was theirs, and it was taken away. Period. And the places where we recreate, national and state parks, hold a lot of historic pain of displacement.

Then you look at the African American community, which was brought here to work the land but denied rights to own it, recreate on it or even be safe on it. There’s also this history of “bad things happen to Black people in the woods.”

So, depending on where you come from, your relationship to the land is very different, as are the stories told to you or the fear associated with it.

And inevitably, you still have to overcome the discomfort of, “I’m the only one out here who looks like me.” Plus, there’s a bar to entry with knowledge, equipment, and culture, which can deter people. A big part of breaking down those barriers is creating spaces where people can feel safe, explore, and try something on their own.

Q: So how do you fix that?

A: Familiarity is important. For example, when I got my gun license, I knew nothing about gun culture. But I saw a class about women in shooting and thought, “You know what? I want to go in there and explore because I feel really uncomfortable in a completely male-dominated space.”

It’s so intimidating. But it made me comfortable to go to this class for women. I could relax. It was daunting, but the minute I saw someone I related to, I said, “OK, maybe this is possible for me too.”

That’s a good parallel to the outdoors. If you’re new to it and people from your walk of life aren’t there, you feel unfamiliar, and it can be intimidating. But when you see someone who looks like you, who you can identify with, that changes things.

And there are so many groups doing this exact work, trying to make a space for people to feel safe, explore, and connect. I highly recommend people go out with groups that make a welcoming space for newcomers — local and county recreation centers, the Sierra Club, even faith-based groups that organize outings. There are so many resources.

You can also go on social media and find those groups. Even if you don’t want to go out with them, you’ll feel like you’re part of a community that’s encouraging you to explore. That’s the psychological support everybody needs.

Q: How have people responded to this? I hear you’ve gotten some pretty heinous messages.

A: That’s been the greatest surprise for me. It’s rare, but when I see ignorant comments, it’s not enough for me to say, “Oh, that’s just a crazy person.” It’s not. It’s a person with an opinion who probably represents 50 others who think the same way, and to ignore it would go against the work I’m trying to do. I genuinely want to understand what it is about what I do that angers someone.

The most extreme comments are just white supremacy. It’s nativism — “This is my land, get the f— out.” Then there’s the middle resistance, which sounds like, “Why are you playing the race card? Why are you making the outdoors political?” It’s consistently white people who say that.

So I tell them, “Put yourself in a time and place where you’ve been a minority.” Often, the people who respond that way have never experienced that. It’s not personal, and I’ll never lose sleep over those comments because they don’t know me. It’s more of an expression of where they are.

There’s a large swath of people in this country who are emotionally suffering. They’ve been led to believe they were going to grow up and have this country be a certain way, but politics is pointing to people of color as the reason they don’t have that — money, resources, power or land.

It’s the age-old manipulation of racism to make people believe minorities are causing all their problems when that has nothing to do with it. It’s ignorance laced with fear.

But it makes me laugh when people say, “Why do you have to make the outdoors political?” My response is, land is the single most political thing in the history of the planet Earth. So I’m not going to tell you what to think, but I am going to share stories with you. I’m going to tell you how I feel and how I think. Maybe that will help us understand each other better.",https://jerseyvindicator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10746622288_IMG_7179-2a.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 11:04:19.532570

Daimler Truck North America, International Motors, Paccar and Volvo Group North America sued the California Air Resources Board in federal court this past August, seeking to invalidate the Clean Truck Partnership emissions reduction deal they signed with the state in 2023 to move away from traditional trucks and toward zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The main point of the lawsuit was that, because the incoming Trump Administration rolled back Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) policies that had previously given individual states the right to set their own environmental and emissions laws, the truck makers shouldn’t have to honor the deals signed with individual states.

“Plaintiffs are caught in the crossfire: California demands that OEMs follow preempted laws; the United States maintains such laws are illegal and orders OEMs to disregard them,” the lawsuit reads. “Accordingly, Plaintiff OEMs file this lawsuit to clarify their legal obligations under federal and state law and to enjoin California from enforcing standards preempted by federal law.”

After several weeks of waiting for a response, we finally have one: CARB is suing the OEMs right back, claiming that the initial suit proves the signing manufacturers, “(have) unambiguously stated that they do not intend to comply.”

In its lawsuit, CARB argues that monetary damages alone would not make the people of the State of California whole as far as damages are concerned, citing that the stated goal of the 2023 Clean Truck Partnership was, “to achieve emissions reductions that cannot be measured strictly in financial terms,” according to ACT-News.

The agency is asking the court to compel the truck companies to perform on their 2023 obligations or, failing that, to allow CARB to rescind the contract and recover its costs. A hearing on the truck makers’ request for a preliminary injunction was held Friday, with another court date set for November 21, when CARB will seek to dismiss the case brought forth by the truck brands.

The Xi-Trump rare earth deal represents a pivotal moment in global supply chain diplomacy, establishing a temporary framework that addresses immediate tensions while exposing deeper structural vulnerabilities. This 12-month agreement, announced during the Busan Summit on October 30, 2025, creates breathing room for manufacturers while highlighting the urgent need for supply chain diversification and demonstrating how energy security trends continue to shape international relations.

Key Details of the Xi-Trump Rare Earth Agreement

Agreement Element Details Duration 12-month suspension period Scope Chinese rare earth export restrictions to US Announcement Date October 30, 2025 (Busan Summit) Trade Context Part of broader tariff reduction negotiations Strategic Impact Temporary stabilization of critical mineral supply

The agreement's significance extends beyond bilateral trade relations, affecting global manufacturing networks dependent on these essential materials. For technology manufacturers, defense contractors, and clean energy companies, this temporary stabilisation provides crucial planning certainty while underscoring long-term vulnerability to supply concentration in a single nation.

How China's Export Controls Created Global Supply Chain Disruption

The Strategic Leverage of Rare Earth Dominance

China's commanding position as controller of approximately 90% of global rare earth supply transformed these minerals into powerful geopolitical instruments. When Beijing implemented export licensing requirements in October 2025, the ripple effects immediately disrupted international manufacturing networks across multiple critical sectors.

The implementation of these controls demonstrated how quickly strategic minerals can become tools of economic statecraft. Manufacturing facilities worldwide faced unprecedented uncertainty regarding material availability, forcing companies to reassess supply chain strategies that had operated seamlessly for decades. Furthermore, this development aligned with broader global mining trends that emphasise strategic mineral concentration.

""Critical industries including electric vehicle production, smartphone manufacturing, and defense contractors experienced immediate supply uncertainty, with manufacturing operations requiring rapid adjustment to licensing-dependent material flows.""

Elements Beyond the Headlines: Strategic Limitations

The Xi-Trump rare earth deal contains significant exclusions that reveal its tactical rather than strategic nature. Understanding these limitations proves essential for assessing the agreement's actual impact on supply chain security.

Heavy Rare Earth Elements Remain Controlled

Dysprosium and terbium licensing unchanged

Samarium export permits still required

Magnet-grade materials face continued restrictions

Processing Equipment Restrictions Persist

Refining technology exports remain limited

Separation equipment licensing unchanged

Downstream manufacturing tools still controlled

These exclusions highlight the agreement's selective nature, addressing only October's incremental restrictions while maintaining fundamental controls over the most strategically important materials. This selective approach preserves China's leverage over critical supply chains despite diplomatic headlines suggesting broader resolution.

America's Tactical Wins vs. China's Strategic Positioning

Comparative Outcomes from the Deal

United States Gains China's Strategic Maintains 12-month export stability Control over heavy rare earths Reduced tariffs on agricultural products Licensing authority over critical elements Nexperia chip shipment clearance Midstream processing dominance Fentanyl cooperation progress Long-term supply chain leverage

The United States secured tangible short-term benefits through this transactional approach, obtaining immediate relief for manufacturers while addressing broader trade relationship concerns. The clearance for Nexperia chip shipments represents diplomatic pragmatism, though industry analysts suggest this gesture carries more symbolic than strategic significance.

Agricultural tariff reductions provide American farmers with expanded market access, demonstrating how rare earth negotiations interconnect with broader economic relationships. The inclusion of fentanyl cooperation progress indicates both nations' recognition that economic and security issues require integrated solutions. These dynamics reflect ongoing US‑China trade impact concerns that continue to shape global markets.

The European Union's Spectator Status

Brussels received diplomatic assurances rather than concrete supply guarantees, highlighting fundamental asymmetries in negotiating leverage. The EU's response characterising the suspension as appropriate and responsible masks underlying structural weaknesses in rare earth dependency.

Europe's exclusion from substantive negotiations reflects its lack of bilateral trade tools comparable to America's tariff leverage. Without significant transactional capabilities or alternative supply arrangements, the EU remains dependent on diplomatic engagement rather than economic bargaining power in rare earth discussions.

Why Europe was excluded from Xi-Trump rare earth negotiations: Europe lacks the bilateral trade leverage that enabled US-China negotiations. Without significant tariff tools or alternative supply arrangements, the EU remains dependent on diplomatic engagement rather than transactional bargaining power in rare earth discussions.

How Rare Earth Elements Power Modern Technology and Defence Systems

The 17 Elements That Define Technological Supremacy

Consumer Technology Applications

Smartphone displays require europium and terbium for colour accuracy and efficiency

Electric vehicle motors depend on neodymium and dysprosium for high-performance magnets

Wind turbine generators use praseodymium and samarium for energy conversion

Military and Aerospace Dependencies

Fighter jet guidance systems utilise yttrium compounds for precision navigation

Missile technology requires specialised rare earth alloys for targeting systems

Satellite communications depend on lanthanide elements for signal processing

The concentration of these materials in military applications creates strategic vulnerabilities that extend beyond commercial manufacturing. Defence systems require consistent material specifications, making supply disruption particularly challenging for military readiness and equipment maintenance.

""Advanced fighter aircraft contain substantial rare earth materials across guidance systems, communications equipment, and engine components, demonstrating the strategic vulnerability created by supply chain concentration in a single nation.""

What Are the Long-Term Implications for Global Supply Chain Security?

Building Alternative Supply Networks

The temporary nature of the Xi-Trump rare earth deal emphasises urgent needs for supply chain diversification strategies that extend beyond diplomatic solutions. Multiple regions are developing alternative production capabilities, though meaningful capacity remains years away. In addition, initiatives like Australia's critical minerals reserve demonstrate national efforts to address supply security concerns.

Emerging Production Regions

Australian mining operations expanding processing capabilities beyond extraction

Canadian rare earth projects advancing through development phases

African mineral deposits attracting international investment for exploration

Recycling and Alternative Technologies

Urban mining from electronic waste streams gaining commercial viability

Substitute materials research accelerating across industrial applications

Circular economy approaches reducing virgin material dependence

Investment Opportunities and Strategic Risks

Rare Earth Investment Landscape Post-Agreement

Investment Category Risk Level Strategic Considerations Chinese rare earth stocks Medium Stable short-term returns, geopolitical exposure Alternative supply projects High Significant development time, regulatory complexity Recycling technologies Medium Growing market demand, technical challenges Substitute material research High Revolutionary potential, uncertain timelines

Investment strategies must balance immediate opportunities against long-term supply chain transformation. The 12-month agreement window provides time for alternative supply development while maintaining awareness of continued Chinese market dominance.

How This Deal Impacts Electric Vehicle and Clean Energy Markets

Stabilising Green Technology Supply Chains

The Xi-Trump rare earth deal provides temporary relief for clean energy manufacturers facing material cost volatility and supply uncertainty. This stabilisation proves particularly crucial for sectors experiencing rapid expansion while dependent on rare earth-intensive technologies.

Electric Vehicle Sector Benefits

Motor magnet production schedules stabilised through reduced licensing uncertainty

Battery material supply chains experience reduced pressure from export restrictions

Manufacturing planning horizons extended for production capacity expansion

Renewable Energy Infrastructure

Wind turbine production schedules secured through temporary material availability

Solar panel component supply chains improved despite continued processing restrictions

Grid storage technology development continues with reduced material constraints

The clean energy transition's dependence on rare earth materials makes supply chain security essential for climate objectives. This temporary agreement provides breathing room while highlighting the need for sustainable material sourcing strategies.

Strategic Lessons for Other Nations From This Agreement

The Power of Economic Interdependence

""The Xi-Trump rare earth deal demonstrates that even strategic competitors must balance geopolitical tensions against economic realities when critical supply chains are at stake.""

The agreement reveals how economic interdependence can create pathways for cooperation despite broader tensions. Both nations recognised that supply chain weaponisation carries mutual costs, leading to pragmatic compromise despite strategic competition. However, according to recent reports, the deal's limited scope suggests continued underlying tensions.

Building Negotiating Leverage

Nations seeking supply chain security must develop comprehensive strategies that extend beyond diplomatic engagement. Effective negotiating leverage requires:

Alternative supplier relationships reducing dependence on single sources

Domestic processing capabilities enabling strategic material control

Strategic material stockpiles providing negotiating flexibility

Technology substitution programmes reducing critical material dependence

These capabilities take years to develop, emphasising the importance of long-term strategic planning over short-term diplomatic solutions.

Understanding the Xi-Trump Rare Earth Deal: Key Questions

Will this agreement prevent future rare earth supply disruptions?

The 12-month agreement provides temporary stability but doesn't address underlying supply chain concentration risks. Long-term security requires diversified sourcing, domestic processing capacity development, and strategic material reserves.

How does this deal affect rare earth market pricing?

Short-term price stabilisation is expected through reduced uncertainty, but long-term pricing will depend on global supply chain development, alternative source availability, and continued geopolitical relations between major economies.

What happens when the agreement expires in October 2026?

Both leaders indicated potential extension possibilities, but future negotiations will depend on broader trade relationship dynamics, alternative supply development progress, and evolving geopolitical considerations across multiple issues. As industry analysts note, the expiration timeline creates ongoing uncertainty for manufacturers.

Temporary Stability in a Strategically Volatile Market

The Xi-Trump rare earth deal represents pragmatic diplomacy addressing immediate supply chain pressures rather than permanent resolution of critical mineral dependencies. While providing crucial relief for technology manufacturers and clean energy sectors, the agreement underscores urgent needs for supply chain diversification and alternative source development.

For investors and industry stakeholders, this agreement creates a valuable 12-month window to advance alternative supply projects, develop recycling capabilities, and build strategic stockpiles. The temporary nature of diplomatic solutions in critical mineral markets reinforces long-term value propositions for supply chain independence and technological innovation.

The agreement's selective scope, excluding heavy rare earth elements and processing equipment, demonstrates that fundamental supply chain vulnerabilities persist despite diplomatic headlines. Industries dependent on these materials must continue developing resilience strategies that extend beyond temporary political agreements.

This analysis involves forecasts and speculation about geopolitical developments and market conditions. Supply chain dynamics, international relations, and material pricing can change rapidly based on numerous factors beyond the scope of this temporary agreement. Readers should conduct independent research and consult qualified advisors before making investment or strategic decisions.

It raises questions about who will benefit from the shift; manufacturers, licensed recyclers, or the millions of informal workers who have long powered India’s electronic waste economy.

What triggered the court battle?

The new rules were issued in 2022, but authorities have only in the last year tightened implementation to make producers recycle electronic waste through government-registered recyclers at a minimum price of 22 rupees (US$0.25) per kilogram.

Companies argue this price is “arbitrary” and “anti-competitive”, and that it is roughly three to four times higher than what they previously paid.

Research firm Redseer told Reuters that India’s recycling rates were still low compared with the United States, where they are up to five times higher, and China, where they at least 1.5 times higher.

Since 2016, brands could meet Indian recycling targets by trading Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) certificates with other companies or licensed recyclers. This created a flexible market, letting them choose how and where to fulfil their obligations while keeping compliance costs lower.

Producers are now seeking a return to this system, saying the new rules remove flexibility and increase costs.

The lawsuit by Daikin, LG, Samsung, Carrier, Hitachi and Havells says recycling targets are unrealistic given the limited number of licensed recyclers, especially outside major cities.

What is the government trying to achieve?

The government says the rules are essential for building a formal, traceable recycling industry that can recover critical minerals.

The policy is part of India’s US$4-billion National Critical Minerals Mission, launched in 2023, which seeks to secure supplies through overseas deals, new domestic mines and by scaling up formal recycling.

The government says the minimum recycling price ensures recyclers are paid fairly, helping expand compliant facilities and reduce reliance on informal workshops that often lack safety standards.

India’s formal electronic waste recovery rate now exceeds 40 per cent, nearly matching that of Europe and the United States, though much of that volume still flows from informal collection networks.

More than 90 per cent of electronic waste collection and dismantling takes place in informal workshops, often by workers without protective gear, for a typical daily wage of 300 rupees (US$3.38), before the material is sold to licensed recyclers, according to estimates by Delhi-based non-profit Toxics Link.

What’s at stake for India’s clean energy and workers?

The court outcome will influence India’s electronic waste-to-minerals strategy at a time when countries are competing for these resources.

Mineral access is expected to be discussed at the UN COP30 climate summit in Brazil next month.

India could be a test case of whether emerging economies can build cleaner, fairer recycling systems. Sustainability experts caution that while the formalisation of recycling is necessary, it could exclude millions of informal workers who do much of the collection and dismantling and put them out of jobs.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/eugenia-pan-kiv-A7NNW7pjHOk-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-11-02 10:19:03.485118

A new national survey commissioned by Sunrun shows that 80% of consumers fear the AI boom could boost their power bills—a view that is rapidly evolving into a political and regulatory hot potato for the industry. The problem is acute. Researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory estimate U.S. data centers are on track to consume around 4% of the nation’s electricity, more than double their share in 2018, and could grow to 6.7%–12% by 2028. That projection unfolds simultaneously with the prospect of more upward pressure on wholesale market prices from fuel prices, extreme weather, and grid congestion.

Why wholesale power prices are climbing across regions

Fuel dynamics are a substantial factor. U.S. Energy Information Administration data indicate gas-fired power burn is about 20% above the 2019 level, while liquefied natural gas exports are up almost 140%, tightening the market and boosting generator costs. And thousands of heat waves are increasingly contributing to higher peak values and capacity-stress rates across multiple regions.

New supply is in short supply. The International Energy Agency notes that combined-cycle gas plants normally take about four years to build, and manufacturers are now encountering a critical shortage of one-of-a-kind turbines, with quoted deliveries extended out as far as seven years. While the interconnection queue for fresh generation and storage is still congested, it is frustrating the development of projects that might alleviate specific local price volatility.

Renewables help but policy delays and load growth loom

Renewables’ continued growth has been the price mitigator of the last decade in many markets. EIA reports that solar, wind, and grid-scale batteries will continue to lead new U.S. capacity additions in the shorter term. However, with additional long-duration tax incentives still undecided by H1 2023, this may retain barriers to accelerated growth as load outmaneuvers supply.

AI training clusters are reshaping data center demand

AI training clusters have upended the scale of data center power demands. Developers are now planning campuses on the order of 100 MW or more, with individual buildings geared for unprecedented rack densities to keep racks of GPUs and specialized accelerators humming. Utilities from Virginia to Texas report multi-gigawatt pipelines anchored by digital infrastructure customers, and grid planners in PJM, ERCOT, and the Midcontinent region have already revised load forecasts upwards.

While efficiency helps, it does not entirely mitigate the demand. The Uptime Institute reports that the average data center PUE is around 1.58, a constructive development over the last decade. However, overall consumption has continued to rise given the growth of AI workloads. Additional water and thermal management—warm-water liquid cooling and heat reuse—are eliminating waste at the margins of historical cooling; the underlying demand for compute remains.

Public sentiment may slow projects amid bill concerns

Public discernment will act as a brake. Pew Research Center reports many more Americans are concerned than positive about AI writ large. Higher electric bills—due to fuel pass-throughs, capacity costs, and native congestion—will be associated with the most-seen new fringes of power consumption: AI and hyperscale data centers.

Regulators weigh limits on large new digital loads

Policymakers are on it. State commissions are re-examining long-term utility contracts and rate designs applied to large digital loads. European experience indicates what to anticipate: Ireland’s grid manager has banned new data center connections around Dublin, and Dutch cities have put the permits on hold temporarily for mega-sites. U.S. city utilities have also indicated capacity constraints, and some require that high-load connections await transmission upgrades.

How builders are battling the rising energy cost curve

Hyperscalers are racing to secure stable energy. Power purchase agreements for long-term utility solar and wind remain the initial line of protection, trusted for cost clarity and accelerating the market. Many operations are situated next to existing nuclear plants or have signed groundbreaking contracts such as next-generation geothermal and provisional fusion to safeguard the impact and sharpen the carbon triple.

Storage is advancing from the pilot to the portfolio. Grid batteries are helping to reduce the highest prices and sustain renewable output, specifically when paired with flexible AI workloads that shift training to off-peak sessions. Liquid refrigeration, superior power delivery, and reuse of waste energy are decreasing operating costs and easing local grid pressure in compute land expenditure. However, when regional capacity is tight, none of that eliminates the exposure.

What could shape the next chapter for AI power costs

For data center operators, the choice is getting harder: secure firm power at a premium, delay projects, or redesign workloads to be more grid-interactive. For households and small businesses, the question is easier. Whatever is done, it should not involve another line item creeping charges on monthly statements. It is difficult to do it without rapid low-cost generation, storage, and transmission buildouts.

Three signals will decide the next chapter:

the pace of interconnection reforms dismantling renewable and storage backlogs;

the behavior of gas prices and LNG exports heading into peak seasons;

whether AI companies commit to aligning consumption with automated calls for flexible consumption.

If any of these trends break favorably, the AI power-price overhang will probably lessen. If not, simply wait for stricter siting rules, tougher contracts, and louder ratepayer pushback.",https://www.findarticles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/featured_edited_1762020448.png,N,,2025-11-02 12:18:14.845645

As the global LNG landscape progresses toward lower-carbon solutions, how does Technip Energies plan to support the Middle East developments?

LNG remains a cornerstone of the global energy mix and it’s an opportunity for the long term. What we’re seeing today is three strong trends shaping this market: the need for secure and affordable access to energy, a steady increase in global demand, and regional policies driving lower-carbon production. And the Middle East, of course, sits right at the center of this dynamic.

At Technip Energies, we’re helping our clients respond to these trends. Our differentiation lies both in how we execute and how we innovate. Over the past decades, we’ve proven our ability to deliver mid to mega-scale projects, to leverage modular and productised solutions like SnapLNGTM by T.EN, and to advance decarbonisation through electrification and CO₂ capture.

And this know-how is tangible and recognised by the market. You can see it in action with Ruwais LNG, a landmark project with ADNOC that will be the first LNG export facility in the MENA region to run on clean power. In Oman, Marsa LNG will follow the same path, using renewable energy to produce low-carbon LNG for maritime transport.

Today, with more than 35% market share of LNG projects reaching FID since 2020, we’re proud to be shaping the next generation of LNG: modularised, electrified, and designed for lower carbon intensity.

Technip Energies has been advancing technologies in ethylene and refining decarbonisation as well as CCUS. How do you see these innovations reshaping the company’s leadership role in the energy transition over the next decade?

Indeed, beyond LNG, our leadership also extends to industrial decarbonisation, and ethylene is a great example. For more than 50 years, we’ve designed and delivered some of the world’s largest and most complex ethylene facilities. We hold roughly half of the global licensing market, which says a lot about our experience and, more importantly, the trust of our clients.

But leadership also means evolution. Over time, our clients’ priorities have changed and so have we. We’ve reworked our technologies to decarbonise ethylene production and make plants more efficient. Our low-emission cracking furnaces, proprietary equipment, and advanced simulation tools now enable up to 30% CO₂ reduction and around 20% energy efficiency improvement.

With initiatives such as BlueH₂ by T.EN and the Shell–Technip Energies CCUS alliance, how is Technip Energies positioning itself to build integrated low-carbon value chains — from hydrogen production to carbon management — on a global scale?

In fact, what we’re doing today is connecting the dots across the entire low-carbon value chain, from hydrogen production to carbon management. Our role is to bring proven solutions to our clients at every step of that journey, especially in hard-to-abate industries.

As you mentioned, we have two flagship solutions that make this possible. First, with BlueH₂ by T.EN™, we deliver scalable hydrogen solutions that can capture up to 99% of CO₂ emissions. Then there’s Canopy by T.EN™, our integrated suite of post-combustion carbon capture solutions for any type of emitter, powered by Shell’s proven CANSOLV® CO₂ Capture System.

These solutions, combined with our strong integration and execution know-how, make us a trusted partner for low-carbon projects. Because in the end, what our clients need most are proven technologies, scalable solutions, and the confidence that their projects will be delivered successfully.

This positioning has already led us to two landmarks projects: Net Zero Teesside Power in the UK, the world’s first gas-fired power station with carbon capture, and Blue Point One in the US, the world’s largest low-carbon ammonia plant.

How can an international company such as Technip Energies have a strong local content across the region?

Well, while we’re truly a global company, we’ve always believed that success is built through collaboration and proximity. Understanding our clients’ needs, being close to them, and building trust through everyday teamwork, that’s really what makes the difference.

That’s exactly the spirit behind NT Energies, our joint venture with NMDC Energy based in Abu Dhabi. It brings together strong local execution capabilities with Technip Energies’ global expertise in technology and project management. NT Energies is already delivering real value across the UAE, the wider Middle East, and North Africa, from blue and green hydrogen to CO₂ capture, waste-to-energy, biorefining, and biochemistry.

What I really like about this model is that it creates a true win-win dynamic: developing local talent, supporting regional economies, and building long-term, trust-based partnerships with our clients.","https://www.energyconnects.com/media/rzsewxpo/portrait-_-arnaud-pieton-diplômé-1998-et-ceo-de-technip-energies____-2.png?center=0.45181092694904851,0.4688180558305286&mode=crop&width=1200&height=628&rnd=134061099437170000",N,,2025-11-02 10:19:07.959060

The fund will also help create hydrogen hubs, connect producers with end-users, and encourage the use of made-in-Ontario hydrogen.
The updated criteria will promote projects developed by Canadian companies to help strengthen Ontario’s economy and energy security.
The expanded fund responds to industry feedback for increased government support and reaffirms Ontario’s commitment to advancing a low-carbon hydrogen economy.
“Ontario’s Hydrogen Hub in Sarnia-Lambton applauds the leadership of the Ontario government – and especially Minister Oosterhoff – as the build out of the low-carbon hydrogen economy and establishment of defined hydrogen hubs stand to benefit significantly from the support of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund,” said Matthew Slotwinski, CEO of the Sarnia-Lambton Economic Partnership.","The Ontario government is investing $30 million to launch a new round of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund, supporting projects aimed at unlocking hydrogen’s potential to drive economic growth, create good-paying jobs and strengthen the province’s position as a world leader in the clean energy economy.

This investment doubles the funding from the previous round and expands eligibility criteria under Energy for Generations, Ontario’s long-term energy roadmap designed to build a resilient, secure and self-reliant energy sector capable of powering the most competitive economy in the G7.

“By expanding the Hydrogen Innovation Fund, our government is making a strategic investment as part of our plan to protect Ontario’s economy and energy independence,” said Sam Oosterhoff, Associate Minister of Energy-Intensive Industries. “Hydrogen technologies are already unlocking new opportunities for private sector investment and creating good-paying jobs, all while enhancing our competitive edge and making Ontario a world leader in the hydrogen sector as we build a more competitive, resilient economy.”

The expanded fund includes two streams: one for projects integrating low-carbon hydrogen into Ontario’s electricity grid, and another supporting broader sector applications of hydrogen across transportation, manufacturing and heavy industry. The fund will also help create hydrogen hubs, connect producers with end-users, and encourage the use of made-in-Ontario hydrogen.

The updated criteria will promote projects developed by Canadian companies to help strengthen Ontario’s economy and energy security. The expanded fund responds to industry feedback for increased government support and reaffirms Ontario’s commitment to advancing a low-carbon hydrogen economy.

“Hydrogen has potential as both a clean energy resource and a major economic play that can create tens of thousands of jobs,” said Stephen Lecce, Minister of Energy and Mines. “Our government’s focus is on delivering affordable energy to families, along with creating good-paying jobs as we build-up Ontario’s low-carbon future.”

Hydrogen technologies are seen as uniquely suited to fill gaps in the energy system that are difficult or costly to address through electrification alone. The province said hydrogen can help manage peak electricity demand, provide long-duration energy storage and reduce emissions in sectors such as steel, cement and refining.

“Ontario’s Hydrogen Hub in Sarnia-Lambton applauds the leadership of the Ontario government – and especially Minister Oosterhoff – as the build out of the low-carbon hydrogen economy and establishment of defined hydrogen hubs stand to benefit significantly from the support of the Hydrogen Innovation Fund,” said Matthew Slotwinski, CEO of the Sarnia-Lambton Economic Partnership. “The development of the at-scale low-carbon hydrogen economy starts with leveraging innovation to connect hydrogen producers and users, setting the stage for long-term economic growth, job creation, clean energy integration, and low-carbon diversification.”

According to a 2023 study commissioned by Natural Resources Canada, a robust hydrogen economy could create up to 70,000 jobs across Canada by 2050, including in Ontario, in areas such as production, infrastructure, storage and clean technology development, while helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Overcoming challenges with renewable energy

Wadi Zar, with a population of 7,000, is a small village accessible by sandy roads and dirt tracks that can pose challenges for vehicular travel. Here, homes made of straw and mud reflect a lifestyle grounded in simplicity, but also in struggle. For years, women like Azara relied on oil-powered lanterns that emitted harmful smoke, endangering the health of users.

""Previously, we used to use battery-powered lamps, which we only used when necessary because we couldn't afford the cost of batteries,"" shares Azara.

The project distributed solar lanterns, which have positively impacted Azara and her family.

""This solar lantern helps us provide light when cooking, helps the children study and play in the evening, and keeps us safe from snakes and scorpions. My husband and I are also able to walk safely, as we are physically disabled.""

Participants are not only learning technical skills but also provided with the knowledge to start their own businesses.

Madleen shares, ""In the production phase, we organized work teams with a unified goal: to create finished products through a complete production line. Every team member had a distinct role, contributing to the final outcome.

“In Nigeria today, we have over 10 gigawatts of stranded generation capacity.
The story is that, inside that factory, there is a 540-megawatt turbine for power generation in good condition.
And we have been wasting power-generating assets built with the funds and resources of this country,” Adelabu lamented.
They have an existing 84-megawatt power capacity that is wasting away: a thermal plant.","Despite the country’s persistent lack of electricity, over 10,000 megawatts of electricity are being wasted across different idle plants scattered across the country, Sunday PUNCH has learnt.

Nigeria’s Minister of Power, Adebayo Adelabu, decried the country’s wastefulness in the energy sector, revealing that more than 10 gigawatts of generation capacity remain stranded nationwide while millions of citizens live in darkness.

Speaking at the just-concluded Nigeria Energy Conference in Lagos, the minister said the country’s immediate problem was not generation but the inability to transmit and distribute the energy already available.

He described the country as wasteful because plants that should light up businesses and homes were left idle without considering the cost of construction.

“In Nigeria today, we have over 10 gigawatts of stranded generation capacity. Yes, we have energy being generated or installed all over the country that we are not even using. Generation will not be our immediate problem today, but stable transmission and effective distribution to the household, with full metering.”

Energy that will power industries, create jobs, and even support electricity exports to our neighbouring countries through the regional power pool is all stranded,” he said.

The minister lamented that several government-built assets worth billions have been left idle for years, saying the country was being lazy and carefree.

Citing examples, he said the Aluminium Smelting Company in Akwa Ibom hosts six turbines of 90 megawatts each, a total of 540 megawatts, that have been lying fallow for two decades simply because of a short transmission gap.

“It’s been there for the past 20 years, not operating. There are power issues because it is not connected to the bridge. But that is not the story. The story is that, inside that factory, there is a 540-megawatt turbine for power generation in good condition. They have about six turbines of 90 megawatts each. Each of these turbines has a capacity for an additional 20 megawatts, which is 120 megawatts, plus 540. It is a potential 660 megawatts of power that has been there for the past 20 years.

“And we are not even bothered, just because there are fewer than four kilometres of line to be connected to the 330-132 kV substation. Can you see how wasteful we are in this country? Beside it is the Ibom power station, less than two kilometres away, with a regular gas supply. And we have been wasting power-generating assets built with the funds and resources of this country,” Adelabu lamented.

From there, the minister said he proceeded to the Port Harcourt Refinery, where another 84-megawatt power facility has been wasting away.

“From there, I drove straight to the NNPC’s Port Harcourt Refinery Company. They have an existing 84-megawatt power capacity that is wasting away: a thermal plant. Built for NNPC, though NNPC is not consuming up to 20 megawatts. We have 60 megawatts of power stranded in that location inside Port Harcourt, and Port Harcourt Disco is complaining of a lack of supply of energy from the grid. Meanwhile, there is a wasted asset. And by extension, it is not just 84 megawatts that is wasted; they have an additional potential of 120 megawatts to be constructed using the same facility, that is 200 megawatts. So who says this country is not rich? Who says we don’t have potential? But are we realising these potentials? We are just being complacent, lazy and carefree. And that is how it is littered all over the country. I just gave you two examples,” Adelabu said.

The minister added his team would be visiting more stranded power locations across the country “to show the world that Nigeria has the resources to be a leader in the power sector.”

“With this new Electricity Act of 2023, states can now generate, transmit, and distribute power. They are like sovereigns. So the subnationals must take the bull by the horn and light up their states,” he advised.

He assured investors that government policies now favour private capital and long-term investment in the power sector.

“Our market fundamentals are improving, and our policy environment is clear. The national leadership is committed to creating the enabling conditions for innovation and investment. As minister, I am personally involved in generation, transmission, and distribution. I know where the shoe pinches, and I know the steps we must take,” Adelabu said.

Urging participants at the conference to act decisively, he added, “Let’s think boldly, collaborate strategically, and invest with purpose. Together, through sustained investment and forward-thinking innovation, we can light up Nigeria and build an energy-secure future.”",https://cdn.punchng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/19091912/Adebayo-Adelabu.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 07:59:03.910340

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn’t easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/11/6906250e182ec8.68329809.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-02 10:19:13.940034

Attorneys general from Nebraska and South Dakota joined Bird in signing the letter, which calls on federal officials to ""restore integrity"" to the renewable fuels program.
The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association applauded Bird.","Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird has asked the U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies to investigate whether some oil companies are improperly benefiting from exemptions under the Renewable Fuel Standard program meant for small refiners facing economic hardship.

In a letter sent Wednesday to the Justice Department, Department of Energy, Environmental Protection Agency, and Securities and Exchange Commission, Bird said some refineries may be ""gaming the system"" to receive small refinery exemptions while simultaneously reporting strong profits to investors.

The RFS requires refiners to blend renewable fuels such as ethanol into their products or buy compliance credits. Bird said some companies appear to have manipulated production to remain under the 75,000-barrel-per-day cap that qualifies them for exemptions, and have made public filings touting record profits and stock buybacks — claims she said are inconsistent with assertions of financial hardship.

""Renewable fuels are part of the backbone of Iowa's economy,"" Bird said in a statement. ""The possibility that refineries are gaming the system to receive government handouts when they don't need them hurts Iowa farmers.""

Bird, in the letter, said the RFS program ""plays a critical role in setting the demand for renewable liquid fuels and the agricultural feedstocks necessary for such fuels — both of which are critical to the economic prosperity of Iowa and surrounding States.""

Attorneys general from Nebraska and South Dakota joined Bird in signing the letter, which calls on federal officials to ""restore integrity"" to the renewable fuels program.

The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association applauded Bird.

""In a time when crop prices are low and increased biofuels usage is a key solution, it is deeply troubling to see what appears to be an attempt by some oil refiners to game the system and avoid their legal requirements under the RFS,"" Executive Director Monte Shaw said in a statement.

Iowa Biodiesel Board warns of losses, urges quick EPA action

Meanwhile, the Iowa Biodiesel Board submitted formal comments to the EPA urging the agency to swiftly finalize the 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard rule and to fully reallocate nearly 200 small refinery exemptions. The group warned that failure to act could cost U.S. soybean farmers $3.2 billion to $7.5 billion in crop value over the next two years, citing data from the World Agricultural and Economic Environmental Services model.

""U.S. biomass-based diesel adds value to every acre of soybeans grown, accounting for roughly ten percent of each bushel's worth — a contribution that is especially vital this year as America's soybean farmers face record yields amid unpredictable global markets,"" Iowa Biodiesel Board Executive Director Grant Kimberley said in a statement.

The board said independent biodiesel producers in Iowa, lacking the financial reserves of larger competitors, are particularly vulnerable to prolonged regulatory uncertainty.

The board is calling on the EPA to:

Reallocate 100% of small refinery exemptions for 2023 through 2027Finalize Renewable Volume Obligations before the new compliance year beginsMaintain strong volume targets to ensure market certainty for farmers and producers.

Kimberley said the industry appreciates the EPA's recognition of expanded production capacity but stressed that timely rulemaking is critical as Iowa farmers already are making planting decisions for the next season.

Iowa's biodiesel industry supports 12,000 jobs and generates roughly $3.5 billion in economic activity. In 2024, the state's 10 biodiesel plants produced an estimated 350 million gallons, making Iowa the nation's top biodiesel-producing state.

Feenstra backs strong biofuel volumes and reallocation

Also, Iowa U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Hull, led a bipartisan letter — signed by 49 members of Congress — to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin expressing strong support for the agency's proposed Renewable Volume Obligations under the RFS. The lawmakers urged the EPA to reallocate 100% of waived gallons from any granted small refinery exemptions and to finalize the rule as quickly as possible.

""A final, timely … rule that includes strong RVOs and necessary reallocation represents the most meaningful commitment to farmers and rural communities, homegrown American energy, and affordability for consumers,"" Feenstra said in a statement.

Feenstra, who earlier this week formally announced he is running for Iowa governor in 2026, was joined in the effort by the rest of Iowa's all-Republican congressional delegation.

In September, the EPA issued a supplemental proposal considering proposed levels of reallocation for small refinery exemptions — a key issue for Midwestern lawmakers and biofuel producers seeking market stability and fairness in implementation of the RFS.

Medicare changes ahead as open enrollment begins

With the Medicare open enrollment period underway through Dec. 7, thousands of Iowans are reviewing their options amid significant changes.

According to the Iowa Insurance Division's Senior Health Insurance Information Program, major adjustments in plan offerings, drug coverage and provider networks are expected in 2026 after new federal drug pricing reforms and the 2025 cap on prescription co-payments.

The federal health insurance program provides coverage for people 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain disabilities or health conditions.

Among the biggest changes this year:

Plan cancellations: UnitedHealthcare is canceling eight of its 10 AARP Medicare Advantage plans in Iowa, affecting about 36,500 enrollees. Wellmark is ending three of four plans with drug coverage. Beneficiaries in canceled plans must select a new plan by Jan. 1 to avoid losing coverage.Reduced service areas: 22 other Medicare Advantage plans have shrunk their geographic coverage, meaning some Iowans' plans may no longer be available in their county.Provider network changes: Several large health systems have adjusted which Medicare Advantage plans they accept, making it critical for members to confirm their providers remain in-network.Lower drug costs: Negotiated price reductions are taking effect for 10 high-cost drugs — Eliquis, Jardiance, Xarelto, Januvia, Farxiga, Entresto, Enbrel, Imbruvica, Stelara and Novolog/Fiasp — though costs will vary by plan.

Kristin Griffith, SHIIP and Senior Medicare Patrol director, urged Iowans to act quickly if their plan is ending or no longer offered in their area. Beneficiaries in those situations have guaranteed issue rights, allowing them to switch to another Medicare Advantage plan or return to Original Medicare and buy a Medicare supplement without medical underwriting or higher premiums — but only until Feb. 28.

""It is time individuals on Medicare to read all mail from their plan or provider and stay informed of possible changes,"" the Iowa Insurance Division said in a news release.

If a Medicare beneficiary receives notice that their plan has been canceled or is no longer offered in their ZIP code, ""that letter is the proof required to secure the guaranteed issue right to enroll in a Medicare Supplement,"" according to the Insurance Division.

Last year, SHIIP-SMP helped more than 52,000 Iowans and saved clients tens of millions of dollars, according to the Insurance Division.

The deal, finalized on October 13, 2025, provides a substantial boost to the continent's ambitions of establishing a self-sufficient lithium supply chain, moving away from its current import dependency.

The multi-year contract with Glencore represents a significant commercial achievement for Vulcan Energy. Under the terms of the agreement, the company will supply between 36,000 and 44,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide monohydrate from its Lionheart Project over an eight-year period. This partnership elevates the Swiss resource giant to the status of Vulcan Energy's fourth major industrial customer, joining existing partners Stellantis, LG Energy Solution, and Umicore.

Beyond the immediate revenue stream, this collaboration provides Vulcan Energy with crucial long-term visibility necessary for securing project financing. The commitment from a global industry leader like Glencore serves as a powerful endorsement of the company's innovative approach to lithium extraction. The Lionheart Project is designed for an annual production capacity of 24,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide—sufficient to power approximately half a million electric vehicles each year.

Accelerating Commercial Development

Vulcan Energy is rapidly advancing its transition from development to full-scale production. The company has demonstrated this progress through a series of strategic capital commitments, including awarding a €140 million contract to JordProxa for plant engineering. Concurrently, agreements have been finalized with Turboden and ROM Technik for the construction of geothermal power plants.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Vulcan Energy?

These investments support the company's groundbreaking methodology, which centers on its Direct Lithium Extraction technology. This process utilizes geothermal energy derived from thermal brine, operating without freshwater consumption and achieving a zero-carbon emission footprint.

Addressing Europe's Critical Supply Gap

The strategic importance of Vulcan Energy's project is underscored by Europe's current lithium supply dynamics. The continent presently imports between 97% and 99% of its lithium requirements, creating a strategic vulnerability amid growing geopolitical tensions. Domestic production from sources like Vulcan Energy could fundamentally alter this landscape.

European battery gigafactories are projected to reach a combined capacity exceeding 700 GWh by 2030, creating annual demand for 150,000 to 200,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. Vulcan Energy's local production offers substantial logistical advantages, eliminating transport costs exceeding $1,000 per tonne typically associated with shipments from South America while simultaneously enhancing supply chain reliability and flexibility.

With a planned funding round scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2025, Vulcan Energy is positioning itself to establish the foundation for commercial production commencing in 2028.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2372986_600_800.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 11:19:03.923272

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has approved final authorization for the Venture Global CP2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, allowing exports of up to 3.96 billion cubic feet per day to countries without free trade agreements. The decision follows earlier approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and supports a broader federal effort to increase domestic energy production and export capacity.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Assistant Secretary Kyle Haustveit of the Office of Fossil Energy stated the project would provide reliable energy to global partners while supporting job creation and infrastructure development in the U.S.

“In less than ten months, President Trump’s administration is redefining what it means to unleash American energy by approving record new LNG exports,” said Assistant Secretary Haustveit. “Finalizing the non-FTA authorization for CP2 LNG will enable secure and reliable American energy access for our allies and trading partners, while also providing well-paid jobs and economic opportunities at home.”

The authorization is a step in expanding LNG exports since the federal government resumed processing applications for non-free-trade-agreement (FTA) countries. Current U.S. LNG exports average about 15 billion cubic feet per day, reflecting continued growth in the sector.

While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears.","Swords or ploughshares?

That’s the dilemma that has plagued us since the sudden dawn of the nuclear age. Should we split atoms for peace or to rain destruction on our enemies? In the space of a single human life we’ve done both, killing hundreds of thousands in two atomic bomb attacks on Japan and then building nuclear reactors to provide light, power and medicine.

Radioactivity was discovered just more than a century ago, when Wilhelm Roentgen detected X-rays. In high school textbooks, most of us saw the ghostly radiograph of his wife Anna’s skeletal hand with wedding band, “Hand mit Ringen.” The image — the first X-ray — prompted Anna to remark, “I have seen my own death.” In 1913, science fiction writer H.G. Wells predicted both nuclear power and weaponry, in “The World Set Free.” In 1938, the trio of Hahn, Meitner, and Strassmann were first to recognize that uranium atoms split when bombarded by neutrons. When physicist Leo Szilard confirmed fission, according to author Edward A. Friedman, he said ”the world was headed for sorrow.”

In 1939, Szilard and Albert Einstein sent a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt advising that fission could be used to create a powerful new bomb. The scientists feared the Nazis were already working on such a device, and their letter helped spur creation of the secret Manhattan Project, which eventually resulted to the test firing of the first atomic bomb in a remote part of New Mexico in 1945. Three weeks later came the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.

The Cold War began shortly after, and by 1949 our former allies, the Soviets, had their own nuclear weapon, too.

Later we created nuclear weapons stockpiles ready to kill hundreds of millions more and built dozens of nuclear generating plants to provide about 20% of the American electrical supply. One of those plants, Wolf Creek, owned by two regional utilities, has been online in Kansas since 1985.

Now comes a firm founded by one of the world’s richest men, Bill Gates, with the lure of bringing “advanced” nuclear power to Kansas. TerraPower announced a partnership last month with the state’s Department of Commerce and Evergy, one of the owners of Wolf Creek, to explore placing a natrium reactor somewhere in the utility’s service area of eastern Kansas.

TerraPower is already building a $4 billion pilot natrium reactor site in Wyoming, with half of the funding from the US Department of Energy. Some of the projected energy may power AI data centers. The company promises clean and safe power through its innovative technology, which uses molten salt (natrium is Latin for sodium) to cool the 345-megawatt reactor instead of water, as is done at Wolf Creek and every other commercial nuclear plant in the U.S.

A few Kansas communities in Evergy country have already tossed their hardhats in the ring to host the natrium reactor, including my home city of Emporia. The city commission, along with the county board and a regional development association, signed a letter of support for the project. Commissioners in Coffey County, home to the Wolf Creek plant, have also expressed interest, as have officials in Hutchinson.

TerraPower claims it will only place reactors where they are wanted, but there’s not been time for any substantive public discussion yet on the issue. Nobody asked Kansans whether we want a second nuclear plant or not. Another firm, Deep Fission, is working with an undisclosed partner to place reactors at the bottom of mile-deep holes in Kansas to supply power-hungry AI centers, but it’s not answering questions about details or whether it has sought state approval.

The gold rush for new nuclear is on.

We are, according to current U.S. policy, on the verge of a “new nuclear renaissance.” Old fears spawned by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Three Mile Island and Chernobyl are receding in popular memory. There is now public and bipartisan support for expanding nuclear power, according to a Pew Research Center poll.

It is understandable why leaders in a community like Emporia — which logged the state’s highest unemployment following the closure of Tyson meats — would find TerraPower’s projected 1,500 construction and 500 permanent jobs attractive.

But those vying to bring TerraPower jobs to their communities might want to cool their enthusiasm long enough to consider the safety and security risks presented by natrium reactors.

These risks were described to me by Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy group. Lyman is an expert on nuclear proliferation, terrorism, and safety and security. He’s also one of the authors of “Fukishima: The Story of a Nuclear Disaster.”

“I have signifcant concerns,” Lyman said, “related to safety and security as well as for the economics. … It’s inexplicable to me why there’s so much enthusiasm for this type of reactor.”

When I spoke with Lyman on Tuesday, he’d just finished monitoring a multi-day Nuclear Regulatory Commission advisory committee meeting reviewing the preliminary safeguard assessment of the TerraPower’s Wyoming reactor.

It is important to note that TerraPower refused my repeated requests for an interview. “TerraPower will have to politely decline participation in this opportunity at this time,” public relations specialist Brooke Leader said on behalf of the firm.

The problems with the natrium reactor, Lyman said, are inherent in the design of any sodium-cooled reactor. The molten sodium bursts into flame upon contact with air or water, he said, and these types of reactors have historically been expensive to build and prone to leaks. But, he said, the most worrying thing about the natrium reactor is that it uses fuel enriched to up to 20% of the isotope Uranium 235. This fuel is called HALEU, for high assay low enrichment uranium, and it’s just below the threshold for weapons-grade material.

Conventional nuclear reactors use fuel that is between 3 and 5% enriched.

Natrium reactors require HALEU to make them smaller and more efficient, Lyman said, but there is no domestic source of this fuel available in the quantities needed. In addition, security at natrium reactors would have to be beefed up compared with conventional reactors, because HALEU is attractive to terrorists and rogue states. Enriching uranium to 20% represents most of the effort required to make weapons-grade material.

In addition, there’s the problem — inherent with every reactor currently operating or planned in the United States — that there’s no long-term storage solution for spent fuel. Work on the Yucca Mountain geologic repository was halted in 2010. All waste is stored on-site, in cooling ponds and dry casks. It will remain hazardous for much longer than there has been recorded history — tens of thousands of years.

We can’t even keep the government running year-round or provide reliable food and health care to our poorest Americans. How can we expect to keep the distant future safe from us?

The immediate risk with a natrium reactor, Lyman said, is fire.

Molten sodium “is a highly reactive material, so you have to keep it away from the air and water at all costs,” Lyman said, “or you could end up with a sodium fire. And having a nuclear reactor where the coolant itself can catch on fire just sounds like a bad idea. It really is. So they have to go to extraordinary lengths to prevent any exposure of the coolant to air or water.”

This adds a level of unneeded complexity, he said. Even though TerraPower claims that natrium reactors are safer than light water-cooled reactors, Lyman said just the opposite is true. The time to respond to accidents is much shorter, he said, and there is no containment structure — the familiar dome-shaped vessel — as additional backup to contain leaks.

“The Department of Energy is trying, with Congress’s help, to stimulate and stand up a whole production program for this kind of (HALEU) material,” Lyman said. “But the demand is very unclear. The investments are on the order of billions and billions of dollars for an infrastructure to make this fuel. It’s a risky proposition, and it’s not clear that TerraPower is going to have the amount of fuel it needs just for the first plant.”

Because TerraPower would not speak to me, I will rely on author Edward A. Friedman, in his 2025 book “Nuclear Energy: boom, Bust, and Emerging Renaissance,” to make the case for next generation reactor technology.

“The promise for successful realization of (advanced) technology was significantly enhanced with the groundbreaking of the TerraPower sodium-cooled natrium reactor,” Friedman writes. Bills Gates’s company, TerraPower, began construction June 10, 2024, at Kemmerer, Wyoming, “of the natrium fast-neutron, liquid sodium-cooled reactor (SFR) that uses an associated liquid salt storage system. This fail-safe, small modular reactor (SMR) will be the first model in the world for cost-effective replacement of a coal-fired power plant with a nuclear reactor.”

The reactor is expected to become operational in 2030.

Gates hopes for hundreds of coal-to-nuclear transformations in the future, according to Friedman. Indeed, the vision of replacing fossil fuel that drove Gates to found TerraPower in the first place.

“There’s no scenario in which we keep adding carbon to the atmosphere and the world stops getting hotter,” Gates wrote in his 2021 book, “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”

“The hotter it gets, the harder it will be for humans to survive, much less thrive,” Gates wrote.

Nuclear is the only carbon-free energy source, he said, that can reliably deliver power day and night through any type of weather on a large scale. It’s also one of the few practical ways to bring electricity to the poorest of countries, such as those found in sub-Saharan Africa. Access to energy is highly correlated to wealth and happiness.

“It’s no secret that nuclear power has its problems,” Gates wrote. “It’s very expensive to build today. Human error can cause accidents. Uranium, the fuel it uses, can be converted for use in weapons. The waste is dangerous and hard to store.”

Yet, nuclear represented our best hope of stopping global warming, he claimed. There was nothing more important than halting the rise in temperature if we were to avoid catastrophe.

Recently, Gates has changed his tune on climate.

In a memo to COP30, the United Nations climate change conference scheduled for next week in Brazil, Gates abandoned his previous “net zero” views. He criticized “doomsday” climate scenarios and suggested that people will be able to “live and thrive” in most places on Earth for the foreseeable future. It’s time to put “human welfare” at the center of climate strategies and improving agriculture and health in the poorest countries.

“Climate change is a serious problem,” he said, “but it will not be the end of civilization.”

The memo sounds like nothing short of a retreat from climate activism from a man who had spent personal billions on a quest for net zero. In the case of his push for advanced reactors, Gates may have been so driven by his desire to stop global warming that he swallowed the nuclear pill.

His sudden redirection must be having some effect on TerraPower, the company he founded. But his memo will have no effect on the U.S. delegation to COP30, because there will be no official American presence there. Donald Trump had already pulled the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. The world has now blown past the agreement’s 1.5 degree Celsius limit on global warming, with more climate suffering to follow.

Trump recently directed the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing, something we haven’t done since 1992. There is not yet a name for this arms race, but it is on as surely as the seas are rising. I am reminded of Damocles from Greek mythology, who was taught the dangers of power by the sword dangling above. So let us call this the Age of Damocles, because nothing is happy for those wracked by anxiety.

It is no coincidence that we embrace a new arms race at the same moment we accelerate the regulatory process to approve and deploy new types of nuclear reactors that use disturbingly enriched fuel. While nuclear proponents like Friedman dismiss opposition to nuclear power as an artifact of the Cold War and media misinformation, there were reasons for those fears. Troubling issues remain.

Opposition to nuclear power that curbed the U.S. nuclear power program from the 1980s until recently was based not only on fictional movies like 1979’s “The China Syndrome” but in real-life accidents like Fukishima in 2011, in which an earthquake and tsunami shut down the power grid and made it impossible to cool the reactors. More recently, Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia in Ukraine, has caused alarm because it’s been damaged and sometimes cut off in the ongoing war with Russia. Movies that might contain some inaccuracies, such as the 2019 HBO miniseries “Chernobyl,” are not causes of our nuclear jitters but expressions of them.

This is the global context in which we find ourselves pondering whether a new type of nuclear energy is good for Kansas or just a costly experiment that will risk accident or murderous mayhem. We live in a new period of global instability, one driven by all the old forces — greed, ignorance, haste, denial — that have plagued us since the ice receded. The communications from TerraPower have been carefully curated to present a sanitized version of a techno billionaire philanthropist’s dream of a nuclear renaissance.

I’m cold to the idea of spending billions on nuke plants to power, in large part, electricity-hungry AI data centers. It seems immoral when so many Americans go hungry and are without health insurance. Beyond that, there’s just too many unanswered questions about next-generation reactors.

But I’m opposed to the TerraPower plan for a natrium reactor in Kansas not because of the unknowns — where, how much, how long? — but because of what we do know. The HALEU fuel, in the amounts needed, presents an unacceptable risk of nuclear proliferation.

Read our updated Tesla's Growth Dilemma analysis...","Tesla has finally delivered what investors have been anxiously awaiting: a return to revenue growth. However, this achievement comes with significant consequences that are brutally evident in the company's compressed profit margins. As vehicle deliveries climb following three consecutive quarters of decline, profitability is deteriorating rapidly. Market observers are now questioning whether Tesla is essentially purchasing its growth through aggressive discounting strategies.

Profitability Under Severe Pressure

The electric vehicle manufacturer's financial health shows a troubling divergence between top-line performance and bottom-line results. While revenues are expanding, earnings are contracting dramatically. Tesla's net income plummeted by approximately $1 billion, with earnings per share collapsing by 37 percent. The operating margin witnessed an alarming contraction, falling from 10.8 percent to just 5.8 percent.

Several key factors contributed to this margin erosion:

* Intensifying competitive pressures are forcing continuous price reductions

* Rising administrative expenses are creating additional margin pressure

* Tariff-related costs totaling $400 million negatively impacted financial performance

The market response was immediate and telling. Following the earnings release, Tesla shares initially dropped by five percent before staging a partial recovery.

Revenue Resurgence with Hidden Costs

Breaking a three-quarter streak of disappointing results, Tesla reported encouraging revenue growth. The company posted an 11.6 percent year-over-year increase, with total revenue reaching $28.09 billion, exceeding Wall Street's projections. This sudden reversal was primarily fueled by a buying surge in the United States, where customers rushed to take advantage of expiring government incentives for electric vehicles.

Diverging Business Segments

Tesla's current story reveals two distinctly different operational realities. While the core automotive business struggles with severe margin compression, another division is experiencing remarkable success. The energy storage segment reported revenue growth of nearly 50 percent, continuing its impressive performance trajectory. Demand for Tesla's battery technology is booming, with this business unit operating at peak efficiency.

During the earnings presentation, CEO Elon Musk redirected attention toward future initiatives, particularly highlighting the humanoid ""Optimus"" robot and other long-term visions. This forward-looking focus has left some investors concerned about present-day challenges. With government tax credits phasing out and the core automotive business facing headwinds, stakeholders are questioning when management will address the company's immediate strategic needs.

Now, with Scotland set to supply the three quarters of Britain’s onshore wind power, some fear history could repeat itself.","In other words, if the wind is blowing strongly across all turbines, Scotland could generate enough electricity to supply over 70% of Britain’s total onshore wind power needs.

There are now calls to ban further onshore wind farms fearing it is being used to power the UK's green revolution while seeing little reward.

Some critics warn that Scotland’s rapid expansion of wind power for export could be a repeat of the oil experience, when billions of pounds of North Sea oil wealth largely flowed south instead of benefiting local communities.

Government data suggests that the nation produced about a third of the UK's onshore wind power needs last year.

To manage that power surge, Scotland's energy storage capacity is to be ramped up and would become the highest of any of the ten regions of the UK - with 7.5GW out of 27GW across Britain by 2030. According to Renewable UK, the UK has more than 6.8GW of storage with 16% (1.09GW) in Scotland.

The huge batteries are needed because wind power is not constant and they store excess energy when the wind blows, and release it back into the grid when it does not.

But NESO has also indicated more action was needed to expand green power.

In the 1970s and 1980s, Scotland produced a huge share of Britain’s oil, yet much of the economic gain went to companies and the UK Treasury rather than staying in the country.

The loss of control over this “black gold” sparked widespread frustration and became a rallying point for Scottish nationalism. Alba leader and fair energy prices campaigner Kenny MacAskill has accused the UK Government of exploiting Scotland’s natural resources and called for a ban on further onshore wind farms.

""This confirms why Scotland is so vital to the UK economy. It is Scottish renewable energy which is to fuel power and heat it,"" he said.

""It is clear that Scotland is just a resource to be exploited. Our energy taken, no revenues given and few jobs and businesses provided, all whilst our environment is trashed.

""Basically we're supplying the south. The time has come for a moratorium on further onshore wind, other than small scale community owned ones. Enough is enough.""

It comes as a frightening energy debt mountain is gripping the nation, with total unpaid bills set to hit £4.43 billion by the end of June — nearly triple the 2019 figure of £1.55 billion.

The most vulnerable Scots alone are estimated to owe over £400 million, which has prompted calls for government action.

Analysis from regulator Ofgem shows debt has surged by almost £1 billion in the past year alone, leaving households reeling amid the ongoing cost-of-living crisis.

Under the energy bills price cap set by regulator Ofgem, which limits how much suppliers can charge households per unit of gas and electricity, the average annual bill is £1,755. Despite the cap, this is still over 50% higher than four years ago.

Frazer Scott, chief executive of Energy Action Scotland said: ""Energy is an essential requirement and consumers are most concerned about affordability and security of supply to their homes and business.

""It isn’t working in the favour of consumers, mounting debt, more time off supply for those on prepayment meters and 1 in 3 in fuel poverty. It is time to think differently, to at least have an honest debate about the future and how we can reconcile targets for fuel poverty and net zero.""

Meanwhile, the Herald revealed that households have been landed with a £6.6 billion bill to pay energy firms — mostly Scottish wind farms — for switching off because the grid cannot handle all the green power being generated.

The amount of so-called constraint payments reached £1.7 billion in 2024/25, more than four times higher than five years ago, with £1.2 billion (70%) going to Scottish turbines.

NESO has set out the road map for wind power in Scotland in an analysis of the UK Government’s Clean Power 2030 plan which sets targets for how much clean energy should be built across Britain by 2030. And the grid operator has broken down what Scotland, needs to deliver to hit these national goals.

In Scotland, this means a big increase in renewable energy projects, especially battery storage and land-based turbine sites, along with some new solar developments. But they say hitting those goals will require careful planning, stronger electricity networks, investment in local supply chains, and support from communities that will host the projects.

The analysis sees Scotland as a ""significant resource for renewables, but its large pipeline of energy projects are limited in part due to the unique geography and rural grid"". It stated: ""Scotland needs greater investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure to support the development of renewables which can facilitate decarbonisation and new industrial activity. ""It also requires strategic planning of generation, storage and demand...""

It added: ""We are committed to engaging closely and collaboratively with customers and stakeholders across Scotland to understand its unique and varied context.""

It states that their regional energy planning team in Scotland was working with the Scottish Government , local authorities and industry to help ensure Scotland ""responds to local and national ambitions"".

The perception that Scotland was being exploited for its resources helped fuel the rise of the Scottish National Party, which campaigned for greater autonomy and eventually independence.

Now, with Scotland set to supply the three quarters of Britain’s onshore wind power, some fear history could repeat itself.

They argue that the country could again become a supplier of energy wealth with limited local benefit, while households and industries south of the border reap the rewards of Scotland’s turbines.

Mr MacAskill, the former SNP justice secretary added: ""We're to be England's giant onshore wind farm but getting nothing in return. The pylons running from the north down the east coast and through the central borders are simply to power England.

""This all confirms that Scotland has received a second great energy bounty. First it was oil and gas and now its renewables. The wealth of Norway has passed us by but the benefit of North Sea oil must still be pursued and used for Scotland's benefit.

""But equally the old adage of fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me applies. We must ensure that the wind resource isn't taken from us for a song with our land and people losing out. Lessons must be learned. It cannot be allowed that Scotland is energy rich, yet Scots are fuel poor.

""It's why there should be no more onshore [wind farms] at the moment. Its simply a bonanza for developers with the price paid by consumers and the Scottish environment.""

It comes just three months after a “once in a generation” movement of 53 community councils called for a summit with UK and Scottish energy ministers to pause new energy projects in Scotland’s most scenic areas.

They say they are being overwhelmed by a “barrage” of over 700 renewable energy applications in the Highlands alone, including wind, hydro, storage, and transmission projects, many backed by well-funded overseas developers.

The councils want an inquiry into the cumulative impact on communities and landscapes, warning that unchecked development could override local democracy and accelerate depopulation.

Highland Conservative councillor Helen Crawford, who was a key convention organiser, is now planning to stand in the 2026 Scottish Parliamentary Elections in the deputy first minister Kate Forbes; seat of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch because she felt ""so strongly about the pylon disaster"" and it might provided a ""decent shot at getting the pause"".

The UK Government said that energy firms were pouring billions into Scotland’s green infrastructure, with SSEN Transmission planning up to £31.7bn in upgrades by 2031 and Scottish Power investing £12bn in new transmission networks, supporting thousands of jobs.

Major offshore projects like Cerulean Winds’ £10.9bn Aspen scheme, Berwick Bank, and Green Volt were set to create thousands more roles while the Acorn project in Aberdeen was expected to generate around 15,000 jobs.

A UK Department of for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesman said: 'Our mission to make the UK a clean energy superpower will unlock economic opportunity for Scotland.

“Our landmark Clean Energy Jobs Plan will deliver up to 40,000 new jobs in Scotland by 2030, creating the next generation of skilled roles.

""Clean energy will bring growth and investment.

""We are getting Scotland off the rollercoaster fossil fuel markets and onto clean, homegrown power we control to bring energy security, lower bills and good jobs.""",https://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/20021787.jpg?type=og-image,N,,2025-11-02 04:17:36.667196

How has Infosys used AI to support the energy sector?
When done right, it becomes a major driver for long-term value in the energy sector and across industries.","The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow.

This simple reality has long posed challenges for energy companies trying to integrate renewable power into their grids.

Now AI is emerging as a potential solution to manage the intermittent nature of wind and solar generation.

Ashiss Kumar Dash, EVP and Global Head Services, Utilities, Resources, Energy and Enterprise Sustainability at Infosys, says AI can help generate more reliable renewable energy output through better weather forecasting and grid management.

But he also stresses that the technology must be deployed responsibly.

Infosys has already worked on more than 60 AI projects in the energy sector, including a deployment for a major North American utility that improved load forecasting accuracy to 95% and saved tens of millions of dollars in infrastructure investment.

How can AI impact the energy sector?

AI offers incredible possibilities to modernise and improve the energy sector. The energy sector is asset heavy. AI makes these assets intelligent and self-learning. Whether it’s optimising operations, enabling data-informed decisions or predicting equipment failures before they happen, AI offers significant promise in helping energy companies run smarter and more efficiently. AI will open doors for renewables as well, allowing companies to forecast weather patterns better and generate more reliable wind and solar output.

On the side of operations, it powers predictive maintenance and reduces downtime for heavy infrastructure. One of the challenges in the rapidly changing energy sector is grid modelling and design; AI is tremendously helpful in this complex area.

We’re also seeing Gen AI come into play, responding to design questions, ensuring safety in the field, automating reports, answering customer inquiries through virtual agents and even helping engineers simulate new designs through digital twin technologies. AI enables energy companies to balance sustainability with performance, while staying ahead in a transforming regulatory and market environment.

What goes into an AI strategy?

I believe there should not be a separate “AI strategy”. AI should be the business strategy in this sector. A strong AI strategy is really about building a scalable, sustainable foundation that works across the entire organisation. At Infosys, we approach this through five key pillars:

Tech Incubation – Trying out new tools and ideas to solve real-world energy problems.

Building the Platform and Ecosystem – Making sure the data, infrastructure and integrations are solid.

Responsible AI – Setting guardrails for fairness, transparency and compliance from the start.

Focusing on the Right Use Cases – Prioritising projects that offer clear value and ROI. This could mean reducing downtime, streamlining supply chains or cutting costs through automation.

Reusable Solutions Across Teams – Creating templates and models that can be adapted across all functions – engineering, finance, HR, legal and beyond.

Beyond these pillars, successful AI deployment comes from how well the strategy is executed and embedded into day-to-day operations. That’s why we establish dedicated “strategy and execution pods” to bring together the right mix of tech, domain and business expertise. These teams don’t just plan; they also build, test and scale solutions quickly.

And because AI is constantly evolving, we treat the strategy as a living framework—one that can adapt to new regulations, technologies and market shifts. The goal is to ensure AI delivers real, measurable impact while staying aligned with both the company’s values and its long-term vision.

How has Infosys used AI to support the energy sector?

One great example is our work with a major utility company in North America where we deployed AI models to perform on-demand, bottom-up, long-term grid forecasting and enable smart decision making on capital spend and unplanned outages. The first-of-its-kind solution used open-source ML models, a CIM utility model and scalable cloud architecture to provide significant business benefits to the client:

Improving load forecasting accuracy to 95%.

Savings of tens of millions (USD) in electrical infrastructure investment by transitioning out from “annual peak load” and reduced unplanned outage to <1% from previous >5-10%. This was primarily because of efficient and proactive grid investments or upgrade in precise grid areas of electrical infrastructure.

Forecast “At Will” - anytime, anywhere – for any forecast horizon (10 years for DSP, 15 years scenario study, 22 years for 2045 study).

Faster processing within twenty-four hours for 650K transformers compared to 85 hours for 6,500 assets (i.e. 25 times faster while using 100 times more nodes.)

High agility - more agile response to emerging regulatory needs.

Similarly, we have more than 60 AI projects driving remarkable transformation across the energy sector.

What can businesses do to ensure ethical and compliant AI deployment?

Responsible AI is absolutely essential in an age where technological advancement has grown in intelligence, use and popularity like never before. Companies need to make sure their AI systems are fair, transparent and compliant with industry standards, values and regulations.

To get it right, businesses need to put strong governance in place to oversee how AI is built and used, making sure it aligns with governing regulations, guardrails and ethical standards. It’s important to embed responsible practices from the start, thinking about fairness, transparency and bias before any model goes live.

Regular monitoring helps catch performance drifts or unintended outcomes and involving cross-functional teams, like legal, HR and compliance, ensures diverse perspectives are part of the process. Just as important is educating employees on how AI works and the risks involved, so they feel empowered to use it responsibly.

Infosys views responsible AI as a way to build trust while advancing innovation, performance and efficiency.

But both paths are proving difficult. Without representation, they remain outside key policy discussions, financing frameworks, and subsidy programs that could shape their future.

Startups like Montra Electric, AutoNxt, and ShreeMarut have been developing electric tractors aimed at reducing emissions and fuel costs in agriculture. Yet, as they look to expand production, the absence of a collective industry voice has become a serious handicap.

The lack of association backing also makes financing difficult. Without an institutional framework or recognized body to interface with lenders, startups say banks are hesitant to finance electric tractor purchases.

""Not a single bank has said they will finance an e-tractor,"" said one founder on a condition of anonymity. ""They finance every other electric vehicle, but not tractors yet.""

Experts say that from the perspective of lenders and policymakers, the segment remains too small and untested. ""Financing institutions rely on data and scale,"" said an industry expert. ""A formal association could help generate that data and bridge trust between startups and regulators.""

""Joining the Tractor Manufacturers’ Association (TMA) is essential,"" said one founder. ""Without it, startups have no access to policy discussions or financing networks. But the entry conditions make it nearly impossible.""

The TMA, which represents India’s major tractor manufacturers such as Escorts Kubota, Sonalika, and John Deere, requires companies to have at least ten years of operational history, a source revealed. Most electric tractor firms are only a few years old.

""A startup will die for sure, if not today, then tomorrow,"" said an industry source. ""The TMA’s rule is that a company must be ten years old. The government’s rule is that there should be at least seven companies to form an association.""

TMA did not respond to Autocar Professional’s queries at the time of publishing.

The government allows new industry associations to be formed if at least seven registered members apply together — a requirement that, in a young sector with only a handful of active players, is proving hard to meet.

""Are startups capable of organizing that many events and initiatives? Forming and promoting an association needs money too,"" said another founder.

Industry insiders say the lack of formal representation is one reason electric tractors remain outside subsidy programs. The PM-eDrive scheme, a revised version of FAME, currently supports electric two-wheelers, buses, and ambulances, but not tractors.

""Policy inclusion usually follows when there’s an organized body pushing for it,"" said a source familiar with the matter. ""Right now, e-tractor startups don’t have that collective lobbying power.""

For now, the electric tractor industry remains fragmented with a few innovators trying to establish themselves while struggling for a collective identity.

""The technology is ready, but the ecosystem isn’t,"" said a founder.

A two-headed wind turbine that is nothing like the wind turbines we have seen traditionally. It is a striking sight, but more impressive than that is the 10 megawatts of power it can generate. The two turbines catch the wind above the waves, which has made this turbine yield a high efficiency.

How a floating wind turbine could change the clean energy game

The Dounreay Tri Floating Wind Demonstration is a step in the right direction. Scotland is investing a lot in offshore wind energy projects. This wind turbine is not anchored to the bottom, as is the case with most wind turbines in water. This one floats. Two turbines share a floating platform, which makes the whole setup look kind of like the famed cryptid beast, the Loch Ness Monster, as it floats on the waters, charged with the task of servicing power requirements with clean energy.

Dounreay Tri Ltd is responsible for its construction, and they have been supported in this endeavor in part by the Scottish government, with the added aid of private investors. This idea of a floating wind turbine has always been relished as these are less disruptive to marine life, but the journey in realizing this has been fraught with trial and error. This design is sure to shake things up.

What makes this floating wind turbine particularly special

The aerodynamics involved are where the true genius lies when it comes to this wind turbine. Wake loss is reduced, the effect when one turbine impedes the efficiency of another. These combine well together and create a vortex above the water with very little interference between the two turbines. The two turbines actually help each other out. Together, they create an effect where each one helps the other to spin at an effective rate.

This is a significant time for wind power, and this turbine could help usher in a new era for this kind of clean energy. Scotland is on the front lines of this with their two-headed “Loch Ness monster.”

Wind power in Scotland will never be the same again

Scotland would like to be able to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Perhaps this wind turbine could help. Scotland is windy, and the waters of its seas and lakes are known to be deep. Traditional wind turbines over water just won’t cut it in an environment like that. This two-headed turbine does make the grade. Each turbine is a 10 megawatt Vestas model floating on a platform. The turbine is kept secure by chains and cables.

Experts say this wind turbine could provide clean power for thousands of homes. The project has also helped from an economic standpoint as a lot of jobs have been made available because of it, with Orkney and Caithness being the major beneficiaries at the moment.

When this turbine goes live, real-world data will help shape the way forward

Once this project enters the next phase beyond testing, and real-world data is able to be examined, the design team will be able to further make adjustments and improve on what is already a brilliant idea. The world is watching as well, with companies from Norway, Japan, and America showing interest in the two-headed design. The costs it will save are a major drawcard, all while rendering 15% more power than the single-turret wind turbine.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DounreayTri_Hexicon_large-2017031712272828-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 05:18:53.516078
