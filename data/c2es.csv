The previous administration initiated this loan, which is still moving forward, enabling existing power lines to carry more power.

As TechCrunch reported, these new grid upgrades will improve electricity flow in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia. American Electric Power, the company that owns these power lines, will upgrade 5,000 miles of them in these states to improve energy transmission.

The power company plans to use new conductors to rewire the power lines. With the Department of Energy loan, the company can get a lower interest rate on the project and save at least $275 million. It said that these cost savings will ultimately benefit energy customers.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that the $1.6 billion loan will ""ensure lower electricity costs across the Midwestern region of the United States,"" per TechCrunch.

This power project stands out for its continued momentum, despite so many other energy projects being canceled under the Trump administration.

People living in states that will benefit from the project already have some of the lowest energy prices in the country. Meanwhile, other states' projects were abruptly eliminated, hindering their residents' access to affordable energy rates and perpetuating excess pollution in local communities.

Government support for clean energy solutions is critical to helping people live more sustainably while reducing environmental harm. Regulatory changes that support sustainable energy practices can have a profound impact on how much residents pay for electricity and on the amount of pollution released.

However, every time you reject dirty energy in favor of more sustainable power, you make an impact on your community.

For example, installing solar panels will help reduce your monthly energy costs and lower planet-overheating pollution where you live. To make solar installations more affordable, TCD has put together a Solar Explorer to get trusted quotes from vetted partners in your area, such as EnergySage and Palmetto, enabling you to save thousands of dollars.

When you power your home with clean energy from the sun, it's also more affordable to use other money-saving, planet-saving appliances, like heat pumps. When you're ready to find a heat pump that works with your budget, Mitsubishi can help.

In a Department of Energy statement, Wright said: ""This loan guarantee will not only help modernize the grid and expand transmission capacity but will help position the United States to win the AI [artificial intelligence] race and grow our manufacturing base.""

Here are some key insights and examples:

District Energy Systems

District energy systems, which provide centralized heating or cooling to multiple buildings, have sparked mixed opinions:

Efficiency and Practicality: Some Redditors believe that while district energy systems can be more efficient in dense urban areas, they might not be practical for less dense regions. ""In areas like Universities and cities with buildings close together and a higher density it could be worthwhile to look into since it is more energy efficient and saves cost over the long run.""

Control and Maintenance: Concerns about individual control over home temperatures and the reliability of centralized systems are common. ""If it means each household can’t control the temperature of their home at any given time, most Americans will likely not be supportive of that.""

Solar and Renewable Energy

Solar energy is frequently discussed, especially in the context of door-to-door sales and potential scams:

Door-to-Door Sales: Many Redditors warn about the aggressive and potentially misleading tactics of solar sales representatives. ""You promise to purchase power for the approximate cost of what the solar panels cost, except they own the solar panels and you're at their mercy if something breaks down.""

Scams: There are numerous reports of solar energy scams, where sales representatives misrepresent the benefits and costs of their programs. ""100% a solar scam""

Energy Efficiency Programs

State and local energy efficiency programs are also under scrutiny:

Skepticism: Some Redditors are skeptical about the authenticity and effectiveness of these programs. ""Yes it's a scam. There's no state program to 'weatherize homes'.""

High Energy Usage Flags: The idea of being flagged for high energy usage by a state program is often seen as a precursor to a sales pitch. ""The whole 'flagged for high energy usage' thing is complete bullshit.""

Innovative Storage Solutions

Energy storage solutions, such as sand batteries, are highlighted as promising technologies:

Sand Batteries: Finland’s deployment of the world’s largest sand battery is noted for its potential to store thermal energy efficiently. ""The massive 15-meter-wide system in Pornainen can store enough thermal energy to meet the town’s heating needs for an entire month during summer.""

Collaboration and Development

Collaboration between companies to bring innovative energy solutions to market is also a topic of interest:

Ascent Solar Technologies and NovaSpark Energy: Their agreement to combine lightweight solar technology with mobile hydrogen generation systems for drone powering and other applications is seen as a significant step. ""The agreement brings the two companies’ technologies together to achieve mutually beneficial goals.""

Community Efforts

Community-led initiatives to improve urban environments and energy efficiency are also celebrated:

Urban Compassion Project: This project’s efforts to clean up illegal dumping sites and provide support to unhoused individuals are seen as a positive example of community action. ""Since 2021, Urban Compassion Project has cleared over 3,000 tons of illegal dumping across the Bay Area, with most of our work centered in Oakland.""

Despite the drastic shift in the U.S. energy policy, energy majors are swiftly following the lead of the administration’s agenda.","On 4 July 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), representing a sweeping reset of the United States (U.S.) energy policy. The act drastically pares back the energy transition tax credits for wind and solar, made available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as amended, Code) and further extended or created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), while largely preserving those for clean energies and energy storage in the near future. Complex fiscal incentive rules are further complicated by far-reaching restrictions on foreign ownership and assistance (the so-called FEOC, or “foreign entity of concern”, requirements) that will reshape supply chains and financing across both renewable and clean energies. On the other hand, the OBBB presents clear wins for fossil fuels under a more permissive leasing and fiscal regime.

Incentives Rolled Back for Wind and Solar

The OBBB phases out the long-standing tax credits for wind and solar which were reinforced under the IRA regime, namely the clean electricity production credit under Section 45Y of the Code (Production Tax Credits) or the clean electricity investment credit under Section 48E of the Code (Investment Tax Credits). Under the OBBB, wind and solar projects may only retain eligibility for the Production and Investment Tax Credits if they begin construction before 5 July 2026 or are placed in service by 31 Dec. 2027. Developers are expected to rely primarily on the latter pathway, in which case they would have until the end of 2030 to place their projects in service to maximise their tax credits.

On 15 Aug. 2025, the US Department of Treasury further issued Notice 2025-42 (Notice) to tighten the criteria to determine when a wind or solar project is deemed to have begun construction for the purposes of the first pathway. In essence, developers of wind and solar projects with a maximum net output of more than 1.5 megawatts must demonstrate performance of physical work of a significant nature. Based on market experience, this requirement may be satisfied by performing off-site manufacturing work or ordering site-specific equipment such as main power transformers. In addition, once construction has begun, it must be continuous. This continuity test requires developers to place a project in service within four years after the end of the year in which construction starts or, failing that, demonstrate that construction has been continuous from the start.

The clearcut deadlines and short-term policy guidance are likely to accelerate pipeline wind and solar projects to lock in tax credits. The International Energy Agency estimates that U.S. renewable capacity additions will peak in 2027 before tapering in 2028 and levelling through 20301. At the peak of activity, however, developers may be asked to satisfy more stringent requirements of significant upfront physical work and continuity to lenders and insurance providers to demonstrate the project’s eligibility for tax credits (and thus its economic viability). Projects that begin construction after 2025 will also have to contend with FEOC constraints on supply chains, as explained below, adding significant procurement costs.

Extended Runway for Geothermal, Hydrogen, Nuclear and Energy Storage

The OBBB largely preserves the tax incentives for geothermal, hydrogen and nuclear in the near future. Full Investment and Production Tax Credits remain available for geothermal and nuclear projects that begin construction before the end of 2033, while hydrogen Production Tax Credits would still apply to projects that begin construction before the end of 2027. This extended runway is especially valuable for nascent technologies, such as small nuclear reactors, to develop and prove out before the incentives are withdrawn. Energy storage technologies, i.e. properties that receive, store and deliver energy for conversion to electricity such as battery storage, thermal batteries and hydrogen fuel cells will also retain Investment Tax Credits on a similar deferred phase-down schedule.

That said, clean energy and energy storage must still meet FEOC sourcing requirements. As explained below, this will strain supply chains for critical minerals and components, traditionally dominated by Chinese suppliers. Early BloombergNEF analysis indicates energy storage additions could fall about 7 percent versus prior expectations as FEOC limits narrow supply options2.

FEOC Requirements: Ownership/Control and Material Assistance

The OBBB conditions tax credits eligibility on compliance with more stringent foreign ownership/ control and material assistance rules. The latter stipulates that projects for which specified foreign or foreign influenced entities provide “material assistance” will not be eligible for the Production or Investment Tax Credits. “Material assistance” is determined based on the proportion of direct project or component costs attributable to the relevant entity. For example, starting in 2026, energy storage projects seeking to receive investment tax credits must ensure 55 percent or more of the total material costs are not sourced from specified foreign or foreign influenced entities. This threshold gradually increases for projects that begin construction in subsequent years, reaching 75 percent by 2030.

The designation of specified foreign and foreign-influenced entities include companies owned or controlled by the governments of China, Iran, North Korea or Russia, or by citizens of those countries or otherwise organised or having a principal place of business in one of those countries. For wind, solar and energy storage – sectors where Chinese inputs dominate key components – the “material assistance” restrictions threaten to further tighten already strained supply chains and elevate capex.

Clear Wins for Fossil Fuels

The OBBB is unequivocally supportive of oil and gas, primarily through mandating new lease sales across federal lands and waters. Under the IRA, offshore oil and gas lease sales are linked to those of offshore wind and, as a result, the administration only scheduled three offshore oil and gas lease sales for the 2024-2029 period. By contrast, under the OBBB, the federal government plans to add 30 oil and gas lease sales across the Gulf region over 15 years. In addition, the OBBB restores royalty rates to pre‑IRA levels, reinstates full deductions for intangible drilling costs and delays the methane emissions fee until 2035. As key fossil fuel incentives are reinforced while those of renewable and clean energy are over time withdrawn, it is predicted that U.S. capital and service capacity will soon pivot into upstream and midstream opportunities.

Where Next for UK and EU Energy Companies Operating in the U.S.?

The combination of tax credit rollbacks and surging material costs due to FEOC “material assistance” requirements may result in companies redirecting capital away from U.S. wind and solar. According to BloombergNEF, U.S. investment in solar and wind in 2025 amounted to $35 billion, down 36 percent from the second half of 2024 – in contrast to a 63 percent increase in the EU3. The Financial Times further reported that Germany’s RWE has halted U.S. projects, including three offshore leases, due to political developments, while TotalEnergies and Shell have also dropped planned U.S. wind investments since President Trump’s re‑election4. At the same time, Shell was reportedly planning to bid for new oil leases sale in December, the first under the new annual lease sale schedule set by Trump5. Despite the drastic shift in the U.S. energy policy, energy majors are swiftly following the lead of the administration’s agenda.

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley.
It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030.
“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
None of them have regulatory approval to build a commercial system, nor have they proven they can produce power at a commercial scale.","After a generation of stagnation, interest in US nuclear energy is sky high, thanks to artificial intelligence’s voracious energy needs. Nuclear companies are stock market darlings, and the Trump administration recently unveiled an $80 billion-plus commitment to help fund new reactors.

There’s just one problem: Hardly anything will be ready to to plug in for a decade.

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley. In reality, traditional reactors take 10 years or more to build, while a highly anticipated wave of small, modular reactors has yet to produce commercial power. That means the only plants that will go into service anytime soon are a handful of shuttered facilities that can be restarted.

“There’s a lot going on, and nothing is going on,” said BloombergNEF’s head nuclear analyst Chris Gadomski.

That dissonance underscores how radically, and rapidly, the US energy system has transformed in recent years. Not long ago, utilities were shutting down costly nuclear plants and replacing them with cheaper natural gas-fired and renewable plants. The AI boom has since supercharged electricity consumption, straining power supplies and driving up prices. But while nuclear is suddenly in demand again, logistics and technology constraints threaten to thwart development even with President Donald Trump’s moves to streamline permitting and commit billions of dollars in funding.

It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030. But there won’t be a lot of wiggle room, said Wyatt Hartley, head of North American asset management for Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. The company is emerging as a key player in the industry, in part because it’s the majority owner of Westinghouse Electric Co., which is expected to be a key beneficiary of the $80 billion reactor deal announced last month.

“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Besides permitting, developers must line up buyers for the power and hire thousands of skilled workers. And some of the most critical components of a plant, such as reactor vessels and steam generators, can take as long as four years to manufacture and deliver.

Hartley expects some of those orders to be placed “in the very near term” but, realistically, it will take 10 years to get just two plants up and running.

Until then, some reactor developers are relying on natural gas. Fermi Inc., an energy real estate investment trust co-founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry that is developing a massive data center in Texas, placed orders for reactor components last month, but doesn’t expect them to go into service until the early 2030s. Start-ups Blue Energy Global Inc. and First American Nuclear Co. also expect their reactors to be completed next decade. All three companies are installing gas systems to supply data center customers as soon as possible.

And there’s another wrinkle that could slow deployment of big reactors: The Trump administration hasn’t yet laid out how the $80 billion will be allocated. It’s also not clear who would be responsible for covering the costs for a project that goes significantly over budget. Cost overruns resulted in the 2017 abandonment of the two-reactor VC Summer project in South Carolina.

“What matters at the end of the day is who takes on the cost overrun risk,” said Jigar Shah, who headed the US Energy Department’s loan programs office under President Joe Biden.

Hyped Up

The buzz around nuclear is so cacophonous that simply announcing plans to develop reactors is enough to drive up company valuations. Fermi, which has yet to build any electricity generation and only listed on the New York Stock Exchange in September, is now valued at about $13 billion, more than Campbell’s Co. or Moderna Inc. Meanwhile, firms developing small, modular reactors have seen share prices skyrocketing in the past year.

Despite the hype around small reactors, which are designed to be produced in factories and assembled on site, actual progress is painstakingly slow. Shah and others think small reactors could come online sooner than big ones because they’re potentially cheaper and faster to produce, but only three companies have started construction: Oklo Inc., TerraPower LLC and Kairos Power LLC. None of them have regulatory approval to build a commercial system, nor have they proven they can produce power at a commercial scale.

Kairos may be the closest to delivering on its plans for commercial plant. It’s building a demonstration reactor to validate the technology but won’t generate electricity, and has permission to build a slightly larger version that will produce 50 megawatts. Once the company gets all regulatory approvals, it has a deal to sell that energy to the Tennessee Valley Authority for Google data centers, potentially as soon as 2030.

BloombergNEF’s Gadomski remains skeptical of the modular projects: “They’re just pushing bulldozers around.”

‘A Lot of Talk’

That means the fastest-moving part of the industry is restart projects.

More than a dozen reactors were shut down from 2012 to 2022, mostly for economic reasons, and three of them are now being revived. Holtec International expects the Palisades plant in Michigan to resume service early next year, and Constellation Energy Corp. is on track to switch on a reactor in 2027 at Three Mile Island, in Pennsylvania. NextEra Energy Inc. announced last month that it would bring the Duane Arnold plant in Iowa back online by 2029. Brookfield, meanwhile, is in talks to take over the abandoned VC Summer project, which could go into service in the early 2030s, Hartley said, though the deal is not yet finalized.

But the list of potential restart candidates is very short, and the three planned revivals would produce just 2.2 gigawatts of electricity at most, a fraction of the power Trump wants to generate from reactors.

“It’s a lot of talk,” said Scott Levine, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. “Will we see anything soon? No.”

When conditions feel unpredictable, confidence drops, spending slows, and the economy loses momentum, regardless of what the hard data say.","Shoppers wandering store aisles this November still seem to feel the pinch as many North Carolinians plan to rein in spending this holiday season. We are posting the latest Carolina Journal poll in just a few hours, but here is a sneak peek: two-thirds (67%) of North Carolinians say they expect to spend less during the holidays, reflecting lingering anxiety after years of high inflation and economic uncertainty.

We also found that a majority of voters (58%) say they are not confident in the US economy, with 38% saying they are not confident at all (38%). Despite that low confidence level, most rate their own financial situation as either good (37%) or fair (34%).

So what is weighing on consumers? We can’t discount consumers’ economic scars of the last four years. With memories of double-digit inflation still fresh, even modest cost fluctuations feel threatening. Add recent warnings about tariffs triggering high holiday prices, and consumers are more likely to keep a much closer watch on their wallets.

In many ways, confidence often lags recovery. Beneath the caution, there are good reasons to believe that this holiday could mark a turning point in consumer confidence.

Let’s look at the actual data.

The national picture shows reason for cautious optimism. According to CBS News’ Price Tracker and the latest CPI data, inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target at 3.0% in September 2025. While that’s still elevated, it came in below forecasts, and the monthly pace of inflation has slowed. For the year ahead, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates at least twice, possibly three times.

Food and everyday goods, which hit North Carolina households the hardest, are showing signs of stabilization. Energy costs, which often set the pace for consumer prices, are finally easing. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the energy index rose only 2.8% over the 12 months ending in September 2025, a sharp slowdown from the spikes seen in previous years. Gasoline prices actually fell by 0.5% during that period. Because energy is a key driver in the cost of transporting goods and powering production, this decline is an early sign that price pressures on everyday items, from groceries to manufactured products, may continue to moderate in the months ahead.

In North Carolina, the state’s labor market remains strong, and companies continue to see opportunity in our state for sectors like advanced manufacturing and technology. The CJ Poll also found that younger adults (ages 18-34) were more likely than older cohorts to indicate they might spend more this season, a small but meaningful sign that some households feel their finances are stabilizing.

tariff passthrough pressures

Of course, caution is still warranted. Excluding food and energy, core inflation rose 0.2% over last month, a step down from the 0.3% increase in the two prior months, and according to analysis from TD Economics, tariff passthrough costs continued to materialize in core goods prices. Price gains were mostly in apparel, appliances, and hobby and sporting goods, with 75% of categories experiencing price gains last month, up from 67% in August.

The CJ Poll reveals how powerful predictability and psychology are in shaping consumers’ response to inflation amid what feels to be constantly changing economic policy. According to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, consumer confidence reflects not just the economy’s measurable strength but also people’s feelings about stability and direction. When conditions feel unpredictable, confidence drops, spending slows, and the economy loses momentum, regardless of what the hard data say.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/shopping-venture-cart-4007474_1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 04:00:32.401181

Even with the best materials and most optimized designs, there is only so much energy that can be packed into a lithium-ion battery.

I’m a materials engineer who studies these batteries and seeks alternatives with better performance, improved environmental sustainability and lower cost. One promising design uses sulfur, which could boost battery capacity significantly, though some key roadblocks remain before it can be widely used.

Lithium-sulfur vs. lithium-ion

Any battery has three basic components: a positively charged region, called the cathode; a negatively charged region, called the anode; and a substance called the electrolyte in between, through which charged atoms, also known as ions, move between the cathode and anode.

In a lithium-ion battery, the cathode is made of a metal oxide, typically containing metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt, bonded with oxygen. The materials are layered, with lithium ions physically between the layers. During charging, lithium ions detach from the layered cathode material and travel through the electrolyte to the anode.

The anode is usually graphite, which is also layered, with room for the lithium ions to fit between them. During discharge, the lithium ions leave the graphite layers, travel back through the electrolyte and reinsert into the layered cathode structure, recombining with the metal oxide to release electricity that powers cars and smartphones.

In a lithium-sulfur battery, the lithium ions still move back and forth, but the chemistry is different. Its cathode is made of sulfur embedded in a carbon matrix that conducts electricity, and the anode is made primarily of lithium itself, rather than graphite layers with lithium in between.

During discharging, the lithium ions travel from the anode, through the electrolyte to the cathode, where — rather than sliding in between the cathode layers — they chemically convert sulfur in sequential steps to a series of compounds called lithium sulfides. During charging, the lithium ions separate from the sulfide compounds, leave the cathode behind and travel back to the anode.

The charging and discharging process for lithium-sulfur batteries is a chemical conversion reaction that involves more electrons than the same process in lithium-ion batteries. That means a lithium-sulfur battery can theoretically store much more energy than a lithium-ion battery of the same size.

Sulfur is inexpensive and abundantly available worldwide, meaning battery manufacturers do not need to rely on scarce metals such as nickel and cobalt, which are unevenly distributed on Earth and often sourced from regions such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has limited worker safety regulations and fair labor practices.

Those advantages could deliver batteries with far more capacity and that are cheaper and more sustainable to produce.

Why aren’t lithium-sulfur batteries widely used yet?

The biggest obstacle to mass production and use of sulfur-based batteries is durability. A good lithium-ion battery, like those in an electric vehicle, can go through thousands of cycles of discharging and recharging before its capacity starts to fade. That amounts to thousands of car rides.

But lithium-sulfur batteries tend to lose capacity much more quickly, sometimes after fewer than 100 cycles. That’s not very many trips at all.

The reason lies in the chemistry. During the chemical reactions that store and release energy in a lithium-sulfur battery, some of the lithium sulfide compounds dissolve into the liquid electrolyte of the battery.

When that happens, those amounts of both sulfur and lithium are removed from being used in any remaining reactions. This effect, known as “shuttling,” means that with each round of discharging and recharging, there are fewer elements available to release and store energy.

In the past couple of decades, research has produced improved designs. Earlier versions of these batteries lost much of their capacity within a few dozen discharge–recharge cycles, and even the best laboratory prototypes struggled to survive beyond a few hundred.

New prototypes retain more than 80% of their initial capacity even after thousands of cycles. This improvement comes from redesigning the key parts of the battery and adjusting the chemicals involved: Special electrolytes help prevent the lithium sulfides from dissolving and shuttling.

The electrodes have also been improved, using materials such as porous carbon that can physically trap the intermediate lithium sulfides, stopping them from wandering away from the cathode. This helps the discharge and recharge reactions happen without so many losses, making the reactions more efficient so the battery lasts longer.

The road ahead

Lithium-sulfur batteries are no longer fragile laboratory curiosities, but there are significant challenges before they can become serious contenders for real-world energy storage.

In terms of safety, lithium-sulfur batteries have a less volatile cathode than lithium-ion batteries, but research is continuing into other aspects of safety.

Another problem is that the more energy a lithium-sulfur battery stores, the fewer cycles of charging it can handle. That’s because the chemical reactions involved are more intense with increased energy.

This trade-off may not be a major obstacle for using these batteries in drones or grid-level energy storage, where ultrahigh energy densities are less critical. But for electric vehicles, which demand both high energy capacity and long cycle life, scientists and battery researchers still need to sort out a workable balance. That means the foundation for the next generation of lithium-sulfur batteries is likely still a few years down the road.

That effort culminated in legislation heavily influenced by the utility that temporarily scaled back some fuel costs for customers, he said.
Riders for fuel costs and for high-voltage, long-distance electrical wires, by contrast, make up nearly half of the average household bill in southwest Virginia.
Fuel costs are closely tied to national markets for coal and gas, which make up over 80% of APCo’s power-generating capacity.
Passthrough of volatile fuel costs is a common problem for utility customers, Gilmore said.","Many households in rugged and rural southwest Virginia are already struggling to make ends meet. But they pay some of the highest electric rates in the nation, with prices that have risen at more than three times the pace of inflation over the last decade and a half.

Last week, residents of the Appalachian region voted to do something about it, joining Americans around the country in electing candidates who made affordability and spiking electricity bills central to their campaigns.

To wit: Voters in Montgomery and Roanoke counties elected Lily Franklin, a Democrat and former schoolteacher from Blacksburg, as their representative to the state House of Delegates. With 51% of the vote, she beat out a Republican incumbent in a district that voted for President Donald Trump three times in a row.

“It is a huge deal that we won this,” she told Canary Media.

The price of electricity wasn’t the only economic issue on voters’ minds as they cast their ballots across Virginia, giving Democrats the governor’s office, a larger majority in the House of Delegates, and a governing trifecta in Richmond. But Franklin said the topic came up again and again in her district, home to Virginia Tech as well as large swaths of mountain countryside.

“I talked to thousands of people across the district, and rising energy bills was a top concern,” she said. ​“I would hear it time after time — people were like, ​‘My bill is almost three times what it was last year, and I haven’t changed anything.’”

Franklin is determined to tackle the problem when she’s sworn in on Jan. 14. ​“I’m not fixing inflation as a state legislator,” she said, ​“but I can work on energy in Virginia and bring down people’s bills.”

Of course, that’s easier said than done. But Clean Virginia, a Charlottesville-based nonprofit with a research division and a campaign arm that endorsed Franklin and numerous other candidates, just issued a report that could serve as a guide. The study homes in on Appalachian Power Co., or APCo, the investor-owned utility that serves all but a few patches of southwest Virginia.

“The last General Assembly session on the energy front was really dominated by intensive focus on the cost crisis in APCo territory,” said Brennan Gilmore, executive director of Clean Virginia.

That effort culminated in legislation heavily influenced by the utility that temporarily scaled back some fuel costs for customers, he said. ​“But it was not a holistic look at what the actual drivers of the crisis were, [or] a holistic look at how to resolve those crises.”

So, Gilmore’s staff spent months digging into regulatory filings in both Virginia and West Virginia, where APCo is headquartered. What they found is that base rates aren’t the main problem. Instead, add-on fees known as riders are the real culprits — and they typically receive far less regulatory scrutiny.

Riders, especially to fund grid upgrades, are hardly confined to APCo territory, rising in multiple jurisdictions nationwide and even sparking a popular internet meme that cheekily sums up the charges: ​“Distribution fee. Processing fee. … Transmission fee. Fee fee. Fee fi fo fum fee. Might as well fee. … Another dollar won’t hurt fee.”

In deep-red Patrick County, south of Franklin’s district on the border of Virginia and North Carolina, the internet hive mind mostly blames the monopoly-utility model for these costs, with scores of commenters on a local Facebook page bemoaning bills that doubled and even tripled in the span of a month.

The Clean Virginia report authors tend to agree, saying the rising bills overall are propelled by a regulatory system that ​“incentivizes utility overspending, inflates utility profits, and puts disproportionate costs on residential customers.” But the study also drills down on specifics.

The researchers note that Virginia’s 2020 Clean Economy Act, which requires APCo to sell 100% renewable energy by midcentury, is causing some of these riders. But they’re relatively paltry: Solar and wind generation to comply with the law makes up less than 1% of households’ monthly bills today, the report found, and is expected to comprise just 3% of monthly costs next year.

Riders for fuel costs and for high-voltage, long-distance electrical wires, by contrast, make up nearly half of the average household bill in southwest Virginia. Fuel costs more than tripled between 2007 and 2024. Transmission fees rose fivefold from 2009, when regulators first allowed them as a separate line item.

Fuel costs are closely tied to national markets for coal and gas, which make up over 80% of APCo’s power-generating capacity. Coal prices more than doubled in 2021 alone, the report says. Likewise, natural-gas prices jumped 540% between 2020 and 2022. Since APCo customers pay 100% of fuel costs, they bear the full brunt of these increases, while shareholders bear none, Clean Virginia notes.

“If you’re using generation technology that requires a lot of fuel, customers are going to pay more than if you use a renewable source with no fuel,” Gilmore said. ​“Add the volatility and the spike in natural-gas prices because of global and other economic issues, then you see a direct correlation between increased bills and fossil-fuel prices.”

But fuel fees appear to be rising for other reasons, too, the study says. The charges include power purchases from other utilities, and last year, the report notes, the Virginia attorney general found that APCo was buying coal power at above-market rates from an affiliate company, Ohio Valley Electric Corp.

“Legislators should urge [regulators] to order refunds if APCo’s interaffiliate power purchases exceed market benchmarks,” the report suggests.

APCo may also be using more coal power than is cost-effective.

Across the country, plant operators have scaled back use of coal-fired units not just because the fuel itself is expensive, but because the aging plants cost a lot to operate and maintain. Last year, the average run time for U.S. coal plants was a little over 40%. But regulators in West Virginia — where APCo operates two coal plants — have ordered the utility to run the facilities at least 69% of the time, the report says, citing testimony from a recent rate case.

Passthrough of volatile fuel costs is a common problem for utility customers, Gilmore said. ​“But there are some specific APCo elements of this,” he said, ​“including uneconomic dispatch of their coal plants, and a sort of self-dealing with some of the APCo affiliate-owned coal plants.”

Perhaps the biggest challenge is the utility’s ballooning transmission fees. One problem, according to the study, is that the cost of building and maintaining these high-voltage electric lines in the area’s hilly terrain is spread among relatively few customers. The much larger Dominion Energy, for instance, charges less than half as much in transmission costs per household as does APCo.

Data centers could well be a factor, too. Though virtually none are in southwest Virginia, hubs in Ohio, northern Virginia, and elsewhere are crowding the grid run by the regional transmission organization PJM Interconnection. PJM allocates the resulting costs for upfitting lines across its member utilities, without factoring in where these large electric loads are located.

For its part, APCo said in an emailed statement that ​“investing in and maintaining [our] generation, transmission and distribution network is essential for minimizing and shortening outages, accommodating growing energy demands and integrating new energy sources.”

Like utilities nationwide, the statement continued, APCo faces high interest rates and inflation, driving up a number of the expenses associated with generating and delivering power, including ​“higher material and labor costs; … cost recovery for major storms; fuel-related costs not yet recovered through the fuel factor, and cost recovery for investments made in generating plants and distribution infrastructure.”

The company also touted its energy-efficiency programs and noted that a $10 decrease in fuel costs took effect Nov. 1.

The price cut grew out of the law Gilmore said inspired his group’s study, which notes, ​“given that methane gas prices are projected to double between 2024 and 2026, fuel costs are likely to increase again in the near future.”

Incoming Del. Franklin called the reduction woefully insufficient.

“It’s not a whole lot of relief when your wages haven’t gone up any, your groceries are still more expensive, and your rent’s really high — or your property taxes have gone up,” she said. ​“We have to have a more substantial plan to bring down rates.”

The recommendations in the plan by Clean Virginia, such as requiring utilities to pick up a share of fuel costs and reducing reliance on riders, echo a recent report that grew out of a bipartisan resolution from the 2024 General Assembly.

“There are folks that think if we have an all-of-the-above approach — that is how we bring down costs,” she said. ​“Then you’ve got some people on both sides that think nuclear is the direction.”

“And at the end of the day, we’ve got to help the people,” she said, ​“and that’s what I’m going to remind members of my party.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/lily-franklin.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ccd2b6f0bac2cf8fdb582bd90665cd91,N,,2025-11-13 04:59:52.226952

Total sales fell 4.3% year-over-year to 1.28 million units, with a daily selling rate of 47,300 units—down from 52,100 in September. The annualized pace of sales dropped to 15.4 million vehicles, the lowest in three months.

While retail sales were nearly flat, rising 0.3% year-over-year to 1.13 million units, fleet deliveries plunged 28.8%, reflecting a sharp pullback in commercial demand.

GM maintained its lead with 219,000 units and a 17.2% market share, but Toyota closed the gap to its narrowest since April, selling 208,000 vehicles for a 16.3% share. Ford remained in third place with roughly 170,000 units and a 13.3% share. At the brand level, Toyota led with 178,000 units, followed by Ford (162,000) and Chevrolet (140,000). Stellantis’ brief surge faded, with its market share easing to 8.3% from 8.8% in September, GlobalData said.

Among individual models, Ford’s F-150 held the top spot at 40,700 units, narrowly ahead of the Toyota RAV4. The Chevrolet Silverado, Honda CR-V, and Toyota Camry rounded out the top five. The Tesla Model Y slipped from the rankings as the loss of EV tax credits weighed on demand.

Segment-wise, Compact Non-Premium SUVs continued to dominate, but their share fell to 21.4%, the lowest since June. Large Pickups gained the most ground, rising to 14.7% of total sales—their highest share of 2025.

“As the weather turned colder during October, the light vehicle market was also expected to cool down, and in general this proved to be the case,” said David Oakley, manager of americas sales forecasts at GlobalData. “The loss of EV tax credits was certainly a factor in a more subdued October, with some well-known EVs suffering a sharp reduction in sales, whether in year-on-year or month-on-month terms.”

He added that manufacturer incentives “failed to support demand in most cases,” suggesting the current pool of EV buyers “is depleted, as many pulled forward purchases into Q3.” Still, Oakley noted, “the broader picture is that most OEMs reported steady sales outside of EVs, as the industry continued to absorb tariff costs, shielding the consumer—for now—from the majority of their impact.”

From a financial perspective, the data highlight a market still outperforming early-year expectations, even as sales momentum moderates and smaller, import-heavy brands face tougher conditions.

Battery-electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales were the hardest hit, dropping 47 per cent overall. BEVs were down 43 per cent from a year earlier, representing 5 per cent of total retail sales, while PHEVs fell 62 per cent to a 1 per cent share.

“Following months of significant growth in August and September, when shoppers bought EVs at record rates, the BEV market is experiencing a pullback in October,” said Tom Kondrat, global lead for advanced analytics at Urban Science, in a statement.

He added that the situation is not unexpected, since the termination of U.S. federal tax credits “pulled BEV buyers ahead” as they wanted to take advantage of the incentive before it expired — much like the situation in Quebec.

Kondrat said BEVs accounted for only 5 per cent of total retail sales in October, roughly half their year-to-date share of 8.4 per cent. He expects BEV sales to remain below last year’s levels through the fourth quarter and into early 2026, with a possible recovery next spring as seasonal demand returns.

The amendment would ban donations from within Michigan’s campaign finance system and also so-called issue advertisements funded through the nonprofit accounts that are the most common avenue for “dark money” in Michigan’s political system.

The Michigan Chamber, which opposes the new ballot initiative, has described issue advocacy as a tool “used extensively to educate the public.” By avoiding a few key phrases that would explicitly support or oppose a candidate or ballot proposal, political groups can spend unlimited amounts to advertise without having to follow any campaign finance rules.

The ballot proposal aims to cast a light on some of that spending, by requiring any outside spending group making even tangential reference to a candidate or ballot issue to report their spending totals and donors to the state in the months leading up to an election.

First Amendment rights?

Business groups argue it amounts to an attack on free speech.

“This ballot petition disenfranchises over 900 state contractors — picking winners and losers in who can and cannot express their freedom of speech through transparent political activity,” Consumers Energy spokesperson Katie Carey told Bridge in a statement.

The type of nonprofit accounts used by Consumers and others for issues ads in the past are not required to disclose who funds them.

Michiganders for Money out of Politics is itself so far largely funded by dark money. It received $115,000 from the California-based Tides Foundation, a clearinghouse for liberal donor-advised funds through which hundreds of millions of dollars pass each year.

The group is currently circulating petitions to try to make the 2026 ballot. It will need to collect valid signatures from at least 356,958 voters to qualify.

The proposal wouldn’t impact political spending at the federal level, which regularly dwarfs state-level election spending.

Protect MI Free Speech’s treasurer is the head lobbyist for the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, Wendy Block. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment for the story.

BCBS noted in a statement that their PAC is “funded entirely by employees, who represent all political viewpoints and voluntarily contribute their own money to our collective work in advancing quality health care in our state” and argued the ballot proposal “silences their voices.”

Consumer Energy also alleged employees “may lose their right to association and to engage in the political process as they do today” under the legislation.

The ballot initiative’s language however, does not appear to block regular employees from contributing to campaigns and political action committees.

“Rank-and-file employees are not touched by our proposal, it’s only c-suite executives,” Sean McBrearty, one of the coalition’s organizers, said in an interview.

Under the language, that includes a company’s president, CEO, treasurer, officer with similar responsibilities, a person with “substantial” ownership or is on the board of directors.

“In Spite of Ourselves” was written by John Prine and appears as the 15th song on his 13th studio album of the same name.
It was the first song Prine recorded after battling throat cancer in 1998.
Personnel on the record were: John Prine (vocals, acoustic guitar), Iris DeMent (vocals) and Marty Stuart (acoustic guitar).
“In Spite of Ourselves” was the only Prine song on the LP.","Let’s start with a quick refresher on carbon capture. When carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured and stored, and that’s all, the process is called carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and requires a Class VI injection well for long-term storage in deep geologic formations. If the CO2 is used for some other process before it’s stored, it is called carbon capture, use and sequestration (CCUS) and for certain applications requires a much-easier-to-permit Class II injection well — the most common example being the type used in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Permitting for Class VI wells is typically handled by the EPA, although a few states have gained control over that process, something referred to as primacy, and several others, including Texas, are attempting to do the same (more on those states later).

There are plenty of CCS projects in the works nationwide, driven at least in part by improvements made to the 45Q tax credit for permanent CO2 sequestration as part of 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and this year’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Under the budget law passed in July, the tax credits for CCS and CCUS/EOR are now equal at $85/MT for most carbon-capture facilities and $180/MT for direct air capture (DAC). Before the changes this year, the tax credits for CCUS/EOR were lower than for CCS. The blue bar sections in Figure 1 below indicate the credit rates under the IRA; the orange bar sections show the increases under the OBBBA.

“In Spite of Ourselves” was written by John Prine and appears as the 15th song on his 13th studio album of the same name. The song features Iris DeMent on vocals with Prine. Dement sang on four other tracks on the LP. Prine wrote the song for Billy Bob Thornton’s film, Daddy and Them. It’s about two lovers who look past each other’s imperfect ways, to a love that will last despite themselves. It was the first song Prine recorded after battling throat cancer in 1998. Personnel on the record were: John Prine (vocals, acoustic guitar), Iris DeMent (vocals) and Marty Stuart (acoustic guitar).

The album, In Spite of Ourselves, was recorded between August 1997 and December 1999 at Country Arms and Jack’s Tracks in Nashville. The album featured duets of classic country songs with female country artists, including Connie Smith, Lucinda Williams, Trisha Yearwood and Iris DeMent. “In Spite of Ourselves” was the only Prine song on the LP. Produced by Jim Rooney and John Prine, it was released in September 1999 and went to #21 on the Billboard Hot Country Albums chart and #197 on the Billboard 200 Albums chart.

John Prine was an American country/folk music singer, songwriter and musician. Working as a mailman in Chicago in the late 1960s, he began writing songs and performing at coffeehouses in the area. After Steve Goodman told Kris Kristofferson about Prine, Kristofferson began using him as his opening act, leading to a deal with Atlantic Records in 1971. He released 18 studio albums, six live albums, three compilation albums and eight singles. He won four Grammy Awards and is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Prine died in Nashville in April 2020 at 73.

Iris DeMent is an American singer, songwriter and musician. She has released seven studio albums and three singles. She continues to record and tour.",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2025-11/Fig1_Revised%20Rates%20for%20the%2045Q%20Tax%20Credit_0.png?itok=Y6YlhET5,N,,2025-11-12 22:59:39.731652

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Wylfa on the island of Anglesey, or Ynys Môn, will be home to three small modular reactors (SMRs) to be built by British manufacturer Rolls-Royce SMR. The government said it will invest £2.5bn.

SMRs are a new – and untested – technology aiming to produce nuclear power stations in factories to drive down costs and speed up installation. Rolls-Royce plans to build reactors, each capable of generating 470 megawatts of power, mainly in Derby.

The government also said that its Great British Energy – Nuclear (GBE-N) will report on potential sites for further larger reactors. They would follow the 3.2GW reactors under construction by French state-owned EDF at Hinkley Point C in Somerset and Sizewell C in Suffolk.

The Labour government under Starmer has embraced nuclear energy in the hope that it can generate electricity without carbon dioxide emissions, while also providing the opportunity for a large new export industry in SMRs.

However, it faced the prospect of a row with the US, piqued that its ally had overlooked the US’s Westinghouse Electric Company when choosing the manufacturer for the Wylfa reactors.

Ahead of the publication of the UK announcement, US ambassador Warren Stephens published a statement saying Britain should choose “a different path” in Wales.

“We are extremely disappointed by this decision, not least because there are cheaper, faster and already-approved options to provide clean, safe energy at this same location,” he said.

The Trump administration last month signed an $80bn (£61bn) deal with Westinghouse, which had been struggling financially, to build several of the same larger reactors proposed at Wylfa. Under the terms of that deal, the Trump administration could end up taking a stake in the company.

A source close to the UK government said: “This is the right choice for Britain. This is our flagship SMR programme, producing homegrown clean power with a British company and we have chosen the best site for it.”

While the ambassador’s intervention is unlikely to change the future of Wylfa, it may put pressure on the UK to choose Westinghouse if it does go ahead with future large reactors.

It is understood that Torness, to the east of Edinburgh, and Hunterston, to the west of Glasgow, would be considered for future large reactors. A source close to the energy secretary, Ed Miliband, said the government wants to generate nuclear power in Scotland, despite the opposition of the ruling Scottish National party.

Wylfa generated nuclear power from 1971 until 2015, when its last reactor was shut down. Japan’s Hitachi tried to build a new plant there, but these efforts collapsed in 2019 after it failed to agree funding with the government. GBE-N bought the site from Hitachi.

Starmer said: “Britain was once a world leader in nuclear power, but years of neglect and inertia has meant places like Anglesey have been let down and left behind.

“This government isn’t just reversing decline, it’s delivering thousands of future-proofed jobs, driving billions in investment and providing cheaper energy bills in the long term.”

However, Sharon Graham, general secretary of Unite, said that building three smaller reactors rather than one larger one at Wylfa would be a mistake because it would not maximise the number of jobs for British workers. The union represents some workers in the nuclear industry.

“Failure to support a gigawatt nuclear power station at Wylfa would be a huge missed opportunity in securing the UK’s energy security,” she said.

Nevertheless, the confirmation of a UK site will be another welcome step for Rolls-Royce, the FTSE 100 maker of jet engines that was chosen as the government’s preferred developer in June.

It owns the majority of Rolls-Royce SMR, alongside Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, France’s BNF Resources, US energy company Constellation, and the Czech utility CEZ, which could order as many as six of the reactors.

Rolls-Royce SMR has more than 1,000 employees, who are racing to produce technology that will also be installed at Temelín in the Czech Republic.

Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, a lobby group, said the Wylfa project was “an exciting opportunity for a UK technology, our domestic supply chain and skilled workforce”.

He added: “To achieve the amount of nuclear capacity the country needs for a secure, reliable and price-predictable electricity mix, we will need reactors large and small.

“There will be other projects using different reactor technologies, and potentially further gigawatt-scale plants beyond Sizewell C. Partnership with like-minded allies, including the US, will be a part of delivering that ambition.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd0d67bd71875cc05e13b88746ec07e7bbf4b885/363_0_2108_1688/master/2108.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a8546080980e35ac995c6cb7adbe9991",N,,2025-11-12 22:59:29.131842

This partnership marks a step forward in Sustainea’s efforts to promote sustainable practices across its supply chain.

The project will support around 1,000 acres of farmland near Lafayette, Indiana. That’s a key region within the U.S. Corn Belt known for high corn productivity. The focus is on implementing regenerative agricultural techniques that aim to improve soil health, increase carbon sequestration, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and lessen environmental impact.

Gustavo Sergi, CEO of Sustainea, commented, “Regenerative agriculture offers a way to address climate change while supporting rural communities in the Midwest. Working closely with local farmers and trusted partners, we aim to promote practices that contribute to long-term industry resilience. We’re proud to collaborate with Primient and local farmers in Indiana to build a low-carbon future.”

This initiative builds on Sustainea’s ongoing partnership with Primient, which includes collaboration on the development of the first U.S. Bio-MEG facility. The project aims to promote large-scale adoption of regenerative practices in the Lafayette area and ensure responsible sourcing of corn—the raw material used in Sustainea’s Bio-MEG production.

Laura Kowalski, Head of Sustainability and Marketing at Primient, stated, “Since 2018, Primient has been working to increase regenerative agriculture practices in the U.S. Midwest. Using advanced technology, we help farmers monitor and measure their environmental outcomes, contributing to a more resilient supply chain.”

Sustainea’s Bio-MEG, produced from renewable, plant-based feedstocks, offers a way for customers to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing quality. As the company prepares to expand its operations in the U.S., local regenerative sourcing is central to its sustainability strategy.

The Bio-MEG facility is projected to begin operations in 2028, processing the equivalent of 42,000 bushels of corn daily. This capacity could prevent up to 400,000 tons of CO₂e emissions annually by replacing petroleum-derived MEG with Sustainea’s low-carbon alternative.

Gustavo Sergi concluded, “This initiative reinforces our commitment to creating value at every level; from how we source raw materials to the products we deliver. It provides our partners and customers with greater transparency and measurable ways to reduce their environmental impact.”",https://worldbiomarketinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sustainea-launches-regenerative-agriculture-project-with-Primient-.jpg,N,,2025-11-13 04:01:37.931179

More than 12 million gallons of liquid waste from Smitty Supply had been recovered from impacted areas as of Oct. 28.
The liquid waste is pumped through the tubing and into the ground, filling the tiny spaces in porous rock underground.
As for the kinds of solid waste River Birch will accept from Smitty’s Supply, LDEQ officials wouldn’t provide any specifics when reached for comment Wednesday.
Lisa Karlin, a River Ridge resident and longtime citizen watchdog of Jefferson Parish government, raised several concerns about River Birch accepting waste material from Smitty’s Supply.","Millions of gallons of oily water and spilled petrochemicals from the Smitty’s Supply fire and explosion have been handled at three different sites, but state officials have granted an emergency request to bring some of the liquid and solid waste to a Jefferson Parish landfill.

River Birch LLC, which operates a landfill in Avondale, received a permit exemption last month from the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality to accept waste recovered after the Aug. 22 fire disaster in Tangipahoa Parish, according to LDEQ records the agency published this week.

Although River Birch’s Class 1 injection wells are permitted for only non-hazardous materials, a 1996 federal law allows them to be used to dispose of certain hazardous materials mixed when with water. River Birch uses its injection wells for petrochemical wastewater, industrial sludge, oily waters, solvents, acids, contaminated groundwater and stormwater, and other liquid wastes that would otherwise be considered hazardous, according to the company’s website.

River Birch’s injection well permit allows it to accept liquid waste statewide, but its solid waste permit is limited to a 13-parish area that doesn’t include Tangipahoa. The company requested the emergency solid waste exception on Oct. 13, and the state approved it two days later.

“This is a unique opportunity for Smitty’s to manage all of its contaminated waste at a properly permitted facility,” Chris Casteix, River Birch’s environmental compliance manager, wrote in the company’s emergency request to the agency.

In its approval letter to River Birch, the Department of Environmental Quality said the waste from Smitty’s Supply “will have no significant adverse impact on the public health, safety, welfare, and the environment.”

It’s unclear how much waste Smitty’s Supply will send to the River Birch landfill. Neither company has responded to calls or emails.

More than 12 million gallons of liquid waste from Smitty Supply had been recovered from impacted areas as of Oct. 28. Roughly half of that amount has already been disposed of at other facilities, according to information from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state.

As of Oct. 16, EPA contractors brought 2.7 million gallons of recovered waste to Preston Environmental Solutions in Baton Rouge for recycling and 3.7 million gallons to Woodside Landfill in Livingston Parish for solidification.

Another 595,000 gallons has been taken to a landfill in Liberty, Mississippi, and injected underground, according to LDEQ records.

Underground injection of liquid waste is an accepted disposal practice under state and federal laws.

Whether it’s an injection well for waste disposal or an oil well for extraction, the structure is mostly the same. A hole is drilled to a desired depth, typically around 4,000 feet for Class 1 wells, and supported with long sections of pipe cemented in place to prevent cave-ins. Often an additional layer of tubing lines the inner walls of the pipe to prevent leaks. There is no encasement or container at the bottom of the well. The liquid waste is pumped through the tubing and into the ground, filling the tiny spaces in porous rock underground.

The EPA requires a Class 1 well to extend below the lowermost formations containing drinking water within a quarter-mile vicinity. Patrick Courreges, spokesman for the Louisiana Department of Conservation and Energy, said there must be a good enough barrier of impervious rock to prevent any of the waste from seeping upwards. He said the injection pressure at the wellhead is constantly monitored to prevent fractures and blowouts.

River Birch’s website says its wells are positioned 6,500 feet underground.

Injection wells are generally the cheapest option to dispose of contaminated liquid waste, but they do carry some risks such as well leaks and groundwater contamination, according to the EPA and other sources. The federal agency says underground injection is safe when the wells are placed at an appropriate site and properly maintained.

As for the kinds of solid waste River Birch will accept from Smitty’s Supply, LDEQ officials wouldn’t provide any specifics when reached for comment Wednesday.

“River Birch will be disposing of non-hazardous solid waste that they are already permitted to dispose of,” LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

Lisa Karlin, a River Ridge resident and longtime citizen watchdog of Jefferson Parish government, raised several concerns about River Birch accepting waste material from Smitty’s Supply. She wants to know who determines whether the waste going to River Birch is hazardous or not and if any kind of testing is required to make that determination.

“Even if it’s technically OK, should the parish take in waste from Smitty’s?” Karlin said. “Everything I’ve seen suggests that the Smitty’s waste is likely highly toxic.”

Members of the Jefferson Parish Council have not responded to her questions about River Birch’s permit, she said.

Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng and Councilmembers at-large Jennifer Van Vrancken and Scott Walker have not responded to a reporter’s request for comment.

Karlin also questioned whether River Birch’s permit exemption warranted expedited approval when waste from Tangipahoa Parish was already going to other landfills that were closer in distance.

“Why drive over an hour to get to River Birch?” Karlin asked.

The 180-day emergency permit exemption will remain in effect until mid-April.

The offices of Bacon and Hurd did not respond to inquiries about next steps now that the government seems likely to reopen imminently.","WASHINGTON — With the federal government appearing to be on the precipice of reopening without an agreement on extending the soon-to-expire health care tax subsidies at the center of the shutdown fight, attention is likely to turn to the fate of the Affordable Care Act credits that have helped lower the cost of insurance for millions of Americans.

In particular, as federal employees get back to work and government programs return to normal operations, eyes may turn to the trickle of bipartisan proposals to extend them and the handful of Republican lawmakers who have joined Democrats in calling for action.

The credits, which were established under Democrats’ American Rescue Plan in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic and extended in the party’s Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, are set to lapse at the end of the year, threatening to raise the cost of health coverage plans for Americans across the country.

Democrats, who say they were standing up to the “health care crisis” in America created by Republicans, made an extension of the subsidies the key tangible focal point of their demands in exchange for joining with the GOP in voting to reopen the government.

The eventual agreement to end the record-long, 40-plus-day shutdown that appears likely to become law was worked out by Republicans and a handful of Democratic senators and promises the party a vote on extending the credits by the second week of December but makes no commitments it will result in the outcome those on that side of the aisle want. And given the GOP’s yearslong battle against the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare and the ACA for short, it is unlikely it will. Also, no parallel commitment to a vote was made in the House, where an extension would also have to pass to become law.

Throughout the shutdown, Republican leaders argued they would be open to conversations on the subsidies only once Democrats voted to reopen the government but Speaker Mike Johnson in particular also said there would have to be reforms.

The bipartisan proposals and vocal Republicans

But as the shutdown dragged on, a collection of Republican lawmakers has emerged to express concern about the expiration of the credits and call for Congress to address it, with a few even joining Democratic colleagues to propose solutions.

In perhaps the most notable instance, a bipartisan pair of House members representing California introduced a bill this week that seeks to extend the premium tax credits for another two years while implementing an eligibility cap at six times the poverty level and moving to crack down on what they say is fraud by insurance brokers and waste in Medicare Advantage.

“Our bipartisan legislation will assure Americans are spared from a massive increase in health care costs that is just around the corner,” said Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who joined with Democratic Rep. Sam Liccardo, in introducing the bill. “This will provide short-term relief while we tackle broader reforms to lower the cost of care.”

A week earlier in what marked the first instance of a bipartisan group teaming up to propose a tangible plan to address the credits amid the shutdown, Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Jeff Hurd of Colorado, along with Democratic Reps. Tom Suozzi of New York and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, banded together to offer a “statement of principles.” Although not legislation, the statement proposed a two-year extension of the subsidies with an income cap phased out between $200,000 and $400,000.

”Our hope is that this shared statement of principles will inspire bipartisan collaboration across Washington and help get Congress back to work for the American people,” the lawmakers wrote.

The offices of Bacon and Hurd did not respond to inquiries about next steps now that the government seems likely to reopen imminently.

Meanwhile, a group of more than a dozen House Republicans, led by Reps. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Jen Kiggans of Virginia, spoke out last month urging Johnson to ensure action is taken on health care once the shutdown is over. In a letter to the speaker, the House Republicans urged him to “immediately turn our focus to the growing crisis of healthcare affordability and the looming expiration of the enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits” once the government is reopened, warning that allowing them to lapse “without a clear path forward would risk real harm to those we represent.”

Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a well-known conservative firebrand, has also been vocal on the issue throughout the shutdown, noting that her own adult children are set to see their insurance premiums double next year if the credits expire.

For his part, President Donald Trump — who has long railed against the ACA and unsuccessfully sought to get rid of it in his first term — vowed in a recent interview with CBS News to “sit down with the Democrats” and work to “fix” the health care situation in the U.S. when they vote to reopen the government.

Asked about such a pledge from the president at Wednesday’s White House briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is “absolutely open to having conversations about health care” once the shutdown is officially over.

She added that Trump would be “putting forth some really good policy proposals the Democrats should take very seriously.”

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York vowed Wednesday to introduce legislation to extend the subsidies for three years.

The impact of the credits expiring

With the ACA open enrollment period already underway, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health estimated consumers buying insurance through the program are seeing their premiums rise by up to 59%. An analysis from independent health policy organization KFF estimated that the enhanced premium tax credits saved certain enrollees an average of $705 a year in 2024 and would have been more than 75% higher without the subsidies.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, meanwhile, estimated that the end of the enhancements will raise the cost of coverage for enrollees previously receiving the credits by an average of $1,000 a year. And it notes the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found 1.5 million more people will be uninsured in 2026 if Congress waits until the end of the year to take action on their extension.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/capitol_AP_25310656691923_NAT_1109_crop,N,,2025-11-12 22:59:42.605250

Under the proposed rule, EPA now seeks to add key reporting exemptions including: (1) mixtures or articles containing PFAS in concentrations less than 0.1%; (2) PFAS imported as part of an article; (3) certain PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance; (4) PFAS that are impurities; (5) PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development purposes; and (6) PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates.

In addition, EPA seeks to revise the reporting deadline under the rule. The current reporting deadline is October 13, 2026. EPA is proposing to alter the deadline for reporting, by having the submission period begin 60 days after the rule is finalized and to run for three months. Thus, if the rule is finalized after May 2026, this would result in an extension of the reporting rule’s deadline.",https://www.stites.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Light-bulb-with-plant-inside-1024x652.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 21:00:44.457951

The $14b investment is Toyota's largest in a single site, and part of the reason this campus cost them so much (others have built 30 GWH for $2b-$3b) is that it's really three battery plants on the same grounds.

In North Carolina, they're running 4 of 14 possible production lines, making batteries for 600,000 hybrids annually such as Camry in Kentucky and Corolla Cross in Alabama. They're building space for PHEV and EV batteries, but those plans are fairly limited currently, enough to support 74,000 PHEVs and 45,000 EVs.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which was established in the 1970s, oversees power plants and other uses of nuclear materials.","The Department of Energy will lend most of its loans for nuclear power plant projects, its secretary announced Monday.

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

There’s also the question of what kind of load flexibility FERC should push for.
One of the trickiest questions for FERC to iron out is whether it actually has the authority to regulate interconnection to the transmission system.","Energy Secretary Chris Wright’s directive to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to standardize large load interconnections landed last month with a bang.

The unusual move — delivered via advanced notice of proposed rulemaking — would dramatically expand FERC’s authority over interconnection to the transmission system, which has traditionally been left up to the states. And it bolstered the industry’s growing enthusiasm for load flexibility for data centers by encouraging FERC to offer expedited interconnection for curtailable loads (as well as colocated facilities that agree to be both curtailable and dispatchable).

But the ANOPR leaves open many critical questions. And with the ambitious — arguably to the point of improbable — six-month timeline that Wright set for the rulemaking, FERC doesn’t have much time to answer them.

Allison Clements, former FERC commissioner and current partner with digital infrastructure advisory firm ASG, and Tyler Norris, a researcher at Duke University who authored a seminal paper on load flexibility last February, unpacked some of these considerations on a recent episode of the Catalyst podcast with Shayle Kann. For instance: What are the technical parameters of flexibility? How many total hours of curtailment will be required each year? How will FERC value different approaches to flexibility, from batteries to backup generation? And how to ensure loads actually curtail when they’ve committed to doing so?

One of Clements’ primary concerns is that answering these questions with sufficient specificity will be impossible, given both FERC’s typical approach to these kinds of rulemakings, and the timeline at play.

“Ever since standard market design failed in 2000, the agency has been really skittish about requiring standardized anything across the board….So my instinct, without getting into the politics, is they’re not going to get that specific on first take,” Clements told Kann. “And that’s my biggest concern here. We don’t want something rushed that ends up failing to really take advantage of the opportunity that these flexibility alternatives provide and incentivize them in a way that works for the providers.”

For more of Allison Clements and Tyler Norris’ takes on the ANOPR, listen to this recent episode of Catalyst with Shayle Kann:

In the next five and a half months, FERC will have to take comments on the ANOPR, then write its own notice of proposed rulemaking — an outline of the proposed regulation — then take comments on that NOPR, all before issuing a final rule. According to Clements, accomplishing that by the April deadline would be “rocket speed in FERC world.”

The rulemaking process for FERC’s Order 1920, a landmark long-term transmission planning and cost allocation rule, Clements added, took four years and was 1,200 pages long. The Wright ANOPR, in contrast, was 14 pages. “It’s not realistic,” Clements said of the April deadline. And Wright’s authority to require that six-month speed rulemaking, she added, is simply “the bully pulpit, political pressure.”

“But I think when that letter came out, there were a lot of FERC staffers who were thinking, oh no, my Thanksgiving and holiday plans,” she added.

What kind of load flexibility?

There’s also the question of what kind of load flexibility FERC should push for. The concept has gathered steam in the last year, but there are several ways a large load could be flexible: for instance either throttling down their use during moments of peak demand (as Google has done for several years) or relying on backup generation or batteries. However, there is also a growing move to redesign data centers themselves to serve as flexible grid assets, as the startup Verrus is doing.

Norris argues, however, that ideally FERC would structure its regulation to cover any approach to flexibility that a large load may want to take, rather than picking winners by endorsing a particular one.

“Ultimately you want it to be as sort of generalizable as possible so that you can sort of represent any load that is utilizing this type of flexibility for all these purposes,” he said. “Then we can actually create a market where a variety of different options can compete either onsite — or even to some extent offsite.” While it’s even more nascent, there is a move toward procuring flexibility from other loads in the same balancing authority, he added, including via a virtual power plant program announced by WattCarbon last week.

But the technical specifications still need to be worked out. In the wake of the proposal, a collection of researchers at the Duke Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment, and Sustainability joined Clements and the lawyers of Roselle LP in outlining FERC’s considerations for the rulemaking.

The brief argued that if FERC wants to make the most of large load flexibility — and ideally free up grid capacity at the same time — the commission will need to structure flexibility commitments “as transactions with clearly defined terms.” And in doing so, the group said FERC will need to evaluate rules that:

Enable large load flexibility commitments to avoid or defer transmission upgrades

Enable large load flexibility commitments to reduce capacity procurements

Enable flexible large loads to obtain non-firm withdrawal and, as applicable, injection rights

Clarify study timelines, queue priority, and interconnection process for large load customers, as well as load-supply hybrid facilities and pairings

The response so far

The docket for the proposal is open now; in light of stakeholder requests, the comment period has already been extended from November 14 to November 21, with reply comments due December 5.

So far, most respondents have filed motions to intervene — essentially requests to become an official party to the proceeding, via arguing that they will be directly impacted by the outcome. This group includes both the PJM Power Providers Group and the organization of PJM states, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, and Southwest Power Pool Market Monitoring Unit, as well as companies like Mainspring Energy and Vitol. No company or organization has yet expressed opposition or support for the specifics of the ANOPR.

Utilities, some of the most important stakeholders in this rulemaking, have yet to weigh in.

One of the trickiest questions for FERC to iron out is whether it actually has the authority to regulate interconnection to the transmission system. Clements said on Catalyst that the legal arguments that Wright makes in his filing are strong, but said “I’m not sure if it’s by tradition, by culture, experience or practice that it actually hasn’t been asserted in the past.” Norris added that he anticipates concerns on the jurisdictional question especially from some state commission officials “and certainly the investor-owned utilities.”

So far, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group representing the country’s large, investor-owned utilities, has remained mostly quiet on the ANOPR. The group’s sole statement on the proposal could be characterized as damning-with-faint-praise: “We share the Administration’s commitment to American energy dominance and appreciate their leadership to accelerate energy to win the AI race and fuel our economy,” EEI president and CEO Drew Maloney said. “We look forward to working with FERC to strengthen the grid, drive down costs for customers, and improve reliability across our country.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-11-12T171849.189.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 22:59:36.420931

Prices are then forecast to hold near $4.00/MMBtu in 2026 as U.S. LNG exports continue to grow and domestic production levels off.
“Flat production and strong export growth are expected to tighten natural gas balances,” the agency said.
While oil prices ease, electricity demand continues to grow—particularly in Texas and neighboring states.
Oil and refined fuel prices are poised to soften amid growing inventories, but natural gas remains on a firmer trajectory as export capacity expands and new LNG projects ramp up.","Global oil markets are expected to ease in 2026, but the U.S. natural gas sector continues to tighten as liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports expand and domestic production growth slows, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) latest Short-Term Energy Outlook.

The EIA projects Henry Hub natural gas prices will average about $4.00 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2026, up 16% from this year, reflecting stronger LNG exports and steady winter heating demand. In contrast, global oil inventories are rising, putting downward pressure on crude prices even as gas markets strengthen.

Gas prices firm as exports expand

The EIA expects Henry Hub spot prices to rise to an average of $3.90/MMBtu this winter (November–March), following typical seasonal patterns of higher heating demand. Prices are then forecast to hold near $4.00/MMBtu in 2026 as U.S. LNG exports continue to grow and domestic production levels off.

“Flat production and strong export growth are expected to tighten natural gas balances,” the agency said.

U.S. LNG terminals are exporting gas at record levels. The EIA expects average LNG exports of 14.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2025, up 25% from last year, driven largely by rapid commissioning of the Plaquemines LNG facility in Louisiana. That project has come online faster than expected, prompting the EIA to raise its fourth-quarter export forecast by 3% from the prior month.

Exports are projected to increase another 10% in 2026, underscoring the U.S. role as the world’s leading LNG supplier.

In contrast to the tightening gas market, the EIA expects global oil inventories to build through 2026, exerting downward pressure on crude prices. Brent crude is forecast to average $54 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026 and $55 per barrel for the year, about $3 higher than last month’s forecast due to revised assumptions about Chinese stockpiling and ongoing Russian sanctions.

Lower crude prices will filter through to the retail level, with U.S. gasoline prices projected to fall below $3.00 per gallon in 2026 and diesel prices averaging $3.50 per gallon, both declines from 2024 levels.

While oil prices ease, electricity demand continues to grow—particularly in Texas and neighboring states. The EIA expects U.S. electricity sales to rise 2.4% in 2025 and 2.6% in 2026, led by demand from data centers and cryptocurrency mining facilities in the West South Central region.

Coal production, meanwhile, is forecast to remain steady above 500 million short tons (MMst) in 2026, buoyed by the reopening of several Appalachian mines and slower stock drawdowns at coal-fired power plants.

Outlook

The EIA’s forecast highlights diverging trends across the U.S. energy landscape. Oil and refined fuel prices are poised to soften amid growing inventories, but natural gas remains on a firmer trajectory as export capacity expands and new LNG projects ramp up.

By late 2026, the United States is expected to solidify its position as the world’s largest LNG exporter, even as domestic producers face limited output growth and infrastructure planners balance expanding export demand with system reliability.",https://www.compressortech2.com/Images/1260x628/index-20251112-214759-Henry-Hub-graph.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 18:00:58.605395

The automaker breaks ground on the plant and announced an additional $2.5 billion

Toyota announced its spending an additional $2.1 billion in the EV battery factory

The company announced it’s spending an additional $8 billion, bringing the total investment to $13.9 billion

The new plant will serve as Toyota’s hub for developing and producing lithium-ion batteries for its growing EV portfolio, according to the Nov. 12 press release.

The facility will house 14 production lines supporting hybrid, battery-powered and plug-in hybrid EVs.

The facility currently has “all different stages going,” Don Stewart, president of Toyota Battery Manufacturing North Carolina, said in a video on Wednesday. Four of the hybrid lines are currently operational while its first BEV line is in its trial phase. “So we’re actually producing batteries, but they’re not sellable,” Stewart said.

The Liberty plant assembles battery modules specifically for HEV models of Toyota’s Camry, Corolla Cross, RAV4 and an undisclosed BEV that Toyota said will be the first of its kind to be built in the United States. The company plans to add more production lines, set to launch by 2030.

Stewart added that the North Carolina facility is helping Toyota become a mobility company through its various EV battery efforts. In April 2023, the company introduced a mobility strategy to accelerate EV production and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, according to its media channel, Toyota Times. The strategy also includes improving the energy density of its lithium-ion batteries.

“As [the electrification age] continues to ramp up, we’re right to the leading edge of that,” Stewart said.

In June, the facility beganshipping HEV modules to the company’s Georgetown, Kentucky, plant as well as its joint venture assembly factory with the Mazda Motor Corp. in Huntsville, Alabama, according to the automaker’s website.

Toyota's Strategic Leap into Battery Production: A Commitment to Electrification

Toyota Motor Corporation takes a significant step forward in its electrification strategy with the commencement of production at its new $13.9 billion battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina. This facility, the first of its kind for Toyota outside Japan, plays a crucial role in the company’s efforts to enhance its electric vehicle (EV) production capabilities. Designed to produce lithium-ion batteries with an annual capacity of 30 GWh, the plant is poised to support Toyota's growing lineup of hybrid and electric vehicles, aligning with the global automotive industry's shift towards electrification. The establishment of this facility not only reinforces Toyota's commitment to sustainability but also positions the company as a key player in the rapidly evolving EV market.

The Liberty plant is expected to create approximately 5,100 jobs, contributing significantly to the local economy and supporting the workforce in the region. President and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, Ted Ogawa, emphasizes that this investment reflects Toyota's dedication to its workforce, customers, and local communities. Additionally, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy commends the investment for its potential to reshape the Piedmont Triad region’s economy and stimulate job growth. This development aligns with the current administration's efforts to reshore manufacturing and promote economic revitalization, showcasing the broader implications of Toyota's investment beyond its corporate interests.

Toyota’s commitment to electrification extends beyond the Liberty plant. The company has pledged an additional $10 billion in U.S. investments over the next five years, bringing its total commitment in the U.S. to nearly $60 billion since its inception nearly 70 years ago. As part of its comprehensive electrification strategy, Toyota aims to sell 3.5 million electrified vehicles annually by 2030. This ambitious target underlines the company’s proactive approach to securing a competitive edge in the evolving automotive market while addressing environmental concerns. The Liberty facility is a pivotal element of this strategy, enabling Toyota to meet the increasing demand for sustainable transportation solutions.

In addition to its advancements in battery production, Toyota faces scrutiny from significant shareholders regarding governance practices related to a proposed transaction with Toyota Fudosan. Elliott Investment Management, a substantial stakeholder in Toyota Industries Corporation, raises concerns over the potential undervaluation of the company and emphasizes the need for transparency in corporate transactions. This highlights the ongoing challenges that Toyota navigates in balancing shareholder interests with its strategic goals in the rapidly changing automotive landscape.

Overall, Toyota's establishment of the Liberty battery plant marks a transformative moment for the company, reinforcing its leadership in the electrified vehicle market while demonstrating a commitment to sustainable practices and technological innovation.

MITCHELL, Staff, DAVID GRUNFELD, HILARY SCHEINUK",,,,,https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-infrastructure-roads-bridges/article_5ea54fb5-0087-5219-97ca-72fedf4cebdb.html,"The American Society of Civil Engineers reached this conclusion and rated all state infrastructure with a ""C-"" in its new report card, though roads and drinking water systems were given a ""D"" and bridges a ""D+"" grade.
Grades for Louisiana aviation, coastal areas and drinking water improved compared with the 2017 grades, but the state’s dams, ports and wastewater systems received lower marks.
The report noted that Louisiana has spent $1.62 billion annually to fight coastal erosion on a combined 150 projects to try to protect 2 million coastal residents and oil and gas infrastructure.
In that same time period, the share of bridges rated in ""good condition"" has steadily fallen, pushing the majority of state bridges into ""fair"" condition.
""This trend means the overall condition of bridges continues to decline, reflecting the increasing overall aging of our infrastructure and the need for continual maintenance,"" the report says.","Extreme weather, chronic underfunding and age are conspiring to keep Louisiana's infrastructure falling behind ""current and future needs"" despite recent federal investments, a national engineering society analysis released Wednesday says.

The American Society of Civil Engineers reached this conclusion and rated all state infrastructure with a ""C-"" in its new report card, though roads and drinking water systems were given a ""D"" and bridges a ""D+"" grade.

The overall ""C-"" represents a slight improvement from what the society concluded in its 2017 analysis, but the group said the 2025 grade still means ""Louisiana’s built environment is not keeping pace,"" as infrastructure continues to age and is affected ""by limited resources and increasingly frequent severe weather events.""

The national average was a ""C.""

The society noted that the state has experienced 36 extreme weather events over the past decade that resulted in $200 billion in damages statewide. While the society acknowledged that some areas have made strides, a member of the engineering society argued more needed to be done.

""The people of Louisiana require infrastructure networks that are as resilient as the people they serve, to keep families safe and businesses operational,"" Katherine Castille, an engineer who is the society's Louisiana president, said in a statement Wednesday.

""The improved grade in this report demonstrates the hard work our public and private sectors have done to modernize our built environment, but we know Louisiana is capable of far better than a ‘C-’ when provided additional resources and a dedicated workforce.""

In 2017, the society gave Louisiana a ""D+"" grade.

State highway officials and Gov. Jeff Landry's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

'Need for continual maintenance'

The society analysis detailed in the 140-page report looked at a wide sweep of public and private infrastructure, from the familiar roads and bridges to ports, airports, dams, levees, drinking water and sewage treatment systems, as well as coastal protection work.

Grades for Louisiana aviation, coastal areas and drinking water improved compared with the 2017 grades, but the state’s dams, ports and wastewater systems received lower marks. None was higher than a ""C+"" grade.

Since the 2017 report, Louisiana has been the beneficiary of post-COVID economic stimulus packages under President Biden that have sent $750 million for public water and sewer systems and $5.9 billion for roads and bridges.

Funding, however, remained a problem in all the categories analyzed. The society also concluded that without enough money to go around, the state needed to find a way to be selective and impactful.

In trying to build in greater resiliency to storms, for instance, the society said the state should improve currently lacking data ""that could guide the best use of limited funds.""

The report noted that Louisiana has spent $1.62 billion annually to fight coastal erosion on a combined 150 projects to try to protect 2 million coastal residents and oil and gas infrastructure. But millions of wetland acres still need restoration, with the billions related to the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon spill set to expire in six years.

The state has major road and bridge projects under construction, including improvements on I-10 and at the I-10/I-12 split in Baton Rouge.

But the society pointed out that Louisiana roads and bridges still have a $33 billion maintenance and capital improvement backlog combined, a rising figure affected not only by continuing demands but also by inflated material and other costs over the past several years.

The society noted that 11.5% of Louisiana's nearly 12,700 bridges are rated as being in ""poor"" condition, which is an improvement since 2018 due to maintenance and repair efforts, but the figure is still nearly double the national average.

In that same time period, the share of bridges rated in ""good condition"" has steadily fallen, pushing the majority of state bridges into ""fair"" condition.

""This trend means the overall condition of bridges continues to decline, reflecting the increasing overall aging of our infrastructure and the need for continual maintenance,"" the report says.

Congestion hits drivers

Louisiana highways and bridges rely on a 20-cent-per-gallon state sales tax that has lost two-thirds of its purchasing power since it was last raised in the late 1980s. The state road tax has seen total revenues decline due to greater gasoline engine efficiency and electric vehicles.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/df/adf53a0b-7d57-5767-afbd-2a75a4d6983b/691504a497a65.image.jpg?crop=1732%2C910%2C0%2C59&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-12 18:00:52.433694

This surge is being driven by transport and industrial electrification, heating, cooling, data centers, and rising demand in emerging economies.

The report shows both the opportunities presented by the global energy transition as well as the risks of inaction.

Following is a statement from Taryn Fransen, Director of Global Research and Data, WRI Polsky Center for the Global Energy Transition:

“A clean, reliable, affordable, and abundant energy future is possible – but we need to make smart investments today to get on the right path. The IEA projects rapid growth of electricity demand driven by electric transport, data centers, and air conditioning. Power systems around the world could struggle to keep up – but with the right policies, this challenge could become an opportunity to accelerate the global energy transition.

“Investments in grids are critical. Strengthening and modernizing transmission, distribution and storage will make power systems more reliable and enable clean energy to scale to meet growing demand. Global investment in grids is rising, but more is needed, especially for high-voltage transmission.

“Policymakers and regulators should work with large buyers of electricity – particularly in countries with rapidly growing data centers – to find ways to meet demand without falling back on dirty fuels or driving up costs.

“The clean energy transition depends on critical minerals, but there are risks as countries rush to expand the currently concentrated mining supply chain. Reducing the need for mining through better design and improving recycling and circularity can help manage these risks as we take steps to ensure mining is done responsibly.

“The global energy transition should ensure no one is left behind – from the hundreds of millions of people who still lack electricity and clean cooking to consumers facing rising bills. Policymakers can also embrace new economic opportunities through workforce development and clean energy jobs.

“As world leaders gather at COP30, the choices made today will determine the future of our energy system. Without careful management, households will face higher energy bills, communities and businesses will see more blackouts and emissions will continue to climb. But with the right decisions, we can cut emissions, further unleash the benefits of a booming clean energy sector, and bring reliable, affordable power to households and communities around the world.”",https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-12 18:00:25.109855

Congress will likely try to finish work on the remaining nine full-year government spending bills by the Jan. 30 deadline set in the new stopgap spending bill.","WASHINGTON — The U.S. House plans to approve a stopgap spending bill Wednesday evening that will end the record-breaking 43-day government shutdown once President Donald Trump signs the legislation.

Democrats are expected to oppose the package en masse, though a few centrists may vote for it, despite party leaders whipping against the measure. The House action will be the first time members, who left town while the Senate struggled to pass a stopgap spending bill and curtail the shutdown, have voted since Sept. 19.

House Republican leaders need nearly all of their members to back the deal after the balance of power in the House shifted to 219-214 once Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., swore in Arizona Democratic Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva.

Two GOP lawmakers — Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie and Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz — voted against the original version of the short-term spending bill when it passed the House in September. Democratic Rep. Jared Golden of Maine voted for that bill, the only member of his party to do so.

The Senate significantly reworked it into what is now a 394-page package, adding in three of the full-year government funding bills and changing the date of the stopgap measure to Jan. 30, among many other provisions. The original stopgap was set to last through Nov. 21.

The change will give Congress a couple more months to work out agreement on the remaining nine appropriations bills that were supposed to become law before the start of the current fiscal year on Oct. 1.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing that Trump “looks forward to finally ending this devastating Democrat shutdown with his signature and we hope that signing will take place later tonight.”

Health care costs

Trump will then turn his attention toward the rising cost of health care that Democrats highlighted during the shutdown, Leavitt said, though she didn’t put a firm timeline on when he’ll release any plans.

“Once the government reopens, the president, as he’s always maintained, is absolutely open to having conversations about health care,” Leavitt said. “And I think you’ll see the president putting forth some really good policy proposals that Democrats should take very seriously to fix, again, the system that they broke.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters following a closed-door meeting that Democrats will try to get the necessary signatures on a discharge petition to force a floor vote on legislation to extend tax credits for three years for people who buy their health insurance from the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

The New York Democrat said the extension mirrors how long the enhanced tax credits were set to last initially in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

Temporary health care subsidies were originally passed as part of the COVID-19-era American Rescue Plan in 2021 for two years. The Inflation Reduction Act, the signature climate policy bill from the Biden administration, then extended those health care subsidies for three years, expiring at the end of December 2025.

“The legislation that we will introduce in the context of a discharge petition will provide that level of certainty to working-class Americans who are on the verge of seeing their premiums, co-pays and deductibles skyrocket,” Jeffries said.

Democrats will need the support of at least a handful of Republicans in order to get the 218 signatures needed to force a vote on the bill. The discharge petition was released mid-afternoon.

Senate floor vote pledged on ACA tax credits

Democrats said for weeks ahead of the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline they wouldn’t provide the support needed to move the House-passed, short-term spending bill over the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster unless GOP leaders negotiated over the ACA tax credits.

Speaker Johnson said those talks wouldn’t happen during a shutdown and referred to it as an end-of-year issue, though he has repeatedly declined to say if he’ll hold a floor vote on the expiring subsidies in the weeks ahead.

Ramifications of the shutdown worsened the longer it went on through flight cancellations, delayed payments to U.S. Department of Agriculture nutrition programs and no pay for federal workers, just to name a few.

Seven centrist Senate Democrats and one independent, concerned about the shutdown’s impact on their constituents, broke with party leaders this weekend to advance the reworked spending package and then voted to approve the legislation Monday.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who said throughout the shutdown he was interested in a bipartisan path forward on health insurance costs after the shutdown ended, committed to hold a floor vote on a Democratic bill “no later than the second week in December.”

What’s in the new bill

The spending package wraps in several different bills and provisions, such as the three full-year funding bills that cover the Agriculture Department, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Legislative Branch, military construction projects and Department of Veterans Affairs.

Included are:

A stopgap spending bill that will keep the rest of the federal government running through Jan. 30;

$30 million for the U.S. Capitol Police to enhance protections for lawmakers, $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service to bolster security for members of the judicial and executive branches, and $28 million for enhanced safety for Supreme Court justices;

Language requiring the Trump administration to reinstate the thousands of workers it sent layoff notices to during the shutdown and preventing officials from firing those workers through January;

Provisions mandating the Trump administration provide back pay to all federal workers, including those furloughed during the shutdown. Trump at one point during the shutdown had threatened to yank that back pay, though it is required by law.

The Trump administration issued a Statement of Administration Policy a few hours before the House was scheduled to vote, saying the administration strongly supports the bill, describing the measure as “a fiscally responsible package that provides the full-year funding necessary to support the Nation’s veterans, farmers, and rural communities.”

The package also “ends disruptions to programs the American people rely on and ensures the thousands of Federal employees who have been forced to work without a paycheck, such as air traffic controllers, will be promptly paid,” the administration added.

The Agriculture and Military Construction-VA spending bills include tens of billions of dollars in earmarks requested by lawmakers from both political parties, important to them as midterm elections loom in 2026.

Separate vote planned on senators and subpoenas

But not every Republican on Capitol Hill is happy with how the full-year bills turned out.

Speaker Johnson announced mid-afternoon that the House would take a separate vote later this month to remove language from the package that will allow senators to file suit against the federal government if their data is subpoenaed.

“We are putting this legislation on the fast track suspension calendar in the House for next week,” Johnson wrote in a social media post.

The provision, tucked into the full-year Legislative Branch spending bill, is retroactive to January 1, 2022 and would apply to the eight senators who had their cell phone records subpoenaed during a 2023 investigation into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results.

The FBI reportedly obtained data for cell phone use between January 4 and January 7, 2021 for Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania.

Congress will likely try to finish work on the remaining nine full-year government spending bills by the Jan. 30 deadline set in the new stopgap spending bill.

Failure to broker a bipartisan deal that can pass both chambers of Congress before that deadline would lead to another government shutdown, though that would be partial and only affect the agencies included in those nine bills.

For workers whose jobs are deemed essential for the nation, it should also be essential they get paid.
The goal of a smaller government is reasonable, with the number of government employees mostly flat over the past half-century.","The current government shutdown is now the longest on record, surpassing the 34-day shutdown during President Trump’s first term. More than 700,000 government employees are on furlough, and not being paid. Those deemed essential have remained on the job, but without a paycheck to show for it.

What the Department of Government Efficiency attempted to do with a sledgehammer, Congress succeeded in doing with gridlock and an unwillingness to compromise.

On the surface, a smaller government workforce appears to be working. But is it really?

Government has two basic functions. It provides services for the population, and it collects data that informs such services. With the government shutdown, both of these functions are compromised.

There are certain agencies that are not viewed favorably by President Trump, and they have a significant number of their workforce on furlough. The Internal Revenue Service, for example, has had only about half of its workforce active through the shutdown. As an organization, they oversee the collection of tax revenue. If such revenue slows, then less money comes into the federal Treasury. Whether the current non-furloughed employees are sufficient to fulfil their mission remains to be seen.

The Environmental Protection Agency has around 90 percent of its workforce on furlough, effectively bringing all of its research and data collection activities to a standstill. NASA has also seen more than 80 percent of its workforce furloughed. Both of these agencies play an active role in monitoring factors that relate to the environment. Given that Trump believes climate change is a “con job,” starving these agencies of human capital is something he most likely enjoys.

The Department of Commerce has about 80 percent of its workforce on furlough. This, too, is not surprising, since it is a highly data-centric unit within the government. It contains the Bureau of Economic Analysis and International Trade Administration, both of which are equipped to collect data that exposes flaws in the president’s tariff policies.

The U.S. Census Bureau, also housed within the Department of Commerce, collects and analyzes data that capture the economic condition and societal metrics of the nation. It is also responsible for overseeing the decennial census and apportionment, which determines which states gain or lose House seats — something Trump is keenly interested in.

The Department of Labor has more than three-quarters of its workforce on furlough. It contains the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects data surrounding the labor force and the economy, exposing potential flaws in the president’s economic agenda. The firing of its commissioner back in August indicated the president’s interest in suppressing such data.

Though essential workers like Transportation Security Administration officers and Federal Aviation Administration air traffic controllers continue to show up for work, the fact that they are not being paid is de facto slave labor for the government. For workers whose jobs are deemed essential for the nation, it should also be essential they get paid. The forced reduction in flights by the secretary of Transportation will cost the airlines and the government billions of dollars in lost revenue.

Yes, the country continues to function. But is the level of function during this shutdown making the nation better? Ruptures in the foundation of our nation may not be visible for quite some time. And any time data is being suppressed by not being collected, or tasks that contribute to the stability of the nation are not being executed, we as nation are weaker for it.

The goal of a smaller government is reasonable, with the number of government employees mostly flat over the past half-century. Yet, the U.S. population has grown by around 10 percent on average per decade over this time period. This means that the number of people served per government employee has grown over time. Thus, the government has already been shrinking for many years. With the proliferation of technology and the growth of artificial intelligence, there is every reason to believe that this downward trend will continue.

The government shutdown may give the illusion that workers on furlough are not needed. Undoubtedly, some of these people are expendable. The challenge is identifying who they are, as would also be the case in the private sector. Attrition over time can organically address this issue.

Indeed, the tasks that federal workers perform, the services they provide, and the data they collect are all vital to keep the foundation of our nation strong and safe, both today and into the future. Over time, this shutdown will provide evidence to support this statement, as the carnage left in its wake is assessed.

This acquisition, subject to closing conditions, will mark an important step in JOLT’s international expansion, by adding thousands of locations across the United States to its growing footprint, with sites spanning up to 34 states and 64 Designated Marketing Areas (DMAs), including major metros such as Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas–Fort Worth. JOLT will acquire a strategic selection of Volta assets to deliver maximum value for drivers, advertisers and property partners.

The integration of Volta’s network will build on JOLT’s pioneering model of combining DOOH displays with EV charging, connecting brands with consumers at key moments in their daily journeys; from on the way into malls and restaurants to travel hubs and retail centers. Central to JOLT’s approach is its data-led advertiser proposition, delivering advanced targeting, audience measurement and performance insights that enable brands to engage customers with precision and relevance across its network. Leveraging Volta’s foundation and JOLT’s global expertise in streetside OOH and fast EV charging, the combined network will deliver a seamless, measurable experience for advertisers and an enhanced charging experience for EV drivers.

With this expansion, JOLT will further solidify its position as the world’s largest combined EV charging and digital out-of-home network. That scale is reflected in the company’s global client base, which includes leading brands across retail, automotive, finance, technology, and quick-service restaurants, with global brands such as McDonald’s, Amazon, Toyota, Target and American Express among its advertisers.

“This acquisition will accelerate our mission to make it faster, easier, and simpler for drivers around the world to switch to electric vehicles,” said Doug McNamee, JOLT CEO. “The Volta Media Network and JOLT share the same DNA - combining EV charging with a powerful media platform - making this acquisition a natural fit. Securing a significant US footprint represents a major milestone and a longstanding strategic priority for JOLT, strengthening our ability to serve drivers, advertisers, and partners while delivering on our growth ambitions. These assets sit squarely in JOLT’s sweet spot: combining EV charging with digital media. We’ll bring our innovation and operational discipline to maximize their value for drivers, advertisers, and landlords.

“JOLT’s acquisition ensures the Volta network continues to thrive, giving drivers, advertisers, and landlords confidence in its future at a time when its continuation had previously been uncertain,” McNamee added.

With charging speeds tailored to both everyday top-ups and longer sessions, the combined network will meet the diverse needs of EV drivers while creating new pathways for advertisers across categories to engage audiences in contextually relevant, real-world environments.

JOLT’s expansion underscores the growing convergence between mobility infrastructure and digital media, delivering measurable commercial outcomes for advertisers while accelerating the broader shift toward electrification. Looking ahead, JOLT plans to expand its presence across major U.S. markets in 2026, partnering with leading advertisers, property owners, and municipalities to grow its integrated charging and media footprint.

The agreement is expected to close Jan. 1, 2026, and is conditional upon satisfaction of closing conditions. Shell was advised on the transaction by Goldman Sach & Co. LLC.

TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea.

A few years ago, oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there.

It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last.

Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming.

In 2023, Petro pledged to stop approving new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step.

Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going?

When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil.

But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says Ana Carolina González Espinosa, senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says.

""I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,"" she says. ""But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.""

""It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,"" she says.

Why Colombia is doing this

Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy.

Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector.

But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes. The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050.

Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says Guy Edwards, who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop.

"" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,"" González Espinosa says, ""then we are going to be in trouble.""

Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol.

The year before Petro took office, the company acquired an electricity transmission company. In recent years, they've acquired more solar and wind projects. And they're investing in geothermal energy, drilling deep into the earth to create electricity.

""The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,"" Lemos says, ""but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.""

""We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.""

Renewable progress and failures

A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro.

Solar made up around 9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024, according to data from XM, Colombia's electricity market operator. That's up from roughly 1.5% in 2022.

Petro's government has introduced something called ""energy communities,"" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract international financing for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar making it more efficient, says Manuel Schulte, chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy.

But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says.

Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors have given up on renewable projects, particularly wind projects. The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has acquired some of these abandoned wind projects.

Losing the messaging fight

Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the ""myth,"" she says, that the country's energy transition ""will be an economic hindrance.""

"" The opposite,"" Muhamad says. ""What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.""

Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press. His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as ""disastrous for the Colombian economy.""

Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels.

"" They didn't resonate with the national audience,"" González Espinosa says in an email. ""It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.""

Looking to the future

Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration?

Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote.

As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal, Estefanny Pardo, mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it.

""The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,"" Pardo says in Spanish.

An upcoming conference

Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023.

Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production.

Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels.

The land trusts will purchase new conservation easements that will protect air and water quality, preserve wildlife habitat and biodiversity, support sustainable forest management, and increase outdoor recreation opportunities for the public.

“Under Governor Hochul’s leadership, DEC continues to protect forests and bolster climate resiliency, quality of life for all communities, and the economy,” said Commissioner Lefton. “With approximately 73 percent of New York State’s forests being privately owned, this $1.72 million in FCELT Grant Program funding will help landowners keep their forests as forests and maintain working forest landscapes. Through partnerships with land trusts and dedicated landowners, we’re adding protections that keep trees standing, wildlife thriving, watersheds intact, and communities resilient.”

The grants, administered by the Land Trust Alliance in partnership with DEC, were made available through the Forest Conservation Easements for Land Trusts (FCELT) Grant Program and contribute to the State’s goal of conserving 30 percent of New York’s lands and waters by 2030. These grants are intended to provide community benefits, advance ecosystem benefits and climate resilience, and work towards goals identified in the New York State Open Space Plan, the New York State Wildlife Action Plan, the New York State Forest Action Plan, and/or other local, regional or statewide land protection plans. Environmental justice and climate resilience are key components for project selection.

New York Senior Program Manager for the Land Trust Alliance Jamie Brown said, ""Protecting forests offers so many benefits to all New Yorkers. The FCELT Grant Program is a vital tool that assists land trusts to do this important work. We are grateful to the State’s support and leadership in protecting our natural resources and important places.”

Funded Projects:

Genesee Valley Conservancy, Livingston County: $227,220 to purchase a conservation easement on the 135-acre Pokey Moonshine Hallow property, located in the town of Springwater. This land is 99 percent forested and situated within the watershed of Hemlock Lake, a drinking water source for the City of Rochester. The landowners will continue to sustainably manage the forest.

Genesee Valley Conservancy, Steuben County: $350,000 to purchase a conservation easement on the 841-acre Beckhorn property, located in the towns of Rexville and West Union. This is one of the largest forested parcels remaining in Steuben County and will connect to other protected land. The property’s forest blends species found in both temperate and boreal climates, making for a diverse mix of trees and plants, enhancing biodiversity and providing habitat for numerous species of birds and mammals.

Hudson Taconic Lands, Rensselaer County: $265,000 to purchase a conservation easement on the 288-acre Wheeler Mountain Escarpment in the towns of Brunswick and Grafton. The land is 100 percent forested and is adjacent to the 1,100-acre Camp Rotary Conservation Easement recently acquired by Hudson Taconic Lands. The easement will protect Wheeler Mountain and the Quaken Kill, home to critical habitat and part of a larger initiative to create a four-mile contiguous corridor of protected forest along the western escarpment of the Rensselaer Plateau.

Otsego Land Trust, Otsego County: $54,250 to purchase a conservation easement on the 41-acre Burr Forest property in the town of Westford. The land is adjacent to the popular Betty and Wilbur Davis State Park. The easement property is 90 percent forested, and includes wetlands and hemlock stands, along with large concentrations of native plants. The landowners will manage the forest for wildlife and the health of the forest.

Roundout-Esopus Land Conservancy, Ulster County: $160,850 to purchase a conservation easement that will protect 19 acres of diverse forestland adjacent to Minnewaska State Park in the town of Wawarsing. The easement will protect Mine Hole Brook, which contains brook trout and is a tributary to Roundout Creek. The easement will also ensure that the area surrounding the Mine Hole Trail, a popular and heavily used recreation area, remains in a natural state. The current owner is interested in proactively managing the woodlands for habitat, with a focus on improving the health and ecological diversity of the forest.

Scenic Hudson, Columbia County: $250,000 to purchase a conservation easement on the 272-acre West Family Land property in the towns of New Lebanon and Canaan. The land was once part of a larger 19th century Shaker community and is adjacent to conserved land, including Bates Memorial State Park in Massachusetts. The forest is a mix of hardwood and softwood and includes habitat for several bird and mammal species.

Scenic Hudson, Dutchess County: $125,000 to purchase a conservation easement on the 137-acre Royal Strawberry Hill Farm and Preserve in the town of Poughkeepsie. The property, once part of a network of farms, has mostly reverted to forest in an area under extreme development pressure. The City of Poughkeepsie identified the property in its Open Space Plan and designated the land as an urban greenway. The land hosts a limestone woodland forest community, wetlands and streams, habitat for birds, mammals, and amphibians, and connects some of the last remaining forests in the area.

Tug Hill Tomorrow Land Trust (THTLT), Herkimer County (two projects): $131,122 to conserve the 135-acre Kimak Forest property and $161,175 to conserve the 182-acre Grafer Forest property, both located in the town of Russia. Both properties are part of a large, forested area that includes other conservation easements held by the land trust. These new easements will build on THTLT’s conservation efforts surrounding Hinckley State Forest. Both properties are characterized by forested land that contains a mix of softwood and hardwood species, which play a crucial role in providing habitat for a diverse array of wildlife. Several streams cross the property and flow into West Canada Creek.

The grants are funded through the State's Environmental Protection Fund (EPF). Among the many environmental victories in the enacted 2025-26 State Budget, Governor Kathy Hochul and legislative leaders increased the historically high level of $425 million in EPF funding. The EPF supports climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, improves agricultural resources to promote sustainable agriculture, protects water sources, advances conservation efforts like the projects announced today, and provides recreational opportunities for New Yorkers.

Entr will conduct FEED for a temporary storage and liquefaction processing terminal at Port Tampa Bay in Tampa, Florida, and a discharge and regasification terminal at LBC Tank Terminals in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, supporting Aptamus’s CO2 maritime transport and storage programme, Carbon Ocean and Storage Transport 20 (COAST20).

COAST20 was selected for an award to be partially funded by the US Department of Energy. The programme includes design of a 20,000-tonne liquefied CO2 tank vessel which will be the first built in the United States, the Port Tampa Bay intermodal hub site collecting captured CO2 from emitters across Florida, and the LBC receiving port on the Mississippi River near Baton Rouge, adjacent to an existing dedicated CO2 pipeline system for delivery to permanent underground storage sites. Port Tampa Bay and LBC are partners in the COAST20 project.

Knut Egil Pedersen, vice president of hydrogen and CO2 at Aker Solutions, expressed excitement about bringing pioneering expertise in designing and building CO2 terminals and first-of-their-kind carbon removal projects to Florida. He stated that having advised on optimised solutions in early development phases, Entr will now execute these in a cost-effective, industrialised project environment, combining North American team expertise with global experience to support safe processing, storage, and transport of CO2 from Tampa Bay to Louisiana.

Jeffrey Ross Williams, president of Aptamus, stated that Aptamus has strategically expanded capabilities to offer Florida’s largest CO2 emitters a supply chain solution for safe and efficient removal of captured CO2 from the state. He characterised Entr’s development of the Port Tampa Bay hub and LBC Tank Terminals site as offering the ideal solution for managing captured CO2 in Florida. Williams noted that COAST20 will allow power generation companies to meet increasing electricity demand in Florida whilst managing carbon output to meaningfully impact the environment and human health.

The COAST20 programme addresses emerging requirements for CO2 transport and storage infrastructure supporting carbon capture deployment. Florida’s CO2 emitters lack proximate geological storage formations suitable for permanent sequestration, necessitating transport solutions connecting emission sources with suitable Gulf Coast storage sites.

The maritime transport approach utilises purpose-built liquefied CO2 carriers connecting Florida collection points with Louisiana delivery terminals adjacent to existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure. Port Tampa Bay serves as collection hub enabling aggregation of CO2 from multiple Florida sources, with temporary storage and liquefaction processing preparing CO2 for ship loading.

LBC Tank Terminals’ Baton Rouge location provides strategic positioning on the Mississippi River with existing liquid bulk storage infrastructure and proximity to established CO2 pipeline systems. The discharge and regasification terminal will receive liquefied CO2 from vessels, return it to a gaseous phase, and inject it into pipelines for delivery to permanent storage sites.

US Department of Energy funding support reflects federal policy priorities for carbon capture, utilisation, and storage infrastructure development. Aker Solutions’ experience in CO2 handling infrastructure from North Sea projects provides relevant technical expertise for COAST20.

FEED work establishes detailed technical specifications, equipment selections, process designs, safety systems, and cost estimates supporting final investment decisions. The project exemplifies emerging carbon management infrastructure connecting emission sources lacking proximate storage with suitable geological formations via multimodal transport, potentially establishing models for similar regional approaches addressing commercial-scale CCS deployment requirements.",https://tankterminals.com/wp-content/themes/tankterminals/src/img/favicon/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-12 21:01:22.018519

That could spell the end for North Carolina’s booming businesses that sell the intoxicating products.

Over the past five years, stores selling hemp-derived products have flourished, selling products like smokable THC-A flower, gummies, candy and drinks infused with THC. Some businesses have billboards along interstates.

The products contain Delta-8 and THC-A, which are close derivatives of Delta-9 THC, the chemical in marijuana that gets you high.

Matt Mitchell, owner of Hemp and Barrel in Pineville, has a wide array of products on display.

“This will be all our flowers,” he said, pointing to plants kept behind a glass case. On the wall, the store has a board showing the percentage of THC-A contained in each product. When eaten, THC-A has no effect. But when burned, it converts to regular Delta 9 THC, and has the same effects you would get from smoking pot. The cigarettes produce a high just like a joint — and it's legal.

Mitchell continues the tour.

“Here’s your CBD, your concentrates,” he said. “Pet stuff over here. Tea. Topicals. Edibles. Chocolate. Gummies.”

Mitchell has been in business for six years, but the upcoming year could be his last.

The Senate continuing resolution that funds the government would also revamp the 2018 Farm Bill. One provision in that earlier law allowed for a proliferation of hemp-derived products that are being sold in places where marijuana is still illegal, like North Carolina, Texas, Georgia and Wisconsin.

The new restrictions would take effect in a year, severely limiting the amount of THC-like chemicals in products and effectively outlawing the dried plants, edibles and other items in his shop.

“It would shut everything down,” he said. “There’s just no way to get [my products] to that level. It just wouldn’t be beneficial.”

Phil Dixon with the UNC School of Government is an expert on North Carolina’s hemp industry, which he has called the “Wild West.” The General Assembly has debated bills to regulate the market, but hasn’t approved any.

Now, Congress could be doing their work for them, Dixon said.

“It would be a big change on the federal definition of hemp and it would vastly constrict the industry if not effectively shutting it down altogether,” he said.

That wouldn’t just affect the THC-selling stores such as CannaBuddy, Blue Flowers and Apotheca that have become ubiquitous. It also would mean pulling products from stores big and small, from gas stations to major retailers like Total Wine that sell THC-infused drinks.

The Trump administration has said it approves of the new regulations.

On Monday, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, pleaded unsuccessfully with his colleagues to remove the provision. Kentucky is a large hemp-producing state.

“Instead of a clean CR, this bill contains language that has been air-dropped that will destroy hemp farming and the United States,” he said on the Senate floor.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2b8506e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/818x429+0+25/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2Fce%2Fd41c97b741e29921c1164c4a2e73%2Fhemp-barrell.png,N,,2025-11-12 19:59:05.114481

PMI warns of skills gap; 2.1M project managers needed for transition by 2035

African governments and industries must make major investments in renewable energy manufacturing and deployment. According to George Asamani, the Project Management Institute’s (PMI) regional director for Sub-Saharan Africa, such efforts could unlock millions of new jobs.

In an analysis published Thursday, November 6, on Engineering News, Asamani said that up to 30 million new green jobs could be created by 2030, but that will depend on local production and technical training.

To meet this challenge, Asamani noted that African universities and technical institutes are steadily adapting to the needs of the energy transition. In Nigeria, petroleum and gas engineers are being retrained for solar energy and energy efficiency roles. Similar initiatives are expanding across the continent. In Kenya, geothermal energy is creating new opportunities for former thermal technicians. Programs in Rwanda, Morocco, and Ghana are reorienting fossil fuel engineers toward hydropower, wind, and hybrid projects. These efforts aim to build a talent pool capable of driving the deployment of renewable energy while retraining workers from legacy industries.

Urgency to Act

Asamani emphasized that Africa must move quickly to address its energy transition challenges. The continent still has 600 million people without access to electricity, while coal remains a cheap and reliable source of power, highlighting a stark paradox. South Africa illustrates this clearly. Research from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) shows that nearly 100,000 coal miners and power plant workers risk losing their jobs as mines close. The SARB noted that their mostly semi-skilled profiles rarely align with the demands of renewable energy projects.

According to PMI’s Talent Gap Report 2025-2035, between 1.6 million and 2.1 million additional project management professionals will be needed by 2035 to support transition infrastructure and technologies, representing a 75 percent increase over current levels. The report also estimates that 10 percent of global project investments are lost annually due to poor performance, an inefficiency especially costly for Africa’s infrastructure portfolio.

Asamani’s warning comes amid high youth unemployment across Africa. The International Labour Organization (ILO) reported that nearly 62 million young people in Sub-Saharan Africa were not in employment, education, or training in 2023, representing more than a quarter of the region’s youth population. Among those who are employed, nearly three-quarters hold precarious jobs, often informal or low-skilled.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/0915b09c6ab1f1fe19371d9e00de18da_S.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 19:58:41.510647

First promulgated in 2023, the PFAS Reporting Rule in its current form is wide-sweeping, applying to all companies that domestically manufactured PFAS or imported PFAS-containing items during 2011-2022. The current rule includes essentially no exemptions, and now EPA is proposing to change that.

EPA’s proposal would incorporate exemptions for imported articles; de minimis concentrations of PFAS at 0.1% or lower; byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates; and for research and development (R&D). EPA is also proposing certain clarifications, technical corrections, and to key the submission period to the effective date of the finalized revisions. The most prominent of these proposed revisions is the imported articles exemption, which would remove from the rule’s scope the large majority of companies subject to the regulation in its current form. Affected stakeholders should consider submitting public comments on the proposed revisions, and these comments will be due 45 days after the proposed revisions are published in the Federal Register.

Background

EPA first finalized the PFAS Reporting Rule (40 C.F.R. Part 705) in October 2023 pursuant to Section 8(a)(7) of TSCA, which was added to TSCA by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020. Section 8(a)(7) requires EPA to promulgate a reporting rule applicable to “each person who has manufactured a chemical substance that is a [PFAS] in any year since January 1, 2011.” EPA applied Section 8(a)(7) through the October 2023 rule to impose a one-time reporting requirement on all companies that manufactured PFAS between 2011 and 2022 or that imported PFAS in any amount during that period (even in articles). EPA has since delayed the submission period for this rule twice, and that submission period is currently set to open on April 13, 2026, and close (for most manufacturers) on October 13, 2026.

As explained in our previous alert, EPA’s proposed revisions to this rule are not completely unexpected. EPA under the Trump administration has previously indicated that revisions were on the horizon, including through an April 28, 2025 press release where EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin committed the agency to implementing TSCA section 8(a)(7) “to smartly collect necessary information, as Congress envisioned and consistent with TSCA, without overburdening small businesses and article importers.”

The Proposed Exemptions

EPA is proposing to add exemptions to the rule for the following:

Imported articles. “Article” is defined in the rule at 40 C.F.R. § 705.3 and can generally be described as a finished good or component thereof with a definitive shape or design. EPA justified this exemption in the preamble by explaining that article importers are unlikely to have known or reasonably ascertainable information about the PFAS in the articles they imported during the lookback period. EPA also reasoned that Congress did not intend Section 8(a)(7) to apply to article importers and that the agency will nevertheless receive information on PFAS in articles by upstream PFAS manufacturers who will still be required to report under the rule.

De minimis PFAS concentrations. EPA explained in the preamble that the agency is “proposing a de minimis concentration exemption for reportable PFAS in mixtures or articles under which PFAS concentrations below 0.1% would be exempt from reporting.” EPA reasoned in the preamble that this exemption is justified in part because, during the lookback period, “reporters are unlikely to have records of PFAS amounts below 0.1% due to U.S. and international requirements at the time.” EPA also noted that the agency is interested in comments on whether a 1.0% de minimis exemption or another de minimis level would be more appropriate.

Byproducts, impurities, and non-isolated intermediates. EPA explained in the preamble that these exemptions would “align with existing exemptions under TSCA for substances not manufactured and used for a separate commercial purpose and is consistent with the approach taken in EPA’s [Chemical Data Reporting] rule.”

R&D chemicals. This exemption would apply to PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes. EPA explained in the preamble that this exemption is justified since “information on PFAS manufactured solely for R&D purposes would be limited and would provide minimal information regarding PFAS exposures and quantities in commerce.”

EPA also offered other justifications for the revisions in the preamble, including how TSCA Section 8(a)(5)(A)-(C) directs EPA, to the extent feasible, to not require unnecessary or duplicative reporting, minimize compliance costs on small manufacturers, and apply reporting obligations only to companies likely to have information relevant to the effective implementation of TSCA. EPA likewise pointed to TSCA Section 2(c), which directs EPA to carry out TSCA “in a reasonable and prudent manner” and to “consider the environmental, economic, and social impact of any action.”

Proposed Revision to the Submission Period, Clarifications and Technical Corrections

EPA is proposing that the submission period begin 60 days after the effective date of the finalized revisions and then last for three months. As EPA explained in the preamble, this revision to the submission period will “allow[] reporters to familiarize themselves with the amended rule and ensure their data are responsive to the amended rule and EPA to modify the reporting application as needed.”

EPA is also proposing a few clarifications and technical corrections to the rule, including for the scope of environmental health effects information that must be reported and the consumer and commercial product categories to be used for reporting purposes.

EPA Requests for Comment

In addition to public comments on the revisions mentioned above, EPA is soliciting comments on the following questions:

Should EPA amend the scope of reportable chemicals? For instance, EPA indicated in the preamble that the agency is receptive to feedback on the possibility of limiting reporting to PFAS with Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Numbers (CASRNs) and adding a production-volume threshold to the rule.

Should EPA modify any assumptions or cost savings calculations in its Economic Analysis? For instance, in the preamble, EPA estimated that a certain percentage of industry costs has already been accrued in preparation for reporting under the October 2023 rule. EPA is seeking comments on these types of assumptions, including sunk cost estimates.

Upon publication of the proposed revisions in the Federal Register, EPA will accept comments on the proposed changes for 45 days. Given that the impact of the proposed revisions will span across industries – especially for article importers – all affected stakeholders are encouraged to comment.",https://www.bdlaw.com/content/uploads/2024/10/Diamond-Only-Web-Size-default-social-share-social-sharing-image-23338.png,N,,2025-11-12 21:01:04.905961

As it reveals, he says the word a lot. Normally in a mocking tone, sometimes threatening, and often derisive. In fact, Trump’s main nemesis throughout his two presidencies has been the world’s second most populous country.

He’s blasted China for what he’s characterized as bad trade deals and blamed the country for ruining the United States’ steel, manufacturing, and auto industries. More recently, Trump blamed China for profiting disproportionally from global free trade and instituted significant tariffs that escalated into a game of trade-war chicken.

But for all of his strong-arming with the country, Trump isn’t trying to compete with China on a key area where they’ve come out far ahead globally–clean energy.

China currently produces over 80% of the world’s solar panels. It surpassed Tesla as the leading producer of electric vehicles in 2023 and is now responsible for producing more than 70% of the global EV market. After vowing in 2021 to end (with some veracity) new overseas coal projects, China invested heavily in clean-energy projects in more than 50 countries. The country now has the most new nuclear power plants under construction, and dominates the market for rare earth metals—an important component of battery storage.

China, like the U.S., signed the international Paris Climate Agreement 10 years ago in a commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

The U.S., by comparison, removed itself from the agreement twice: both times under Trump. While former President Joe Biden championed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, intending to boost U.S. manufacturing in clean energy and an investment in clean-tech jobs, Trump pushed Congress this year to shrink those initiatives.

At the U.N. General Assembly this past September, Trump called climate change a “con job,” and pressured diplomats at the White House last month to table plans to create a global shipping climate tax. The U.S. is now re-embracing fossil fuels, announcing executive orders focused on expanding natural gas drilling and opening up more offshore oil exploration. This is happening at the same time offshore wind projects are halted, solar grants ended, and electric vehicle subsidies pulled.

With COP30 as the backdrop, China—once considered a climate boogeyman as the source of the largest share of annual greenhouse gas emissions—is now demonstrating an incredible investment in clean energy technologies while situating itself as a global leader on the green transition … just as the U.S. is turning away.

China is far from a perfect leader when it comes to climate commitments. For one, its motives aren’t humanitarian, nor apologetic: They’re economical.

In a Yale Environment 360 analysis, Isabel Hilton writes:

“There are many ways to judge climate leadership: They include the quality and consistency of policy, the speed and effectiveness of carbon reduction, and the role a country plays in the global effort, including in support to less developed countries.

When China became the biggest carbon emitter by volume in 2005, its leadership did not contest the science. Importantly, they understood climate change as a severe threat but also as an enormous industrial opportunity. If the world needed to transition away from fossil fuels and towards clean energy, China resolved to be the supplier of the enabling goods and technologies.”

China is now leading where more traditional climate champions—namely, the most industrialized nations—are faltering.

Instead of sending delegates to COP30, the White House sent Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to a different conference.

The two flew last week to Athens, Greece, to promote fossil fuels. “There is no energy transition—there is just energy addition,” Burgum told reporters there.

The European Union also scaled back its leadership capacity on climate initiatives, as several member countries faced tough elections with populist parties championing fossil fuels. The EU further disappointed environmentalists after softening an anti-deforestation law and moving to push its start date. The EU also failed to finalize its own climate-mitigation targets by COP’s September 30 deadline.

It’s part of a trend that André Corrêa do Lago, the president of this year’s COP and a Brazilian diplomat, framed as the wealthiest global countries losing interest in climate change.

Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping told delegates at the U.N. General Assembly in September that the “green and low-carbon transition is the trend of our time.” The focus is already giving China wins: A new study found that China’s CO2 emissions have been flat or falling for 18 months, thanks in part to its “rapid adoption of electric vehicles.”

China’s investment in renewable energy also helps other countries approach their own climate targets.

As Somini Sengupta and Brad Plumer write for The New York Times:

“Having saturated its own market with solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, Chinese companies are now exporting their wares to energy-hungry countries in the developing world. What’s more, they’re investing billions of dollars in factories that make things like solar panels in Vietnam and electric cars in Brazil.”

“China is coming up with solutions that are for everyone, not just China,” Corrêa do Lago told The Guardian. “Solar panels are cheaper, they’re so competitive [compared with fossil fuel energy] that they are everywhere now.”

Newsom was blunt when he said how China’s dominance looked for the U.S.:

“The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic,” he told Reuters in Belem, adding that Republicans were letting China take ownership of the growing market and that the country “will dominate in the next great global industry.”

During Trump’s recent Asia trip, he signed a flurry of deals with countries that indicate the U.S. is jockeying for a stronger hold on rare earth minerals to stay competitive in electricity and tech innovation—to say nothing of the materials required for expanding renewable energy capabilities, such as solar or wind.

While climate change might be a backburner issue for some developed nations, electricity capacity is not. With the rise of AI and data centers and the subsequent battle of tech giants to come out on top, there’s a projected global energy rush.

The overlap of clean energy and innovation is becoming more evident every day. The economic and business opportunities around embracing renewable energy are what former Secretary of State John Kerry says could be what brings the U.S. back to the table on climate.

Kerry told NPR:

What I’m banking on is showing people that the transition to a clean energy economy is, in fact, the greatest economic opportunity the world has ever known. There are 8 billion people who want electricity, need electricity in the world today—1 billion of them actually don’t have it yet—and it’s going to go up to 10 billion in the next 20 or 30 years. So that’s a huge marketplace … And by the way, the best of capitalism—you can make a lot of money as that transition is implemented.

Time will tell whether that potential money speaks to the White House.

While there’s been progress at past COP conferences, it hasn’t been enough to slow down the impacts of greenhouse gases. Going into this year’s meeting, some modeling shows that the world is already likely to blow past the Paris Agreement’s target, projecting the globe to warm between 2.3-3.4 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial averages by the end of the century.

During opening remarks on Monday, Brazil’s President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva said the world needed a roadmap to “overcome” fossil fuel dependence.

Here’s what could be on the table:

● A forest fund: Brazil wants a major focus on this year’s meeting to be a plan that protects the Amazon rainforest. The country aims to create a multibillion-dollar fund that would pay countries to keep their forests intact at around $1.60 per acre.

● Climate finance: Leaders last year set a target, called a New Collective Quantified Goal, to deliver at least $300 billion annually for developing countries to partake in climate action by 2035. This year’s COP kicked off with a roadmap target that increases funds to $1.3 trillion, in part by increasing taxes on polluting activities.

● Adaptation: Another area of focus will be a sobering one: preparing the world for the impacts of climate change through adaptation. The U.N.’s environmental arm released an Adaptation Gap Report this year that found the private sector could provide around $50 billion annually in adaptation finance, if backed by policy. Delegates are working toward codifying “indicators” of adaptation from a list of 10,000 different options and eventually creating a global adaptation scorecard.",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1237358959_hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 17:00:11.229800

Sign up for our free newsletters.

HARRISBURG — Environmental advocates and a handful of Democratic lawmakers are lambasting legislative leaders for agreeing to pull Pennsylvania out of an interstate cap-and-trade program as a part of the state’s long-awaited $50.1 billion budget.

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) would have capped the amount of carbon that companies in Pennsylvania are allowed to emit. Lawmakers and advocates who spoke with Spotlight PA said pulling out was a major capitulation to state Senate Republicans that leaves the commonwealth without a clear path forward to combat climate change.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf directed the state to join the initiative in 2019 through an executive order. However, litigation from Republican lawmakers and energy producers prevented the state from participating in the program. A case is currently pending before the state Supreme Court.

Molly Parzen, executive director of environmental advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, called leaving RGGI a “devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy, and pollution.”

“Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy,” Parzen said in a statement, referencing the potential revenue that would have been funneled to the state.

Republicans have long criticized the program, saying that it would stymie the state’s powerful energy industry and raise consumer bills at a time of increasing costs.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has been vocally skeptical of the program since he announced his run for governor in 2021. He introduced his own state-based alternative to RGGI as legislation that would require GOP support.

However, state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that he would not move on any energy policy as long as the state was still in RGGI.

Language pulling Pennsylvania out of RGGI was included in the budget-enabling fiscal code bill. It passed the state House 189-14 and the state Senate 43-6.

State Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware), a longtime environmental advocate and chair of the Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee, voted no.

“Democrats and the governor have ceded to this, along with other environmental asks, as a way of coming to a budget agreement and getting other things they deem important,” Vitali told Spotlight PA.

Vitali called RGGI the “only serious thing” that the legislature could have done to address climate change, calling Shapiro’s policy plan “dead on arrival” in the state Senate.

“This is our one opportunity, even though this was an uncertain opportunity. And unfortunately, we are caving in,” Vitali said.

The budget does include an additional $25 million for a popular grant program that provides schools with money to install solar panels and authorizes the spending of federal funding for solar panel construction.

Still, Vitali called those provisions “minuscule” compared to RGGI’s impact.

State Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D., Chester), the minority chair of the chamber’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, voted for the bill, despite her concerns regarding “taking RGGI off the table.”

Instead, she called on the legislature to pass Shapiro’s energy plan, which would create a state-level cap-and-trade program and increase renewable energy usage requirements for utilities.

“I fought for RGGI for years. I support RGGI. I still think RGGI would be a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Comitta said on the floor of the state Senate on Wednesday. “But I’m also realistic, and I’m willing to vote yes to end this impasse.”

Atlanta is one of 81 metro areas and 45 states that received funding from the federal Environmental Protection Agency to develop comprehensive climate action plans.

The plan features 24 measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across a range of sectors, including transportation, industry, residential and commercial buildings, energy, waste & materials, and trees & greenspaces.

These measures include:

Encouraging fleet transitions to electric vehicles

Providing more options for people to walk, bike, or take public transportation

Making buildings more energy efficient

Increasing use of renewable energy sources

Protecting and restoring natural lands.

“This landmark plan will help build our region’s resilience to extreme weather events, like intense storms, flooding, heat waves, and droughts,” said Anna Roach, ARC’s Executive Director & CEO. “We know that action is needed to better prepare our region. The Metro Atlanta Climate Action Plan provides strategic options for local governments, businesses, and residents throughout the region to consider that can make a real difference.”

For next steps, ARC will be engaging organizations across the region to help move this plan toward action and implementation. Activities may include a MACAP “roadshow” to inform stakeholders and the general public and sector-focused training seminars. ARC may also consider incorporating policy recommendations into future regional planning efforts.

ARC developed the plan with feedback from a series of online stakeholder webinars, one-on-one conversations with stakeholders, existing community events, and online surveys.

The plan builds on existing climate-related work of ARC, including the Green Communities program, Livable Centers Initiative, and the ongoing transportation planning and policy work undertaken by ARC.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in August urged engine and equipment manufacturers to revise system software to prevent sudden loss of power from engine derates related to aftertreatment problems. The Cold Weather Diesel Reliability Act of 2025, co-sponsored by Republican Senators Dan Sullivan (Alaska) and Cynthia Lummis (Wyoming), however, hones in Arctic temps at which diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) is known to freeze.

The Senators contend that automatic engine shutdowns and power reductions due to emissions control malfunctions in extreme cold pose ""serious, life-threatening risk,"" and that DEF systems are ""frequently unreliable and logistically impractical"" in prolonged freezing conditions.

The bill does not waive compliance with any emissions standards under the Clean Air Act yet contends that ""emissions safeguards under the Clean Air Act were never intended to jeopardize human safety or impede critical mobility,"" the bill reads.

The bill, which would apply to on- and off-highway diesel vehicles and equipment, outlines two primary mandates for the EPA, each to be enacted within 180 days of the bill's passage.

Temporary cold weather mitigation

The EPA would be required to revise regulations to allow manufacturers to suspend engine derate or shutdown functions. This temporary mode would be allowed when an emissions control fault is triggered at or below freezing (0°C/32°F).

This function would only be authorized if ""continued maximum engine performance... is necessary to prevent occupational danger, equipment failure, or loss of essential transportation functionality in remote areas.""

The engine must return to normal emission control operation once temperatures rise above freezing.

Regional exemption

The bill also grants a year-round exemption from DEF system requirements for specific vehicles – ""primarily operated north of 59 degrees north latitude"" or those that encounter operational conditions where prolonged low temperatures make using the DEF system ""impractical."" The area north of 59 degrees north latitude is primarily Alaska.

BEAVER DAM, WI. NOV. 12, 2024 – Gov. Tony Evers, company leaders, and state and local partners announced today that Meta is investing more than $1 billion in an artificial-intelligence-optimized data center campus located in Beaver Dam.

“Wisconsin is a leader when it comes to biohealth and advanced manufacturing industries, and we’re excited to keep building upon this tradition as we become the home to new world-changing technology,” said Gov. Evers. “This investment will help ensure Wisconsin is meeting the demands of the 21st Century and creating good, family-supporting jobs to support the workforce in the Beaver Dam community and across the greater region. Wisconsin must stay one step ahead in harnessing AI technologies to remain a national and international leader in this work, and this announcement will help us continue to do just that.”

“We’re thrilled to announce Meta’s first Wisconsin data center in Beaver Dam. This is the perfect home for Meta for several reasons, including great local talent, strong community partnerships, and reliable infrastructure,” said Brad Davis, director of data center community and economic development at Meta. “We are excited to become part of the Beaver Dam community, and we look forward to a strong partnership with the city and the state for years to come.”

Meta anticipates the project will result in more than 1,000 skilled trade jobs on site at peak construction. The data center is expected to come online in 2027, after which it will support more than 100 operational jobs.

“I’m excited for the positive things this project brings to Beaver Dam, including the increased tax base and additional jobs,” said Mayor Bobbi Marck. “I am pleased to partner with a company that has a strong commitment to environmental stewardship and charitable giving, and I also look forward to building a strong partnership with Meta so that together we can continue to enhance our community.”

The data center campus will span over 700,000 square feet, with its operational buildings set to achieve LEED Gold certification. Meta officials said the project will be designed and built with efficiency, flexibility, and sustainability in mind, and the site’s electricity use will be matched with 100% clean and renewable energy. As part of its commitment to cover infrastructure costs to support the data center, Meta will underwrite nearly $200 million in energy infrastructure investments including network upgrades, utility substations, and transmission lines.

Alliant Energy, the energy utility serving Beaver Dam, continues to develop renewable energy generation sources across Wisconsin and energy storage that will serve increased energy demands and ensure reliability. Over the next ten years, Meta will also donate $15 million to Alliant Energy’s Hometown Care Energy Fund, aimed at providing direct energy cost assistance for families in need.

Meta has a goal to be water-positive in 2030, meaning the company will restore more water than it consumes. As part of this, Meta will restore 100% of the water consumed by the Beaver Dam data center to local watersheds. Additionally, the facility will use dry cooling, which means that there will be no water demands for cooling once it is operational.

In partnership with Ducks Unlimited and local conservation partners, the project will also restore 570 acres of biodiverse wetland and prairie surrounding the data centers. Of this, 175 acres of greenspace will be deeded to Ducks Unlimited and its partners for conservation work that will provide flood storage, filter nutrients before they enter the watershed, create new opportunities for wildlife viewing (particularly migratory birds and pollinators), and offer a place for visitors to recreate.

“Strong partnerships are at the core of successful conservation projects,” said Brian Glenzinski, manager of conservation programs for Ducks Unlimited. “We are excited to join Meta, the city of Beaver Dam, and the many other organizations that are prioritizing wetland habitat through this project.”

Located in Alliant Energy’s Beaver Dam Commerce Park, the location is Wisconsin’s largest certified site and has been shovel-ready for development since it was designated by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation in 2019.

“The Midwest is emerging as a hub for expanding large industrial businesses, from data centers to manufacturing and other cutting-edge industries,” said Becky Valcq, assistant vice president regulatory & data center services, at Alliant Energy. “Our Beaver Dam Commerce Park provides strong infrastructure and was specifically intended to facilitate economic development opportunities like this. We are proud to welcome Meta to the community. As the communities we serve grow, energy demand grows too. New and expanding businesses play a key role in helping to keep energy bills more affordable.

It’s day 43 of the U.S. government shutdown, but an end is finally in sight. On Sunday night, the Senate voted to move forward with funding for the federal government through Jan. 30. That vote, in which eight Democrats joined the vast majority of Senate Republicans, is expected to be followed by approval from the Republican majority in the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump. With many Democratic officials condemning the capitulation of their Senate colleagues, a revival of the shutdown is a distinct possibility after funding expires again next year.

One of the many adverse effects of the current shutdown is that, for weeks now, the nation’s top environmental cop has been off duty. While it’s too early to know the exact consequences of the dysfunction, analogous situations in the recent past indicate that polluters often increase their emissions during periods of relaxed enforcement. With such periods becoming regular features of the U.S. political process, the cumulative environmental fallout could be significant.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement division is responsible for making sure the country’s cornerstone environmental laws — the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and hazardous waste laws among them — are followed. From Washington, D.C., and 10 regional offices across the country, these staffers police some of the nation’s biggest polluters. They conduct surprise inspections at refineries, power plants, and factories. They review data and reports to check compliance. And, when they find violations, they issue fines and work with the Justice Department to take offenders to court until they course correct.

But since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the EPA has gradually furloughed most of its civil enforcement staff. At first, only a handful of employees were sent home at the start of the month, and the agency kept most workers on using unspent funds from previous budget years. As that funding ran out, however, the agency furloughed most of its workforce. Since only essential staff that protect the public from imminent threats are retained during furloughs, the vast majority of enforcement staffers had been ordered to stay home by the end of the month.

“The inspection and enforcement arm of the agency has largely been shuttered,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, the union that represents agency employees. “The large majority of inspectors and enforcement officers, along with attorneys who work with them to conduct the settlements and other legal actions against regulated entities, are all furloughed right now.” Chen himself was furloughed on Oct. 20.

Previous pauses in enforcement indicate that a lack of federal oversight can embolden polluters. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University examined emissions data from 204 coal-fired power plants from across the country during the last major federal shutdown at the end of 2018. They found that the coal plants released 15% to 20% more particulate matter during the 35 days when the government was shut down and EPA enforcement officers were furloughed. When the shutdown ended and the inspectors returned to their jobs, emissions returned to pre-shutdown levels. The findings were robust even though the researchers controlled for changes in weather, use of more polluting coal varieties, and other factors. That suggests that the plants were less likely to operate their pollution controls when they knew they were unlikely to get caught.

“The only possibility is a temporary change of the end-of-pipe pollution abatement device,” said Ruohao Zhang, a professor at Penn State and lead author of the study, which was published last month. Zhang and his colleagues relied on data reported by the coal plant operators to the EPA as well as satellite data from NASA. They examined particulate matter levels in a 1.8-mile radius around the coal plants.

While Zhang was not able to comment on the legality of such moves on the operators’ part, he said that it indicated there was a higher possibility of a violation. The current shutdown creates similar incentives as the last time around, he said. “Now without the EPA’s watching, this increased possibility [of being cited for violating environmental laws] is no longer there,” he said.

Researchers found a similar trend in the spring and summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 shutdown. At the time, the EPA announced that facilities that weren’t able to monitor and report their emissions would be excused from compliance. Companies took the EPA up on the offer. Self-reported data from polluting facilities showed that companies conducted 40% fewer emission tests at smokestacks in March and April of 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. American University researchers also found that counties with six or more polluting facilities reporting to the EPA saw a 14% increase in particulate matter pollution after the EPA announced its enforcement policy in 2020.

Shutdowns ultimately send the message that nobody is watching, said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit founded by former EPA enforcement staffers.

“It means that communities may be more exposed to pollution,” she said, “if companies do break the laws, and there’s no one from EPA working to be able to respond.”

The EPA’s regional offices each have about 18 staffers dedicated to handling each of the three main enforcement areas: air, water, and hazardous waste and toxics. Chen estimated that roughly 600 EPA employees were responsible for enforcement at the regional level. In part, these employees supervise the many environmental enforcement activities delegated to individual states. Additionally, the EPA has also assigned staff to enforce environmental laws in consultation with tribes, since many federally recognized tribes haven’t been granted authority to implement environmental laws.

The near-complete halt of inspections and case processing activities is likely to have significant implications for the EPA’s enforcement work. For one, any administrative settlements the agency might want to enter into with a polluter are contingent on utilizing evidence not more than a year old, unless the agency secures a waiver from the Justice Department. As a result, staff tend to front-load the work at the beginning of the fiscal year, which starts Oct. 1, Chen said. But given that they’ve been furloughed for the past several weeks, it “makes it very difficult timing-wise to do some sort of administrative settlements to get a quick resolution on certain things,” Chen said.

The furloughs are the latest setback to hit EPA staff. The Trump administration has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs and offered buyouts to workers this year. While it’s unclear exactly how many EPA enforcement staffers were let go or resigned, the EPA is in the process of reducing its headcount by nearly 25%. The Department of Justice, or DOJ, has also lost at least 4,500 workers to layoffs and buyouts. As a result, the Justice Department’s environmental enforcement arm has shrunk by about half.

Once the EPA identifies environmental violations, the Justice Department pursues cases against polluters and enters into legal settlements with them. According to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project first reported by the Washington Post, the DOJ has brought just nine major civil cases against polluters in the first eight months of the Trump administration. That’s a major decrease compared to Trump’s first term, when the DOJ brought 53 cases during the same time period.

An EPA spokesperson told the Post that the number of civil cases did not reflect relaxed enforcement on the Trump administration’s part, citing other metrics in which she claimed Trump had outperformed the Biden administration, but Duggan, the Environmental Integrity Project’s executive director, disagreed.

“That’s a significant slowdown of the enforcement process,” she said. “If you are cutting the staff that are doing that job, you know that’s going to have an impact.”

The steady stream of good EV charging news keeps on coming — this time in the state of Michigan. The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) has awarded $1.84 million dollars in funding for the installation of 201 new EV chargers at 31 multifamily properties in Michigan.

The new chargers will be installed in such locations as: Taylor, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Dearborn Heights, and Southfield. Other sites include Kalamazoo, Flint, and Lansing. They will be Level 2 chargers, which is just fine because residents at multifamily complexes who drive electric vehicles and plug them in at night can get a full charge while in their homes doing other things. In other words, it is not necessary to fast charge to 80% in 35 minutes for EV owners when they are at home. Some residents also may work remotely so they can charge at home while working and have their batteries ready to go when they need to drive somewhere.

Many EV owners have single family homes and home chargers, which makes home charging convenient and easy. However, most apartment and condo complexes do not yet have their own home chargers, so people who live in such dwellings do not yet have the same easy access to home charging.

Some critics, trolls, and haters might poo-poo the news of this number of EV chargers being installed as too little, but they are actually part of a much larger plan. “The grants expand charging access for residents throughout Michigan and move the state closer to the MI Healthy Climate Plan (MHCP) goal of sufficient infrastructure to support 2 million EVs in Michigan by 2030. Awardees are listed below. The MHCP is Michigan’s roadmap to a healthy, prosperous, carbon-neutral future for all Michiganders by 2050.”

Electric vehicles don’t directly generate toxic air pollution because they don’t burn gasoline or diesel fuel. Some areas of Detroit have too much air pollution. “The 48217 zip code in Southwest Detroit has the most air pollution of any community in the state, which can have devastating impacts on our health. Residents in the 48217 zip code — a community that is majority Black and Latino residents — experience disproportionately high rates of cancer and asthma. Investing in 100% clean energy will significantly reduce our carbon emissions and protect the health of communities across the state.”

Climate change impacts may also become more harmful. “A University of Michigan study projects deaths and emergency department visits caused by weather events during the time period 2041 to 2070 compared to a historical period of 1971 to 2000. Deaths from extreme heat are likely to increase from 33 deaths annually to 240 in the projected time period, the researchers report. Emergency department visits are expected to increase from 1,200 to 7,800, and hospitalizations from 28 to 185. Illness caused by extreme precipitation may increase from 170 ER visits per year to 220 visits per year.”",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-12-2025-12_46_41-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-11-12 16:01:00.194401

The Dalles, Ore., Nov. 12, 2025 — Oregon homeowners are facing a critical deadline to maximize savings on energy-efficient home improvements by stacking federal tax credits with local cash offers. The federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, making the remaining months of this year the final opportunity to complete eligible projects.

Homeowners can claim these federal tax credits when filing their taxes in early 2026 for any qualifying projects completed in 2025. Many of these upgrades also qualify for cash incentives from Energy Trust of Oregon, a nonprofit that helps people, businesses and communities use less energy and save money. Combining tax credits and incentives allows homeowners to get the deepest possible savings.

Along with lowering energy bills, these changes help make your home more comfortable inside. Energy efficiency improvements eligible for both the federal tax credits and Energy Trust incentives include:

Insulation: Adding or updating insulation on your attic, walls and floors can keep your heated or cooled air inside, meaning your system doesn’t have to work as hard.

Windows: Replacing older windows with energy efficient ones can keep your home more comfortable by keeping the air in and preventing drafts.

Heating and cooling: Heating and cooling your home is likely one of your biggest home energy expenses, so upgrading to modern, energy efficient units like heat pumps are a great way to keep energy costs low.

Water heating: Switching from a traditional water heater to a more efficient heat pump water heater uses much less energy to heat your water (often the second largest energy expense after heating and cooling).

Home energy audit: Credits can cover the cost of a professional energy “check-up” for your home. During the audit, an energy auditor uses tools to monitor temperature and moisture in your home and advises on the best upgrades to make, where your home is using energy efficiently and where energy may be wasted.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement federal tax credit offers two separate caps for tax credits, allowing homeowners to claim a total of up to $3,200 on their 2026 taxes from projects finished before December 31, 2025. The general cap with a maximum of $1,200, covers upgrades like insulation, windows, doors and home energy audits. Additionally, there’s a separate cap of $2,000 for installing an electric heat pump or heat pump water heater.

To claim the federal tax credits when filing a 2025 tax return, homeowners must have receipts and the manufacturer’s certification statements for all upgraded products. The process involves filling out a Form 5695 through the IRS website or tax prep software and filling in the details of energy-efficient improvements made at home in 2025 that qualify. Afterward, consult a tax professional to ensure everything is correct and ensure you’re able to qualify for as many savings as you’re eligible to claim.

Energy Trust does not give tax advice. Consult your tax professional for current information on credits available and how to apply.

DALLAS, TEXAS (November 12, 2025) – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a final rule approving the State of Texas’ request to administer permitting for Class VI underground injection wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). With this approval, Texas will implement Underground Injection Control (UIC) programs covering all well-types (Class I-VI), allowing better coordination and improved efficiencies.

This action recognizes that Texas is best positioned to protect its underground sources of drinking water while bolstering economic growth and energy dominance. It supports EPA’s Powering the Great American ComebackInitiative, which prioritizes clean and safe water for Americans, restoring American energy dominance, and advancing cooperative federalism.

“Approving Texas’ request to be in charge of this critical program is a big step forward for cooperative federalism—as big as the state of Texas,” said Regional Administrator Scott Mason. “The Railroad Commission of Texas has demonstrated that the state is ready, willing, and able to add Class VI wells to its underground injection control program, and the Trump Administration is proud to support Texas as it shows once again that you can protect natural resources and grows our nation’s energy economy at the same time.”

“Obtaining Class VI primacy marks an important step forward for our state’s energy sector and our citizens by recognizing the Railroad Commission’s unmatched expertise when it comes to matters of energy production, geological knowledge, and safety,” said Railroad Commission of Texas Chairman Jim Wright. “I want to thank the Trump Administration and the leadership of EPA Administrator Zeldin and Region 6 Administrator Mason for their efforts to work with states to reduce regulatory overlap and for understanding that the permitting of Class VI wells can be accomplished both safely and efficiently under the Railroad Commission’s oversight.”

“Texas is a leader in energy production, and part of that is pioneering carbon capture and storage practices,” said Senator John Cornyn (R-TX). “The EPA’s final approval of Texas’ application for primacy over underground water injection wells under the Safe Drinking Water Act will allow the Lone Star State to have more control over its own permitting process and improve efficiency, and I thank the Trump administration and EPA Administrator Zeldin for prioritizing this effort.”

“I applaud and strongly support Administrator Zeldin and the EPA for this decision. Texas is the energy capital of the world, Class VI wells are critical to energy innovation in the Lone Star State and beyond, and providing certainty about their development in the permitting process will help spur new investment. This decision reaffirms that the Railroad Commission of Texas, not the bureaucracy in D.C., is best equipped to manage the permitting of wells in the Lone Star State. I look forward to working with Administrator Zeldin and my colleagues in the Senate to ensure that regulations don’t unnecessarily hinder Texas energy development, and that Texas remains the top energy producer in the nation,” said Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX).

“Texas has always led the way in responsible energy development, and today’s decision affirms that leadership. By granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells, EPA is recognizing what we already know: no one is better equipped to protect our drinking water, advance American energy independence, and streamline permitting than the great State of Texas,” said Congressman Brian Babin (R-TX-36). “I was proud to support this effort, and I applaud Administrator Zeldin for finally clearing the way for Texas to do what it does best: grow our economy, safeguard our communities, and strengthen America’s energy future.”

“I want to thank EPA Administrator Zeldin for this approval, which will keep Texas a leader in energy innovation,” said Congressman John Carter (R-TX-31). “This decision is a win for Texas, our environment, and our economy. With this approval, Texas can move faster, attract new investments, and create good-paying jobs, leading the way for Texas energy to flourish responsibly.”

“Giving states the authority to regulate Class VI wells will cut down lengthy review times and redundant bureaucratic red tape. Carbon capture should not be mandated, but if market forces demand it, duplicative regulations should not stand in the way. This is also why I introduced the Primacy Certainty Act of 2025—so other states can benefit from what Texas energy projects now enjoy thanks to the EPA’s actions under Lee Zeldin’s leadership. President Trump is delivering on his promise to allow our energy industries to thrive, and Texas is leading the way,” said Congressman Dan Crenshaw (R-TX-2).

“I want to thank Administrator Zeldin for recognizing Texas’ leadership and granting our state primacy over Class VI well permitting. Delays at the federal level have slowed down critical carbon capture projects. As a result, this has held back innovation, investment, and job growth across Texas,” said Congressman Jake Ellzey (R-TX-6). “By empowering the Texas Railroad Commission to oversee these permits, we’re cutting through red tape and putting decisions back in the hands of experts who understand Texas’ geology, economy, and commitment to protecting our water resources. I’m grateful to my Texas colleagues who joined me in urging this action, which strengthens both environmental stewardship and American energy leadership.”

“I’m glad to see the Environmental Protection Agency, now run by the Trump Administration, finally cut red tape and streamline the permitting process for Class VI underground injection wells,” said Congressman Craig Goldman (R-TX-12). “This improved process not only safeguards our drinking water but also promotes economic growth in Texas and across the nation.”

""This is a crucial step by Administrator Zeldin and the EPA to safeguard our drinking water while advancing technologies that keep Texas and America energy dominant. This America First policy will protect our water sources and draw new jobs and investment to Texas,” said Congressman Lance Gooden (R-TX-05).

“In February, I signed onto a letter expressing strong support for the Texas Railroad Commission’s (RRC) application for primary enforcement responsibility over Class IV Underground Injection Control (UIC) wells” said Congressman Wesley Hunt (R-TX-38). “With final rule approval from the EPA, Texas will be able to implement this initiative. This will incentivize economic growth and ensure that underground water sources are properly utilized, providing clean, safe drinking water for Texans. I applaud all efforts to protect public health and the environment. Thank you to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for taking key steps to delegate and approve this rule, which will benefit and strengthen communities across Texas.”

“Texas is the epicenter of our nation’s energy industry, leading the charge on carbon capture and responsible permitting. Today’s final rule announcement will continue our state’s incredible work and streamline its efficiency and innovation. I applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin’s leadership which benefits not only Texas, but also creates jobs, boosts manufacturing, and encourages energy dominance,” said Congressman Morgan Luttrell (R-TX-8).

""For far too long, bureaucratic red tape has delayed critical energy projects and slowed innovation. Texans lead the way in responsible, efficient production, and no one understands our geology better than the experts at the Railroad Commission. I applaud the EPA's decision in granting Texas primacy over Class VI wells, which will streamline the permitting process and allow energy producers to move forward with confidence. I want to thank Administrator Zeldin for recognizing Texas’s leadership and taking this important step to advance American energy security,"" said Congressman August Pfluger (R-TX-11).

“I applaud the Trump Administration EPA decision to grant the Texas Railroad Commission primary enforcement responsibility (or “primacy”) for Class VI underground injection wells to help expand American energy dominance and support tens of billions of dollars of investment, economic growth, and job opportunities for the Lone Star State,” said Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne (R-TX-24). “The Texas Railroad Commission is fully capable of evaluating and overseeing the development and operation of carbon capture and storage wells. I am thankful the Trump Administration is, once again, working to get the federal government out of the way and allow states to best manage energy production, storage, and innovative new technologies to secure a stronger energy future for our nation.”

“I was proud to support Texas’ request for primacy over Class VI injection wells, and I applaud EPA Administrator Zeldin for acting quickly and decisively to move this process forward,” said Congressman Randy Weber (R-TX-14). “Texas’ standards align with the Safe Drinking Water Act, and this decision helps streamline the permitting process to reduce unnecessary delays. It keeps projects moving, supports investment, and ensures decisions are made closer to home. This is a positive step for Texas and America’s economic future.”

After conducting a comprehensive technical and legal review, EPA determined that Texas’ UIC Class VI program meets all requirements for approval and that the state will implement and enforce the program consistent with the Safe Drinking Water Act. Today’s action marks the sixth time a state has received primacy for Class VI wells and the fifth approval under President Trump’s leadership.

Under the leadership of Administrator Zeldin, EPA is streamlining processes for issuing permits and reviewing applications for primacy. This work includes reducing the time to permit UIC wells and eliminating the backlog of applications.

The final rule will become effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register. Publication is expected to be delayed due to a lapse in government funding.

Background

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy; US Sen. Ted Budd, R-NC; Gov. Josh Stein; Japanese ambassador to the US Shigeo Yamada; state Sens. Dave Craven, R-Randolph; Amy Galey, R-Alamance; state Reps. Brian Biggs, R-Randolph; Neal Jackson, R-Moore; officials from the Town of Liberty, Randolph County, and Guilford County; officials from the Greensboro-Randolph County Megasite Foundation; president and CEO of Toyota Motor North America, Tetsuo “Ted” Ogawa; and Toyota North Carolina president Don Stewart, were on hand to mark the occasion.

US Rep. Richard Hudson, NC-09, who was also supposed to be in attendance, was in Washington, DC, voting on a bill to end the federal government shutdown.

Stewart and Budd also acknowledged Jim Melvin, the late mayor of Greensboro, for his involvement in helping the plant come to fruition.

The company announced in 2021 that it planned to open the plant megasite, which spans 1,850 acres and is Toyota’s largest investment in the United States, at nearly $14 billion.

It currently has more than 2,500 workers, but the plans are to hire a total of 5,100 employees.

The plant, which is Toyota’s 11th manufacturing facility in the US, will feature 14 production lines, including four dedicated to supporting battery production for hybrid electric vehicles and 10 dedicated to supporting battery production for battery electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.

The state-of-the-art facility features several shops that specialize in various stages of the lithium-ion battery manufacturing process. Production is divided into three main parts: electrode manufacturing, cell assembly, formation, and module.

According to a press release, batteries assembled at Toyota North Carolina are set to power the Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric 3-row BEV — the first of its kind for Toyota to be built in the US. Currently, the plant ships HEV modules to both Toyota Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. Additional production lines at Toyota’s North Carolina facility are scheduled to launch by 2030.

The plant also has an on-site childcare center, medical clinic, and pharmacy for its employees.

Toyota “no stranger” to North Carolina

Ogawa noted that the company is no stranger to North Carolina, with its Racing Development Team in Salisbury, Rowan County.

“So, we are putting even deeper roots in North Carolina,” he said, adding that the launch of the plant marks a pivotal moment in the future of electrification for Toyota and for US auto manufacturing and that over the next five years, the company is planning an additional investment of $10 billion, for a total of over $60 billion in the US to further grow its manufacturing capabilities.

“The almost $14 billion investment in this state-of-the-art facility is not just about building batteries, it’s about building a future, a future that reflects our deep belief in America, in North Carolina, and in creating a more sustainable world,” Ogawa said.

He said President Donald Trump acknowledged Toyota’s commitment to North Carolina and recognized the importance of continued growth and partnership between the company and the US economy.

Duffy said an announcement will be made in the near future about the US Department of Transportation’s new “very reasonable fuel efficiency standard,” which will allow auto manufacturers to produce more vehicles that are more cost-effective for the American consumer.

He also applauded Toyota for listening to the consumer about what they want in a vehicle.

“Sometimes political pressure tells companies what they are supposed to do, but Toyota didn’t listen to political pressure,” Duffy said. “They listened to consumer pressure… I think the American people want hybrids, they want electric, but they also want the backup of a combustion engine, and those two things together to drive fuel efficiency is what Toyota has done and done it very well.”

Both Budd and Stein touted why Toyota and many others have selected North Carolina as the No. 1 state to do business.

“Those who have come in from out of state for a very special day, this is what the No. 1 state in the country for doing business in feels like,” Budd told the crowd.

Stein, a Democrat, mentioned his recent trip to the Southeast United States (SEUS)/Japan Annual Joint Meeting in Tokyo, Japan, and said he met with officials from at least 29 other Japanese companies in addition to meeting with executives from Toyota.

“We’re seeing our state become a national leader in the clean energy economy with Toyota leading the way,” he said. “To maintain this momentum, earlier this year I established an energy policy task force, which I’m proud to say Toyota is a part of. It’s about figuring out how we, as a state, can build on our economic momentum, keep electricity affordable as we meet growing energy demands, and maintain our goals to reduce carbon pollution.”

The governor noted that more than 100,000 North Carolinians are employed in clean tech jobs.

“Toyota is not alone here in North Carolina,” Yamada told those in attendance. “More than 400 Japanese companies are operating here. Japan is proud to be the leading investor and leading employer in this state.”

He also mentioned that President Trump had a highly successful meeting with the new Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, the first woman to hold the position in the country’s history, when he visited two weeks ago.

“The president’s visit underlined that Japan and the United States, our relationship is stronger than ever,” Yamada said. “We are steadfast security allies, and we are dynamic economic partners, and we are natural collaborators in advancing our economic security. And in that partnership, this facility stands as a proud symbol of our joint work: driving innovation, sustainability, and resilience.”

Stewart also announced that the Toyota USA Foundation will give a $2.7 million grant to the second phase of Driving Possibilities in Guilford County Schools and the Asheboro City School District.

Sign up for our free newsletters.

HARRISBURG — Environmental advocates and a handful of Democratic lawmakers are lambasting legislative leaders for agreeing to pull Pennsylvania out of an interstate cap-and-trade program as a part of the state’s long-awaited $50.1 billion budget.

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) would have capped the amount of carbon that companies in Pennsylvania are allowed to emit. Lawmakers and advocates who spoke with Spotlight PA said pulling out was a major capitulation to state Senate Republicans that leaves the commonwealth without a clear path forward to combat climate change.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf directed the state to join the initiative in 2019 through an executive order. However, litigation from Republican lawmakers and energy producers prevented the state from participating in the program. A case is currently pending before the state Supreme Court.

Molly Parzen, executive director of environmental advocacy group Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania, called leaving RGGI a “devastating, self-inflicted setback in addressing affordability, clean energy, and pollution.”

“Their capitulation means that Pennsylvanians will now be robbed of more than $1 billion annually to lower electricity prices through investments in clean energy,” Parzen said in a statement, referencing the potential revenue that would have been funneled to the state.

Republicans have long criticized the program, saying that it would stymie the state’s powerful energy industry and raise consumer bills at a time of increasing costs.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has been vocally skeptical of the program since he announced his run for governor in 2021. He introduced his own state-based alternative to RGGI as legislation that would require GOP support.

However, state Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R., Indiana) previously told Spotlight PA that he would not move on any energy policy as long as the state was still in RGGI.

Language pulling Pennsylvania out of RGGI was included in the budget-enabling fiscal code bill. It passed the state House 189-14 and the state Senate 43-6.

State Rep. Greg Vitali (D., Delaware), a longtime environmental advocate and chair of the Environmental and Natural Resource Protection Committee, voted no.

“Democrats and the governor have ceded to this, along with other environmental asks, as a way of coming to a budget agreement and getting other things they deem important,” Vitali told Spotlight PA.

Vitali called RGGI the “only serious thing” that the legislature could have done to address climate change, calling Shapiro’s policy plan “dead on arrival” in the state Senate.

“This is our one opportunity, even though this was an uncertain opportunity. And unfortunately, we are caving in,” Vitali said.

The budget does include an additional $25 million for a popular grant program that provides schools with money to install solar panels and authorizes the spending of federal funding for solar panel construction.

Still, Vitali called those provisions “minuscule” compared to RGGI’s impact.

State Sen. Carolyn Comitta (D., Chester), the minority chair of the chamber’s Environmental Resources and Energy Committee, voted for the bill, despite her concerns regarding “taking RGGI off the table.”

Instead, she called on the legislature to pass Shapiro’s energy plan, which would create a state-level cap-and-trade program and increase renewable energy usage requirements for utilities.

“I fought for RGGI for years. I support RGGI. I still think RGGI would be a good idea for Pennsylvania,” Comitta said on the floor of the state Senate on Wednesday. “But I’m also realistic, and I’m willing to vote yes to end this impasse.”

The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.
Targeting Cars with New Regulation If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on.
Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone.","California has long cast itself as the nation’s climate conscience — and its policy lab.

Now, as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moves to revoke the backbone of federal climate rules — the scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health — one of the state’s top climate officials is weighing a provocative idea put forward by environmental law experts: If Washington retreats, California could lead on carbon-controlling regulation.

Absent what’s known as the endangerment finding, the EPA may soon consider abandoning the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources, furthering the Trump Administration’s stated aim to dismantle U.S. climate policy.

While decrying the prospect of such a move, climate advocates say a repeal would yield a silver lining: California and other states could in theory set their own greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks, regulations previously superseded by federal authority.

Cars and trucks represent more than a third of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. A long shot regulatory gambit could clean some of the nation’s dirtiest air – and keep the state’s clean-car transition alive.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.

Authority States Have Never Had Before

A former federal official and expert on the Clean Air Act – who is also a law professor at UCLA – first floated this idea.

Ann Carlson wrote in the law journal Environmental Forum that an aggressive federal action against climate policy “could, ironically, provide states with authority they’ve never had before.”

The Trump administration now argues that greenhouse gases do not endanger health and that regulation is more harmful — a claim widely rejected by scientists, businesses and environmental groups, as well as states, including California.

“If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act,” Carlson told CalMatters, “then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.”

Carlson, who ran the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last year and has written extensively about the landmark law, argues that the act only preempts state rules for pollutants it actually covers. States “have a pretty strong legal argument” to regulate greenhouse gases, she said.

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate. That’s a view shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobbying group, which supported overturning California’s phaseout of new, gas-powered cars, as well as the American Trucking Associations, which has opposed some of California’s rules on trucks.

Carlson said that argument doesn’t hold up. In her Environmental Forum article, she wrote: “If Congress didn’t intend the act to cover greenhouse gases, as the administration argues, then it’s hard to believe Congress intended to preempt states and localities from regulating them.”

In other words, she says, preemption has its limits.

Other experts agreed the idea is worth considering.

Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said that states are free to “do whatever they want,” as long as the federal government hasn’t preempted them.

Not a Slam Dunk for California to Step in

For the better part of a century, California has worked to curb air pollution at the state and local level. The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.

“I personally would be advocating that they move ahead,” said Mary Nichols, a former air board chair. “And if I were there, I would be looking to gain support for doing it.”

California holds a unique status under federal law. It can set tougher tailpipe-emission standards than the rest of the country — a recognition of its early leadership in fighting smog. Since 1968, the state has obtained more than 100 federal waivers for its vehicle rules, and other states can adopt California’s standards under certain conditions.

UC Berkeley law professor Daniel Farber said the state could even take a dual-track approach. “We don’t really think we need a waiver,” he would argue after EPA abandons the field, “but just in case we do: yes, give us one.”

California’s latest clash with Washington stems from a decades-long dance over who sets the nation’s toughest clean-car rules.

The state’s strict vehicle rules have helped spur innovations from catalytic converters to cleaner fuel to electric cars. The regulatory push began in Los Angeles after skies grew so smog-choked they stung people’s eyes.

In 1966, California adopted the nation’s first tailpipe standards. When Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, it gave the state rare authority to set tougher rules — making California both a laboratory and a trailblazer, so long as it secured a federal waiver.

In 2002, California passed the nation’s first law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.

Such a move would fit California’s pattern of pushing first and asking permission later. In 2005, the state adopted its greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles and sought a waiver before it was even clear whether carbon qualified as pollution under federal law. The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.

“So this wouldn’t necessarily be a slam dunk approach for the state to take, but I think the legal avenue is now there,” said Elkin, of UC Berkeley.

Targeting Cars with New Regulation

If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on. The process would look a lot like how the state has written past clean-car rules — except this time, the target would be carbon itself.

California’s clean-car rules have operated within the permission-seeking framework set up by the Clean Air Act — until this year, when Trump and Congress moved to block the state’s plans to phase out gas cars and tighten diesel-truck standards. Trump’s EPA then went further by proposing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, framing it as a win for “consumer choice.”

Most of the state’s climate programs already run under authority of California’s own groundbreaking state laws: clean-energy mandates for utilities, a carbon-trading program for businesses, even standards to cut the carbon in fuels.

Cars are different. They’re sold into a national market, and tailpipe emissions have long been federally preempted — one reason California has needed Washington’s permission to go its own way.

If the state decides to test those limits, regulators would need to draft new rules and open them to public review — a process that could take years.

California has already started down the path of new rules for clean cars and trucks. Last month, the Air Resources Board began the process of crafting clean car rules in response to the Trump administration’s rollback of the state’s new gas-car ban — a revocation the state is also fighting in court. In December, the board plans to begin the process of writing new emissions rules for trucks.

The automobile association declined to comment on the new rulemaking effort. Patrick Kelly, vice president of energy and environmental affairs for American Trucking Associations, said the group would work with its state affiliate to “respond to specific proposals.”

“More broadly, (our group) supports achievable national standards and opposes a patchwork of state and local standards that Congress sought to avoid,” Kelly wrote in an email.

Asked by CalMatters whether the new rulemakings could become the vehicle for California to go its own way under Trump, Sanchez, the air board chair, said it’s an option staff is studying.

“It’s something that staff is looking into, and I look forward to digging into myself,” Sanchez said.

No Downside to Trying, and Some Upsides

Even if legal experts like the idea in theory, UC Berkeley’s Dan Farber says California going forward alone is a longshot in practice.

“There’s a chance you would win,” Farber said, of the argument that the state could directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars. “You’re buying a lawsuit, but other than litigation expenses, I don’t think there’s much downside in trying to do it.”

Farber and others point out that the Trump administration and car and truck manufacturers would almost certainly sue to block state-level efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned, in comments to the EPA, that if states were not preempted, any unregulated emission “would then become fair game,” creating conflicting standards across the country. Automakers have long argued that letting states write their own climate rules would create a costly patchwork of standards, raising prices for consumers and complicating production for a national market.

California is in somewhat of a legal quandary. The Clean Air Act requires California to meet national pollution standards, and the state still has some of the most air-polluted regions in the country.

The state’s solutions rely heavily on clean-car and truck rules to meet those requirements. If California falls short, it could lose federal highway funding, a situation that Sanchez called a “no-win, Catch 22.”

After decades of regulation and incentives, California has built a reputation as a leader in electric cars, and experts said if the state pushes further on policy, that could help keep California’s clean-car transition alive and its electric-vehicle goals within reach.

Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone. Electric cars proved less popular than policymakers expected when it originally passed its goal to do away with sales of new gas-powered cars.

“What is clear is that the program was not overwhelmingly popular amongst the public, even in California, right?” Nigro said. “That’s usually a flag for policymakers.”

Craig Segall, an independent consultant and former state air board deputy, said there’s another factor to consider: by preserving demand and infrastructure for EVs, the state could maintain a beachhead for innovation that a future president might build on.

With no coherent federal policy to compete in the global EV market, California could again use its regulatory and investment muscle — just as it once did in helping spawn electric car maker Tesla — to push the market forward.

“What the feds are basically signaling here is that the field is open for anyone who’s serious about being a competitive car or truck company in five years,” Segall said. “One of those paths is: the world’s fourth largest economy figures out ways to take its manufacturing economic capacity and just plow ahead.”

The new headquarters is expected to be in the Commonwealth development in Plaza Midwood. The jobs will be created over a five-year period from 2026 to 2030, according to officials at the Economic Investment Committee meeting.

They said $172,878 is the expected minimum average wage, and Scout Motors anticipates investing $207 million by the end of 2029. The state is awarding Scout Motors a job development investment grant worth up to $46.5 million if it reaches its hiring and investment targets.

This is one of the biggest job creation announcements in Charlotte over the past decade, local officials said.

Charlotte beat out sites in South Carolina and Virginia for the Scout Motors headquarters, the company told N.C. officials. Scout Motors’ headquarters is in Tysons, Virginia, near Washington, D.C.

Scout Motors already has a robust presence in the Carolinas. In 2023, the company announced it was investing $2 billion in an electric vehicle manufacturing plant in Richland County near Columbia, along with 4,000 jobs. The company also received $1.3 billion in incentives from the state.

Production is targeted to begin at the S.C. site in 2027.

“Scout Motors has undertaken a nationwide search to identify a location for its new corporate headquarters from which it will lead and drive its company, brand and products,” Mark Poole of the NC Commerce Department, said at the meeting.

In Plaza Midwood, Gov. Josh Stein and state Commerce Secretary Lee Lilley traveled to Charlotte for the announcement. They were joined by city and Mecklenburg County officials who are also involved in the deal, along with the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance.

The Charlotte headquarters will serve as the home for executives, research and development, finance, IT, sales, marketing and other key corporate functions.

“We’re excited that you’re revitalizing an iconic American brand and building the next generation vehicle company right here in the Carolinas,” Stein said.

Why Scout Motors chose Charlotte for HQ

Scoutt Motors President Scott Keogh talked about the reasons the company landed on Charlotte.

He cited the talent pool, local universities and a reputation as a launchpad for bold ideas.

“Charlotte offers the momentum we need to scale quickly and sustainably,” Keogh said. “We’ll build a headquarters that reflects our culture, empowers our team and connects us to a region that’s fast becoming a national hub for mobility and manufacturing.”

Scout Motors will establish its Charlotte presence gradually. Its plans for initial staffing and office development will start next year, with full headquarters operations scaling up over several years.

Scout Motors in South Carolina

In February 2024, Scout Motors broke ground on a production center in Blythewood, South Carolina, off Interstate 77 and just outside of Columbia. It covers about 1,600 acres, with the main plant taking up 1,100 acres, according to a Scout Motors news release.

This location gives Scout Motors easy access to highways, shipping ports in Charleston and Savannah, and colleges known for automotive engineering.

Scout plans to start making vehicles by the end of 2026, with trucks and SUVs expected to go on sale shortly after production begins. Over 14,000 people already have expressed interest for the 4,000 jobs, the Columbia State reported.

Plans are also underway to build a Supplier Park on the site of its Blythewood production center. Located next to the main production center buildings, the Supplier Park spans nearly 200 acres and will feature more than 2.3 million square feet of specialized manufacturing and logistics space.

About Scout Motors

The Scout was first made by International Harvester from 1961 to 1980. It was the world’s first vehicle designed for both off-road and family use, earning a reputation as a tough, all-purpose truck.

In 2022, Volkswagen introduced Scout Motors, a new company founded to bring back the iconic Scout brand by building a fresh line of all-electric trucks and SUVs.

Scout currently operates 1.3 million square feet of assembly space and body shops, according to its website. The company has more than 4,000 workers for production jobs.

EV manufacturer Scout Motors’ decision will bring a new industry to Charlotte

By Ashley Fahey and Tony Mecia

Scout Motors is planting its headquarters in Charlotte, bringing 1,200 jobs and an expected investment of $207M to the Plaza Midwood neighborhood.

The N.C. Department of Commerce’s Economic Investment Committee on Wednesday afternoon voted to approve a Job Development Investment Grant for Scout’s local expansion. An announcement that includes Gov. Josh Stein, the city, the county and the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance is scheduled for 2 p.m. today at the Commonwealth development in Plaza Midwood. Local incentives of about $20M are expected to be offered by the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County.

The investment is expected to run through Dec. 31, 2029. The positions are expected to pay an average wage of $172,000. Scout also considered sites in South Carolina and Virginia for its headquarters.

The project is a significant one for Charlotte, in terms of job count, investment and industry diversification.

Who is Scout Motors?

In starting to manufacture cars and trucks, Scout Motors is reviving a brand from the 1960s and 1970s that is thought of as helping create the SUV segment. Scout off-road vehicles were made by International Harvester from the 1960s until 1980.

The new Scout Motors is a subsidiary of Volkswagen Group that was founded in 2022. It plans to make off-road capable electric trucks and SUVs at a manufacturing facility in Blythewood, S.C., just north of Columbia, which is under construction.

Scout Motors CEO Scott Keogh said in a May interview that the company is going to “restore an American icon for this American moment.”

The company does not currently have vehicles available for sale, though it is accepting reservations for its first two models: the Scout Traveler SUV and the Scout Terra pickup truck. Production is expected to begin in 2027, and analysts estimate the first models will be available in 2028. The company says entry-level models will start at “under $60,000.”

Since Scout selected the site for its $2B plant in South Carolina in 2023 — which is expected to employ as many as 4,000 workers — it has been searching for a headquarters location to consolidate its operations. Scout has said it preferred a spot close to the plant. Blythewood is about 1 hour, 15 minutes south of Charlotte, off I-77.

Keogh said in May that the company was searching for a site that is “a great place to live, and that’s a big spectrum. Can our employees afford it? Do they get good health care? Do they want to move here? We’re going to have to convince an awful lot of people to say this is a great place to raise your family and build a home and all of that.”

The announcement also represents a continued shift of automotive jobs to the South. For years, North Carolina had been bypassed for other states, but that is starting to change — especially with electric vehicle-related projects. Toyota announced a battery manufacturing plant near Greensboro in 2021, and Vietnamese automaker VinFast announced a battery plant west of Raleigh in 2022 (though construction has been delayed).

South Carolina has been stronger at attracting automotive investments, with BMW opening a plant near Spartanburg in 1994 and Volvo opening one outside of Charleston in 2018. Isuzu said this year it would open a plant near Greenville, S.C.

Both states have quietly nurtured the growth of automotive suppliers as well.

Scout’s unique choice in HQ location

The arrival of Scout is also distinctive in that it chose to locate its headquarters in Plaza Midwood, a neighborhood east of uptown that is not known as an office employment hub.

Scout’s future home at the Commonwealth project, spearheaded by Charlotte developer Crosland Southeast and Nuveen, is part of a 12-acre redevelopment at Central and Pecan avenues that was once home to a Family Dollar-anchored strip center. Crosland and Nuveen have built hundreds of apartments, and a substantial amount of retail space — more than 100,000 sq. ft., for both existing and new businesses — is entitled for the property. Already, several ground-floor retail tenants, including Van Leeuwen, Yonder Yoga, Solidcore and bootmaker Lucchese, have opened. Several more, including Japanese restaurant Uchi, have been announced.

The project’s six-story, 145,000 sq. ft. office building finished construction in the second quarter. An undeveloped portion of the site — the side closest to Independence Boulevard, at the intersection of Commonwealth and Pecan avenues — could accommodate a future phase of development.

The Commonwealth project is perhaps the most visible example of the change Plaza Midwood has undergone in recent years, as more developers and new businesses have moved in, and longtime neighborhood staples have relocated to more affordable areas of Charlotte.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical source of energy for meeting exploding future global energy needs. It can also assist in achieving climate goals through replacing more emissions-intensive sources (such as coal). The United States is by far the largest producer and exporter of LNG, with new facilities coming online (including many along the Texas coast) which will enhance future capacity.

In essence, LNG facilities compress natural gas into a liquid form which can be transported by tanker and regassified at locations around the world. It is rapidly transforming the market for natural gas, which was once dictated almost entirely by pipeline routes, into a global phenomenon.

Under a variety of alternative scenarios regarding economic growth, costs of zero-carbon energy sources, energy prices, and other relevant parameters, continued expansion is anticipated. International demand for natural gas is increasing due to its favorable environmental properties as well as its potential role as a backup fuel to intermittent renewable energy. Developing economies around the world are also in need of low-cost, environmentally friendly fuels to facilitate growth, expand production, and alleviate extreme poverty.

Natural gas is also essential to electric generation capacity for the foreseeable future across the world. While renewable sources clearly have a vital and, indeed, essential role to play, their intermittent nature and ongoing lack of sufficient battery storage capacity requires backup generation capacity primarily fueled by natural gas. This requirement has been further enhanced of late by the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI), massive data centers, and other emerging technologies (including those related to carbon capture and other emissions-reducing methods) which require unprecedented levels of power consumption. In Texas alone, requirements for power generation are expected to double over the next five years.

Beyond supplying needed energy, the LNG industry has a significant impact on the economies of the United States and Texas. Through their construction and operations, LNG facilities provide jobs, economic activity, and fiscal benefits. We have studied the effects on numerous occasions and found that construction and operations lead to billions in economic activity as well as substantial tax receipts to federal, state, and local government entities. They also support development of natural gas resources, which brings additional investment and employment opportunities.

US LNG exports are crucial to meeting future demand, and Texas is able to provide the necessary gas production, pipeline infrastructure, LNG facilities, ports, and terminals. In addition to ensuring sustainable global energy supplies, the industry provides a substantial economic and fiscal stimulus. It must be implemented in a responsible manner that recognizes and embraces climate realities, but the sheer quantities of energy that will be required mandate that an “all-of-the-above” strategy be implemented. Stay safe!

About International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety Since 2008, the German government has been promoting climate action and biodiversity conservation in the Global South through the International Climate Initiative (IKI).
Within the Federal Government, the IKI is anchored in the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMUKN).","Belém, Brazil (November 12, 2025) – Today at the COP30 UN climate conference, leaders from governments, businesses, civil society and philanthropy launched a new global effort that puts people’s jobs and skills at heart of the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy.

Developed in collaboration with the COP30 Presidency and a broad coalition of international partners, the Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy aims to accelerate investment in human capital, foster social inclusion, and align workforce development with national climate and economic strategies. The Initiative responds to growing demand for practical solutions that make climate action work for people — creating jobs, developing skills, and ensuring social protection as economies transform.

“Here in Belém, we must show that climate action is not only about emissions and technologies, but about people and their future,” said COP30 CEO Ana Toni, who co-hosted the event launch. “Let us come together in the spirit of mutirão — the collective energy of communities working together — to build a fairer and more prosperous future for all.”

The Initiative builds on new global research from Systemiq and World Resources Institute (WRI) which shows that the climate transition could create an estimated 375 million new jobs over the next decade, particularly in renewable energy, construction and nature-based solutions. Adaptation activities, such as building resilient infrastructure, are expected to be a major source of employment as well, generating an estimated 280 million jobs worldwide.

Realizing the potential for new jobs will require unprecedented coordination among governments, business and international financial institutions. The new analysis sets out an Action Agenda across three key pillars:

Intentionality: Embed jobs and skills strategies in national climate and industrial plans, backed by data-driven workforce intelligence and local transition pacts.

Innovation: Build modern, modular training systems and industry-led consortia to align skills with emerging green sectors.

Investment: Treat spending on human capital as investment, not consumption, mobilizing domestic revenues, business incentives, and international finance for long-term workforce development.

Access the Leaders Summary and new research here.

“The transition to a new economy is not a burden, but a historic opportunity to create jobs, empower youth and drive inclusive growth,” said Hon. Dr. Eng. Festus K. Ng’eno, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment, Climate Change, and Forestry, Kenya. “With over 40% of Kenyans employed in agriculture and a rapidly growing youth population, investing in our people’s skills for sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and transport is essential to building a more resilient, competitive and equitable economy for generations to come.”

“The data is clear — the skills needed for jobs are changing faster than ever,” said Allen Blue, Co-Founder of LinkedIn. “Our research shows demand for green talent continues to grow at twice the pace of skills in the workforce. Closing this gap will only happen with urgent, coordinated action to put green training at the core of every climate and business plan. Doing so not only accelerates progress, it connects people to economic opportunity.”

To deliver impact, the Initiative will work across different tracks to bring together knowledge and learning, help to establish country and industry action partnerships and build a movement. Early engagement is underway with countries including Brazil, Cambodia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Africa, Senegal, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, and partnerships are forming with leading development institutions and private-sector coalitions. As a foundation for further cooperation, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH commissioned and published three country case studies (Brazil, Kenya and Pakistan), while the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the German government funded a case study on the impact of skills shortages on global power emissions.

Leaders supporting the new Initiative underscored how the transition to a low-carbon and resilient economy will succeed only if it is powered by skilled, secure and supported workers. They called for a new compact between climate and development actors, positioning human capital as a central pillar of economic and climate transition strategies:

“A people-centered transition is both a moral imperative and an economic necessity,” said Jochen Flasbarth, State Secretary at the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany. “Social protection, opportunities for retraining and job transition policies are key to ensuring that climate ambition remains both politically and socially sustainable.”

“Business and industry have a crucial role to play in this transformation,” said Ricardo Mussa, Chair of Sustainable Business COP30 (SB COP). “Investing in green skills and workforce transformation is not just good for the planet — it’s good for business. By building the talent base for the low-carbon economy, companies can unlock new markets, strengthen supply chains, and deliver sustainable growth.”

“We need a coordinated, whole-of-economy approach with investments in skills and workforce development at the center,” said Dr. Liesbet Steer, Executive Director at Systemiq and lead author of the report. “Our report shows that a people-centered transition can deliver a powerful triple dividend — stronger economies, greater social cohesion, and faster environmental progress.”

“The transition to a low-carbon economy will only succeed if people are positioned to benefit from it and equipped to drive it forward,” said Ani Dasgupta, President & CEO of WRI. “By investing in people’s skills and potential, we turn the challenge of decarbonization into an engine for growth and shared prosperity.”

“Skills shortages put global climate goals at risk. There can be no climate transition without a skills transition,” said Ingrid-Gabriela Hoven, Managing Director at GIZ. “Accelerating green jobs and skills will yield a triple dividend: stronger and more resilient economies, more social cohesion, and faster progress to a low-carbon economy.”

“Philanthropy and private investors are key to unlocking the potential of the new economy,” said Michelle Armstrong, Managing Director at Ares Management and President of the Ares Charitable Foundation. “Catalytic investments in people’s skills, resilience and potential can help empower communities, expand access to good jobs, and build a more inclusive and sustainable economy.”

""As countries implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the right tools and partnerships are essential to build capacity for climate innovation — unlocking the social and economic transformation these commitments aim to deliver,"" said Pablo Vieira, Global Director of the NDC Partnership. ""The Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy will play a key role in expanding this support, helping countries fast-track NDC implementation and investment for a green and just transition.”

The plant is producing hybrid batteries for factories in Kentucky and a Mazda Toyota joint venture in Alabama.

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10 billion in the US to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60 billion,” said Toyota Motor North America president Ted Ogawa.

Toyota’s 11th US factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 GWh annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, US President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. “Go out and buy a Toyota,” Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

“We know there is no single path to progress,” Ogawa said on Wednesday. “That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other automakers like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Momentum is a crucial factor in success in all walks of life. In sports, a high-performance team builds confidence and enthusiasm, often leading to a string of wins. In politics, legislative victories or a growing list of endorsements pressures others to line up in support of a cause or candidate. And in business, a rising stock or product often continues to climb because its momentum attracts attention and leads to growing demand.

In the energy business, momentum in recent years was on the side of renewables, primarily thanks to government subsidies financing wind and solar initiatives and regulations designed to erect roadblocks to legacy energy enterprises.

Clearly, things have changed. The momentum has shifted. Thanks to the Trump administration removing barriers for our most affordable and reliable energy sources, a whirlwind of activity designed to deliver natural gas to consumers across the nation is underway at a frenetic pace.

Just during the last couple of weeks of October alone, various companies announced a flurry of activity. To highlight just a few:

In Louisiana, Williams Companies unveiled a strategic partnership with Woodside Energy “to advance Louisiana pipeline and liquefied natural gas projects,” leading to more capital investment.

The deal involves an investment in the Louisiana LNG project in which Williams “will acquire 80% ownership in and become operator of Driftwood Pipeline LLC, which includes the construction of Line 200, a fully permitted greenfield pipeline connecting Woodside’s Louisiana LNG facility to multiple pipelines, including Transco and Louisiana Energy Gateway.”

Williams said it expects its investment “will total $1.9 billion in capital for development of the pipeline and LNG facilities.”

In Tennessee, East Tennessee Natural Gas, owned by Enbridge, announced that “construction on the 122-mile pipeline through the Upper Cumberland for the Ridgeline Expansion Project will begin soon.” The company said it received a notice to proceed on Oct. 7 from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Construction was expected to begin Nov. 1, according to Enbridge. “The pre-construction activity began on Oct. 20,” according to the report. The pipeline “will supply natural gas to the new Tennessee Valley Authority Kingston Energy Complex.”

In Ohio, a new bill, SB 294, mirrors federal legislation recently introduced by U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R) aimed at qualifying natural gas as clean energy and designed to “compel the Ohio Power Siting Board to favor energy projects it deems both ‘clean and reliable,’” as one industry site described it.

The bill would also “declare renewable sources like wind and solar ‘unreliable.’”

In Texas, Phillips 66 and Kinder Morgan Inc. announced “the commencement of a binding open season for transportation service on the Western Gateway Pipeline (Western Gateway), a newly proposed refined products pipeline system.”

The project “will facilitate the transportation of refined products from origin points in Texas to key downstream markets in Arizona and California, with connectivity to Las Vegas, Nevada via Kinder Morgan’s CALNEV Pipeline.”

A press release spelled out an impressive delivery network across parts of Texas, Arizona, Missouri, California and Nevada.

Compare the level of excitement and activity for legacy energy with the worries and warnings coming from the renewables industry about its own state of play, including on the world stage.

BloombergNEF recently held a London summit with renewables leaders to address the fact that “the European renewables boom is colliding with growing systemic pains. Record levels of negative power prices, particularly in Spain, are reshaping how risk is distributed across producers and buyers of renewable electricity.”

One of the topics was Europe’s Contract for Difference (CfD) model, which amounts to a contract between a renewables company and a government-backed counter-party agreeing on a fixed price for wholesale electricity. The idea is to stabilize revenues for renewables while encouraging investment by removing fear of volatile electricity prices. In other words, it’s one more way for the government to artificially prop up the renewables industry.

Encouragingly, one panelist at the summit seemed impressively grounded in reality. Dr. Alexandra von Bernstorff, managing partner for Luxcara, a German-based company specializing in renewable energy investments, said she was not a fan of CfDs because “they made the industry lazy.”

“We need to face the fact that we have a product and we have to sell the product like everyone else,” she said. “And I need to think about, do I have connections or not? Do I have customers or not? Can I produce cheap enough or not? As an industry, we should have gotten into these questions much earlier. So I’m a big fan of having free market negotiations. And if it’s difficult, then become creative.”

Wow. Such refreshing economic practicality almost provides hope for the renewables industry after all. Sadly, as Dr. von Bernstorff noted, her opinion on CfDs is not widely shared across the European renewables industry.

The renewables industry is dealing with “systemic pains” and second-guessing its approach in Europe, despite the overwhelming support of government leaders, as Europeans nervously face an uncertain energy future. In the U.S., meanwhile, new projects and improved delivery networks for our most affordable and reliable energy sources are being regularly implemented across multiple states.

Nissan Leaf

The pioneer of the mass-market EV industry remains, for now, the most affordable way into a new electric vehicle. The third-generation Nissan Leaf is still holding the line on price, reducing entry barriers to EV ownership for USA buyers.

Starting at an MSRP of around $29,990 USD, the Leaf is undeniably the cheapest electric car on this list. Despite its low price, there’s no compromises when it comes to range, with even the entry level S+ trim offering an EPA-estimated range of 303 miles thanks to a large 75 kWh battery.

This entry model still packs a decent list of standard equipment, including wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, remote climate control, a 28-inch driver display, and more. With the front-driven electric motor offering up 214 horsepower, it’s got more than enough power to easily merge onto highways too.

Chevrolet Equinox EV

For those in the market for a compact SUV that’s also fully-electric, Chevrolet’s latest Equinox EV is another strong choice. Prices for the entry-level LT1 start at $35,100 USD, and it’s no surprise that this car is Chevrolet’s best selling electric car.

This EV delivers an EPA-estimated range of up to 319 miles, making it the longest range EV available at this price point. It’s a no-compromise replacement for a similarly sized gasoline option, offering ample space inside and strong on-road performance thanks to its 220 horsepower electric motor.

For the 2026 model year, the Equinox EV also comes with a native NACS charging port, further future proofing this American-made EV by offering a seamless gateway to Tesla’s Supercharger network.

Fiat 500e

With its iconic European styling and small form factor, the Fiat 500e is the style icon on this cheap EV list, offering bags of personality for an MSRP starting price of $30,500 USD. With an EPA-rated range of around 153 miles, the 500e is more suited for urban driving, as opposed to the mile-munching capabilities of other cars on this list such as the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Equinox EV.

DC fast charging capability means the Fiat 500e can also be recharged in a flash, on the correct public charger – allowing for 40 miles of range to be added in as little as five minutes.

Hyundai Kona Electric

The Kona Electric is another affordable compact SUV on this list, offering a compelling blend of range, tech, and utility in a segment-favorite crossover package.

The entry-level Kona Electric SE starts at approximately $32,795 USD. With an EPA estimated range of 261 miles, and standard equipment such as Hyundai’s dual-screen infotainment setup, connectivity features, and a spacious cabin, this is a great affordable all rounder.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

There isn’t a consensus on how many hours of backup power a data center needs, Limandibhratha said.
The public debate about such issues is new for the data center industry, which hasn’t been accustomed to such scrutiny.
“Maybe you can’t do it all with battery storage, but you also don’t need to just rely on diesel generators,” Wamsted said.","“Five nines.”

In the world of data centers, ensuring a facility will be online 99.999 percent of the time, is everything. Access to power is the number one priority when developers are trying to figure out where to build the warehouses storing supercomputers that in recent years have grown beyond what was previously imaginable.

In order to ensure five nines, data center developers secure power in various ways: They’ll seek to connect to the grid, build out or buy their own behind-the-meter power supply—typically in the form of gas-fired generation—and lastly, host multiple backup generators on site.

These generators commonly run on diesel. The refined crude oil has become the industry standard to ensure around-the-clock access to power as developers in Texas await a new state regulation that empowers the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the state’s grid operators, to disconnect large power users like data centers at times of peak demand. Backup generators have also become vital to developers as slow supply chains delay onsite gas turbine installations.

The preferred backup power source for data centers are big air polluters, which environmentalists and industry experts say could be highly problematic unless clear rules are established and enforced for limiting diesel generator use.

While these backup generators are meant to be used rarely outside of maintenance testing, there is concern that as ERCOT employs its new powers to force data centers off the grid in times of peak demand, the diesel generators will run more frequently.

Diesel generators are rife with environmental issues. They are expensive to run and face limits from federal, state and local regulators on noise and air pollution. Diesel emits harmful pollutants that the American Cancer Society links to heart and lung disease and cancer.

Yet despite such obvious health impacts, those operating diesel generators are typically only required to self-report emissions to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA may issue compliance inspections and facility evaluations to ensure that projects are abiding by the rules for regulated pollutants.

Diesel generators used as backup power in Texas are most commonly permitted by the TCEQ, as long as the hours they run don’t exceed 10 percent of the annual operations of the primary power source. TCEQ grants those operating diesel generators either a standard permit or a case-by-case new source review permit.

With some data center developers looking to build single projects that consume more electric power than cities, there’s concern that the self-reported emissions from diesel generators used to provide backup power will exceed limits under the Clean Air Act.

Federally, there are no time limits on the use of these diesel generators during emergencies. The EPA sees emergencies as situations resulting from sudden and reasonably unforeseeable events, like a grid power failure, gas plants unexpectedly shutting off or natural disasters. Under such circumstances, the operator of the generator is responsible for logging the emergency and reporting which steps were taken to mitigate emissions.

But for non-emergencies, like machine testing, diesel generators are federally limited to 100 hours. Fifty of those 100 hours can be used for demand response programs—grid or transmission operators paying large load users like data centers to switch to backup generators to reduce stress on the grid.

This comes as Texas’ largest metropolitan areas—Houston-Galveston-Brazoria, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso and San Antonio— already violate air quality standards, according to the EPA.

There are companies in gas-rich Texas promoting a switch to portable natural gas generators, which burn cheaper fuel that is better suited for long-term use with less air pollution. One gas generator company, Generac, said in a white paper that its gas generators emit 95 percent less nitrogen oxides, a significant contributor to smog and acid rain; 98 percent less non-methane hydrocarbons and 59 percent less carbon monoxide. But natural gas, unlike diesel fuel, can’t be stored on site.

Because diesel can be stored on site and is readily available, it has become the preferred energy source for most backup or emergency generators, said Brandon Seale, a longtime gas executive and former president of West Texas Gas, recently rebranded as WTG Energy.

“You can find it in a bunch of different places,” Seale said to a crowd at a data center conference in October. “And so people like that.”

Diesel generators are regularly used in mining, agriculture and energy. Given data centers’ exceptionally large electricity demands and 24-hour use times, projects are sited with numerous large diesel generators.

While data centers already use all sources of redundancy in order to maintain their reliability, as more grid operators around the country like ERCOT trend toward curtailing data centers at times of peak demand, the facilities will likely need even more backup systems, said Nathalie Limandibhratha, BloombergNEF’s U.S. power analyst.

There isn’t a consensus on how many hours of backup power a data center needs, Limandibhratha said. But given the shifting rules regarding large loads in ERCOT, some business leaders are considering having 50 to 100 hours of backup generation onsite, she said.

Diesel generators are the cheapest way for data centers to meet shifting industry standards for on-site backup with on-site fuel supply, said Chris Miller, president of The Piedmont Environmental Council, a Virginia-based nonprofit that has been tracking the environmental impacts of the data center industry across Virginia, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the world. But these generators also produce the most toxic air pollution.

In any other industry use, generating as much power from diesel as is required by data centers in any metropolitan area in the U.S. would trigger Clean Air Act violations, he said. However, by using emergency permitting, the pollution is allowed, Miller said.

“Diesel combustion is one of the dirtiest forms of generation we know,” Miller said. “It’s only supposed to be for emergency use.”

But conversations happening at both the federal and state levels consider allowing waivers from the Clean Air Act for an expanded range of grid scenarios, he said. His concern is that while grid and data center operators try to solve for grid reliability by curtailing and using backup power, air quality impacts are not being considered.

His fear is that the default will become using these diesel generators for longer and longer periods of time.

The public debate about such issues is new for the data center industry, which hasn’t been accustomed to such scrutiny. For years, the industry operated in relative secrecy, building big warehouses to support everyday internet functions like Gmail, iCloud and Amazon Prime.

But as the industry transforms grids across the country and drives electricity demand to record levels, it finds itself at the center of a storm of protest in communities nationwide. Residents across the country are becoming increasingly concerned about rising power costs, pollution, zoning and water usage related to data centers, many of which are massive in size.

As Texas follows in the footsteps of Virginia’s so-called “Data Center Alley,” building out huge amounts of infrastructure and incorporating these large loads onto its grid, Miller warns about the looming consequences of allowing the industry to steam ahead before rules are settled.

In attempts to get online faster as interconnection queues grow, Miller said some data centers are getting permits for a power generation unit they claim is temporary and will be used as backup power once they’re connected to the grid, but end up using it as the primary power source as they wait to get on the grid.

“We’re starting to see specific proposals that say, ‘Well, don’t worry about the air quality effects. We’re just trying to come online in a timely fashion,’’’ Miller said. “But what they’re really saying is, ‘We want to operate outside the rules.’”

Some big tech companies say they are looking to reduce their growing emissions while trying to stay competitive in the race to develop artificial intelligence. While Microsoft’s emissions grew by nearly 25 percent from fiscal years 2020 to 2024, the company has committed to becoming carbon negative by 2030. To get there, Microsoft says it plans to phase out the use of petroleum-based diesel generators as a backup power for its data centers by 2030, partly by adopting “renewable diesel variations” and procuring hydrogenated vegetable oils to reduce their emissions.

An alternative future to diesel generators could include diversifying backup power options to include battery storage, renewables, natural gas or cleaner diesel products, Duke University’s Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability concluded in a February report.

Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the nonprofit Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, warned against the widespread use of diesel generators. “On a 30,000-foot level, it’s a terrible idea,” Wamsted said. “They’re noisy, they have to be tested all the time if they aren’t running. They are not very friendly, if you will.”

The local air pollution undoubtedly will lead to issues, he said.

Wamsted said that large-scale battery storage has great potential in this application and could be used even in combination with diesel generators to lower a site’s overall environmental and noise pollution, as well as running costs.

“Maybe you can’t do it all with battery storage, but you also don’t need to just rely on diesel generators,” Wamsted said.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-2194970695-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:03:37.724633

Donate to sustain Prism’s mission and the humans behind it.

The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), India’s largest Hindu far-right organization, initiated a well-funded lobbying effort in the U.S. earlier this year, a Prism investigation has found.

Prism is the first news outlet to report that Squire Patton Boggs, one of the top lobbying firms in the U.S., registered as a lobbyist on Jan. 16 for the RSS, according to lobbying disclosures. In the first three quarters of 2025, Squire Patton Boggs received $330,000 to lobby officials in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on behalf of the RSS, according to lobbying reports. This marks the first time the RSS has hired lobbyists in the U.S., according to public records.

In September, the RSS marked 100 years since its founding in 1925. The organization was established to promote what critics and human rights groups describe as a Hindu state; its followers have been accused of targeting Muslims and other minorities with discrimination, harassment, and violence. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s political party emerged from the RSS, and Modi himself was once a worker for the organization.

The RSS’s lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., raise questions among experts on foreign influence operations about how the RSS has been able to conduct its activities without identifying as a foreign entity or without Squire Patton Boggs registering under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), a 1938 law that requires transparency from representatives of foreign interests. Public records confirm that neither Squire Patton Boggs nor any other organization is registered as an agent for the RSS under FARA. It is unclear whether Squire Patton Boggs is required to register as a foreign agent of the RSS.

The RSS and Squire Patton Boggs did not respond to Prism’s requests for comment.

The paperwork—filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (LDA), a transparency law for activities to influence the federal government—does not list the RSS as Squire Patton Boggs’ direct client. Rather, the client is State Street Strategies doing business as the lobbying firm One+ Strategies on behalf of the RSS.

In Squire Patton Boggs’ lobbying registration form for the RSS, the general lobbying issue is noted as foreign relations, and the specific lobbying issue is “U.S.-India bilateral relations.” The focus on relations between the two countries strongly suggests that the firm’s activities should be registered under FARA, experts told Prism.

“Registering under the LDA and not FARA really keeps this influence campaign in the shadows,” said Ben Freeman, director of the Democratizing Foreign Policy program at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and a leading expert on lobbying and foreign influence in the U.S. “And so, we really don’t have much idea at all about what [the lobbyists] are doing for the RSS.”

In India, the RSS has grown its influence in part by providing social services for local communities through charity programs, schools, and environmental disaster relief. In the U.S., however, the group has been the subject of political and media scrutiny in recent years over its ties to Modi, whose Hindu nationalist, anti-Muslim politics have turned the secular democracy into an “electoral autocracy.”

Raqib Hameed Naik, the founder and executive director of the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, a D.C.-based think tank that researches political extremism, said the RSS’s lobbying activities in the U.S. could be part of a campaign to alter how it is perceived outside of India.

“The RSS might have become a mainstream force in Indian politics, but globally, it is still seen as a fascist paramilitary group,” he told Prism. “So what they’re trying to do right now is to invest in changing the perception of the policymakers.”

Who are the RSS’s lobbyists?

Over the past century, the RSS has grown from a small, fringe volunteer paramilitary group into the most influential right-wing Hindu organization in India. The early leaders of the all-male organization praised Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, and a member of the RSS assassinated Mahatma Gandhi in 1948. Today, RSS members participate in drills and marches at training camps, and critics say the group’s methods of mass mobilization and targeting of minorities are rooted in its fascist origins.

The RSS serves as the ideological fountainhead of the broader Sangh Parivar, a network of Hindu right-wing organizations encompassing education, social services, and labor. A few years after India’s independence from British colonial rule in 1947, the Sangh developed a political wing in order to enter electoral politics. In 1980, erstwhile members of the political wing formed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Critics accuse the RSS, the BJP, and its affiliates of instigating harassment and violence toward Muslims, Christians, and other religious minorities. Notably, those groups led a campaign to build a Hindu temple at the site of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya that culminated in the destruction of the mosque by activists in 1992, triggering a series of communal riots that were among the deadliest in Indian history. Last year, Modi attended the consecration ceremony for the newly built temple.

Since Modi and the BJP’s ascent to power in 2014, Indians have witnessed major democratic backsliding and a cascade of anti-minority politics and policies. The RSS remains closely linked to the BJP: Several of the party’s top leaders, including Modi, emerged from the RSS’s rank and file. “Their only interest has always been love towards the nation,” Modi said of the RSS at a centenary event in October.

While U.S. nonprofits have spread the RSS’s ideology among Hindu communities domestically, the RSS has now turned its attention to lawmakers.

According to quarterly lobbying reports, Squire Patton Boggs received payments totaling $330,000 during the first three quarters of 2025 for its work with the RSS.

Four Squire Patton Boggs lobbyists are listed in the reports: Bradford Ellison, Ludmilla Kasulke, Bill Shuster, and Rebekah Sungala. Ellison and Kasulke have experience lobbying Congress on behalf of foreign governments: Ellison previously represented Ethiopia and Benin, and Kasulke has represented South Korea and the umbrella organization for the Syrian opposition, according to FARA filings. Shuster served as a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania from 2001 to 2019; Sungala was a congressional staffer in his office. Bill Shuster’s brother Bob Shuster is a co-founder of One+ Strategies, the firm listed in the disclosures as working on behalf of the RSS. Neither the lobbyists nor One+ Strategies responded to requests for comment.

Email communications obtained by Prism, along with an article in an RSS publication, shed light on how Squire Patton Boggs and One+ Strategies have engaged with the RSS this year.

On Jan. 16, Ellison reached out to Audrey Truschke, a historian and professor at Rutgers University–Newark. Truschke, who has extensively researched the Hindu right, was contacted as part of the lobbyists’ efforts to conduct research about the RSS, according to an email obtained by Prism.

“Our team was recently retained by Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to educate lawmakers about RSS’s mission and impact, as the organization marks its centenary. This effort calls for us to develop a comprehensive understanding of RSS’s history, including historical controversies associated with the group,” Ellison wrote. “Accordingly, we would appreciate meeting with you in February to understand your perspective on the RSS’s history and current impact.”

Truschke’s reply was short. “Thanks for reaching out. Please let me know your status under FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) for this advocacy work.”

“I never heard back from them,” she told Prism.

In June, the Shuster brothers and Ellison were among the guests at an RSS event in Nagpur, India, where the group is headquartered. Neither the RSS nor local news reports indicated that the Shusters and Ellison are the RSS’s lobbyists.

The lobbyists visited an RSS training camp and met with members, according to an article in an RSS publication. The article called the visit “a significant moment in Indo-US civil society engagement, signaling growing interest among American policymakers in understanding India’s indigenous institutions beyond government and corporate corridors.” The article noted that the visit came weeks after a military conflict between India and Pakistan.

Also part of the “high-profile United States delegation,” according to the article, were Walter Russell Mead, a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, and Bill Drexel, a think tank specialist on U.S.-India relations. Mead and Drexel are both fellows at the Hudson Institute, a right-wing think tank based in Washington, D.C. Mead and Drexel did not respond to requests for comment.

The RSS also appears to have enlisted a pharmaceutical executive based in Massachusetts to help promote the group during its centenary.

The lobbying registration between Squire Patton Boggs, One+ Strategies, and the RSS lists Vivek Sharma as “an entity other than the client that contributes more than $5,000 to the lobbying activities in a quarterly period” and either participates in or supervises the registrant’s lobbying activities. Sharma is the executive chair of Cohance Lifesciences, a drug manufacturer based in Boston with major operations in India. The address given for Sharma on the form matches that of his company’s financial filing. Sharma has also been listed as a mentor of Ekal Vidyalaya, a U.S.-based nonprofit that reportedly has links to the Sangh Parivar and runs a network of schools in rural India that have been accused of imparting divisive teachings that preach Hindu superiority to children. Sharma did not respond to a request for comment.

In October, Jim Geraghty, a contributing columnist at The Washington Post, attended an RSS event in Nagpur marking the group’s 100th anniversary. Geraghty, who is a political correspondent for the conservative magazine The National Review, wrote in his column, “My trip was sponsored by the Hudson Institute and the Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies, whose president is affiliated with RSS.”

The Foundation for India and Indian Diaspora Studies (FIIDS) is a U.S.-based nonprofit that regularly hosts events to “strengthen the U.S.-India partnership,” according to its website, featuring high-ranking Indian officials such as the country’s foreign minister and the ambassador to the U.S. FIIDS also brings together U.S. lawmakers to “underscore the deepening strategic and bilateral relationship between the two nations.” FIIDS is not registered under FARA.

The nonprofit’s president, Khanderao Kand, was reported as being a member of the Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS), an organization that has been likened to being the RSS’s branch in the U.S. Kand also reportedly served as HSS’s national public relations coordinator.

Hudson Institute, FIIDS, and Kand did not respond to requests for comment.

The RSS’s lobbying efforts have raised concerns among multiple experts about whether the activities fall under the purview of FARA.

Legal questions over foreign lobbying status

After reviewing the lobbying disclosures, three experts on foreign influence in U.S. politics told Prism that per lobbying regulations, the RSS would be considered a foreign entity and Squire Patton Boggs should be registered as a foreign agent for the RSS.

The registration form under the LDA asks if there is any foreign entity that holds at least 20% equitable ownership in the client or “directly or indirectly, in whole or in major part, plans, supervises, controls, directs, finances or subsidizes activities of the client or any organization.” In Squire Patton Boggs’ registration, there is a check in the box next to “No,” despite the RSS employing One+ Strategies, the listed client, to act on its behalf.

“This is clearly, just unquestionably, a foreign entity as far as the LDA is concerned. They should have checked ‘yes’ in that foreign entities box,” said Freeman of the Quincy Institute. “What matters is who the ultimate client is. And the ultimate client here, according to this document, is the RSS, which is a foreign entity.”

Squire Patton Boggs did not respond to a question from Prism about why the firm had not listed RSS as a foreign entity.

Dan Auble, a senior researcher at OpenSecrets who oversees the watchdog group’s lobbying database, told Prism that according to LDA guidelines published by Congress, the RSS should disclose itself as a foreign entity. “The guide is actually quoting the law itself,” said Auble, who also directs OpenSecrets’ Foreign Lobby Watch program.

The section in the guidelines on “Listing Foreign Entities” provides more specific guidance on what constitutes an indirect client. “The purpose of the disclosure is to identify the interests of the foreign entity that may be operating behind the registrant,” the document explains.

“If the RSS in India is funding or controlling the lobbying effort, or if they are affiliated and have a direct interest, then there should be disclosure of [Squire Patton Boggs’] ties to a foreign entity,” Auble told Prism.

When Squire Patton Boggs registered as a lobbyist for the RSS under the LDA, the firm entered the code for foreign relations as the “general lobbying issue area.” The “specific lobbying issues (current and anticipated)” is “U.S.-India bilateral relations.” In the subsequent quarterly filings, however, the specific lobbying issue is to “introduce the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to U.S. officials.”

“My conclusion is that ‘U.S.-India bilateral relations’ is within the FARA rules. RSS should have been registered under FARA instead,” said James Thurber, distinguished professor of government emeritus at American University and a co-editor of the book, “Congress and Diaspora Politics: The Influence of Ethnic and Foreign Lobbying.”

Freeman agreed. “To me, what jumps out is that line in the registration statement where it does say their activities are U.S.-India bilateral relations,” he told Prism. “I can’t think of any exemption that they would fall under.”

Some firms registered under LDA can qualify for a FARA exemption. However, if a foreign government or a foreign political party is the principal beneficiary, this exemption does not apply. Because the disclosure mentions “U.S.-India bilateral relations” and the RSS has a close proximity to the ruling regime in India, Freeman said, “that raises a very important question of whether they should be registered under FARA and not the LDA for this work.”

The lobbying classifications matter, experts say, because registrants under FARA have to publicly disclose significantly more about which lawmakers they engage as well as other particulars, such as details of meetings, emails, texts, calls, receipts, transactions, and disbursements. Under the LDA, the RSS’s lobbyists do not need to disclose any such details.

The Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives, which administer the LDA, did not respond to requests for comment.

This is not the first time the lobbying activities of a Hindu nationalist organization have raised concerns over federal violations.

After operating in the U.S. for almost 30 years, Overseas Friends of the BJP-USA (OFBJP-USA) registered as a foreign agent of the BJP under FARA in 2020. OFBJP-USA has reportedly campaigned for the BJP, including during Indian elections. The group has also facilitated trips to the U.S. for BJP leaders, hosted them at events, and promoted them through social media initiatives.

In August 2020, an Indian news website reported that a member of OFBJP-USA criticized Joe Biden’s presidential campaign and his selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate. As questions were raised about the propriety of the member’s statement as a part of OFBJP-USA, the group clarified that his views did not reflect its own. Less than 10 days later, the group registered under FARA.

The Indian government, too, has hired lobbyists in Washington. India has long been represented by BGR Government Affairs, and this year, it contracted with two more lobbying firms. In April, the Indian Embassy signed a contract worth $1.8 million annually with SHW Partners. The firm’s activities for India include government relations and perception management, according to FARA filings.

Less than 10 days after President Donald Trump imposed a 50% tariff on India in August as alleged retaliation for India purchasing Russian oil during the Ukraine war, the Indian Embassy hired another lobbying firm, Mercury Public Affairs. The Indian government is paying Mercury $75,000 a month, per FARA filings, for services that include federal government relations, media relations, and paid advertising. The government of India did not respond to a request for comment about Squire Patton Boggs’ lobbying on “U.S.-India bilateral relations” on behalf of the RSS.

In February, the Trump administration took aim at FARA with a memo from Attorney General Pam Bondi that pared back enforcement of the law and disbanded the FBI’s Foreign Influence Task Force.

“The problem right now is that with Trump as the new president, he’s explicitly announced that he’s not going to actively enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act,” Thurber said. The Department of Justice, which administers FARA, did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite the RSS lobbyists’ efforts to change the group’s image among U.S. lawmakers, Naik, of the Center for the Study of Organized Hate, said the influence campaign could easily be challenged by decades of publicly available information about the RSS.

“Documentation of a century of all their activities is literally available to anyone,” he said.

Leveraging over 24 billion proprietary VIN-level data points and more than a decade of machine learning innovation, the report delivers unmatched insight into the state of the automotive retail market, including new and used vehicle performance, pricing trends, inventory risk, and consumer behavior. Click here to access the full Q3 Quarterly Vincensus Report.

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Key Findings

Inventory and Pricing Trends

New vehicle day supply increased by 5 days QoQ to 62 days (up 1 day YoY)

Used vehicle day supply increased by 1 day QoQ to 40 days (up 4 days YoY)

Carryover for new vehicles decreased 2% QoQ to 52%; used increased 7% QoQ to 50%

Aged ending inventory decreased 3% QoQ to 42% for new vehicles and held steady at 48% for used

Units sold with a markdown increased by 1% QoQ for new vehicles and 3% QoQ for used

EV, Hybrid, and ICE Performance

New EV sales surged 72% QoQ, while hybrids rose 7% and ICE vehicles 9%

EVs made up just 5% of all sales, signaling that the surge is short-term and incentive-driven

New EV day supply dropped to 61 days and used EV day supply to 36 days — both below ICE averages

Average list price of sold new units: EVs $55,510; hybrids $44,100; ICEs $41,857

For used vehicles, EV prices fell 3% QoQ to $28,888, while ICE and hybrid prices remained stable

Market Dynamics and Competition

The stabilization of inventory has introduced new challenges, particularly for brands with aging 2025 stock

Dealers are expected to face the most aggressive pricing environment in years, with manufacturer incentives rising sharply to move inventory

Markdown strategies and real-time decisioning are becoming critical for profitability

Lotlinx Dealer Performance

Lotlinx dealers continued to outperform the broader market during Q3. On average, Lotlinx dealers had 1% less aged inventory for new vehicles and 4% less for used vehicles compared to the market.

It first introduced the plan in December 2021 to produce batteries for its hybrid and electric vehicles (EVs). Batteries from the plant are set to power hybrid versions of the Camry, Corolla Cross, RAV4, and a yet-to-be-announced, all-electric, three-row-battery vehicle. The plant is producing hybrid batteries for factories in Kentucky and a Mazda and Toyota joint venture in Alabama.

“Over the next five years, we are planning an additional investment of $10bn in the US to further grow our manufacturing capabilities, bringing our total investment in this country to over $60bn,” said Ted Ogawa, president of Toyota Motor North America.

Toyota’s 11th US factory, on a 1,850-acre (749-hectare) site, will be able to produce 30 gigawatt-hours of energy annually at full capacity and house 14 battery production lines for plug-in hybrids and full EVs. It will eventually employ 5,000 workers.

Last month in Japan, US President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10bn investment in the United States.

“Go out and buy a Toyota,” said Trump, who has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and has imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest carmakers to move to full EVs, but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

“We know there is no single path to progress”, Ogawa said on Wednesday.

“That’s why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.”

Other car companies like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivised EV sales.

US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event that the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under former US President Joe Biden, a Democrat, for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.

Beyond its assembly plant, Scout this year announced a $300 million investment for a “supplier park” for smaller parts manufacturers to service the South Carolina factory.","Scout Motors, an upstart electric vehicle company that plans a $2 billion assembly plant in South Carolina, is putting its headquarters in Charlotte’s Plaza-Midwood neighborhood. A $207 million is projected, along with as many as 1,200 jobs are expected, at an average salary of $172,000, state officials said.

Scout is backed by German automotive giant Volkswagen Group, which bought the Scout trademark in 2021. An incentives plan was approved at today’s meeting of the state Economic Investment Committee. Total state and local incentives are expected to be in the $50 million range, hinging on hitting jobs and investment targets.

The company’s plans to enter Charlotte were discussed at today’s meeting of the neighborhood business association, according to Tonya Wilson, president of the affiliated Plaza-Midwood Neighborhood Association and Clifton Castelloe, a longtime board member of the merchants group.

Gov. Josh Stein plans to attend an economic development announcement at 2 p.m. today at the Commonwealth development, where Scout is establishing offices. The Charlotte Ledger was first to report Scout’s interest in the site.

Scout has said it will invest $2 billion in the Blythewood, South Carolina, plant with a goal of making 200,000 vehicles annually once it is fully operational. The company has said it expects to start production in 2027 and eventually employ as many as 4,000 people.

“That’s kinda neat to have that kind of auto business in our neighborhood,” says Wilson, who owns the Wiloe Home & Gift store in Plaza-Midwood. “We are an evolving, established neighborhood that appreciates history and our small businesses and closeness as neighbors. We want anyone who comes here to be part of that.”

“We think it’s a great sign for neighborhood development and economic growth in our area,” says Castelloe, who with his wife Michelle owns the Moxie Mercantile shop in Plaza-Midwood. “We’re absolutely thrilled to welcome them.”

The company says it is planning to make electric SUVs called “Travelers” and “Terra” trucks priced at $60,000 or less. Plug-in hybrid versions of Scout’s models are also planned. Blythewood is about 70 miles south of Charlotte and the North Carolina border.

A $5 million training hub at Midlands Tech Northeast, a community college in the Columbia area, recently opened to help train workers for the new plant. More than 14,000 people have sent emails expressing interest in working at Scout, Tim Hardee, president of South Carolina’s Technical College system, told The State newspaper in Columbia this week.

Scout CEO Scott Keogh told the Carolina Business Review TV program in Charlotte that the company’s headquarters could have “upwards of 1,000 high-paying jobs.” He is a veteran VW executive.

Elimination of tax incentives for electric vehicles and relatively high vehicle prices has prompted General Motors and other manufacturers to pull back on some of their EV plans. But Scout says it anticipated the changes and is ready to compete as more consumers favor EVs over gas-powered vehicles.

“We’re able to operate in this current environment because we’re set from the ground up to build in America, at our new facility in Blythewood, South Carolina,” Keogh told Car and Driver in September.

“Our intent always was exactly what we are seeing now with the administration and everything else. … Our product is coming in 2027 and 2028. The incentives were always going away in 2032. So there’s no way in the world we would build a so-called 50-year factory like we are in Blythewood based on a four-year window.”

Scout plans to sell vehicles directly to consumers, without a dealer network, which has sparked some lawsuits from some trade associations. North Carolina lawmakers have shown limited interest in allowing manufacturers to sell cars without dealer involvement, with the exception of EV pioneer Tesla.

Beyond its assembly plant, Scout this year announced a $300 million investment for a “supplier park” for smaller parts manufacturers to service the South Carolina factory.

Volkswagen Group had revenue of $353 billion in 2024. It sells more cars globally than any other company except Toyota.

The Commonwealth development is owned by Charlotte developer Crosland Southeast and asset manager Nuveen Real Estate, which is a subsidiary of TIAA. Crosland Southeast bought the mostly undeveloped 12-acre site in 2020 from a local real estate investor. It has built the Rowe apartment development there.

Jon Husted, R-Ohio, on Newsmax Wednesday praised Republicans and President Donald Trump for delivering tax relief, reviving American energy production, and lowering gas prices, saying those results are now clear for working families.

Husted said on “National Report” that Republicans “gave working families the largest tax cut they’ve ever had in American history … eliminated taxes on tips and overtime [and] cut taxes on Social Security.”

He added, “So we’re letting people keep more of what they earn.”

Husted also credited renewed energy production for easing costs at the pump.

“One of the things you see dramatically gone down since last year are gas prices because we eliminated all the [former President Joe] Biden-era prohibitions on drilling and so forth on energy,” Husted said.

Husted argued that Republicans have kept their promises, while Democrats “didn’t accomplish anything other than put people through 43 days of pain and unnecessary suffering” during the recent government shutdown.

“We finally, as Republicans, did what we said we would do,” he said.

Husted also criticized Democratic Party leadership, saying Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and his allies “got the Democrats into a shutdown that they could not get their way out of.”

He said it took “more moderate Democrats” to cross over and work with Republicans to reopen the government.

“The Democrats have been taken over by the radical left,” Husted said.

“Since Obamacare was put in place, healthcare inflation has been the number one driver of inflation in this country,” he added. “And the Democrats put that in place, not Republicans.”

He argued that Republicans can now show they are the party of affordability.

“We want to make healthcare more affordable,” Husted said. “We want to empower consumers, stop sending payments directly to insurance companies, and give consumers the ability to shop for their healthcare and drive down the cost.”

Husted said the GOP’s record proves its economic approach works.

“We’re responsible,” he said.

“We’re letting people keep more of what they earn. We’re attacking the bad policies that Democrats put in place and showing that there’s a pathway forward to make things more affordable.”

Meeting that demand while reducing emissions requires expanding every viable source of clean, firm energy. Nuclear power, with its ability to deliver reliable, firm zero-carbon electricity and heat at scale and speed, remains indispensable to that strategy.

At COP28 in Dubai, 22 nations pledged under the Net-Zero Nuclear (NZN) initiative to work toward tripling global nuclear capacity by 2050, marking a historic recognition of nuclear energy’s central role in achieving a clean energy future. Two years on, as the world attends COP30 in Belém, that commitment offers an opportunity to take stock of progress made.

From Washington to Brussels, governments are increasingly placing nuclear energy at the heart of their clean energy and industrial strategies. Yet progress since COP29 toward the NZN goal continues to face persistent hurdles, chiefly around financing, regulatory modernization, and supply chain readiness.

U.S. leads with ambitious federal push for nuclear expansion and innovation

The United States has made nuclear energy a pillar of its domestic and international climate and energy policy. The Trump 2.0 Administration’s “Make Atoms Great Again” agenda has reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to scaling the sector, with executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity by 2050. The policy focus includes:

Accelerating the licensing and construction of new reactors, including advanced and small modular designs;

Modernizing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to accommodate next-generation technologies while maintaining independence and transparency;

Strengthening U.S. nuclear fuel supply chains to reduce reliance on foreign enrichment;

Expanding reactor exports to bolster U.S. global competitiveness; and

Building the American nuclear workforce to meet the growing demand for skilled engineers and operators.

These steps mark a clear ambition to deploy nuclear energy but, as we’ve previously outlined, achieving the Administration’s targets will require a far more muscular approach to deployment and financing. While the retention of key tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act is valuable, large-scale deployment will not happen without deeper federal involvement to reduce risk, streamline project delivery, and promote investment.

Specifically, the U.S. needs to focus on establishing clear “orderbooks” of standardized reactor builds that enable cost reductions through economies of scale, rather than focusing on isolated projects. Federal cost-overrun insurance and expanded use of tools like loan guarantees and power purchase agreements could help de-risk early projects. Without these measures, the Administration’s goal of quadrupling U.S. nuclear capacity will remain aspirational. Beyond policy, the U.S. Army’s plan to deploy microreactors to power domestic bases illustrates nuclear energy’s growing appeal for energy security and resilience applications.

In a historic first, Palisades nuclear plant set to restart operation

The Holtec Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan is entering the final phase of a historic restart, with commercial operations expected by late 2025. Following NRC approval and fuel delivery, Palisades will become the first U.S. nuclear plant ever restarted from decommissioning.

This milestone underscores the value of extending and revitalizing existing nuclear assets, opening new possibilities for other prematurely shuttered plants.

Europe’s political realignment anchors nuclear as key part of its energy strategy

Across Europe, political attitudes toward nuclear power are shifting rapidly. Once considered peripheral, nuclear energy is now seen as essential for decarbonization, competitiveness, and energy security.

The European Nuclear Alliance among Member States creates a powerful bloc pushing for technology-neutral policies across EU institutions. Even Germany’s participation as an observer marks a tentative but notable potential recalibration in its stance toward EU-wide nuclear policymaking.

Recent policy updates are also laying the foundation for a European nuclear resurgence:

Revised State Aid Rules from the European Commission have clarified how Member States can support nuclear energy through subsidies, contracts-for-difference (CfDs), and other mechanisms, recognizing nuclear’s strategic value to the bloc.

The Programme for Nuclear Energy (PINC) update assesses national commitments to deploy at least 60 GW of new large-scale nuclear capacity by 2050, which could be supplemented by dozens of gigawatts of SMR capacity depending on market conditions (See our recommendations here).

The European Industrial Alliance on SMRs released its Strategic Action Plan, advancing standardization, regulatory alignment, and supply chain development to accelerate deployment.

Meanwhile, the UK’s Final Investment Decision on Sizewell C and its selection of the Rolls-Royce SMR design for further development signal that Europe’s nuclear ambitions are translating into action.

Together, these steps are laying the foundation for nuclear energy to fulfill its role in delivering a secure, low-carbon energy mix across Europe, but concrete and actionable plans on financing, bolstering supply chains, readying the workforce, and standardizing regulatory frameworks are crucial to building on this momentum.

COP30 ambitions

At COP30, global ambitions to triple nuclear capacity remain strong, but implementation and financing lag behind political momentum. The past year has seen a remarkable convergence of political will in both the U.S. and Europe. The challenge now is to translate commitments into concrete deployments, ensure fit-for-purpose regulatory environments, and mobilize capital at scale.

With climate finance again high on the COP agenda, world leaders have an opportunity to anchor nuclear energy within broader climate investment frameworks, helping nations secure reliable, zero-carbon power while strengthening economic resilience.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/03150558/nuclear-playbook.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:45.772289

Countries can ensure that green tax incentives support climate goals without undermining revenues by focusing on efficiency, effectiveness, and targeting.
You analyzed 35 different countries for the report ""The Use of Green Tax Incentives for Renewable Energy Deployment.""
The United States showed how powerful tax incentives can be when combined with industrial strategy through the Inflation Reduction Act, which used production and investment tax credits to crowd in manufacturing and deployment.
This evolution highlights an important principle: tax incentives should be temporary, targeted, and tied to performance, not permanent giveaways.","One of COP 30’s top priorities is boosting climate finance from both governments and private investors. Why is this especially crucial for emerging and developing economies?

Despite record-high investment in renewable energy last year, emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) face a USD 2.2 trillion financing gap each year through 2030 to meet their goals under the Paris Agreement. Countries need to attract investments that can lower emissions while expanding access to affordable energy and creating jobs. Unlike major emerging economies, such as China, India, or Brazil, which attract the majority of global renewable energy investment, the climate transition of many lower-income EMDEs continue to be held back by limited access to affordable finance, perceived country or sector-related risks, and weaker policy frameworks.

In response, mobilizing both public and private finance is crucial. Public financial support is needed to crowd in larger private investment, such as through targeted subsidies including incentives, budget transfers, concessional lending, and market mechanisms that reduce investment risks. This must go hand in hand with phasing out inefficient tax incentives for fossil fuels to level the playing field and encourage a shift by consumers and investors toward less polluting alternatives. Raising taxes on fossil fuels to reflect their social costs—through excise or carbon taxes can also accelerate the transition in an economically efficient way, provided that protections are in place for vulnerable groups.

What have governments already committed to in terms of renewable energy capacity?

At COP 28, 133 governments agreed to the collective goal to triple the world’s installed renewable energy generation capacity by 2030, taking into consideration different starting points and national circumstances. Limited fiscal space and rising debt require that public support be used strategically such as by lowering investment financing costs. The global FfD4 process has underscored the mounting pressure on public budgets and the need for more efficient deployment of resources.

Without this combination of public and private finance, emerging and developing economies cannot accelerate the energy transition in line with the COP 28 commitment.

What mechanisms at COP 30 could help scale green investment and turn commitments into action?

COP 30 has been framed by the Brazilian Presidency as a COP for implementation, where countries work to turn their climate commitments into action. This could be achieved through the Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T, which sets out a plan for how climate finance from all sources can be scaled up to USD 1.3 trillion annually by 2035.

However, as IISD has noted, while the Baku to Belém Roadmap recognizes that phasing out environmentally harmful subsidies, including fossil fuel subsidies, can have long-term benefits, these points are not reflected in recommendations. This means we risk COP 30 becoming a missed opportunity for redirecting public finance from fossil fuels to renewables.

Ambitious reforms also require financial backing. At COP 30, a decision on Article 2.1(c) (the Paris Agreement’s goal on aligning financial flows with climate-resilient, low-carbon development pathways) is expected. For the past three years, the Sharm el-Sheikh dialogue on Article 2.1(c) has taken place, leading to greater understanding of what the Article means. However, more work remains to be done, and COP 30 could establish negotiations towards a framework for Article 2.1(c), perhaps under a work programme. A decision on Article 2.1(c) could contain a commitment to phase out public finance for fossil fuels to ensure investment is climate compatible.

COP 30 could also move the dial on strengthening public finances and growing governments’ fiscal space for climate action, for example through advancing the conversation on ambitious debt relief.

Tax policy is one tool for leveraging public resources to scale private investment. What role can the tax incentives play towards closing the green investment gap, especially in emerging and developing economies?

Tax incentives that target green investment, if strategically designed, can help lower the cost of capital for climate projects, unlocking private finance and accelerating renewable energy deployment. They already have in countries that use them well.

Designing strategically means shifting away from broad profit-based tax holidays toward incentives that address real investment constraints. Targeted tools like allowing businesses to write off the cost of renewable energy capital faster (“accelerated depreciation”), partial relief from import duties for certified green technologies, or time-limited tax credits for investment in energy grids and storage can really move the dial on climate projects through reducing upfront and operating costs.

What other levers should governments be using to mobilize private finance?

Incentives work best as part of a broader policy mix that includes planning, regulation, and infrastructure development. Without clear energy targets, ready energy grids, and streamlined permitting for energy projects, even generous incentives will fail to attract investment.

Tax policies are only one tool among many.

Countries also use many non-tax instruments to encourage clean energy investment, particularly for technologies that are already cost competitive, such as solar and onshore wind. Market-based mechanisms can provide the certainty that investors need without a large net impact on public finances.

These include measures that stabilize prices such as feed in premiums, contracts for difference, and auctions for long term power purchase agreements. Domestic and international public financing can reduce the high cost of capital that is common in many EMDEs. While some of these mechanisms can be more complex to administer than broad based tax incentives, they have proven effective in large EMDEs that are rapidly scaling up clean energy including Brazil, China, India, and Vietnam.

Policy stability and an enabling regulatory environment are also key to attracting investment.

How can countries ensure that green tax incentives achieve results for climate without eroding the tax base unnecessarily?

Our research shows that tax incentives deliver the strongest results in sectors with high upfront costs, such as early-stage renewables, storage, industrial efficiency, and mini-grids, rather than in mature technologies that already attract private investment. Focusing on these areas is where countries are most likely to see tangible results.

Countries can ensure that green tax incentives support climate goals without undermining revenues by focusing on efficiency, effectiveness, and targeting. Incentives should directly address barriers such as high upfront costs or technology risks, be time-bound and performance-linked, and include clear monitoring and review mechanisms.

Shifting from broad profit-based tax holidays to cost-based measures such as accelerated depreciation, which I explained earlier, or investment tax credits, makes sure the support catalyzes new investment rather than rewarding activity that would occur anyway. This is a strategic use of public resources, maximizing climate impact while maintaining fiscal sustainability.

Additionally, one of the key elements is tying tax incentives to real economic outcomes, like new capacity or job creation; or to environmental goals, with priority going to projects that fit a national green taxonomy and meet environmental and community consent standards.

Transparency throughout the process is also essential. Tax expenditure reporting at the economy-wide level helps governments track the fiscal cost of incentives by clearly presenting revenue forgone across sectors and bring other benefits. The Coalition on Tax Expenditures Reform launched by IISD and partners seeks to support countries in increasing reporting and evaluation of incentives.

You analyzed 35 different countries for the report ""The Use of Green Tax Incentives for Renewable Energy Deployment."" What trends did you spot in terms of countries’ use of tax incentives to drive green investment?

Our analysis reflects trends among smaller emerging and developing economies (excluding larger emerging economies such as China, India, or Brazil), where governments are increasingly using tax incentives to attract private investment into clean energy but are often challenged by limited fiscal space, weak targeting, and inconsistent implementation.

These countries continue to rely on profit-based tax holidays, which tend to be less effective in stimulating renewable energy investment. These incentives only apply once firms become profitable, yet in many lower-income markets, renewable projects often face long development timelines, grid connection delays, and high financing costs, which postpone or reduce taxable profits.

However, we also observe a gradual shift toward targeted, cost-based measures, with more countries adopting investment tax credits, accelerated depreciation, VAT exemptions and import duty relief for renewable energy components—policies that are more likely to be cost effective and better aligned with climate objectives.

What did you find on the design of these tax incentives?

The design of these tax incentives varies widely, and policy fragmentation remains a major issue. In many countries, incentives are scattered across investment laws, tax codes and special economic zone legislation, creating complexity for investors, and tax administration, and increasing the risk of overlapping or duplicate incentives. Very few countries include clear eligibility criteria, performance conditions or sunset clauses.

Most incentives we analyzed were open-ended and did not require any reporting on energy generation, job creation or emissions reductions. Without reporting requirements, governments have no reliable basis to assess whether tax incentives are delivering value for money or contributing to climate and development goals. As a result, it becomes difficult to evaluate tax expenditures, compare their cost-effectiveness against other policy tools, or justify their continuation when public finances already are squeezed.

Fresh data shows that, at the global scale, investment in renewable technologies and projects reached a record. To what extent have tax reforms helped make that happen, and what can EMDEs learn from it?

Indeed, global investment in renewable energy reached a record USD 2.1 trillion in 2024, up 11 percent from the previous year. Much of this growth came from large emerging economies.

China alone accounted for over one-third of global clean energy investment in 2024, and India is consistently among the top ten countries for renewable energy investment.

While it is difficult to isolate the specific impact of tax incentives, countries that combine fiscal measures with broader policy frameworks such as clear renewable energy targets, grid investments, and stable power purchase mechanisms tend to attract the highest levels of renewable energy investment. This has been an instrumental strategy in China, the European Union, and the United States, where extensive renewable energy support measures are in place.

Other successful strategies include India, which used accelerated depreciation, GST reductions for renewable components, and tax holidays in earlier phases to rapidly scale wind and solar, and South Africa introduced a 125 percent tax deduction for businesses investing in renewables, helping unlock new private-sector projects during its energy crisis. This measure complements the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme, which awards long-term power purchase agreements through competitive auctions to provide investment certainty. Together with other renewable energy fiscal policies, these initiatives illustrate how combining fiscal incentives with clear procurement frameworks can effectively mobilize private investment and advance broader development goals.

The United States showed how powerful tax incentives can be when combined with industrial strategy through the Inflation Reduction Act, which used production and investment tax credits to crowd in manufacturing and deployment.

The global trend also shows that successful countries adapt their tax incentives over time. China initially relied heavily on VAT rebates and tax holidays to build its solar manufacturing base but has gradually phased these out as the industry became globally competitive. India has taken a similar path unwinding broad tax breaks as its renewables market matured and shifting toward more targeted measures, like reverse auctions for deployment of renewables and production linked incentives, viability gap funding, and concessional lending for manufacturing.

This evolution highlights an important principle: tax incentives should be temporary, targeted, and tied to performance, not permanent giveaways. For emerging and developing economies, this is especially critical given limited fiscal space and competing public priorities. Incentives must therefore be designed to catalyze private investment without compromising revenue sustainability, ensuring that scarce public resources are used efficiently and can continue to support essential development and social spending.",https://www.iisd.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/2025-11/solar-energy-kenya.jpg?itok=78Agcr4K,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:49.261652

The site is the largest economic project North Carolina has ever backed with state incentives, in terms of capital investment.
Toyota aims to eventually operate 14 lithium-ion battery production lines across seven buildings at the site called Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina.
Toyota shipped its first hybrid batteries to a Mazda Toyota plant in Huntsville, Alabama for the Corolla Cross SUV.
Toyota officials later told reporters they were not aware of how much, if any, of this additional Toyota spending will be in North Carolina.","In a dark warehouse enlivened with neon lights and up-tempo music, Toyota and North Carolina political leaders gathered Wednesday to mark the start of production at the carmaker’s first battery plant outside of Japan.

The event was held nearly four years after Toyota unveiled plans to build a hybrid and electric battery factory on an 1,800-acre megasite near the small Randolph County town of Liberty, about 20 miles south of Greensboro. The automaker started its first production line in January and shipped its first car batteries from the Liberty facility in the spring.

Toyota says it currently employs around 2,500 workers and runs four hybrid battery production lines at the facility. Company officials say that by 2034 the local headcount should exceed 5,000.

The site is the largest economic project North Carolina has ever backed with state incentives, in terms of capital investment. Under its job development investment grant, Toyota targets spending $13.9 billion on the facility. Toyota aims to eventually operate 14 lithium-ion battery production lines across seven buildings at the site called Toyota Battery Manufacturing, North Carolina. Per its grant, Toyota must pay workers an average wage of at least $62,234.

Between state and local incentives, Toyota is poised to receive around $439 million in payroll tax breaks if it meets its minimum investment and job creation targets by 2029.

Specific production lines will be tailored to support hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicles. Toyota has prioritized hybrid vehicles over fully-electric cars — both globally and at its North Carolina factory — a decision company officials say has been advantageous as electric vehicle demand in recent years has weakened and federal EV tax credits ended this year under the Republican-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“We’ll follow market demand,” said Don Stewart, president of Toyota North Carolina.

Toyota shipped its first hybrid batteries to a Mazda Toyota plant in Huntsville, Alabama for the Corolla Cross SUV. It also supplies batteries for the Camry in Georgetown, Kentucky, and will eventually send them to Canada for the RAV4.

Among the speakers in Randolph County were Gov. Josh Stein, U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy.

During the ceremony, Toyota announced it would invest $10 billion in the United States over the next five years, a move Duffy credited to President Donald Trump’s trade policy approach. “President Trump has asked the world to make investments in America, because when companies invest in America, that means great American jobs,” he said.

Toyota officials later told reporters they were not aware of how much, if any, of this additional Toyota spending will be in North Carolina.

However, the SPS case suggests an additional seven exajoules (EJ) of solar will be in operation by 2040, and an additional 13EJ by 2050, compared to the CPS case.
Growing electricity demand The increasing cost-competitiveness of solar PV comes as the world’s energy demand is likely to grow and change.
“Data centres are an important driver, especially in the US, where they account for more than 50% of demand growth in the next decade,” explained Cozzi.
While they will only account for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth between 2024 and 2030, the doubling of consumption is a striking trend.","“Our world is thirsty for energy,” Birol said. “Demand for energy services and electrification will increase, but we’re seeing new driving countries coming into the mix. Slowly but surely, China will be replaced by India, Southeast Asia, Latin America and a few other emerging countries.

“None of these countries alone will replace China, but together they will be the drives of global energy demand growth in the years to come.”

Unsurprisingly, solar PV looks set to be a key component in meeting this shifting energy demand in the years to come.

The IEA report sets out four scenarios, which Birol highlighted are not forecasts, but potential scenarios, that could determine global power demand and usage: the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), the least ambitious scenario that takes into account policies and regulations already in place in the energy sector; the Stated Policies Scenario (SPS), which takes into account policies that have been announced but not yet implemented; the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario, which includes measures necessary to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2025; and the Accelerating Clean Cooking and Electricity Services Scenario (ACCESS), which provides a roadmap to achieve universal access to electricity and clean cooking.

The graphs below demonstrate the potential energy mix, for selected technologies, in both the CPS and SPS cases, with oil set to lead the world in energy generation in both cases. However, the SPS case suggests an additional seven exajoules (EJ) of solar will be in operation by 2040, and an additional 13EJ by 2050, compared to the CPS case. In both scenarios, the world’s solar generation is expected to outpace its combined wind and hydro generation by 2050.

A key driving force behind this trend will be the continued low levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) for the solar sector. The report notes that, since 2010, the LCOE of solar PV has fallen by 90%, in line with a 90% decline in battery energy storage systems (BESS) and greater than the 70% decline in wind. Between 2024 and 2035, the IEA report expects solar costs to decline by a further 40%, compared to 30% for BESS and 10% for wind, suggesting that solar PV will continue to be the most cost-effective form of electricity generation in the decade to come.

Crucially, the report adds that in the SPS case, the projected cost for new solar PV and wind projects have “similar or lower average generation costs” than new coal, gas and nuclear projects in the US, EU and China, suggesting that renewables will soon be on par with conventional fossil fuels in regions with some of the largest energy generation systems in the world.

The report also notes that the co-location of BESS and solar PV is likely to be the most financially viable clean energy technology in the years to come, which echoes a sentiment expressed by others in the sector. The rapid deployment of PV capacity has led to grid curtailment challenges and price collapses in several markets, and many commentators have suggested that better integration of BESS can help sidestep grid issues and improve the bankability of solar projects.

Indeed, the IEA report notes that, by 2035, pairing solar PV with a 4-hour BESS will be “more competitive than standalone PV in major markets, as the added value of dispatchability outweighs the additional cost”.

Growing electricity demand

The increasing cost-competitiveness of solar PV comes as the world’s energy demand is likely to grow and change. The report notes that in the CPS scenario, total energy demand will grow by 14% by 2035, while in the SPS scenario it will grow by 8% by the same year, and Laura Cozzi, IEA director of sustainability, technology and outlooks, said today that in all scenarios, demand for electricity “accelerates significantly”.

“Electricity demand growth from now to 2035 is nearly identical in our two SPS scenarios [to] 10,000TWh, [which is] the electricity that is consumed today in the US, Canada, all of Europe, Japan, Korea and Australia,” said Cozzi. “This will be added in just ten years, and is a very big shift that will demand a lot of investments and planning.”

“We can comfortably say that the age of electricity has arrived,” added Birol, who went on to suggest that the “spectacular” growth in energy demand could create opportunities for the solar sector in particular, as many countries with growing electricity demand have significant potential for new solar deployments.

“Solar is going to play a pivotal role,” he said. “It is also important to see that the bulk of the electricity demand growth will come from the countries where we see a huge amount of solar radiation—they are solar-rich countries—and we see solar electricity playing an important role here, together with other renewables, such as wind, geothermal and hydropower.”

A combination of an ageing and declining population in China will also limit the growth of electricity demand. The report notes that, between 2010 and 2024, China’s total final energy consumption increased by over 2EJ; this is projected to fall to less than 1EJ between 2024 and 2035 in the SPS case, and then decline into the negative between 2035 and 2050.

The decline is even more stark in the “advanced economies” category, which saw negligible year-on-year increases in final energy consumption between 2000 and 2010, and has seen year-on-year declines in energy consumption since 2010, which the IEA notes could persist until 2050 in the SPS case.

Data centres an ‘important driver’ of power demand

The report’s authors also highlighted that data centres are likely to be significant contributors to changing energy demand; this year, the world is expected to invest US$580 billion into data centres, compared to US$540 billion in oil.

“Data centres are an important driver, especially in the US, where they account for more than 50% of demand growth in the next decade,” explained Cozzi. The report adds that globally, data centre electricity consumption is expected to double by 2030. While they will only account for less than 10% of global electricity demand growth between 2024 and 2030, the doubling of consumption is a striking trend.

The graphs above, from the IEA, show how the US and advanced economies will drive electricity demand growth from data centres in the next five years for the SPS case, and how data centres will see greater growth in electricity demand than sectors such as heating, which in this case refers to space and water heating in buildings.

The IEA report notes that, in the SPS case, renewable power will account for 45% of the growth in electricity supply to meet data centre demand through to 2035, totalling nearly 40TWh. This percentage is slightly power in the CPS case, of just 40%, but this is still a larger percentage than any other fuel type.

Solar under-production

While the report points to several examples of significant potential for growth in the renewable energy industry in general, and the solar sector in particular, it notes that current economic systems do not facilitate the kind of growth in renewable energy deployment necessary to meet the more ambitious scenarios.

The report points to “significant surplus capacity” for module manufacturing in China, which has contributed to a downturn in both module manufacturers’ profits and significant reductions in manufacturing output. The IEA report notes that, in 2024, Chinese module manufacturers had a nameplate production capacity of over 1,000GW, accounting for the majority of the world’s nameplate production capacity, but actually produced closer to 600GW. The same trend is true for other clean energy technologies—battery cells saw production drop to less than half of its nameplate capacity—and this highlights the challenges associated with generating profits in the current economic climate.

“Market forces alone are not going to deliver that resilience and diversity that we need [in supply chains],” said IEA chief economist Tim Gould during the launch of the report. “There is a need for coordinated, determined policy action to enhance preparedness against potential disruptions, but also to build up new partnerships and projects that diversify supply chains more quickly, and this will continue to be a very important focus for the IEA.”

Cozzi noted that there are “at least 42 countries” currently implementing or changing energy regulations to better position renewables to deliver profits in the coming years, and Birol explained that challenges in “the political domain” will need to be overcome in order to meet some of the world’s more ambitious clean energy deployment targets as the 2050 goals loom ever larger.

“When we look at climate change, I see two trends, both of them in the political domain,” said Birol. “I talked with several government leaders, business leaders and others, and I see that the priority given to climate change at the national level is at a decline in most cases. At the same time, of course, we know that 2024 was the hottest year in history. The current policy scenario is almost in line with a [temperature rise] of three degrees Celsius.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iea.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:03:13.144569

The federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, making the remaining months of this year the final opportunity to complete eligible projects.

Homeowners can claim these federal tax credits when filing their taxes in early 2026 for any qualifying projects completed in 2025. Many of these upgrades also qualify for cash incentives from Energy Trust of Oregon, a nonprofit that helps people, businesses and communities use less energy and save money. Combining tax credits and incentives allows homeowners to get the deepest possible savings.

Along with lowering energy bills, these changes help make your home more comfortable inside. Energy efficiency improvements eligible for both the federal tax credits and Energy Trust incentives include:

Insulation: Adding or updating insulation on your attic, walls and floors can keep your heated or cooled air inside, meaning your system doesn’t have to work as hard.

Windows: Replacing older windows with energy efficient ones can keep your home more comfortable by keeping the air in and preventing drafts.

Heating and cooling: Heating and cooling your home is likely one of your biggest home energy expenses, so upgrading to modern, energy efficient units like heat pumps are a great way to keep energy costs low.

Water heating: Switching from a traditional water heater to a more efficient heat pump water heater uses much less energy to heat your water (often the second largest energy expense after heating and cooling).

Home energy audit: Credits can cover the cost of a professional energy “check-up” for your home. During the audit, an energy auditor uses tools to monitor temperature and moisture in your home and advises on the best upgrades to make, where your home is using energy efficiently and where energy may be wasted.

The Energy Efficient Home Improvement federal tax credit offers two separate caps for tax credits, allowing homeowners to claim a total of up to $3,200 on their 2026 taxes from projects finished before December 31, 2025. The general cap with a maximum of $1,200, covers upgrades like insulation, windows, doors and home energy audits. Additionally, there’s a separate cap of $2,000 for installing an electric heat pump or heat pump water heater.

To claim the federal tax credits when filing a 2025 tax return, homeowners must have receipts and the manufacturer’s certification statements for all upgraded products. The process involves filling out a Form 5695 through the IRS website or tax prep software and filling in the details of energy-efficient improvements made at home in 2025 that qualify. Afterward, consult a tax professional to ensure everything is correct and ensure you’re able to qualify for as many savings as you’re eligible to claim.

Think of it as bringing together great minds, passionate about providing safe drinking water, wastewater services, and more from around North Carolina.

Let’s set the scene: The convention center was transformed with signs featuring large arrows directing attendees to classrooms and various halls to hear from speakers. In the main exhibition hall, rows of booths snaked through the room, each focusing on a different aspect of water. In addition to the numerous opportunities to meet other like-minded water professionals, several competitions were held among municipalities, including ""Best Tasting Water,"" Hydrant Hysteria, and Pipe Tapping

Of course, our Raleigh Water teams participated in the friendly challenges, and here’s how we ranked:

Hydrant Hysteria:

A fast-paced competition where two-member teams race to assemble a specific hydrant as quickly as possible. Teams are also judged on whether all parts are assembled correctly and function properly. Yes, a loose bolt can cost your team precious time.

This year, Raleigh Water’s women’s team was coached by Meriam Manuel, a five-year veteran of the competition, though this was her first time coaching. The two-person team consisted of Jennifer Anderson, who has participated for three years, and Sarah Calverley, a rookie this year. The women’s team placed second.

The men’s team was led by Josh Bennett, who has competed for two years and was also coaching for the first time. The team included Jeffrey Tennant, returning for his second year, and Jason Talton, a first-time competitor. The men’s team placed third.

Pipe Tapping:

In this timed competition, teams of three workers and one coach compete to tap a pressurized ductile iron pipe and install a water service line.

Raleigh Water’s team consisted of Kyle Bates (first-year competitor), Myles Dawson, Ricky Shanks (both returning for a second year), and coach Jeremy Isgrigg, who has been with Raleigh Water since 2005. The men’s team placed third with a time of 2:18.3.

Isgrigg was proud of his team, saying, ""Every team always puts in so much effort. It’s clear to see that many members put in double duty outside of their everyday work to commit to the team and practice, going above and beyond.”

Best Tasting Water Competition:

Utilities submitted two-liter water samples drawn from their distribution systems for judges to taste and evaluate against other utilities.

This year, the E.M. Johnson Water Treatment Plant secured third place in the state water-tasting competition.

Raleigh Water is dedicated to providing our customers with the highest standards of water quality, and we are proud of the hard work from our teams this year. Congratulations to all!",https://raleighnc.govcover.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 15:03:39.197106

NESE is a 25-mile natural gas pipeline expansion project certificated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that is intended to deliver 400,000 dekatherms per day of natural gas produced in Pennsylvania to local distribution company customers in New York City through new facilities in Middlesex County, New Jersey and an underwater segment traversing the Raritan and Lower New York Bays.

NESE initially received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from FERC for the project in 2019 under the Natural Gas Act (NGA), but its project sponsor ultimately canceled the project without initiating construction due to an inability to secure CWA and flood hazard permits from New York and New Jersey that were required by FERC. In 2025, following the President’s declaration of an Energy Emergency in Executive Order No. 14156 (E.O. 14156), Transco applied to reinstate the 2019 certificate, relying on FERC’s prior environmental analysis. FERC granted the requested relief on August 28, 2025, and reauthorized the project under NGA section 7.

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, stated that the NYSDEC’s decision is consistent with her administration’s “all of the above approach” to addressing grid reliability and affordability. State officials also may be concerned about future actions by the federal government to force infrastructure development in the Northeast region in line with statements made in E.O. 14156, and seek to take greater control to maintain a level of state autonomy for federally permitted projects. Additional Northeast pipeline projects are anticipated to materialize. However, project opponents may try to challenge state-issued permits required for FERC-approved natural gas infrastructure, akin to a recent challenge to a Louisiana-issued Coastal Use Permit received by a liquefied natural gas terminal developer with FERC NGA section 3 authorization.",https://www.akingump.com/a/web/hzs7j7qNY4F5GXZ2TqR5Jz/aa54Rb/speaking-energy.png,N,,2025-11-12 13:04:23.630746

Toyota opens its first EV battery plant in the US

After the first batteries rolled off the production line at its new facility in Liberty, North Carolina, on Wednesday, Toyota said today marks a “pivotal moment” in the company’s history. The facility is Toyota’s 11th plant in the US and its first battery plant outside of Japan.

Toyota first announced plans to build EV batteries in the US almost four years ago. The nearly $14 billion facility will create up to 5,100 jobs in the area.

In addition, the Japanese auto giant announced plans to invest an additional $10 billion in its US operations over the next five years. Since it first arrived in the US nearly 70 years ago, Toyota has invested close to $60 billion.

“Today’s launch of Toyota’s first US battery plant and additional US investment up to $10 billion marks a pivotal moment in our company’s history,” Toyota Motor North America’s CEO, Ted Ogawa, said at the event.

The mega site spans 1,850 acres, or about the size of 121 football fields, and can produce up to 30 GWh annually. Toyota will use the hub to develop and build lithium-ion batteries for its growing lineup of “electrified” vehicles, including battery electric (EV), plug-in hybrid (PHEV), and hybrid (HEV) models.

Batteries from the plant will power the new Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV, and Toyota’s yet-to-be-announced three-row electric SUV.

The North Carolina battery plant houses 14 production lines, but Toyota said it plans to add more to the facility by 2030.

Toyota is already shipping HEV modules to its plant in Kentucky and Mazda Toyota Manufacturing in Alabama. It currently assembles 11 HEVs and PHEVs in the US.

Although Toyota only offers two battery electric vehicles (BEVs) in the US, the bZ SUV and Lexus RZ, it will add several more over the next few months, including the CH-R and bZ Woodland.",https://i0.wp.com/electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/10/Toyota-EV-sales-crash-2.jpeg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-12 13:03:50.556935

In addition, the company throughout November will provide another $500,000 to at least 60 feeding programs statewide amid funding uncertainties as colder weather and the holiday season approaches

Since 2021, Duke Energy and the Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are contributing $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That is why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

What they are saying

Gov. Henry McMaster: ""Duke Energy's contribution to the One SC Fund highlights the very best of South Carolina. At a time when many families are facing uncertainty, Team South Carolina is coming together to support our food banks and put food on the table. I'm grateful for their generosity and hope it will encourage others to join our effort to help families in need.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""These organizations are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but they cannot do it alone. Duke Energy is happy to stand with the governor, and we encourage other corporate entities, organizations and citizens across the state to help support the fight against hunger.""

Bottom line: Duke Energy's support of these organizations and the issue of hunger in the Palmetto State is nothing new. Starting next week, Duke Energy, with support from Duke Energy Foundation, will kick off the company's monthlong annual campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities. The fifth year of the initiative will provide over $500,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday.

Zoom in: This campaign is in addition to the support of the One SC Fund and will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

Go deeper: Customers struggling to put food on the table are also likely making decisions about what bills to pay at home, including their electricity bill. That is why it is important to also offer information that can assist families to manage their energy bills when times are tough.

EPA specifically asked for comments on the elimination of reporting requirements for four categories: suppliers of carbon dioxide, geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide, injection of carbon dioxide and geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide with enhanced oil recovery.
But ethanol producers say if finalized, the proposal could wreak havoc with carbon capture projects that can significantly lower ethanol's carbon intensity.
Also, it would be more difficult to make use of the $85-per-ton 45Q tax credit in the IRA for permanently stored CO2.
The company’s efforts have stalled, in large part because South Dakota approved a law prohibiting use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.","Carbon capture advocates are objecting to an EPA proposal to scrap a greenhouse gas reporting requirement for dozens of industrial sectors, arguing that energy tax credits would be negatively affected.

“The potential wholesale rescission of the [Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)] threatens to destabilize the fuels market, disrupt ongoing and planned projects, and ultimately undercut the significant investments that are helping to revive America's energy dominance,” Wayne Garrett, general manager of Chief Ethanol Fuels in Hastings, Nebraska, said in comments submitted to the agency.

EPA’s September proposal would eliminate reporting requirements for 46 industrial sources of greenhouse gases, including carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCUS), ammonia and lime manufacturing and phosphoric acid production.

The agency said in the proposal there is no statutory requirement to collect GHG emissions information for sectors other than the petroleum and natural gas source category, which are subject to the Waste Emissions Charge in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. That law imposed an annual charge on methane emissions from large emitters in the oil and natural gas sector, but delayed implementation until 2034.

EPA specifically asked for comments on the elimination of reporting requirements for four categories: suppliers of carbon dioxide, geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide, injection of carbon dioxide and geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide with enhanced oil recovery.

But ethanol producers say if finalized, the proposal could wreak havoc with carbon capture projects that can significantly lower ethanol's carbon intensity. Also, it would be more difficult to make use of the $85-per-ton 45Q tax credit in the IRA for permanently stored CO2.

If the reporting program is repealed, ""most investors and lenders would cease deploying capital into new CCUS projects until a replacement reporting mechanism is established,” American Carbon Alliance CEO Tom Buis said in comments. “Without certainty on how to measure, report, and verify emissions reductions under section 45Q, the CCUS industry will be paralyzed, jeopardizing the administration’s energy dominance priorities.”

Many companies involved in CCUS that are seeking the sequestration tax credit under 45Q, in addition to those pursuing the clean hydrogen production tax credit under section 45V, “currently rely heavily on the GHGRP's reporting mechanisms to provide verifiable evidence of the amount of CO2 they have successfully sequestered or prevented from being emitted through their projects,” Buis said.

Summit Carbon Solutions, which has been struggling for years to persuade landowners to allow use of their land for a planned 2,500-mile carbon dioxide pipeline, is an ACA member. The company’s efforts have stalled, in large part because South Dakota approved a law prohibiting use of eminent domain for carbon dioxide pipelines.

Chief Ethanol Fuels' Garrett said use of Section 45Z, a tax credit for low-carbon transportation fuels, also could be imperiled.

The Treasury Department and IRS haven't finalized rules clarifying the 45Z requirements for monitoring, reporting and verifying CI reductions attributable to carbon capture and sequestration, he said. However, ""we believe it is likely the agencies will adopt an approach that is similar to the approach required for both 45Q and the section 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit (i.e., in cases where CCS is employed by the clean hydrogen producer).""

The GHGRP “is a well-established and accepted reporting mechanism within the carbon management industry that, if eliminated, would leave taxpayers unable to claim 45Q,” Christian Flinn, public policy manager at the Carbon Capture Coalition, said at a public hearing last month.

Flinn cited 19 “commercial-scale facilities with the capacity to capture more than 21 million metric tons of CO2 per year” and said 45Q “has spurred over $77 billion in investments across announced and operating projects.”

Savings from elimination of requirement questioned

EPA said eliminating the reporting requirements would save industries $303 million per year through 2033. But commenters who objected to the proposal said those savings aren’t substantial, given that more than 8,000 facilities participate in the program.

The law firm White & Case said compliance costs are about $50 million for industries other than petroleum and natural gas. “When that figure is spread across all of the companies required to report, the total annual cost of the program appears to be fairly modest for most of the regulated industries,” the firm’s analysis says.

In addition, Flinn said EPA’s own estimate shows that compliance costs are “negligible compared to the scale of industry investment.”

“It is already standard practice for facilities that capture, sell, and store CO2 to measure the volume of CO2 in question thanks to widely available, cost-effective equipment installed at these facilities,” he said. “Therefore, for large and small companies engaged in the CO2 supply chain, reporting this information requires minimal additional effort.”

In addition to the carbon capture implications, the proposal has fertilizer manufacturers concerned.

Some members of The Fertilizer Institute take advantage of both 45Q and 45V tax credits; the latter apply to hydrogen. “Without an adequate replacement methodology in place by Treasury/IRS to meet its statutory obligations, The group's members may be unable to demonstrate the ability to qualify for these tax credits,” Tom Lynch, TFI senior vice president of government affairs, said in comments.

TFI recommended EPA keep some of the industrial sources in the reporting program on a voluntary basis for at least a year to allow the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service to put an alternative reporting system in place.

“A short-term voluntary GHGRP would provide near-term certainty to operators of active projects seeking to claim credits, allow industry time to agree upon a suitable replacement methodology and give Treasury/IRS further time to develop effective guidance replacing the GHGRP for future tax years,” Lynch said in comments.

TFI also encouraged EPA to work with the Commerce Department, U.S. Trade Representative, Treasury and industry “to ensure that a framework is provided to support the export of low-carbon products. Currently, the GHGRP – and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model on which it relies – “aids in the ability of U.S. exports of energy and other low-carbon manufacturing exports to key allies by providing a well-respected path for exporters to document emissions.”

The North Dakota Ethanol Producers Association also strongly opposes getting rid of the GHGRP for carbon capture.

“The proposed changes would create significant uncertainty for ongoing and future carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects that are essential to the ethanol industry’s success and to advance national decarbonization goals,” the group said in a letter.

Newman said that there isn't an easy switch between climate anxiety and climate optimism.","Every autumn, news feeds get flooded with stories about climate change. That's because around this time each year, global leaders gather to discuss collective efforts to limit our emissions of planet-warming gases, released primarily from oil, gas and coal.

Some of the information coming out of the COP30 conference is bleak. But it's not just COP. Climate stories can be difficult to consume year-round, whether it's about natural disasters, victims of heat waves or sea level rise or new studies about global warming impacts.

“When you throw a ton of scary facts and information at people, their nervous system shuts down. It’s a coping mechanism,” said Sarah Newman, founder and executive director of the Climate Mental Health Network.

That sense of dread, doom, fear or hopelessness gets lumped into a single term: climate anxiety. Surveys from the American Psychiatric Association have repeatedly shown that a significant amount of Americans experience climate anxiety.

Dealing with it, just like dealing with climate change, is an ongoing process. Here's how to get started.

Climate anxiety different from general anxiety

Imagine you leave the house in the morning, and realize you left the stove on. There's a fire hazard at home, and you're feeling anxious about it. So you turn around and switch it off. The problem is solved, and so is your anxiety.

Climate change doesn't work that way.

It activates different parts of the brain, according to a study published by the National Institutes of Health. While Generalized Anxiety Disorder often involves the part of the brain that handles fear, threat and emotion, climate anxiety activates parts of the brain that help with high cognition, willpower and tenacity.

“It’s an ongoing larger problem that I need to attend to over time and that is largely out of my control,” climate psychologist Thomas Doherty said. ”I can’t just flip a switch around climate change.”

The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it’s largely out of each person’s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.

Doherty, who wrote a book about coping with climate anxiety, said that it isn't inherently negative. It's a natural reaction to a threat, and it's the first step in a cyclical relationship with climate change.

“The rest of the cycle is ultimately taking some action to resolve the threat as best that we can,” he said.

First, cope and connect

Newman said that one of the most effective ways to combat climate anxiety is to find other people who are experiencing it too, and to talk about it.

Every year, New York City hosts something called Climate Week. Folks from all over descend upon Manhattan for hundreds of events and panels on energy, the environment and climate change.

Between 15 and 20 people showed up to one event about finding connection and hope in the face of climate change. It was intimate, but so is confiding feelings of dread and isolation with a room full of strangers.

“How many of you wake up in the morning with feelings of despair or hopelessness?” asked the leader at the front of the room.

Just about every hand sheepishly went up.

“Not just in the morning!” said a man in the front row. And an awkward chuckle of understanding swept through the room.

That group was addressing what Doherty said is one of the greatest risks of climate anxiety: isolation.

“Just like working on any problem, any issue, once you have a team around you, then you feel better. You’re not alone. You feel stronger,” he said.

Meetups such as Climate Cafes or groups like Climate Psychology Alliance have online and in-person events where people can share experiences and build resilience together.

Much of Newman's work with the Climate Mental Health Network is about bringing people together to combat that feeling of isolation.

“When people start to recognize that, they’re not alone with what they’re feeling,” she said. “There’s an opportunity for people to move from that helpless state to one of empowerment.”

Many general anxiety treatments relate to calming the body and clearing the head, and Doherty said that all of those work with climate anxiety.

“It’s our same body. Our same brain, our same heart rate, blood pressure, our same ways of thinking,” he said.

Immediate grounding exercises include the 3-3-3 technique, where you name three things you see, three you hear and three parts of your body that you can move. Another one is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.

Doherty also recommends prioritizing rest and exercise, going outside in nature and focusing on the present moment. He calls all of those practices basic mental hygiene.

Then, find a purpose

Doherty recommended channeling climate concern into something controllable, such as the impacts of climate change in your neighborhood, or even in your home.

“Take care of my own garden so to speak, before I try to plant a garden somewhere else,” he said.

That starts with something Doherty calls ceremonial actions. They don't meaningfully change the world, but they're easy, they can be repeated, they align with a person's values and make them feel better, like picking up litter or bringing reusable bags to the grocery store.

Then those ceremonial actions fuel the desire and resilience needed for something larger, like getting rid of the gas appliances in the house, which could take years to afford and invest in. The U.N. lists 10 actions to reduce a person's impact on the planet.

Climate anxiety is cyclical, because the sources of anxiety keep coming, and so does the need for coping mechanisms and actions. Newman said that there isn't an easy switch between climate anxiety and climate optimism.

“I still carry those emotions and I still have the worry and I have the anger and I have the sadness, but I’m able to live with them in a different way,” she said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/12/PDTN/87231816007-ap-25315625869852.jpg?crop=5999,3375,x0,y200&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-12 13:03:05.681628

This year, a wave of state laws is reshaping how America builds data centers. Ohio’s HB 15, effective in August, fast-tracks power build-out and microgrids for large loads. Texas’s SB 6, in effect since July, makes mega-load data centers responsible for interconnection costs and makes them curtail-ready when the grid is stressed. Massachusetts just approved incentives that grant long-term sales tax relief to major facilities, and Colorado is also moving toward rebates for certified projects tied to jobs and energy benchmarks.

It’s good news that states are thinking strategically about accelerating data center development. All this is essential for the advancement of artificial intelligence and for American competitiveness vis-à-vis China. But speed alone won’t solve the harder problems. States now need creativity to meet the moment with respect to data centers: concrete plans for where the power, water and grid capacity will come from, as well as how to create good jobs and benefit communities and the environment.

Analysts at the International Energy Agency recently projected that U.S. data center electricity use could more than double within five years. By 2030, these facilities may draw nearly 9% of America’s total power — putting pressure on grids and pushing up rates without major new investment.

The squeeze isn’t limited to electricity. By 2027, AI-related water consumption is forecast to equal more than half of the U.K.’s annual use. Researchers at the University of California, Riverside estimate a ChatGPT session of 5–50 prompts can consume up to 500ml of water. Google used 20% more water in 2022 than in 2021 as it scaled AI; Microsoft’s usage rose 34% in the same period. Communities are also pushing back on new data centers over noise, water draw and thin long-term job creation.

Against this backdrop, we should be thinking about how data centers can stack functions for sustainability, efficiency and community benefit. And state governments, along with the federal government and municipalities, should be thinking about how to maximize these kinds of benefits.

In the face of long permitting timelines and firm-power needs, many new campuses are adding “behind-the-meter” power plants. These kinds of data centers offer some unexpected possibilities with respect to sustainability and social impact. For example, imagine capturing server heat and CO2 and putting them to work fueling nearby industrial-scale greenhouses that produce fresh, high-quality food. Elevated CO2 in greenhouses accelerates photosynthesis and boosts yields; recovered heat keeps crops warm through winter. That means local tomatoes, lettuce and herbs in a Northeast or Midwest January powered by data center byproducts. Because these sites often land in less dense areas with ample space, they can supply rural food deserts, strengthening local economies.

When crops require less CO2 in summer, excess carbon can be converted into fuel like clean hydrogen. Emerging capture and electrolysis pathways can turn emissions into hydrogen for backup systems, fuel cells or even local fleets. Organic greenhouse waste can be composted or turned into biochar on site, improving soils, locking away carbon and feeding the next growing cycle. In short: Stack multiple sustainability functions and turn liabilities into assets.

Water is another overlooked opportunity. Vast, flat roofs — often 100,000 square feet or more — are perfect for rainwater harvesting. One inch of rain on 50,000 square feet yields over 30,000 gallons, meaning significant offsets for cooling and irrigation. Captured rain can feed cooling towers and greenhouses, cutting municipal draw. Leaders like Google and Microsoft are beginning to show what this can look like in practice.

On jobs, today’s critique is fair: A 250,000-square-foot facility may employ up to 1,500 people during construction but only around 50 full-time operators thereafter. Pairing data centers with greenhouse agriculture and carbon-utilization operations changes that equation by adding growers, controls technicians, energy operators, logistics staff and trainers. These integrated campuses can run apprenticeships and hands-on programs in data operations, energy management and controlled-environment agriculture, creating durable jobs and deeper community roots.

We’re entering the largest infrastructure build-out in a generation. The choices we make about emissions, water and local economies matter. We’ve risen to moments like this before: the Tennessee Valley Authority and Rural Electrification Act brought affordable power to every farmhouse. The Erie Canal and interstate system rewired commerce. Apollo turned slide-rule sketches into a moon landing in under a decade. Each looked audacious at the start. Each expanded what was possible.

AI infrastructure now calls for a leap of similar ambition. If we pair capacity with on-site microgrids, rain-harvesting roofs, carbon-fed greenhouses, hydrogen production, workforce academies and other innovations, we can scale AI without undermining communities or nature.

It’s not just states that are pushing ahead with policies to accelerate data center development. In late July, the Trump administration unveiled its AI Action Plan, proposing reduced environmental requirements and faster permitting to speed construction of data centers and supporting power infrastructure. The new AI Action Plan contains sensible elements. But any serious national strategy must grapple head-on with energy and water sustainability along with community resilience.

The “megabill” passed this summer surprisingly retained one important environmental provision from the Biden Administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act: the 45Q tax credit, which provides incentives to companies capturing and storing carbon. Given the bipartisan support for carbon capture, we should be thinking about policies to enable data centers to bring these technologies to scale. While it’s important to emphasize speed, we need to think seriously, and realistically, about sustainability.

ElectriCities, the membership organization that provides power supply and related critical services to 99 community-owned electric systems in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia, was created by the North Carolina General Assembly’s Electric Act of 1965 to support public power communities in the region.

Sixty years later, ElectriCities and public power providers continue their mission to better serve citizens through safe, reliable, and affordable electric power, it noted.

“Through political changes, economic highs and lows, and significant evolution in the energy industry, ElectriCities has maintained its commitment to support the success of public power,” said ElectriCities CEO Roy Jones. “ElectriCities members are in the public power business because they know they can provide better, more reliable electric service to their customers—their neighbors,” said Jones. “Public power utilities don’t answer to shareholders or investors. They answer to their community.”

ElectriCities manages the power supply for North Carolina’s two power agencies: the North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA) and the North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number One (NCMPA1). NCEMPA consists of 32 cities and towns in eastern North Carolina while NCMPA1 is made up of 19 cities and towns in piedmont and western North Carolina. Cities and towns that are members of NCEMPA or NCMPA1 own and operate their electric systems and provide power to their local customers.

Significant milestones mark ElectriCities’ 60-year history, including more recent successes that have saved public power communities and customers hundreds of millions of dollars while supporting increased electric reliability.

What appeared to be a software fault was, in fact, a warning about the material fragility of American power. Behind every “cloud” lies a mountain of hardware: transformers, copper cabling, rare earth magnets, and fiber optics. These materials anchor the digital infrastructure of the United States. When the supply chains for data centers and industry falter, compute slows, translating into degraded command-and-control capabilities for the US military.

In an era of strategic competition, digital reliability is deterrence. A single outage in a hyperscale facility can ripple across intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, disrupting real-time operational efficiency. Data centers power the digital age and the associated server farms underpin everything from economic productivity to military decision-making and intelligence operations. Current data center infrastructure is composed of thousands of acres of servers, transformers, and cooling towers scattered across North America. However, these private-sector behemoths remain perilously exposed. In the digital era, failure to treat data and data centers as national defense assets is a strategic blind spot.

The dynamics of deterrence have evolved in the 21st century. Previously, power projection relied on fuel and steel; currently, it relies on megawatts and computational throughput. The physical foundations of the cloud, including transformers, rare earth elements, and copper, are as essential to national security capabilities as shipyards and automobile assembly lines previously were.

The same materials that make fighter jets, missiles, and satellites are what make artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, cyber warfare, and command and control possible. When supply chains for these materials falter, such as through Chinese export controls on certain minerals and rare earths, or when power grid bottlenecks delay new facilities, the US military’s ability to process and act on information stalls. A targeted mineral embargo against the United States could undermine the infrastructure that supports military networks for collection and dissemination of ISR information.

For policymakers, the issue is that data centers are dual use. The Pentagon’s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) and Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) networks utilize the same commercial power and server backbones that serve industry. A disruption in copper, transformer steel, or photonic components slows both sectors simultaneously. The boundary between civilian compute and military command has effectively vanished; resilience in one now requires resilience in the other.

Cloud outages have a major impact on the economy, critical infrastructure, and military operations, meaning the security and the functioning of these data centers are a major national security issue. This article traces the hidden linkage between data centers, component materials, and military readiness. It quantifies the physical footprint of compute infrastructure and examines the emerging vulnerabilities in supply chains and construction timelines before outlining concrete policy steps to harden the ability of US digital computing power.

The Mathematics of Data Centers: Power, Materials, and Build Cycles

Compute power may seem infinite, but its physical limits are constrained by materials and infrastructure. Building a single 100-megawatt AI-enabled data center—a power requirement on par with a mid-sized American city like Dayton, Ohio—has massive physical requirements. Each site needs about 2,700 tons of copper for cabling and busbars, 150 to 200 tons of transformer-grade steel, and more than 50,000 tons of concrete and structural steel for the shell. Even the smallest components carry strategic weight: rare-earth magnets inside hard-disk drives, gold in server connectors, and indium phosphide in optical transceivers. These materials form America’s compute base (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Material Intensity in a 100 MW AI Data Center (estimates)

The estimates for material tonnage are a synthesis of data from multiple sources, including the International Copper Association (2022) for copper requirements, the Department of Energy (2024) for transformer steel, and Arup (2022) for other embodied materials. Figures for rare earth elements and gold are based on component-level mineral data from the USGS (2024).

Every new data center build amplifies these demands. Their construction has already become one of the world’s fastest-growing industrial sectors for copper, aluminum, and specialized steels. Yet production of critical raw materials remains concentrated in a handful of unstable and/or authoritarian countries. The mathematics are unforgiving: Small shortages in transformer steel or copper can delay data center completion by years, with cascading effects on compute availability across both the civilian economy and defense networks.

This situation reflects the limitations that previously characterized naval logistics and fuel supply chains in the 20th century. In this context, computation has become a new form of logistics: Instead of moving oil to the front, it moves information to the decision-maker. And like oil, its flow depends on extraction, refining, and transport chains that are slow, exposed, and politically entangled.

Power requirements amplify the problem. Each megawatt of data center load also requires an investment in grid capacity through substations, high-voltage lines, and cooling systems, which depend on the same constrained material inputs.

Meanwhile, China’s 2024 National Computing Network Initiative plans over 300 new dual-use data centers that explicitly combine commercial and defense functions. Conversely, the expansion of computing in the United States is constrained by transformer shortages, permitting delays, and utility congestion. The inequality lies in hardware: Those who govern material throughput dictate digital speed. This disparity poses a sustained threat to information supremacy.

The American economy and military are racing to deploy AI, advanced analytics, and global sensor networks, yet current bottlenecks reside in the alloys. Each layer of digital acceleration adds an industrial burden that compounds over time. Rather than pursuing an endless build-up of capacity, the United States must also innovate its way out of material dependence. Advances in chip architecture, photonics integration, and compute efficiency, like domain-specific accelerators and co-packaged optics, can reduce the physical footprint of compute. Investing in efficiency at the transistor and algorithm level can stretch limited materials far further than adding another data hall.

Emerging Vulnerabilities: Grid, Transformers, and Mineral Bottlenecks

The most advanced command-and-control systems in the world still depend on transformers, specialized metals, and high-purity optics that each have globalized supply chains with slow replacement cycles. What once seemed like a commercial challenge is now a question of national security. A grid failure or material shortage that halts data center construction can lead to delays in the flow of intelligence and targeting data to combatant commands.

Transformer availability sits at the center of this risk. Rising demand, aging manufacturing equipment, and global concentration of electrical-steel supply have extended delivery schedules from under a year to more than four (see Figure 2). The same pattern holds for high-voltage substation components and electrical steel, where China, India, and Japan dominate supply. This creates an invisible drag on digital expansion. Even if America builds new compute clusters, the energy infrastructure that powers them cannot keep pace.

Figure 2. Lead-Time Ladder for Critical Compute Infrastructure

The estimates for lead times are derived from an aggregation of data from the US Department of Energy (DOE) reports in 2023 and 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in 2024, and private-sector analyses, including those from EPRI, the Uptime Institute, and McKinsey in 2023. The figures represent median durations and are subject to variation based on capacity and permitting jurisdiction.

These constraints spill directly into defense readiness. The recent US Department of Energy Grid Supply Chain Review cautions that the transformer backlog, extending for many years, is causing systemic delays in both commercial and defense programs. The 2021 Texas power crisis illustrated how grid instability can lead to widespread digital blackouts. Should such a disruption coincide with cyber or kinetic attacks, command-and-control systems dependent on commercial clouds may fail during crucial mobilization phases. In contrast, China’s State Grid Corporation manages dual-purpose “computing and command” corridors that ensure uninterrupted power supply for military intelligence fusion centers. The disparity is stark: US computing relies on market logistics, but China’s computing is regarded as national defense infrastructure.

Equally concerning is the geopolitical geography of these critical materials. China produces over 70 percent of the world’s transformer steel, refines most rare-earth elements, and dominates the wafer-level photonics used in optical transceivers. Any export restriction or embargo could throttle global build-out of hyperscale compute, giving Beijing a lever over both economic and military networks. Even friendly bottlenecks matter: The United States has only two domestic transformer plants capable of producing the large units needed for defense-critical data centers. The combination of long industrial lead times and concentrated supply creates a slow-burn crisis. Power, not processing speed, may determine who holds the advantage in digital-age warfare.

From Compute to Combat Power: Why the Cloud Is a Warfighting Enabler

Modern warfighting runs on compute. Every mission, from satellite intelligence and maritime surveillance to predictive maintenance and AI-enabled targeting, depends on data flowing through vast server farms and secure fiber links. These networks form to support military and intelligence actions across Joint All Domain Operations (JADO). When that data flow slows, the tempo of sensing, deciding, and acting slows with it. Compute latency means combat latency.

Decision cycles that previously depended on human analysis increasingly rely on distributed computing infrastructures. The more rapidly a nation can receive, communicate, and integrate sensor data, the more credible its deterrent stance becomes. Throughout the conflict in Ukraine, distributed cloud architectures were pivotal. When Russian missile strikes targeted Ukraine’s command infrastructure, Kyiv rapidly migrated intelligence and targeting data to cloud-based systems. That shift allowed operations to continue with minimal disruption, preserving pace and decision speed even under attack. Compute resilience enabled continuity of operations.

Compute is the new logistics for 21st-century warfare. It moves information instead of fuel, but its vulnerabilities are strikingly similar: limited surge capacity, globalized dependencies, and long resupply timelines. The United States once maintained strategic stockpiles of oil and munitions to ensure freedom of action in crisis. Today it must think the same way about the transformers, rare-earth magnets, and photonic wafers that are needed for a data server farm. Each is a “just-in-time” component that underwrites digital-age war.

Faster kill chains require the compute power hidden in the algorithms and AI at physical server farms, which depend on uninterrupted access to power, bandwidth, and data. An adversary that can choke these inputs, either through cyber-attack, export control, or sabotage, can slow US decision-making without firing a shot. Hence, protecting compute infrastructure is a strategic imperative that can hinder or enable US military operations in crisis or conflict.

Ultimately, superiority in warfighting increasingly depends on data that can be processed, transmitted, and acted upon faster than the enemy. Compute is combat power, and the materials that sustain it are the new munitions. Securing this edge means the United States must defend and sustain the factories, foundries, and substations that make data centers function.

Six Steps to Improve US Compute Power and Resilience

We highlight six steps needed to align industrial tools and defense planning approaches to preserve the US economy and military warfighting abilities.

First, Washington must designate and protect National Compute Nodes, data center clusters whose function is critical to both economic stability and military readiness. These facilities should receive priority access to transformers, fiber routes, and electrical power, along with hardened redundancy and physical defenses comparable to strategic ports and air bases. Compute should be viewed as a form of infrastructure sovereignty and defended accordingly. Regional diversification of data centers would ensure resilience, so that no single natural disaster, cyber-attack, or grid failure can paralyze national decision-making.

Second, the United States must accelerate grid and transformer capacity. Transformer lead times now exceed two years, delaying both commercial and defense projects. The Department of Energy should coordinate with industry to co-fund new electrical-steel and transformer manufacturing plants, establish a strategic reserve of key grid components, and expedite permitting for defense-critical substations. Every week of delay in electrical power delivery translates into slower compute growth, meaning slower economic growth and military command and control.

Third, policymakers must secure materials and photonics supply chains. Copper, transformer steel, rare-earth magnets, and indium-phosphide wafers underpin the entire data center ecosystem. Yet these midstream refining and finishing processes are concentrated in China. Extending Defense Production Act authorities, allied sourcing partnerships, and industrial incentives to these materials will reduce foreign dependency. Recycling and circular-economy programs can supplement domestic supply, but they cannot substitute for new refining and alloy capacity on US soil.

Fourth, Washington needs to deploy targeted industrial tools to rebuild the “missing middle” of manufacturing that connects raw materials to finished components. CHIPS Act styled incentives should expand to include magnet alloys, capacitor powders, optical connectors, and power electronics. These investments are modest compared to the strategic cost of supply-chain ruptures in wartime; plus, they yield long-term dividends in jobs, technology, and resilience across the defense industrial base.

Fifth, compute resilience must become an element of defense planning. Combatant commands should wargame scenarios in which data centers or regional grids are degraded or disrupted. Exercises should test backup compute, power rerouting, and data prioritization under contested conditions, just as logistics drills stress munitions and fuel. Deterrence depends on speed of response, and the assurance that speed can be sustained when data systems are strained or attacked.

Finally, the United States must align its electrical power grid with national security. Data center reliability depends on uninterrupted energy. This can mean small modular reactors, advanced geothermal plants, or contracted renewables backed by large-scale storage. The Pentagon should treat megawatts as munitions: finite, strategic, and vital to operations. Hardening that power base completes the loop between energy, compute, and combat power. It ensures the US military can sense, decide, and act faster than an adversary.

Emerging sensor technologies will amplify these compute demands. Quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and other precision sensors will generate unprecedented data volumes, collapsing the decision window in future conflicts. Quantum sensing may make the invisible visible, but only if backed by resilient compute infrastructure capable of processing those signals in real time. Without secure power and stable data centers, quantum advantages are lost to immense noise these systems will generate.

By locking power, materials, and manufacturing into a single resilience plan, the United States can preserve its edge economically and militarily. Securing transformers, materials, and megawatts is as vital as maintaining aircraft or missiles. Washington must invest in the industrial base of intelligence—the physical architecture of cognition that turns information into strategy and compute into combat power.

The Trump administration had just adopted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which fundamentally altered tax and spending policies in the United States, including phasing out federal tax credits for clean energy.

Biggart, who has worked in the solar industry for over two decades, was alarmed. Just a few years ago, the Biden administration had done the opposite by raising solar tax credits to 30% for homeowners and businesses — increasing interest, accessibility and market for solar energy. But now, Biggart prepared for that momentum to plunge in 2026.

“A lot of people are trying to install solar right now, because once you roll into January you won’t get the credit,” said Biggart, CEO of Freedom Solar Power, a residential solar installation company based in Austin. “I would say once that credit is gone, the solar market is going to go down by 30% to 40%.”

Solar energy has been on the rise in Texas for decades, but a dramatic shift in renewable federal policy and funding has left the industry unstable and industry actors like Biggart uncertain of the future. As a consequence, incentives that made solar energy installation and employment attractive, accessible and affordable have vaporized across the state — throwing a wrench in the growing market.

Before Donald Trump took office a second time, the Biden administration increased the renewable energy tax credit from 20% to 30%, and created Solar for All — a $7 billion federal fund designed to expand solar energy access to disadvantaged communities across the country through the administration’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

However, in an effort to halt the growth of renewable energy in favor of the oil and gas industry, the Trump administration is phasing out the tax credit by January 2026 and eliminating Solar for All — stripping recipients of any initially awarded funds. This includes nearly $250 million for California, $156 million for Pennsylvania and $400 million for Texas.

Experts, officials and businesses across the country have sounded alarm bells over the impact these funding and policy changes will have on the solar industry. In Texas, Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee sued the Trump administration and Environmental Protection Agency in October, arguing that the administration’s decision to claw back the money is unlawful. In the meantime, the funding remains frozen. As for the loss of tax credits, solar companies like Biggart’s are in a kind of purgatory, fighting to stay afloat for the foreseeable future.

“We have more projects than we can literally fill a schedule, and we’re hiring like crazy and trying to get these projects done,” Biggart said. “But there’s this cliff and how far is the cliff, and how gnarly it is, is sort of to be determined.”

Accessible Solar

Despite being home to one of the largest petrochemical industries in the world, Texas has a large and growing renewable energy market.

The state is third in solar jobs behind California and Florida, and employment in the solar industry has increased by nearly 30% between 2018 and 2023, according to the Interstate Renewable Energy Council. And, recent reporting by the United States Energy Information Administration found that in Texas, utility-scale solar — which is solar energy sold directly to the state electrical grid — generated 50% more energy within the first nine months of 2025 than in the same period in 2024, and nearly four times more than in the same period in 2021.

However, the state is not as far along when it comes to nonutility-scale residential installation and community solar programs, according to Margaret Cook, vice president of water and community resilience at the Houston Advanced Research Center, a nonprofit focused on sustainable development and science.

“We have little problems in Texas getting those large [utility-scale] installations and the jobs associated with that,” Cook said. “Our single family, multifamily, our commercial and residential solar industries are not as robust and they are seeing a lot of turnover, downsizing of companies.”

Solar for All was meant to help close that gap by expanding energy access to low-income and disadvantaged communities across Texas through various partnerships and programs. The eventual goal was to lower energy costs and create local job opportunities in the industry — meaning more affordable and accessible solar energy.

With the federal program in place, solar companies prepared for a huge influx of work by hiring more people to get ready for the expected increase in business. Now, Cook said those are sunk costs since none of the companies will be receiving the grant money they were promised.

And it wasn’t just Solar for All. Other renewable energy funding eliminated or halted left numerous programs without funding.

The Black United Fund of Texas — a nonprofit housed in Houston’s historic Fifth Ward — had expected millions in funding from the federal government for a local solar installation training program through several EPA environmental justice and resiliency grants. The organization had already hired instructors and started its first class. But all the funds it initially received have been frozen or eliminated, and the organization had to search for new funding.

“Trust is a big thing in low-income communities because everyone comes in promising so many things, and usually they don’t see anything directly change or impact them,” said Velika Thomas, chief financial officer for the Black United Fund.

Some of the students were able to graduate from the first class, but weren’t able to continue to the next phases, said Thomas. Those students got jobs at a local solar installation company, but the organization is still searching for more funding for future students.

The same type of whiplash left companies like Biggart’s pivoting on the spot after the tax credit ended. Originally, Biggart could breathe a sigh of relief. The 30% credit the Biden administration adopted would last 10 years, until 2032. It meant he could plan how the market would look for the next several years. But after July, all that planning and relief went out the window.

Freedom Solar is now rebranding as Freedom Power, Biggart said. The company launched a heating, ventilation and air conditioning installation business and a generator business in addition to the solar installation and battery business. Two years ago, Freedom Solar had 1,000 employees. This year, it has 400.

“It’s sort of like riding a bull a little bit,” Biggart said. “There are a lot of ups and downs in the solar industry.”

Bringing Solar Back

Before the Trump administration cut funds, Harris County — a leader in Solar for All in Texas — was planning for 4,300 projects across Texas that would aid 30,000 low-income households through the initiative, according to the Office of County Attorney Menefee. He sued the Trump administration and the EPA in October.

Initially, when the Big Beautiful Bill passed in early July, the administration repealed only the unobligated funds — the funds that had not yet been distributed. This came to only $19 million out of the total $7 billion allocation and wasn’t deemed a massive concern, said Menefee.

“But then in August this year, the EPA administrator announced that Solar for All, all $7 billion, would be eliminated,” Menefee said. “So that’s when we started getting ready to take action, which is what led to the lawsuit.”

In an August statement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said that the EPA no longer has the statutory authority to administer the program or to access the appropriated funds to “keep this boondoggle alive.”

Menefee disagrees. The Constitution and the laws of this country don’t allow a president to unilaterally eliminate a program that was appropriated by Congress and for which the funds have been fully obligated, he said. And Texas isn’t the only state taking action: nearly two dozen other states have also sued the Trump administration over Solar for All.

Experts point out that the administration’s move against solar and renewable energy is contrary to market demands. Solar is still on the rise in Texas, especially for the large utility-scale companies, said Cook, the vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center.

Energy prices across Texas are also increasing, widening the gap that already exists between those who can afford electricity and those who struggle to pay the bills. For years, renewable energy, like solar, has been a growing solution to this concern since solar has proven to be more cost effective than traditional energy in the long term — at least for those who can pay the upfront installation cost.

In this new economy, the administration isn’t limiting access for everyone in the same way, said Cook. Solar is moving forward, but it’s leaving people behind at the same time.

“Texas has a lot of sun, a lot of land. It makes a lot of sense to do a utility-scale project in [the state]. It’s just very economically advantageous,” Cook said. “But Solar for All is for people to access what they might never have had access to without this program.”

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

This memo draws on CPE’s work with state agencies and municipalities nationwide, and demonstrates how tools like green banks, revolving funds, and public equity structures can advance climate goals while generating returns. They suggest that state actions taken now will build the institutional capacity to enable faster implementation when federal support returns.

The Trump administration has used both administrative and legislative measures to roll back the progress that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was making to decarbonize and modernize America’s energy system while containing consumer costs. With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), many IRA programs including tax credit support to renewable energy, federal loans for new energy infrastructure, and support for building decarbonization have been halted. New administrative barriers have been erected to minimize the impacts of the programs that still exist.

States can keep the flame of green industrial policy alive through the next three years to preserve some of the IRA’s gains and build a base of administrative competence, innovation, and market information for the day that we see competence return to the federal government. As part of its efforts to build public sector capacity among states, the Center for Public Enterprise has undertaken projects to help states replace and expand some of the functions of IRA, while acknowledging the fiscal limitations of state governments relative to the federal government.

States should be an investor in the green transition. We encourage leaders to find strategic business opportunities for state entities’ financial and development authorities not just by incentivizing the private sector to encourage investment in your state’s infrastructure but also by creating and redistributing value to the taxpayer. Institutions such as green banks, bond banks, and public investment funds can support green industrial policy while also generating returns to the budget that can be recycled or used as a cross-subsidy for further investment in essential projects.

Critical uses for public investments in the post-IRA environment include:

Public development of mixed-income housing: Complimenting and encouraging investment in green industrial capacity by preemptively pairing traditional state and federal economic development efforts with proactive planning of investments into workforce infrastructure—especially housing. State leaders such as the Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission (Maryland) not only streamlined regulation to build new housing but invested public capital into both traditional low income housing and “mixed income social housing,” combining both market-rate and subsidized units using tools such as publicly financed revolving funds. We are providing financial modeling and capital planning services to over 15 municipalities and state governments interested in addressing the housing shortage through this revolving fund-led approach.

Public development or financing of critical energy infrastructure: Using existing or new state instrumentalities as “public developers” of critical infrastructure, including higher-cost technologies such as transmission, storage, geothermal, and nuclear power. For example, the New York Power Authority has been instrumental in sustaining the state’s clean energy progress by building a pipeline of renewable energy projects owned and developed by the state in partnership with private developers.

Public development and financing of local grid resilience: Supporting smaller-scale decarbonization efforts such as rooftop solar and storage deployment and building decarbonization via both green bank lending and green bank-led public development. For example, the Connecticut Green Bank’s Solar Municipal Assistance Program uses its own power purchase agreement (PPA) and lease structures to directly build public-public partnerships with municipalities and community organizations, with the bank as PPA holder and lessor.

Public procurement of clean energy: Investing in both centralized procurement of clean energy projects and PPA warehousing to crowd in capital. In the former case, the state’s utility commission can itself sign PPAs and mandate that regulated utilities buy certain kinds of contracted power (e.g., geothermal or offshore wind). In the latter case, states play a more entrepreneurial role by signing upfront PPAs with developers, to lower developers’ construction risks, and selling them to end-users of clean energy when projects are complete, earning returns in the process. To maximize the impact of such measures, states should examine options for pre-payment of PPA contracts. California has implemented the former of these projects while the latter is being examined in several states in the Western Interconnect grid region.

Public backstop for critical projects: Examining opportunities to rescue projects that have encountered unexpected financial bottlenecks from federal policy uncertainty though public equity or lending structures. Many renewable energy projects rely on tax credit financing and are rushing to meet expiration deadlines. However, administration actions and other delays may cause projects to miss these cutoffs, forcing them to resort to higher-cost financing. In the absence of tax credits, most developers are anticipating charging higher rates for power. Our modelling and research demonstrates that low-cost state loans and public purchases of projects can replace a significant amount of the value provided by tax credits and allow stranded projects to reach completion without raising ratepayer electricity prices.

Whatever the future of national energy and climate policy, states will have to be critical players in economic development policy. Thus, undertaking active public investment is more than just helping sustain momentum before the federal government takes the lead: It is building up vital capacity for many possible futures. One of the roadblocks to IRA implementation was that states had very little experience and capacity in acting as developers and investors, or as partners to federal programs. Thus, they could not easily take advantage of many of the law’s many incentives or play a role in implementing federal policy on the ground. Working now to build up institutional knowledge and capacity will allow states to accelerate their efforts when the funding picture improves and, in the meantime, serve as the laboratories of democracy for the future of our energy system.",https://publicenterprise.org/wp-content/uploads/Norris_Dam_Norris_TN_-_51441440309.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:03:23.093349

Last month in Japan, U.S. President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. ""Go out and buy a Toyota,"" Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Toyota has been one of the slowest automakers to move to full EVs but has rapidly moved to convert its best-selling vehicles to hybrids.

""We know there is no single path to progress,"" Ogawa said on Wednesday. ""That's why we remain committed to our multi-pathway approach, offering fuel-efficient gas engines, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electronics and fuel cell electronics.""

Other automakers like Volkswagen have said they will add more hybrids as the Trump administration has rescinded EV tax credits and eliminated penalties that incentivized EV sales.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the event the administration plans to soon propose to ease fuel economy standards, saying prior rules were too aggressive.

Duffy in January signed an order to direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to rescind fuel economy standards issued under President Joe Biden for the 2022-2031 model years that had aimed to drastically reduce fuel use for cars and trucks.","https://dam.mediacorp.sg/image/upload/s--YZoAQeme--/c_fill,g_auto,h_676,w_1200/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/v1/one-cms/core/2025-11-12T164213Z_2_LYNXMPELAB0VK_RTROPTP_3_AUTOSHOW-NEW-YORK.JPG?itok=gzSvODZw",N,,2025-11-12 14:03:03.032422

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided to retain the designation for PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA (Superfund)— a decision with sweeping implications for local governments, wastewater utilities, and other public entities that handle PFAS-contaminated water or waste.

While the designation aims to hold polluters accountable for cleanup costs, it also introduces significant liability questions for passive receivers, including municipal utilities that did not create or directly discharge PFAS.

To help agencies understand the potential impacts and next steps, SL Environmental Law Group is hosting a live forum featuring Senior Partner Ken Sansone, one of the nation’s leading attorneys in PFAS litigation and water contamination recovery.

What You’ll Learn

This session will provide critical insights into how EPA’s decision affects the public sector — including what risks and opportunities lie ahead for utilities and municipalities:

Understanding CERCLA Liability: How the designation of PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA creates potential liability for passive receivers of PFAS, like wastewater utilities and local governments.

Cost Exposure and Risk: What types of cleanup or compliance costs agencies could face under the new classification.

Congressional Action and Next Steps: Why utilities remain vulnerable until Congress acts, and what agencies can do now to mitigate risk and prepare for potential liabilities.

Participants will also have the opportunity to ask questions during a live Q&A with Ken Sansone, who will discuss the latest developments and share practical strategies for navigating PFAS-related exposure.

Why This Matters

The EPA’s decision to retain the PFAS CERCLA designation marks a pivotal moment for utilities and municipalities.

“We have significant lending authority at the loan program office,” Energy Secretary Chris Wright said at a Washington, D.C. event, according to CNBC.

“By far the biggest use of those dollars will be for nuclear power plants — to get those first plants built.”

The secretary, speaking at a conference held by the American Nuclear Society, noted that he expects electricity demand from artificial intelligence to attract billions of dollars from “very creditworthy providers,” CNBC reported. Wright was quoted as saying that his department could match those dollars by as much as four to one.

President Donald Trump directed the department in May to start building 10 large nuclear reactors by 2030. Wright reportedly added that he hopes there will be dozens under construction by the time the administration ends.

Trump also ordered the secretary to prioritize activities that support nuclear energy to help comply with his construction directive. The president told Wright to use his loan office to build new advanced reactors, finish those that were prematurely suspended, increase the power output of plants that are operating and make resources available to restart closed plants.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

Glenfarne, Baker Hughes announce agreements to advance Alaska LNG

Glenfarne/Baker Hughes

Glenfarne Alaska LNG and Baker Hughes announced a strategic alliance through definitive agreements to advance the Alaska LNG Project, a collaboration celebrated in Washington, D.C. Glenfarne selected Baker Hughes to supply main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. Furthermore, Baker Hughes committed to a strategic investment in the project. This partnership, which was praised by U.S. government officials for strengthening U.S. energy security and global competitiveness, reflects the project’s momentum. The Alaska LNG project is being developed in two phases, with Phase Two adding a 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) LNG export terminal, expected to reach its final investment decision in late 2026. [MDN: Alaska, given its geography, is best suited to export LNG to the Pacific Rim.]

Venture Global CEO says CP2 capacity could grow to 30 million tpy

Oil & Gas Journal/Geert De Lombaerde

Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel announced that the $29 billion CP2 LNG plant’s capacity could reach 30 million tpy, up from 28 million tpy. This improved efficiency is based on data science and AI applied to operational learnings from the Calcasieu Pass and Plaquemines plants. Venture Global reported strong third-quarter results, posting a net income of $429 million on over $3.3 billion in revenue, reversing a year-ago loss. The company exported 100 LNG cargos in Q3, and updated its annual guidance, projecting 148 cargos for Calcasieu Pass and 234-238 for Plaquemines. The announcement came as the company signed a 1-million tpy supply deal with Naturgy and saw its shares rise. [MDN: Too bad VG’s “strong results” come from screwing its contracted customers out of their contracted shipments.]

Venture Global and Mitsui announce 20-year LNG sales and purchase deal

Venture Global

Venture Global, Inc. and Mitsui & Co., Ltd. of Japan have executed a new, long-term Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) for liquefied natural gas (LNG). Under the 20-year agreement, which begins in 2029, Mitsui will purchase 1.0 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG from Venture Global. Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel stated that this new partnership strengthens energy security, enhances the balance of trade, and deepens the ties between the U.S. and Japan, building on existing relationships with Japanese companies to reliably supply LNG to Japan and the global market. [MDN: The Japanese are not stupid people, yet they cut a deal with a company that is known to delay contracted shipments for years—and yet they cut the deal anyway.

Greece signs landmark 20-year LNG deal with Venture Global

Greek Reporter/Tasos Kokkinidis

Greece has secured its first long-term, 20-year LNG supply deal with US giant Venture Global, commencing in 2030, which cements its role in the transatlantic effort to displace Russian gas in Europe. The contract, signed by Greek companies DEPA Commercial and Aktor (Atlantic-See LNG Trade S.A.), guarantees a minimum annual supply of 0.7 billion cubic meters (bcm), with the potential to reach 4 bcm. US Energy Secretary Chris Wright publicly hailed the agreement, stating Greece is strategically moving from being dependent on Russia to a “launch point” for American energy into Europe. Greek officials, including Minister Stavros Papastavrou, are aggressively positioning the nation as an essential LNG hub, investing in infrastructure like the Alexandroupoli FSRU to facilitate transport northward via the Vertical Corridor, aiming to stabilize markets and enhance European competitiveness.

Massachusetts bill will “empower local climate action” by banning natural gas hookups

New Bedford (MA) NewBedfordGuide.com

Massachusetts lawmakers are advancing bill H3449 to expand a 2022 pilot program that currently allows 10 municipalities to ban natural gas hookups in new buildings. The expansion would permit 10 more cities and towns to join, supporting the state’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050 through reducing fossil fuel reliance and cutting long-term energy costs. Proponents, including Rep. Manny Cruz, emphasize climate urgency and cite research showing all-electric homes have lower costs, while data suggests the existing pilot has not slowed construction. However, critics, like former Governor Baker, express concern over potential cost increases during a housing shortage. The bill awaits committee votes as a key step toward local climate action. [MDN: We wonder what it’s like living under Communism like that in Massachusetts. Do the people who keep electing dictators even care that their Constitutional freedoms are being extinguished? Or are they that brainwashed?]

New York’s bad energy policies are out of control — time for Trump to take over

Washington (DC) The Hill/Paul H. Tice

The op-ed argues that President Trump’s attempts to change New York’s aggressive anti-fossil fuel policies through bargaining, like the speculated deal linking the Empire Wind restart to natural gas pipeline approvals, are ineffective. Governor Kathy Hochul’s administration has enacted strict measures like the All-Electric Building Act and a new climate tax, despite temporarily greenlighting the NESE pipeline last week. The author contends that this partial pipeline victory does not signal an end to New York’s net-zero crusade. Instead of seeking one-off project approvals, the Trump administration should use the court system to establish federal preemption over state environmental and energy laws, citing New York’s policies as an ideal test case. [MDN: The author, Paul Tice, a senior fellow at the National Center for Energy Analytics, makes a great point. It’s time to permanently establish federal authority over the states with energy policy. It’s a Constitutional issue.]

Study shows resource scarcity, bureaucracy barriers to natural gas use in CT

Inside Investigator/Alex Appel

A report by the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research details significant hurdles to expanding natural gas use in the state. Connecticut possesses minimal natural gas resources and cannot geologically store gas, requiring reliance on interstate pipelines. Expanding these pipelines, such as the proposed Constitution project, involves navigating complex, protracted federal and state bureaucratic processes, potential use of eminent domain, and risks from public opposition and securing a viable customer base. An S&P Global study confirms growing demand and the obstacles, noting that previous state initiatives to limit financial risk failed. However, the study estimates that overcoming barriers to the Constitution pipeline could net ratepayers $8.5 billion in savings and generate an additional $8.5 billion for regional businesses over 15 years. [MDN: Yet another study that says the proposed Constitution Pipeline would massively benefit New Englanders, like those in Connecticut.]

Duke Energy five-year capital plan could exceed $100B

Utility Dive/Emma Penrod

Duke Energy is expanding its five-year capital plan to $95–$105 billion, up from the current $87 billion, to meet rapid load growth, largely driven by data centers. The company has already secured 3 GW in new electric service agreements with data centers this year, expecting build-out to accelerate into the early 2030s. System additions could exceed 13 GW over the next five years, including 7.5 GW of new natural gas generation, solar, and battery storage. New nuclear generation is also being evaluated, but only after cost and supply chain issues are resolved. Duke expects to finance 30% to 50% of this ambitious plan with new equity. [MDN: The article reveals that Duke has secured 19 natural gas turbines and selected sites for seven new gas plants. Duke’s service territory is primarily in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky—all of which receive M-U molecules. The company is making a major investment in new gas-fired power.

Trump’s EPA ‘leaning into innovation’ instead of overregulation to protect environment

Brietbart/Hannah Knudsen

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin stated that the Trump administration is prioritizing innovation and utilizing domestic energy resources over excessive regulation to protect the environment. He emphasized the high environmental stewardship standards already maintained by U.S. companies, citing numerous examples of industry initiatives across the country. Zeldin mentioned an Exxon Mobil advanced recycling operation in Texas that breaks down plastic, as well as new projects like a nuclear facility in Idaho and natural gas expansions from the Permian Basin to Arizona. He believes firsthand perspective from visiting these diverse, “multi-dimensional” projects nationwide is crucial for effective environmental policy, asserting that relying solely on D.C.-based regulatory discussions is insufficient. [MDN: The enviro-left pretends that without the bludgeon of government regulation companies will pollute us all to hell. Nothing further from the truth. Yes, some regulation is necessary. But the pendulum has swung WAY too far to the left. Zeldin is restoring common sense and balance to the EPA and its onerous overregulatory ways.]

Deloitte puts focus on natural gas in 2026

Midland (TX) Reporter-Telegram/Mella McEwen

Deloitte’s 2026 Oil & Gas Industry Outlook notes that the sector maintains strong capital discipline and innovation following the 2014 downturn. According to Kate Hardin, oil prices are softening, contrasting with a tightening natural gas market driven by rising data center and power demand. Natural gas and LNG companies are expected to increase capital expenditures and expand shale acreage to meet this growth and supportive LNG export policies. However, oil companies will remain cautious in 2026, delaying major spending until structural changes in global fundamentals occur. Facing rising costs and uncertainty, nearly 70% of U.S. O&G companies plan portfolio restructuring, cost optimization, and divesting noncore assets, underscoring a continued focus on shareholder returns over production expansion. [MDN: Years ago, we hinted (maybe even predicted) that oil would eventually decrease, but natural gas would increase. It was easy to spot. And now it’s beginning to happen. Oil will never go away completely, but over time, natgas will grow and continue growing. At least for the next 50-100 years.]

Former Gov. McAuliffe joins pro-natural gas group as national co-chair

Virginia Mercury

Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe has joined Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future as co-chair to promote natural gas as a necessary bridge for long-term energy reliability while renewable sources develop. The organization, which advocates for an “all of the above” energy approach, posits that using natural gas alongside solar and wind can lower utility bills and cut emissions compared to coal, despite Virginia’s plan to eliminate fossil fuels. Natural Allies, whose leadership includes former bipartisan politicians, argues that a 100% renewable transition is too costly and challenging for meeting peak energy demand. However, the group, reportedly backed by fossil fuel companies, is accused of “greenwashing” the climate impact of natural gas to appeal to Democrats and young constituents. They are currently focusing efforts in states like Virginia, where debates about proposed gas plants are ongoing. [MDN: Lib Dems like Terry McAwful join pro-gas groups like Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future for one reason and one reason only: money. They have no principles and would turn on natgas in a heartbeat if other (better) payers appeared.]

America at 250 needs energy overhaul – ARC is the place to start

RealClearPolitics/David DesRosiers

Rep. Troy Balderson introduced “The Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act” (ARC) to correct the focus of current energy policy, which the article argues prioritizes clean energy over affordability and reliability. The ARC bill would require federal agencies like the DOE, DOI, and EPA to prioritize affordability first, reliability second, and cleanliness third when evaluating energy projects. This “all-of-the-above” approach aims to codify the inclusion of all viable, cost-effective, and reliable sources, including natural gas and nuclear, to lower energy costs for American families and businesses. The author presents a nonpartisan appeal, arguing that current energy priorities lead to rising rates, citing examples in New Jersey and Georgia, and that the new framework is essential for economic growth and meeting future demands like AI. [MDN: An op-ed from the publisher of the RealClear websites. He lends his support to Balderson’s excellent bill.]

Oil gains as fuel prices surge

Bloomberg/A. Longley, R.W. Neo and W. Kubzansky

Oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate settling near $61 a barrel, rose for a third day, defying signs of a softer crude market, as support came from surging premiums for refined fuels like gasoline and diesel, and heightened concerns over Russian supply following a US crackdown. Analysts attribute the gains to strong product markets, which are keeping crude prices afloat despite a prolonged slump driven by widespread expectations of a global surplus and increased output from OPEC+ and other drillers. The narrowing WTI prompt spread suggests excess supply, but a major selloff is deemed unlikely unless the strength in refined products decisively ends. Traders also engaged in short covering after WTI successfully held the $60 level. [MDN: WTI for December delivery added 1.5% to settle at $61.04 a barrel. Brent for January settlement edged up 1.7% to settle at $65.16 a barrel. Despite its best effort to denigrate oil and talk the price down, the price keeps returning to the $60s, which is confounding for the leftstream media.]

Exxon CEO expects long-term role for oil and gas, maybe not as fuel

Reuters/Oliver Griffin

Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods stated that crude oil and hydrocarbons will remain critical for a long time, but their use as fuel (combustion) is likely to change as technology evolves, noting continued demand in other sectors, such as medical. Speaking ahead of the COP30 climate conference, Woods criticized current climate policy, stating that without effective carbon accounting to properly track emissions across value chains, “net zero is just a slogan.” He also expressed optimism about the company’s early-stage negotiations to return to Iraq to manage, develop, and operate the Majnoon oil field, emphasizing the need for a favorable, win-win investment proposition with the Iraqi government. [MDN: Darren Woods is undoubtedly a better CEO for Exxon than his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. However, Woods continues to dally with global warming nutters who insist we “transition” to non-fossil fuels for energy. No, Mr. Woods, we do NOT need “carbon accounting” (i.e., a carbon tax). Wise up!]

US urges Europe to stick to oil and gas, not renewables

Reuters/Edward Mcallister, Lefteris Papadimas

U.S. energy and interior secretaries recently argued that global renewable energy investments have failed to deliver, urging a focus on securing reliable fossil fuel supplies, particularly to Europe. Speaking at an energy conference, U.S. officials, reflecting the Trump administration’s policy, pushed to boost U.S. oil and gas exports to replace Russian imports entirely. Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated the shift to renewables “hasn’t worked,” citing that despite trillions spent, solar and wind accounted for only 2.6% of global energy last year. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum claimed there is “no energy transition, there’s only energy addition,” underscoring a divergence from the European Union’s emissions reduction goals.

China could crash the price of oil

Forbes/Michael Lynch

Despite the IEA’s forecast of a massive looming oil glut and inventory build for 2025-2026, critics highlight that observed inventory data has not shown the expected increase, implying a tighter current market. The article argues this discrepancy is largely explained by significant, non-transparent inventory builds in China’s strategic oil stocks, which absorbed 700-900 thousand barrels per day (tb/d). Although the IEA still projects a substantial market surplus (over 2 mb/d by 2026), the market’s stability and price level depend precariously on China’s future purchasing decisions. If China abruptly halts its unpredictable strategic stock-buying, the surplus could turn into a severe flood of oil, likely necessitating intervention by OPEC+ to prevent a price collapse. [MDN: The author makes the point that the price of oil is pretty much in the hands of the thug dictatorship of China. How did we get here?]

IEA backs bullish oil demand growth scenario in tone shift

Bloomberg/Grant Smith

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has reversed its previous outlook, reintroducing a “Current Policies Scenario” (CPS) where global oil demand continues to grow by 13% through 2050, a shift attributed to slower electric vehicle adoption. This latest report marks a softening of the IEA’s stance on a near-term peak in demand and aligns more closely with the views of OPEC. The CPS, which envisions consumption climbing to 113 million barrels per day by 2050 and temperatures rising by nearly 3°C, contrasts with the “Stated Policies Scenario” (STEPS), where demand peaks around 2030. Even in STEPS, the peak is now seen later than previously projected, highlighting a trend across the energy industry toward a bumpier road to net zero. [MDN: What’s really happened is that the IEA is (for now) dropping its propaganda advocacy for unreliable renewables and instead using real data once gain to make predictions. Why? Because the money-sucking agency was threatened with defunding by the Trump administration unless it changed.]

Climate delusions & gaslighting at COP30

Committee For A Constructive Tomorrow (CFACT)/Peter Murphy

The article harshly critiques the UN Climate Summit, COP30, labeling the proceedings as “absurdities.” It attacks UN Secretary-General António Guterres for raising “hysteria” with claims that a 1.5-degree temperature overshoot is “inevitable,” arguing he presented “zero evidence” for this catastrophe. The author contends that the globalists’ demands for massive annual funding (up to $1.3 trillion) are about control and will increase poverty by raising energy costs, noting that World Bank data shows poverty decreasing in nations developing oil and gas. Furthermore, the piece criticizes China’s Vice Premier for pushing “global climate governance” while his nation simultaneously undergoes a rapid, massive expansion of coal capacity. Ultimately, the article dismisses the climate agenda as “fantasies” that ignore the necessity of fossil fuels for global development.

The first shipments went out this past summer.

Why it matters: The Japanese company says it is creating 5,100 jobs and investing $13.9 billion in the North Carolina facility.

Workers at the facility develop and manufacture lithium-ion batteries, which are becoming increasingly important to the world's largest automaker.

State of play: Toyota now has 11 plants across the U.S., but this is the ""first and only battery plant outside of Japan,"" a press release said.

The company on Wednesday pledged an additional $10 billion in American investments over the next five years.

The factory currently employs 2,500 workers.

Context: Earlier in 2025, Japan struck a deal with the Trump administration promising manufacturing investments in the U.S. in exchange for lower tariffs.

Ted Ogawa, Toyota's chief executive in North America, says the plant reflects the automaker's priority to ""build where we sell,"" a commitment he notes President Donald Trump praised on his recent trip to Japan.

Inside the room: U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and Gov. Josh Stein both attended a flashy event held at the plant Wednesday, seated in the front row on either side of U.S. Sen. Ted Budd.

The ambassador from Japan, Shigeo Yamada, sat on Stein's other side.

What they're saying: Duffy joked he was relieved not to talk about aviation amid flight delays and cancellations caused by the government shutdown, and said, ""when companies invest in America, that means great American jobs.""

Stein says the factory helps ""build a state that is safer, stronger, cleaner and more resilient.""

Yamada says it will "" energize the economy of North Carolina — as well as the entire United States — while securing very vital supply chains.""

Zoom in: The site sprawls over 1,850 acres and runs 24/7. It will eventually accommodate 14 battery production lines for various vehicles.

That includes Camry, Corolla and RAV4 models, plus an all-electric 3-row SUV that's not yet been released.

Battery modules made in Liberty are shipped to assembly lines in Kentucky and Alabama, the company says. Factory workers say they're about 80% complete when they leave North Carolina.

Between the lines: Toyota no longer makes fully gas-powered Camrys, and its EV strategy has prioritized hybrids over all-electric models.

""I think the American people want hybrids,"" Duffy added. ""They want electric, but they also want the backup of a combustion engine.""

Don Stewart, who leads Toyota North Carolina, says the factory ""symbolizes the future of the automobile industry.""

Zoom out: For picking Liberty, Toyota is in line for around $664 million in incentives from the state and Randolph County, provided it meets hiring and investment goals.

""History tells us when a company like Toyota plants their roots in a town like ours, that community is going to thrive,"" says Rebecca Sams, a factory worker from Liberty.

“Swift and decisive action is required to jumpstart America’s nuclear energy industrial base and ensure our national and economic security by increasing fuel availability and production, securing civil nuclear supply chains, improving the efficiency with which advanced nuclear reactors are licensed, and preparing our workforce to establish America’s energy dominance and accelerate our path towards a more secure and independent energy future,” Trump said.

The Atlantic Council, an international affairs think tank, said in a May report that Trump’s order addressed “well-trodden issues” but was “ambitious.”

The president’s other directives on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which are partially aimed at reducing the federal agency’s staff, also present issues for the country’s nuclear energy industry, according to the think tank.

“In the new orders, the Trump administration has articulated ambitious goals for rapid deployment of next-generation nuclear technologies; however, reducing personnel and funding for the NRC and the Department of Energy, along with weakening the NRC’s independence and global credibility, will make it challenging to realize the full potential of the US nuclear energy industry,” the Atlantic Council explained.

Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.
Regional dynamics The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand.
But the growth of electricity demand is spectacular.” He noted the role transportation plays in accounting for 45% of global oil consumption, for example.
Nonetheless, Stephan Singer, global energy senior advisor at CAN International, a global network of environmental organizations, said getting below that point is still possible.","Electricity demand will rise much faster than overall energy growth in the coming decades, underscoring the need for diversified energy sources, according to an analysis released Wednesday.

The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years and that coal and oil demand will likely peak globally by the end of this decade. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used. Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.

The release of the annual World Energy Outlook coincided with U.N. climate negotiations in Brazil this week where global leaders are calling for ways to curb the planet's warming.

Regional dynamics

The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand. Investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion this year, exceeding investment in the oil supply, according to the report.

Growing economies including India and nations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, will “increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years,” the IEA said, noting their potential for solar power.

China, meanwhile, has accounted for half the global growth in demand for oil and gas, and more than half for electricity, since 2010.

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release. Birol said that electricity use is also rising in advanced economies.

Nations are grappling with meeting demand while preparing for the risks brought on by the planet’s warming. The IEA says the world is falling short on universal energy access and climate change goals. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, according to the IEA, and despite progress, nearly one-quarter of the global population still relies on inefficient cooking methods that hurt their health or the environment. 2024 was also the hottest year on record.

Nations should diversify their energy sources and cooperate to expand supply chains for critical minerals used to make things like batteries for electric vehicles and components for solar and wind power generation, the IEA said. This also includes making quick improvements to the grid, energy storage and broader infrastructure.

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” Birol said. “With energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals — on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.”

In a conference call Wednesday, Birol said: “We will still use oil, we will still use gas. But the growth of electricity demand is spectacular.”

He noted the role transportation plays in accounting for 45% of global oil consumption, for example. “How the electrification of the transportation takes place, especially in countries beyond China and Europe, will determine the shape of the oil demand and growth.”

Global reaction

Wednesday's edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump's administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the “endangerment finding” that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.

Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.

But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.

“The evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. ""Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.”

Maria Pastukhova, energy transition program lead at climate change think tank E3G, said the report makes “the choices for the global energy system and the global economy unambiguous.”

“If countries want to grow their economies and protect their citizens from roller-coaster energy prices, they need to focus relentlessly on energy efficiency and the (decarbonization) of energy demand,” Pastukhova said.

Others, however, were critical of how the outlook addressed oil and gas. Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council, said the outlook does not fully capture the momentum in renewables, and that it should have emphasized the trajectory for renewable energy is accelerating, driven by the decreasing cost of the technologies, strong policy support and the move toward electrification.

“We’re accelerating,” he added. “You can see it all around the world and we can see it in our numbers for last year, but also in our numbers for the first half of this year. It looks very, very exciting, both for wind and for solar, in fact, and for next year, even more so.”

The outlook foresees the likelihood of surpassing the warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) established in the Paris Agreement. Nonetheless, Stephan Singer, global energy senior advisor at CAN International, a global network of environmental organizations, said getting below that point is still possible.

The IEA addressed some of the criticism in the call Wednesday. It said that it sees differences economically, politically and with regard to clean energy efforts across the globe, and that its analysis tries to account for those differences.

“In a nutshell, the IEA is backsliding. As a global think tank, the IEA has largely failed to represent where most countries in the (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) and the developing world are, as they’re supporting net zero emissions with 98% CO2 emissions reductions by mid-century,"" Singer said.

One of those is Bayer, which last week sent a delegation to the COP30 Leaders’ Summit in Brazil where they signed a letter of intent for a new form of rainforest-based carbon credit, the first of the tradable permits that can be bought directly from Latin American rainforest countries.

For its part Bayer said it was on track for all its electricity to come from renewable sources by the end of 2029, with its five production and two supplier sites in China to reach their 100 percent green electricity target by the end of next year.",https://www.europeanpharmaceuticalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Merck-life-sciences-South-Korea.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:03:17.956053

The gross proceeds before fees and related expenses but after repayment of previous debt and a 5-day short term related party bridge loan that facilitated the transaction amounted to about $10.4 million.

Kalliopi Ornithopoulou, the President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company, said:

The SLB of M/T Eco West Coast is for an amount of $42.0 million. Pursuant to the SLB terms, we will bareboat charter back the vessel for a period of ten years at bareboat hire rates comprising of 120 consecutive monthly installments of $0.18 million along with a purchase obligation of $20.0 million at the expiry of the bareboat charter, bearing an interest rate of 3-month term SOFR plus a margin of 1.95% per annum. Under the SLB terms, we will have the option to buy back the vessel following the end of the first year at purchase prices stipulated in the bareboat charter agreement depending on when the option is exercised.

Eco Malibu Refinancing

The SLB of M/T Malibu is for an amount of $42.0 million. Pursuant to the SLB terms, we will bareboat charter back the vessel for a period of ten years at bareboat hire rates comprising of 120 consecutive monthly installments of $0.19 million along with a purchase obligation of $19.0 million at the expiry of the bareboat charter, bearing an interest rate of 3-month term SOFR plus a margin of 2.1% per annum. Under the SLB terms, we will have the option to buy back the vessel following the end of the first year at purchase prices stipulated in the bareboat charter agreement depending on when the option is exercised.

In connection with the Financing Agreements, Rubico Inc. and Rubico Inc.’s parent company, Top Ships Inc, each provided a guarantee of the obligations of our vessel-owning subsidiaries under the respective SLB. The Financing Agreements, and the relevant appurtenant guarantees, contain customary covenants and event of default clauses, including cross-default provisions and restrictive covenants and performance requirements including that we maintain a leverage ratio (as defined in the relevant corporate guarantees) of no more than 85% and minimum liquid funds (as defined in the relevant corporate guarantees) of $0.50 million in connection with the SLB of M/T Eco Malibu and $0.40 million in connection with the SLB of M/T Eco West Coast.

Last month in Japan, President Donald Trump said Toyota planned a $10 billion investment in the United States. “Go out and buy a Toyota,” Trump said. He has been critical of Japanese and other auto imports and imposed hefty tariffs on imported vehicles.

Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) staff and an administrative law judge (ALJ) agree that the gas units will not need to shut down for UMERC to comply with these renewable and clean energy standards.
These bills distract from the very real contributors to the energy affordability problem in the UP like tariffs and outdated infrastructure","Contact: Nora Naughton, nora.naughton@sierraclub.org, 248-345-1456

LANSING, MI- Michigan Senate Republicans put out a press release Tuesday that claims: ""Without legislative intervention, new energy laws would force the RICE generators to shut down.” This claim is a thinly veiled attempt by one of the UP’s largest utilities to circumvent our clean energy laws – and worse, it is categorically false.

In fact, the proposal for decision hyperlinked in the Republicans’ release clearly contradicts their claim. The PFD reads: “This PFD agrees with AG-CUB that it is possible for UMERC to operate its RICE units beyond 2040 as merchant plants and still meet the RPS, that is that Act 235 does not per se require their retirement.""

Republicans are either hoping no one will read this dense document or have not read it properly themselves.

Upper Michigan Energy Resources (UMERC) – one of the Upper Peninsula’s largest utilities – claims that compliance with state renewable energy standards would force drastic bill increases for ratepayers. Meanwhile, UMERC’s largest ratepayer, the massive out-of-state steel company Cleveland Cliffs, is ginning up fear among UP miners by threatening an early closure of the Tilden Mine due to our clean energy laws.

One big problem: none of this is true.

UMERC argued that to comply with a 2023 act it would need to prematurely close two natural gas-burning power plants. The legislation actually requires gradual compliance levels through 2040 that are designed to insulate both utilities and ratepayers from unmanageable costs.

The law establishes a renewable energy standard of 50% by 2030 and 60% by 2035, as well as a clean energy standard of 80% by 2035 and 100% by 2040, it would need to prematurely close two natural gas-burning power plants.

Michigan Public Service Commission (MPSC) staff and an administrative law judge (ALJ) agree that the gas units will not need to shut down for UMERC to comply with these renewable and clean energy standards. They also agree UMERC greatly exaggerated its costs by including expensive, unnecessary battery storage in their proposal that are unlikely to be approved.

DETROIT, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lotlinx, the auto industry’s first and only VIN Performance platform built to help dealers maximize profitability, announced today its Q3 2025 Quarterly Vincensus Report, the most comprehensive quarterly inventory report in the industry. Leveraging over 24 billion proprietary VIN-level data points and more than a decade of machine learning innovation, the report delivers unmatched insight into the state of the automotive retail market, including new and used vehicle performance, pricing trends, inventory risk, and consumer behavior. Click here to access the full Q3 Quarterly Vincensus Report.

Market Outlook:

The third quarter of 2025 presented a distorted view of the automotive market, driven by a last-minute rush for electric vehicles (EVs) ahead of an expiring federal tax credit. This surge, a 72% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase in new EV sales, represents a pull-forward of demand rather than organic growth, with EVs still comprising just over 5% of total Q3 sales across brands represented in Vincensus.

While overall new vehicle sales rose 11% QoQ and used sales increased 3%, the underlying data suggests a more price-sensitive and competitive landscape ahead. Inventory levels are stabilizing after years of volatility, exposing challenges for brands with older or mispriced vehicles. Lotlinx anticipates a highly competitive Q4, characterized by increased manufacturer incentives, deeper markdowns, and aggressive year-end sales events as automakers seek to clear aging 2025 model-year inventory.

Key Findings

Inventory and Pricing Trends

New vehicle day supply increased by 5 days QoQ to 62 days (up 1 day YoY)

Used vehicle day supply increased by 1 day QoQ to 40 days (up 4 days YoY)

Carryover for new vehicles decreased 2% QoQ to 52%; used increased 7% QoQ to 50%

Aged ending inventory decreased 3% QoQ to 42% for new vehicles and held steady at 48% for used

Units sold with a markdown increased by 1% QoQ for new vehicles and 3% QoQ for used

EV, Hybrid, and ICE Performance

New EV sales surged 72% QoQ, while hybrids rose 7% and ICE vehicles 9%

EVs made up just 5% of all sales, signaling that the surge is short-term and incentive-driven

New EV day supply dropped to 61 days and used EV day supply to 36 days — both below ICE averages

Average list price of sold new units: EVs $55,510; hybrids $44,100; ICEs $41,857

For used vehicles, EV prices fell 3% QoQ to $28,888, while ICE and hybrid prices remained stable

Market Dynamics and Competition

The stabilization of inventory has introduced new challenges, particularly for brands with aging 2025 stock

Dealers are expected to face the most aggressive pricing environment in years, with manufacturer incentives rising sharply to move inventory

Markdown strategies and real-time decisioning are becoming critical for profitability

Lotlinx Dealer Performance

Lotlinx dealers continued to outperform the broader market during Q3. On average, Lotlinx dealers had 1% less aged inventory for new vehicles and 4% less for used vehicles compared to the market. Additionally, 59% of new vehicle brands and 92% of used vehicle brands leveraging Lotlinx outperformed their respective market benchmarks.

,Texas Environment,2025-11-12 15:32:01+00:00,Los Angeles Times,"At Brazilian climate summit, Newsom positions California as a stand-in for the U.S.","Melody Gutierrez, www.latimes.com, melody-gutierrez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-12/newsoms-rise-as-americas-shadow-climate-diplomat,"But on climate, it’s not all performance.
“Absolutely,” he said when asked whether the state is in effect standing in for the United States at climate talks.
“I’m trying to call that out,” Newsom said, adding that in a normal political climate, leaders should model civility and respect.
Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of state leaders, said three governors from the United States attended COP30-related events in Brazil: Newsom, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham.
“But some of the decisions that he’s made, especially recently, don’t move us in as good a direction on climate.” Newsom is expected to return to the climate summit Wednesday before traveling deeper into the Amazon, where he plans to visit reforestation projects.","The expansive halls of the Amazon’s newly built climate summit hub echoed with the hum of air conditioners and the footsteps of delegates from around the world — scientists, diplomats, Indigenous leaders and energy executives, all converging for two frenetic weeks of negotiations.

Then Gov. Gavin Newsom rounded the corner, flanked by staff and security. They moved in tandem through the corridors on Tuesday as media swarmed and cellphone cameras rose into the air.

“Hero!” one woman shouted. “Stay safe — we need you,” another attendee said. Others didn’t hide their confusion at who the man with slicked-back graying hair causing such a commotion was.

“I’m here because I don’t want the United States of America to be a footnote at this conference,” Newsom said when he reached a packed news conference on his first day at the United Nations climate policy summit known as COP30.

In less than a year, the United States has shifted from rallying nations on combating climate change to rejecting the science altogether under President Trump, whose brash governing style spawned in part from his reality-show roots.

Newsom has engineered his own evolution when coping with Trump — moving from sharp but reasoned criticism to name-calling and theatrical attacks on the president and his Republican allies. Newsom’s approach adds fire to America’s political spectacle — part governance, part made-for-TV drama. But on climate, it’s not all performance.

California’s carbon market and zero-emission mandates have given the state outsize influence at summits such as COP30, where its policies are seen as both durable and exportable. The state has invested billions in renewables, battery storage and electrifying buildings and vehicles and has cut greenhouse gas emissions by 21% since 2000 — even as its economy grew 81%.

“Absolutely,” he said when asked whether the state is in effect standing in for the United States at climate talks. “And I think the world sees us in that light, as a stable partner, a historic partner … in the absence of American leadership. And not just absence of leadership, the doubling down of stupid in terms of global leadership on clean energy.”

Newsom has honed a combative presence online — trading barbs with Trump and leaning into satire, especially on social media, tactics that mirror the president’s. Critics have argued that it’s contributing to a lowering of the bar when it comes to political discourse, but Newsom said he doesn’t see it that way.

“I’m trying to call that out,” Newsom said, adding that in a normal political climate, leaders should model civility and respect. “But right now, we have an invasive species — in the vernacular of climate — by the name of Donald Trump, and we got to call that out.”

At home, Newsom recently scored a political win with Proposition 50, the ballot measure he championed to counter Trump’s effort to redraw congressional maps in Republican-led states. On his way to Brazil, he celebrated the victory with a swing through Houston, where a rally featuring Texas Democrats looked more like a presidential campaign stop than a policy event — one of several moments in recent months that have invited speculation about a White House run that he insists he hasn’t launched.

Those questions followed him to Brazil. It was the first topic posed from a cluster of Brazilian journalists in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s largest city and financial hub, where Newsom had flown to speak Monday with climate investors in what he conceded sounded more like a campaign speech.

“I think it has to,” said Newson, his talking points scribbled on yellow index cards still in his pocket from an earlier meeting. “I think people have to understand what’s going on, because otherwise you’re wasting everyone’s time.”

In a low-lit luxury hotel adorned with Brazilian artwork and deep-seated chairs, Newsom showcased the well-practiced pivot of a politician avoiding questions about his future. His most direct answer about his presidential prospects came in a recent interview with “CBS News Sunday Morning,” on which Newsom was asked whether he would give serious thought after the 2026 midterm elections to a White House bid. Newsom responded: “Yeah, I’d be lying otherwise.”

He laughed when asked by The Times how often he has fielded questions about his plans in 2028 in recent days, and quickly deflected.

“It’s not about me,” he said before fishing a malaria pill out of his suit pocket and chasing it with borrowed coffee from a nearby carafe. “It’s about this moment and people’s anxiety and concern about this moment.”

Ann Carlson, a UCLA environmental law professor, said Newsom’s appearance in Brazil is symbolically important as the federal government targets Californa’s decades-old authority to enforce its own environmental standards.

“California has continued to signal that it will play a leadership role,” she said.

The Trump administration confirmed to The Times that no high-level federal representative will attend COP30.

“President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.

For his own part, Trump told world leaders at the United Nations in September that climate change is a “hoax” and “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Since Trump returned to office for a second term, he’s canceled funding for major clean energy projects such as California’s hydrogen hub and moved to revoke the state’s long-held authority to set stricter vehicle emissions standards than those of the federal government. He’s also withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, a seminal treaty signed a decade ago in which world leaders established the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels and preferably below 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit). That move is seen as pivotal in preventing the worst effects of climate change.

Leaders from Chile and Colombia called Trump a liar for rejecting climate science, while Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva broadly warned that extremist forces are fabricating fake news and “condemning future generations to life on a planet altered forever by global warming.”

Terry Tamminen, former California Environmental Protection Agency secretary under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, contended that with the Trump administration’s absence, Newsom’s attendance at COP30 thrusts even more spotlight on the governor.

“If the governor of Delaware goes, it may not matter,” Tamminen said. “But if our governor goes, it does. It sends a message to the world that we’re still in this.”

The U.S. Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of state leaders, said three governors from the United States attended COP30-related events in Brazil: Newsom, Wisconsin’s Tony Evers and New Mexico’s Michelle Lujan Grisham.

Despite the warm reception Newsom has received in Belém, environmentalists in California have recently questioned his commitment.

In September, Newsom signed a package of bills that extended the state’s signature cap-and-trade program through 2045. That program, rebranded as cap-and-invest, limits greenhouse gas emissions and raises billions of dollars for the state’s climate priorities. But, at the same time, he also gave final approval to a bill that will allow oil and gas companies to drill as many as 2,000 new wells per year through 2036 in Kern County. Environmentalists called that backsliding; Newsom called it realism, given the impending refinery closures in the state that threaten to drive up gas prices.

“It’s not an ideological exercise,” he said. “It’s a very pragmatic one.”

Leah Stokes, a UC Santa Barbara political scientist, called his record “pretty complex.”

“In many ways, he is one of the leaders,” she said. “But some of the decisions that he’s made, especially recently, don’t move us in as good a direction on climate.”

Newsom is expected to return to the climate summit Wednesday before traveling deeper into the Amazon, where he plans to visit reforestation projects. The governor said he wanted to see firsthand the region often referred to as “the lungs of the world.”

“It’s not just to admire the absorption of carbon from the rainforest,” Newsom said. “But to absorb a deeper spiritual connection to this issue that connects all of us. ... I think that really matters in a world that can use a little more of that.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0a057d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4000x2100+0+284/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcc%2Fbe%2F2d6ba3ce41f0b78a8533ad865521%2Fla-me-newsom-climate-cop30-02.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:03:33.944843

Dramatic as it may be, experts say the drop is only temporary, as more people are interested in new EVs, even without the tax credit.

According to J.D. Power, the number of people who are considering a new EV is the highest since January.

EVs are far from done, despite the dramatic decrease in sales last month, the first full month after the $7,500 federal tax credit was repealed. Compared to September, EV sales plummeted by 53%, slashing the market share in half.

But that’s just part of the story, as data analytics, software, and consumer intelligence company J.D. Power recently discovered. For starters, last month’s steep sales dip can be partly attributed to consumers rushing to get the tax credit in September, which ballooned the numbers. So, naturally, fewer people bought new EVs in the following month.

Then–and this is important–consumer interest is growing, not faltering, even without the $7,500 incentive on the table. Per J.D. Power, more than half of new vehicle shoppers (59.7%) say they are “very likely” (24.2%) or “somewhat likely” (35.5%) to consider buying or leasing an EV in the next 12 months. The number of people who are actively looking for a new car and are “very likely” to consider an EV is up 2.6 percentage points from September and is now at its highest level since January.

Current EV owners also need to be thrown into the mix, because most of them–a whopping 94%–say they will buy another EV when the time comes for a new car. Among them, 79% say they “definitely will” buy or lease a new EV, while 15% say they “probably will.”

The explanation for this continued interest is customer satisfaction. Among current EV owners, the number one reason for buying an electric car was the expected lower running costs (57%), followed by the tax credits and incentives (51%), driving performance (48%), purchase price or lease offer (47%), and design (35%).

As J.D. Power notes, the end of the federal tax credit will certainly affect the value equation, but EVs have consistently met or exceeded owners’ expectations on running costs.

This might not mean much today, but it will mean a lot next year, when no fewer than 243,000 franchise EV leases will come to an end. Seeing how 94% of current owners say they won’t go back to gas, many of them will likely buy or lease a new EV, putting them back on the market. For reference, 62% of people who returned an EV at the end of the lease in 2025 chose to buy or lease another one, according to the data intelligence company.

It all comes down to cost. While many EVs are more expensive to buy than their combustion-powered counterparts, they are more affordable to own. Per J.D. Power, 60% of current EV owners say their vehicles are much less expensive to own and operate than gasoline-powered cars, and another 26% say they are slightly less expensive to own. At the same time, just 7% of EV owners say their cars are more expensive to own than gas cars.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/ZngjGz/s1/hummer-ev-tesla-model-y-tesla-cybertruck-ford-mustang-mach-e-and-rivian-r1t-at-a-tesla-supercharger-station.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:10.212644

“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.
“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing.
“President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam.
“But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,” he said.","Calling America’s absence from key United Nations climate negotiations “doubling down on stupid,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.

Newsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.

As he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.

Newsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: “You don’t matter, we don’t care.”

“This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,"" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. ""And every other country in the world understands that. That’s why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.”

Green energy transition and China's dominance

Even Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.

California, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to roll back the state’s power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.

“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.

“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We’re ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,” Newsom said. “And they’re going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.”

Trump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America — the No. 1 oil producer in the world — energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.

“Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. “President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s common sense energy agenda.”

Climate impacts in California and around the world

Climate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.

“If you don’t believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don’t, you have to believe in your own eyes,” Newsom said. “Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You’re not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there’s another fire and it’s another closure and the air quality’s been degraded.”

California has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years — slightly more than the U.S. as a whole — and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.

Some of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.

“I’m just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that’s on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,"" Newsom said. “How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.”

“Anyone paying attention here?” added Newsom.

California's ambitious climate goals and challenges

At home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state, and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.

California is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.

Veteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.

“But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,” he said.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/213f5f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+73/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fewscripps.brightspotcdn.com%2F6e%2F07%2Fc17a0f6742bc888f3bc81f8b5fab%2Fap25315602515560.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 14:04:38.781343

The plant in Liberty, North Carolina, about 60 miles west of Raleigh, is the company's first and only battery plant outside of Japan.
The facility will house 14 battery production lines supporting gas-powered hybrid (HEV), full battery-electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid models (PHEV).
The initial lines are set to power the company's Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row vehicle.
Phil Berger, the longtime leader of the North Carolina state Senate, added: “This is a monumental day for North Carolina and Toyota.","Washington — Toyota Motor Corp.'s $13.9 billion battery plant in North Carolina began production Tuesday.

The opening comes less than four years after a 2022 groundbreaking at the site and marks a significant milestone for the Japanese auto giant. The plant in Liberty, North Carolina, about 60 miles west of Raleigh, is the company's first and only battery plant outside of Japan.

""Toyota is a pioneer in electrified vehicles, and the company’s significant manufacturing investment in the U.S. and North Carolina further solidifies our commitment to team members, customers, dealers, communities, and suppliers,” said Ted Ogawa, president and CEO of the automaker's North American branch, in a statement.

The plant opening also underscores the company's commitment to a future business model that relies more heavily on battery electric vehicles, even as the Trump administration cuts federal support for such a transition. Toyota, which has a massive gas-electric hybrid portfolio, has purposefully lagged behind other U.S. competitors on BEVs but still has long-term sights set on electrification.

The 1,850-acre site, according to Toyota, will be able to produce 30 gigawatt-hours annually at full capacity and support 5,100 new jobs. The facility will house 14 battery production lines supporting gas-powered hybrid (HEV), full battery-electric (BEV) and plug-in hybrid models (PHEV). Additional lines will launch by 2030.

The initial lines are set to power the company's Camry HEV, Corolla Cross HEV, RAV4 HEV and a yet-to-be-announced all-electric three-row vehicle.

Toyota also announced $10 billion worth of investment into the United States as part of the launch, which would bring the company's total U.S. investment to $60 billion since beginning operations in the country nearly 70 years ago, per a press release.

The company highlighted support from prominent national and local Republican politicians as the Liberty plant begins production.

“Toyota’s move to expand production in North Carolina is the latest show of confidence in this administration’s efforts to reshore manufacturing, generate new, great paying jobs, and inject billions of dollars into the economy. We’re just getting started!” said U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

Phil Berger, the longtime leader of the North Carolina state Senate, added: “This is a monumental day for North Carolina and Toyota. Even before the first battery rolled off the production line, Toyota has made a real impact in our state. I look forward to seeing North Carolina’s partnership with Toyota continue to grow for generations to come.”

This week Toyota is officially opening a lithium ion battery production facility in Liberty, North Carolina.
The plant will ultimately have a production capacity of 30-GWh of cells which would support production of over 300,000 battery electric vehicles.
The materials required for one BEV battery could produce 90 hybrid batteries and six PHEV batteries.
The Liberty battery plant began shipping hybrid modules to the Georgetown, KY assembly plant in June of this year and is now supplying the Camry, Grand Highlander, Corolla Cross and new Rav4.","Toyota has been building vehicles in the US for nearly 40 years and started producing engines just a few years later. Over the years, most of Toyota’s supply base has also set up manufacturing facilities in North America as well. But despite selling more hybrid vehicles than any other company in the world, Toyota has never produced batteries here until this year. This week Toyota is officially opening a lithium ion battery production facility in Liberty, North Carolina.

The $13.9-billion plant was announced in 2021 with an initial investment of $1.29-billion but the scope of the facility quickly grew. The plant will ultimately have a production capacity of 30-GWh of cells which would support production of over 300,000 battery electric vehicles. However, initial production at the plant is focused on batteries for hybrid electric vehicles.

In recent years, Toyota has been shifting toward making hybrid powertrains standard on an increasing number of models as part of its multi-pathway approach to electrification. The company has argued that selling large volumes of hybrids will have more positive environmental impact than a small number BEVs. This includes both the direct vehicle emissions and the environmental impact of producing batteries.

The automaker has called out its 1-6-90 rule. The materials required for one BEV battery could produce 90 hybrid batteries and six PHEV batteries. With each hybrid giving about a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, 3.5 hybrids would have a similar impact to one zero-emission vehicle. Through the first nine months of 2025, Toyota sold 17,760 zero-emission vehicles and nearly 875,000 hybrids and PHEVs.

In addition to the Prius, Sienna, Sequoia, Camry, Crown and the new 2026 Rav4 all have standard hybrid powertrains while all of the other Toyota and Lexus brand vehicles except for the bZ and RZ BEVs have hybrids at least as an option. Many of these models now also offer plug-in hybrid options which feature a larger battery pack.

The Liberty battery plant began shipping hybrid modules to the Georgetown, KY assembly plant in June of this year and is now supplying the Camry, Grand Highlander, Corolla Cross and new Rav4. Three of 14 planned production lines are already running with a fourth currently being installed. The hybrid batteries are typically about 1.5-kWh capacity with plug-in hybrids generally running from about 18-kWh to 22.7-kWh for the new Rav4. The cells being produced in North Carolina are all rectangular, prismatic can format.

The current Toyota bZ and Lexus RZ BEVs are built in Japan and have 74-kWh batteries. However, the Liberty plant will produce the batteries for an upcoming electric three-row SUV that may debut by the end of 2026 or sometime in 2027. That larger vehicle is likely to use a battery closer to 100 to 110-kWh, similar to what is found in competitors like the Kia EV9 and Hyundai Ioniq 9.

For a plant with a 30-GWh capacity, the $13.9-billion price tag is about three times the investment in other US plants with similar capacity. However, most of those other plants only produce the cells with cathode and anode material processing and module and pack assembly taking place elsewhere. Toyota will be doing all of this work in the Liberty facility. Given the slower rate of EV adoption since the plant was announced, it probably won’t reach its full capacity for several more years. Two million hybrid vehicles annually would only need about 3-GWH and another 200,000 PHEVs would take up another 4-GWh leaving enough capacity for well over 200,000 BEVs.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6913c3d0cd69709bc16d0f10/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-12 11:05:33.847805

The sterile insect technique (SIT) is an environmentally friendly pest control method used to control harmful fruit fly populations in Brazil, Chile and Mexico. Sometimes described as birth control for insects, SIT works by releasing male insects that have been sterilized using radiation, which mate with wild female insects, resulting in no offspring. The SIT reduces reliance on insecticides, protects crops and enables countries to gain access to international markets for food exports. It is showcased at COP30 as part of climate-smart agriculture efforts using nuclear science and techniques.

What Happened

According to an SEC filing released on Friday, WT Asset Management initiated a new position in NIO (NIO 3.39%), acquiring 18.7 million shares valued at $142.1 million as of September 30. This entry marks NIO as one of the fund’s largest equity positions at quarter-end, based on the reported holdings.

What Else to Know

This new position accounts for 6.6% of WT Asset Management’s reportable U.S. equity assets under management as of September 30.

Top five holdings after the filing:

NASDAQ:NVDA: $334.6 million (15.5% of AUM)

NYSE:RBLX: $158.2 million (7.3% of AUM)

NASDAQ:APP: $148.6 million (6.9% of AUM)

NYSE:NIO: $142.1 million (6.6% of AUM)

NASDAQ:HOOD: $128.8 million (6% of AUM)

As of Tuesday's market close, NIO shares were priced at $6.63, up 31% over the past year and well outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 14% in the same period.

Company Overview

Company Snapshot

NIO Inc. is a leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer focused on the design, development, and sale of smart electric SUVs and sedans. The company leverages a comprehensive ecosystem of charging and battery solutions to differentiate its customer experience and drive recurring service revenue. NIO's integrated approach positions it as a key player in China's premium EV market, supported by a robust service network and technology-driven product strategy.

Foolish Take

WT Asset Management’s new $142 million position in NIO signals a high-conviction bet on China’s EV rebound after a punishing multiyear downturn. The Hong Kong-based fund purchased 18.7 million shares in the third quarter, making NIO its fourth-largest holding at 6.6% of 13F assets, according to its latest SEC filing.

The move follows a strong second quarter for NIO, which reported record deliveries of 72,056 vehicles, up 26% year over year, and total revenue of $2.65 billion—a 9% year-over-year increase. The company also narrowed its net loss by 26% quarter to quarter. Despite these gains, shares remain down nearly 90% from early 2021 highs, underscoring both the opportunity and risk facing long-term investors.

For context, WT’s other top holdings—Nvidia, Roblox, and AppLovin—all tie to digital platforms and growth technologies with exposure to Greater China, suggesting NIO fits a broader thematic push toward innovation-driven assets. With EV adoption rising and NIO cutting operational losses, the firm’s timing could pay off if China’s demand stabilizes. Still, profitability remains elusive, and execution risks will determine whether this rebound proves durable.

In addition, the company throughout November will provide another $500,000 to at least 60 feeding programs statewide amid funding uncertainties as colder weather and the holiday season approaches

Since 2021, Duke Energy and the Foundation have dedicated more than $2.6 million to support the efforts of these agencies

Duke Energy and Duke Energy Foundation are contributing $100,000 to the One SC Fund recently activated by Gov. Henry McMaster to support food banks across the state.

Why it matters: As colder weather and the holidays approach, many South Carolina families turn to assistance programs that help support those facing hunger. But those programs are facing challenges of their own to support this tremendous need. That is why it is important to support the organizations that do this great work.

What they are saying

Gov. Henry McMaster: ""Duke Energy's contribution to the One SC Fund highlights the very best of South Carolina. At a time when many families are facing uncertainty, Team South Carolina is coming together to support our food banks and put food on the table. I'm grateful for their generosity and hope it will encourage others to join our effort to help families in need.""

Tim Pearson, Duke Energy's South Carolina president: ""These organizations are fighting the good fight every day in communities across our state, but they cannot do it alone. Duke Energy is happy to stand with the governor, and we encourage other corporate entities, organizations and citizens across the state to help support the fight against hunger.""

Bottom line: Duke Energy's support of these organizations and the issue of hunger in the Palmetto State is nothing new. Starting next week, Duke Energy, with support from Duke Energy Foundation, will kick off the company's monthlong annual campaign to support organizations in South Carolina that address food insecurities and inequities. The fifth year of the initiative will provide over $500,000 to more than 60 feeding programs leading up to the Thanksgiving holiday and culminate in final surprise grant announcements on Giving Tuesday.

Zoom in: This campaign is in addition to the support of the One SC Fund and will highlight critical community partners that do this incredible work to fight hunger, including Harvest Hope Food Bank, Mill Village Farms, Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina, FoodShare South Carolina and AIM, among many others. Duke Energy employees will also provide their time and talents volunteering with organizations throughout the month.

Go deeper: Customers struggling to put food on the table are also likely making decisions about what bills to pay at home, including their electricity bill. That is why it is important to also offer information that can assist families to manage their energy bills when times are tough.

Summary

Energy Transfer LP lowered its 2025 growth capital guidance by 8%, reflecting justified execution risks and sector headwinds, but maintains a robust long-term outlook.

ET's diversified growth projects, including natural gas transportation and long-term contracts, reduce concentration risk and position ET for AI-driven electricity demand appetite.

Despite near-term DCF headwinds and deferred earnings accretion until 2027, ET's valuation has normalized, and its forward yield now exceeds 8.3%.

A salivating prospect awaits ET buyers willing to tide through the near-term uncertainties while allowing the buying accumulation to pan out.

Thus, I deemed that an upgrade is finally due, as I urge investors to capitalize on the weakness while the market looks elsewhere.

Maxvolt aims to enhance domestic production capabilities to meet the surging demand for EV batteries, energy storage systems (ESS), and renewable energy applications.
Strategic Expansion to Boost India’s Battery Manufacturing Ecosystem The upcoming Ghaziabad facility will increase Maxvolt’s annual lithium-ion battery capacity from approximately 72,000 units to 2.25 lakh units, significantly boosting output.
Commitment to Sustainability and Circular Economy Maxvolt Energy has been at the forefront of promoting eco-friendly manufacturing practices.
“India’s EV and energy storage sectors are entering a transformative decade,” a Maxvolt spokesperson said.","Maxvolt Energy Industries, a leading Indian lithium-ion battery manufacturer, has announced plans to triple its production capacity to 2.25 lakh units annually, marking a major milestone in its growth journey. The company has acquired 55,000 square feet of land in the Duhai Industrial Area, Ghaziabad, to establish a state-of-the-art battery manufacturing and recycling facility, which is expected to commence operations by December 2025.

The expansion aligns with India’s accelerating shift toward electric mobility and sustainable energy storage solutions. Maxvolt aims to enhance domestic production capabilities to meet the surging demand for EV batteries, energy storage systems (ESS), and renewable energy applications.

Strategic Expansion to Boost India’s Battery Manufacturing Ecosystem

The upcoming Ghaziabad facility will increase Maxvolt’s annual lithium-ion battery capacity from approximately 72,000 units to 2.25 lakh units, significantly boosting output. In addition to manufacturing, the plant will also focus on battery recycling, supporting India’s circular economy goals and minimizing environmental waste from used cells.

According to the company, the integrated facility will include advanced automated production lines, testing labs, and R&D units aimed at improving battery efficiency, safety, and longevity. This expansion will enable Maxvolt to serve a wider range of industries—including electric vehicles, solar power backup, telecom infrastructure, and industrial energy storage.

Commitment to Sustainability and Circular Economy

Maxvolt Energy has been at the forefront of promoting eco-friendly manufacturing practices. The company’s investment in recycling infrastructure reflects its commitment to a closed-loop energy ecosystem, reducing import dependency and ensuring the responsible handling of used lithium cells.

“India’s EV and energy storage sectors are entering a transformative decade,” a Maxvolt spokesperson said. “Our expansion in Ghaziabad will increase manufacturing efficiency and reinforce our role as a trusted partner for clean energy and mobility solutions.”

Industry and Policy Context

The move comes at a time when India’s battery demand is projected to reach 260 GWh by 2030, driven by electric vehicle adoption and grid-scale energy storage. The government’s policies, including the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme and Battery Waste Management Rules, have encouraged domestic manufacturers like Maxvolt to scale production and invest in sustainable innovation.

Industry analysts believe this expansion will strengthen India’s position in the global lithium-ion value chain while creating employment opportunities and localizing advanced energy technologies.

Looking Ahead

Once operational, we expect the Ghaziabad plant to significantly enhance Maxvolt’s market share in the EV battery pack and ESS segment. The company plans to further explore partnerships with electric mobility startups, OEMs, and energy service providers to meet the growing demand for high-performance lithium-ion solutions.

With a focus on scalability, sustainability, and innovation, Maxvolt Energy’s expansion represents a critical step in supporting India’s mission toward net-zero emissions and energy independence.

Things may change in the UK soon, as the country’s finance minister has proposed a tax on EV drivers to help fill a massive budget gap. In the European Union, subsidies are driving stronger sales, but the bloc’s leadership is on track to reconsider its ban on new internal combustion engine car sales from 2035 after serious pushback from the car industry.

The United States EV and hybrid sales figures, meanwhile, showed what happens when the subsidies go away: Rho Motion reported a 41% drop for October after record-breaking sales in August and September as EV enthusiasts rushed to buy their car while it was cheaper. Data from Germany showed the same trends when the country’s previous government tried to phase out EV subsidies as it began finding it increasingly hard to foot the bill.

“In Europe, the overall year-to-date growth figure remains relatively high and we're expecting strong sales towards the end of the year,” Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said, as quoted by Reuters. “Chinese automotive market is expected to show strong growth in November and December, helped by pull forward effect as the country is moving from a full purchase tax exemption to just a 50% exemption on NEVs.”

After landing Google’s $15 billion project, Andhra Pradesh is doubling down on its next growth frontier — clean energy, AI, quantum computing, and electronics manufacturing. Minister Nara Lokesh says the state’s “sector-agnostic” approach is attracting both global and domestic players.

In an exclusive conversation with CNBC-TV18, Lokesh revealed that the state’s major upcoming investments will focus on clean energy, steel, electronics manufacturing, and AI-driven technologies.

“Clean energy is a very important sector for us,” he said. “Even traditional industries like steel depend on it. We’re also focusing on IT, AI, data centres, and quantum computing — these are our primary thrust areas.”

Lokesh said Andhra is also investing in agriculture and food processing. “As important as a Google investment is, a mushroom processing unit is equally important to me because Andhra is predominantly an agrarian economy,” he said.

He added that the state’s new initiatives in rare earth minerals and beach sand mining will help create a vertical and horizontal industrial ecosystem that connects education, skills, and production.

Last May, as blistering-hot weather broke records across South Florida and smoke from distant wildfires in Mexico turned the sky hazy, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, signed legislation erasing most mentions of “climate change” from state law. “We’re restoring sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots,” he wrote on X.

Back then, it felt like just another Florida story, a fresh example of the culture war overriding reality. In hindsight, it was a preview of where the country was headed.

President Donald Trump’s second term has plunged the United States into “don’t say climate” politics. Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.

Even if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional. Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding and hurricanes. Miami Beach and towns in the Florida Keys have been raising their roads as the sea begins to rise. DeSantis has committed more than $1 billion to Resilient Florida, a grant program that helps local governments address some of these problems.

You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country. PG&E is burying its power lines underground to avoid sparking fires in California’s drying forests, in the name of “wildfire safety.” After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, the county began buying homes that have been repeatedly inundated and relocating residents, turning their former homes into open space to absorb floodwaters.

“There’s been a radical increase in how many people are realizing that whether it’s flooding, drought, fire, air quality impacts from fire — take your example — the disasters have been getting out ahead of us,” said Katharine Mach, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.

Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control. But as time has worn on and emissions have continued to rise, it’s become much more about living with the effects of an overheating planet. A recent United Nations report found the world will soon overshoot its goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with current policies likely to lead to 2.8 degrees C (5 degrees F) of warming by the end of the century. That’s a slight improvement from previous estimates, but still translates to an unrecognizable planet.

“We have unleashed a world where many climate impacts are now locked in,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Because we did not act quickly enough, it’s not just about mitigation anymore. We have to adapt.”

Bill Gates, who’s long funded efforts to switch to clean energy, recently wrote an essay arguing that climate advocates have spent too much time and effort on reducing emissions, and not enough on programs that help people stay resilient in the face of increasingly dangerous weather.

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote.

The question of how to fund efforts for low-income countries to adjust to this new, unpredictable environment has become a central concern for this year’s global climate talks in Belém, Brazil, which started Monday. “It’s a responsibility that richer nations, major emitting nations, have been shirking for the longest time,” Cleetus said. Another recent U.N. report found that developing countries will need at least $310 billion a year over the next 10 years to prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2023, richer countries only provided $26 billion.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has eviscerated foreign aid, stripping away development funding for poorer countries while undermining its own ability to respond to disasters at home. Cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hindered forecasters’ ability to predict what’s coming, at the same time as the diminished Federal Emergency Management Agency has forced local governments to fend for themselves. The U.S. isn’t sending any high-level delegates to the talks in Belém, marking the first time the country will go unrepresented at the annual U.N. climate conference.

“I’ve never seen an administration be so deliberately undermining a country’s capability to be prepared and to deal with challenges like this,” said Susanne Moser, a social scientist who’s considered one of the leading experts on climate adaptation.

Billionaires like Gates are stepping into the gap. MacKenzie Scott, another influential philanthropist, recently donated $60 million to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy to help with disaster preparedness and recovery.

Experts said the new focus on adapting to a changing climate was necessary, but they said that Gates — like many before him — needlessly pitted the need to adapt against the need to cut emissions when both things can happen at the same time.

“Adaptation can actually not succeed, ultimately, if climate change goes unchecked,” Moser said. Today, the world has seen about 1.3 degrees C (2.3 F) of additional warming since before industrial times, but as Gates notes, it could reach 3 degrees C (5.4 F) by the end of the century.

“A 3-degree world is not a world in which adaptation can provide well-being and health,” Moser said. “It’s just simply, people are living in ruins and are trying to basically survive.”

There’s an entrenched idea among environmentalists that discussions over how to adapt to climate change distract from the core mission of cutting planet-warming emissions, what’s known as mitigation. It’s sometimes perceived as a form of giving up. But studies have repeatedly shown that talking about adaptation doesn’t necessarily reduce public support for mitigation efforts. If anything, the challenges of adapting — the high price tag of raising roads in low-lying coastal areas, or the difficulties of relocating communities out of danger zones — highlight the need for reducing emissions. “Once you begin adaptation and you see how difficult it is, mitigation looks like a cakewalk,” Moser said.

If Florida is any indication, the two might go hand in hand. Yoca Arditi-Rocha, CEO of The CLEO Institute, a climate education nonprofit in Florida, says that the state has made a lot of progress that doesn’t often get discussed. In fact, it’s one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the country, and also right near the top for installations of utility-scale solar and rooftop solar.

Arditi-Rocha hopes Florida can show the rest of the country that climate action can still move forward, even if the term itself remains politically off-limits. Getting specific helps, she said: Talking about how towns need more trees for shade, or how they need to be prepared for hurricanes and heat waves, is simply practical. Then again, so is reducing carbon emissions.

“We have to shut down the overflowing bathtub,” Arditi-Rocha said. “We cannot be mopping the floor forever.”

Total oil and gas sales for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.7 million, compared to $5.0 million in the same quarter of 2024.
Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.3) million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024.","HOUSTON, Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Energy Corporation (NASDAQ: USEG, “U.S. Energy” or the “Company”), a growth-focused energy company engaged in the development and operation of high-quality producing energy and industrial gas assets, today reported financial and operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTS

“U.S. Energy delivered another quarter of meaningful operational progress in Q3 2025 as we advanced our Montana industrial gas project,” said Ryan Smith, CEO. “With disciplined execution across upstream development, infrastructure build-out, and carbon management, the Kevin Dome’s scale and strategic location continue to position us as a first mover in a rapidly expanding segment of the energy market. Design of our initial processing facility is now complete, with construction commencing in the coming months—unlocking new revenue streams from both industrial gas production and carbon initiatives. The capture of recycled CO₂ will support carbon management and enhanced oil recovery across legacy assets, creating an integrated platform that maximizes value realization. Our consistent performance, capital discipline, and long-term strategy continue to drive scalable growth and build sustainable shareholder value.”

ADVANCING FULL-CYCLE INDUSTRIAL GAS DEVELOPMENT

The Company continues to achieve significant milestones while advancing the full-cycle development of its industrial gas assets across the Kevin Dome in Montana.

Upstream Development

Drilled two additional industrial gas wells in the quarter, bringing the total to three high-deliverability wells in the CO₂ and helium-rich Duperow Formation, each positioned to deliver strong economic returns.

The three wells achieved a combined peak rate of 12.2 MMcf/d, with high-value composition of ~0.5% helium and 85% CO₂. After testing, flows were restricted to ~8.0 MMcf/d and then shut in to preserve reservoir value until infrastructure is online, setting up an efficient production ramp-up.

Planning one additional industrial gas well for Spring 2026 in the same formation.

Advancing EOR opportunities using recycled CO₂ on nearby Company-owned oil assets.

Undertaking helium offtake negotiations with third-party end users to support commercialization.

Infrastructure Development

Finalized the design for the initial gas processing facility, targeting high purity recovery of helium and recycled CO2, with capital deployment expected to begin in early 2026.

Acquired 80 acres in Toole County, MT for $240,000 to serve as the facility site.

Finalized design of the infill gathering system; construction scheduled for early 2026 to connect wells directly to processing and sequestration.

Permitting, land access, and utility connections progressing in parallel to support a timely startup.

Once operational, the facilities are expected to generate diversified cash flow from helium sales, incremental oil from EOR, and carbon management.

Carbon Management Initiatives

EPA Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) plan was submitted in October 2025, with approval expected by Spring-Summer 2026, creating the ability to capture federal carbon credits.

Preparing second MRV plan for EOR operations, with submission targeted for December 2025.

Sustained injection of 17.0 MMcf/d across two Company-owned wells, equivalent to ~240,000 metric tons of CO₂ sequestered annually.

Progressing near-term EOR projects using recycled CO₂ on legacy oil assets.

Second Class II injection well approved by Montana regulators in August 2025.

CURRENT INDUSTRIAL GAS RESOURCE REPORT

The Company recently had an industrial gas resource report prepared by Ryder Scott for the volumes in place on its initial target development area across its Kevin Dome asset. The report concluded 1.28 billion cubic feet (""BCF"") of net helium resources and 443.8 BCF of net CO2 resources, contingent upon economics and future development. The gas concentrations used for the report were 0.4% - 0.5% helium and 84% - 85% CO2, reflecting the composition of the Company’s recent development activities.

The Company’s proved developed producing (“PDP”) oil and gas reserve base as of October 1, 2025 consisted of approximately 1.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (“BOE”) comprised of approximately 75% oil. The present value discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) of the Company’s reserves was approximately $20.5 million at SEC pricing, with assumed pricing of $67.45/bbl, $3.10/mcf, and $33.01/boe for oil, gas, and natural gas liquids, respectively.

Total hydrocarbon production for the third quarter of 2025 was approximately 35,326 BOE consisting of 75% oil production. Total oil and gas sales for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.7 million, compared to $5.0 million in the same quarter of 2024. This decrease in production and revenue primarily reflects the effects of the Company’s divestiture program throughout 2024. Oil sales accounted for 91% of total revenue this quarter, an increase from 88% during the third quarter of 2024.

Lease operating expenses (LOE) for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.0 million, or $29.36 per Boe, compared to $3.1 million, or $28.95 per Boe, in the prior year. The overall reduction in LOE is primarily attributable to fewer producing assets as a result of our asset divestitures.

Cash general and administrative (G&A) expenses for the third quarter of 2025 were approximately $1.7 million, a decrease of 15 percent when compared to $2.0 million reported in the third quarter of 2024. The decrease was due to a reduction in acquisition costs.

Adjusted EBITDA was ($1.3) million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million in the third quarter of 2024. The Company reported a net loss of $3.3 million, or a loss of $0.10 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2025.

ADJUSTED EBITDA RECONCILIATION

In addition to our results calculated under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), in this earnings release we also present Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a “non-GAAP financial measure” presented as supplemental measures of the Company’s performance. It is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), plus net interest expense, net unrealized loss (gain) on change in fair value of derivatives, income tax (benefit) expense, deferred income taxes, depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization, one-time costs associated with completed transactions and the associated assumed derivative contracts, non-cash share-based compensation, transaction related expenses, transaction related acquired realized derivative loss (gain), and loss (gain) on marketable securities. Company management believes this presentation is relevant and useful because it helps investors understand U.S. Energy’s operating performance and makes it easier to compare its results with those of other companies that have different financing, capital and tax structures. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

The Company’s presentation of this measure should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most comparable GAAP measure, below. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in their entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Specializing in PG&E and SMUD solar programs, the company is helping residential customers take full advantage of the current incentives by offering highly tailored system designs that meet both financial and technical goals under the new Net Energy Metering 3.0 (NEM 3.0) structure.

The Investment Tax Credit has long made residential solar more affordable, but to claim the full 30% credit, systems must be installed and fully operational by December 31, 2025. This deadline is more than a formality; it requires every step, from design and permitting to installation and utility approval, to be completed on time. Given the complexity of working with utility providers and local jurisdictions, North Valley Solar Power, a leader among solar companies Grass Valley, advises customers to commit by November 2025 at the latest to avoid delays that could cost them thousands in lost incentives. Year-end installation schedules compress quickly; early commitments receive priority placement.

Against this backdrop of urgency, the company stands out among solar power companies for its deep expertise in designing systems that are both ITC-compliant and optimized for California’s evolving solar landscape. Under NEM 3.0, simply installing panels isn’t enough. The new rules reduce compensation for excess energy sent back to the grid, making accurate sizing and storage integration essential for maximizing long-term savings.

North Valley Solar Power takes a precision-focused approach, ensuring each system is properly designed to meet the homeowner’s unique energy needs while aligning with NEM 3.0 requirements. The company avoids the common mistakes seen in the industry, such as under-sizing or improper battery pairing, that can diminish system performance and reduce return on investment. By integrating batteries strategically, they help customers use more of the energy they generate, avoiding high utility rates and increasing energy independence. Engineering for right-sizing under NEM 3.0 delivers measurable NEM 3.0 solar savings by prioritizing self-use and intelligent battery dispatch.

Navigating utility interconnection is often the most time-consuming phase of a solar project. North Valley Solar Power’s direct coordination with PG&E and SMUD helps expedite the process, ensuring all paperwork, inspections, and approvals are handled efficiently and accurately. This local utility knowledge gives the solar providers a clear advantage in meeting the tight timelines required for ITC qualification. This utility-first workflow helps fast-track PG&E solar installation in Grass Valley and keeps SMUD interconnections on schedule.

With more than 2,500 residential projects delivered statewide, North Valley Solar Power fields a CSLB-licensed (California Contractors State License Board) team and keeps design, permitting, installation, and maintenance entirely in-house for quality control and clear accountability. As a locally staffed organization, NVSP supports sustainability events and clean-energy education with schools throughout Nevada County.

With time running out and the 30% tax credit nearing expiration, homeowners are encouraged to start the process now to avoid missing out. North Valley Solar Power continues to support Grass Valley and surrounding communities with trusted expertise and a deep understanding of what it takes to go solar successfully in California.

But what should be a moment of celebration is instead being overshadowed by rising uncertainty: the climate-finance gap still amounts to trillions of dollars, while support among the developed countries for climate action is fracturing.

The transition to a low-carbon global economy cannot succeed without the active participation of the private sector, yet businesses and investors are reluctant to commit funds amid uncertainty and instability. Above all, markets need predictability: coherent policy frameworks, clearly defined priority sectors, and practical strategies for managing the financial, environmental, and social risks.

The predictability and stability that investors and markets require, however, remain out of reach. The International Energy Agency has warned that policy uncertainty has stalled the development and usage of many promising clean-energy technologies that are ripe for scaling up. Excluding AI, venture-capital funding for energy innovation declined across sectors in 2023 and 2024. Meanwhile, most countries still lack the policy and investment mechanisms needed to mobilize private capital at scale.

While tighter financial conditions and policy uncertainty play a major role, they are only part of the problem. A deeper, often overlooked reason for the slow pace of progress is that the global climate movement has largely failed to focus on the people most affected by the energy transition: workers, consumers, and local communities.

From its very inception, the Council for Inclusive Capitalism (which I lead) has argued that major economic transitions provide companies and investors with a unique opportunity to build a more inclusive society. Inspired by the late Pope Francis’s call to “hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor,” we established a partnership with energy-intensive companies and investors to develop a framework for a just climate transition.

Created in collaboration with BP, Reliance, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, State Street, and others, this framework places people at the heart of the energy transition. It emphasizes universal access to clean energy, decent jobs that provide pathways for retraining and reskilling, support for local communities, and the need to strengthen supply chains. It also recognizes that investors’ capital-allocation strategies must align with these priorities through meaningful stakeholder engagement and sharing of best practices.

Together with the energy transition, the AI revolution is set to reshape labor markets. To this end, we co-hosted a meeting with World Bank President Ajay Banga at the recent UN Climate Week in New York to discuss how to learn from the mistakes of past transitions and ensure that no one is left behind.

Turning ambition into action requires achievable national strategies. When implemented effectively, nationally determined contributions can serve as more than just climate pledges – they can guide investment and act as roadmaps for economic transformation. Brazil provides a useful model: a joint report by the OECD and the UN Development Programme touts the country’s National Bank for Economic and Social Development as a leader in creating innovative financial instruments capable of attracting private capital at scale.

Other emerging markets are also making strides. Wind and solar power are expanding rapidly across Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, with India on track to become the world’s second-largest renewable-energy market after China. For developing countries, inclusive growth is not a slogan but a socioeconomic imperative, particularly when it comes to ensuring access to energy and critical infrastructure.

Developed economies face a different set of challenges. In the United States, about 40% of energy and technology projects announced under former US President Joe Biden’s industrial and climate policies were already experiencing delays even before President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. At the same time, rising energy costs are jeopardizing the United Kingdom’s net-zero transition, while European manufacturers struggle to cut CO2 emissions and stay profitable in a global market increasingly dominated by Chinese firms.

Even so, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Although Trump withdrew the US from the Paris agreement, energy affordability and AI competitiveness remain top national priorities. Institutional investors and private capital have both the means and the incentive to back emerging technologies – including carbon-free, scalable nuclear energy – that can sustain AI growth without driving up utility costs.

The dozens of world leaders in Brazil for COP30 are meeting at a critical juncture. To build a just and sustainable future, we must bridge the divide between governments, financial institutions, civil society, and the private sector. Only by focusing on workers, communities, and consumers can we translate national targets into tangible progress that protects both people and the planet.",https://webapi.project-syndicate.org/library/985746892da40ba06638ff0c739308f2.2-1-super.1.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:58.003880

Long before it grows its classic black and orange wings, the Monarch butterfly begins its life among the hooded flowers of milkweed. As caterpillars, they can’t eat anything else. Alongside millions of human beings, these butterflies also call North Carolina home, feeding on the 16 species of milkweed that are native to the state, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Federation.

Native species are those that have formed interdependent, complex relationships with the flora and fauna of an area after co-evolving with these species for thousands of years, according to North Carolina State Extension.

But sometimes, they face competition from non-native or invasive plants, which are popular for their landscaping appeal.

As developments continue, it’s more important than ever that the plants we do have nourish the environment, says Amy Mackintosh, co-chair of the Margaret Reid chapter of the North Carolina Native Plant Society.

“We’re having so much impact between agriculture and residential and whatever else use, land use, that we can’t say, ‘Oh, well, [nature] will move to the next place in the country’,” she says. “There is no next place in the country. It’s us.”

The N.C. Native Plant Society and other organizations are encouraging the use of native plants in landscaping by focusing on one side of the business equation: demand. They’re educating the public on how native plants can be incorporated into landscape aesthetics, in the hopes that this will encourage people to buy them.

Here’s one thing that helps: across the state, there’s already a growing interest in native plants, they say.

Demand: Why are people interested in native plants?

In a 2021 survey sponsored by the Coastal Landscapes Initiative, most of the 20 commercial plant growers that were surveyed reported seeing the demand for native plants grow over the past five years, says Jane Harrison, coastal economics specialist for North Carolina Sea Grant, which manages the Coastal Landscapes Initiative. Native plants like Southern wax myrtle, native hollies, and milkweed were especially popular.

The N.C. Native Plant Society has also seen interest in their organization grow beyond membership. While it has around 900 official members, about 2,300 opted in to receive its newsletters, says Margaret Partridge, the other co-chair for the Margaret Reid chapter of the N.C. Native Plant Society.

Concern about native plants has even risen to the state level. In July 2019, the North Carolina General Assembly passed Senate Bill 606, which requires the Department of Transportation to prioritize planting native plants along roadways.

But where is all this interest coming from? Recent research linking native plants to preserving biodiversity formed a lot of the impetus behind this, Mackintosh says.

Thousands of years of co-evolution means that entire ecosystems depend on native plants. For example, many native wildflowers provide nectar for pollinating insects and seeds for animals, says Christopher Moorman, associate head of the Department of Forestry and Environmental Resources at North Carolina State University.

Not only do native plants serve as foundations of the food web, but they also affect soil composition, plant community structures, and disturbance processes, such as fires, he says.

Non-native plants, even if they spread beyond their native range, can never fully replicate the complex interactions that naturally occur, according to N.C. State Extension.

For example, privets, non-native plants from the Ligustrum genus, are integrated into the North Carolina food web because birds eat them, Moorman says.

But if privets outcompete native plants that support invertebrates, such as milkweeds, then the baby birds that need protein from the invertebrates will not survive. So while privets certainly contribute to the food base for native birds, their growth may have other consequences to native bird species as a whole, he says.

When non-native plants outcompete various native plants in a certain area, it can reduce the diversity of plants in an area, as well. This homogenization of food resources is why it’s harder to find native bird species in urban or suburban areas, for example, Moorman says.

“They’re just not able to persist in these landscapes,” he says.

Many non-native plants are popular because they are resilient and grow well in most conditions. But these same characteristics can also crowd out native plants, which arguably makes them invasive.

For Moorman, nonnative plants that establish and reproduce on their own are invasive, primarily because they take up space that native plants could use.

“That also accounts for the fact that in many cases, it takes decades or centuries for a plant species population to become well enough established so that it’s recognizably outcompeting native plants,” he says. “And so if we see it reproducing and surviving on its own now, I think it’s a good indication that in decades in the future, that it would be more widely spread.”

Take Ficaria verna, also known as fig buttercup, for example. The plant was introduced to the United States from Europe, according to N.C. State Extension. In late April and May, the plant grows dormant, forming bulbs under the ground and tiny bulbs on its stems, says Peter Schubert, the citizen representative on the Board of Directors for the North Carolina Invasive Plants Council.

When the stem withers away, its tiny bulbs can spread far, especially through floodwater. Each becomes a new source. And where they settle, they can grow to outcompete native plants, thus harming the ecology of an area, Schubert says.

The N.C. Invasive Plants Council, a volunteer organization that spreads awareness about the dangers of invasive plants, has published a list of invasive plants in the state. It gets input from a variety of experts, including scientists, governmental and conservation organizations, and the landscape and nursery industries.

But there’s no consensus on what makes a plant invasive, Moorman says. Many in the scientific community would not define non-native plants as invasive until they’ve observed their harmful effects on an ecosystem – however long that may take.

“And I’ll also say there’s a component of the ecological community that says, ‘Quit whining, stop worrying about it,’” he says. “‘These plants are here. It’s part of the cycle now with humans, and so we just need to accept it and sort of adapt to it.’ There’s some truth in that.”

Non-native plants have become very integrated into multiple cycles that affect humans. One of the most important ones is the economic cycles, where they form a solid base of the landscaping plant supply.

Supply: Why aren’t there more native plants in the plant nursery supply?

Yousif Nazo, business manager for Nazo Landscaping in Durham, says he has noticed that while there’s a substantial subset of consumers who ask for native plants, most people still prefer to plant non-natives.

Nazo Landscaping is both a full-service nursery and landscaping company, which means it grows the plants it installs for its customers. It sells some native plants, especially ones that are in high demand and don’t grow so wild that they require more work on the company’s part.

However, the lion’s share of their sales comes from non-native plants.

“To be honest, we’re a business at the end of the day, so we try to grow what works really well here but also what’s in high demand,” Nazo says. “You know, I have to maximize all my space, being that we’re right here in Durham, I mean, we’re using almost every foot of space we have.”

Most people asking for native plants are homeowners, who spend around a couple hundred dollars when they shop, he says. But contractors, landscapers, and developers, who primarily buy non-native plants, put in orders worth thousands of dollars.

“It’s a big difference, you know. So the people who are buying the most are the people I have to cater to in order to stay in business,” he says.

Nazo is not the only one. While a mix of small and medium nurseries from the 2021 Coastal Landscapes Initiative survey focused exclusively on native plants, the largest ones did not, Harrison says. This is a trend Mackintosh sees too; while there are smaller nurseries which cater to native plants, they’re still not selling at a scale that would attract landscape contractors, she says.

Various organizations, from nonprofits to the state, are having to balance economic and environmental benefits in landscaping.

“We really have to build a demand so that the horticulture industry can shift to native plants and still be viable economically,” Moorman says. “And we certainly want them to be viable economically.”

Design: Are new aesthetics the solution?

Some of these organizations insist there’s a way to achieve both: emphasizing the aesthetic appeal of native plants.

Both the N.C. Native Plant Society and N.C. Sea Grant works to educate the public on intentional design, particularly when it comes to designing with native plants. There are many ways native plants can be incorporated into a garden or yard to create a neat and organized look, Harrison says. Or, they could be placed in such a way to have a freer, natural look.

“I often think of a garden, a really, you know, kind of attractive, organized garden should be like a living room, you know, just like in someone’s home,” she says. “Do you put a chair in the middle of the room, kind of randomly, or do you put it in a corner, you know, kind of situated so that it can talk to or see the couch across the way?”

There’s even an aesthetic appeal inherent to native plants that attracts North Carolina residents – especially new ones, Harrison says.

“I think people have an interest in what is uniquely North Carolina, you know, what kind of makes this place special,” she says.

It’s not just individual homeowners or gardeners who see the aesthetic appeal of native plants. When the landscape around the Old Well, one of the most famous sites on the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill campus, needed refreshing, native plants proved to be the right ones for the job.

“You know, we’re the University of North Carolina,” says Daniel Widis, UNC University Facilities Landscape Architect. “Pulling in plants from across the state that are representative of the region, representative of this place, right, felt appropriate for that moment, right?”

Almost fifty different types of plants were added around the Old Well during the fall 2024 semester. Previously, the Old Well featured tall hedges, as well as the colorful azaleas that brightened graduation photos during the first two weeks of May, Widis says. Now, the hedges and large trees around the area have been removed. The native plants surrounding the well will bloom at various times throughout the year.

But this landscape will evolve and change over time. Each year, University Facilities will make small tweaks to it. Non-native plants may still be planted in the space in the future, and the design would still be successful, Widis says.

“I don’t think you need to be a strict nativist when it comes to planting, though it obviously comes with a number of ecological and environmental benefits,” Widis says. “In this moment, it just felt like the right thing to do.”

Rather than choosing between yard aesthetics and environmental benefits, organizations across the state seek to increase the demand for native plants by educating the public on how they can achieve both.

And one of the biggest reasons why is that there’s beauty that inherently comes from seeing the diversity of life that flourishes around native plants, Mackintosh says.

Many native plants undergo seasonal shifts throughout the year. From deciduous trees in January to the first hints of trout lily blooming in February, these plants also attract various creatures like butterflies, squirrels, and birds, she says. That’s the beauty of planting native plants.

“I don’t feel like I’m doing it just for the good of the world,” she says. “I mean, I think we get great pleasure out of it, but the greatest pleasure is seeing the life that comes around.”",https://thelocalreporter.press/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/cropped-local-reporter-logo-round-3-option-1-3-e1566310206658-1-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-12 14:04:13.991888

We both subscribe to two fundamental principles that cross party lines: Nevada requires clean, secure power, and Nevada requires strong, secure jobs. What we saw at Steamboat Hills, a plant based on more than 30 years of successful history, is a great model of how geothermal power provides on both.

Our visit highlighted the future of American energy. While solar is an essential piece of Nevada’s clean energy puzzle, the most critical element of this facility is reliability. Geothermal provides always-on baseload power around the clock. This perpetual natural resource is a pillar of grid stability, offering energy independence and a truly resilient system capable of supporting our growing economy.

The economic and community dividends are just as persuasive, demonstrating how clean energy technology can be a cornerstone of regional wealth. In Nevada alone, Ormat owns multiple geothermal power plants with over 483 MW (megawatts) of capacity. They employ nearly 400 highly skilled professionals right here in the state — high-tech, full-time jobs that support Nevada families throughout the region. In addition, these activities have a strong foundation in our society, producing more than $30 million per year in taxes, royalties and other important economic payments, directly contributing to our state budget and local communities.

This accomplishment is the product of good environmental practice, demonstrating the company's ""full commitment"" to the future in a responsible manner. The Steamboat Hills plant employs state-of-the-art air-cooled binary technology, with the geothermal fluid circulated through a closed, sealed loop system. This method of utilizing the earth's heat economically, while taking good care to safeguard our precious groundwater resources and reduce surface disturbance. This dedication to ""constant renewal"" and sound environmental stewardship is evidence that economic vitality, technological advancement and environmental stewardship can, and must, coexist.

The Steamboat Hills Complex is a crystal-clear bipartisan victory. It's a homegrown, financially robust energy answer that anchors our grid and sets us on the way toward a cleaner future. By growing our own natural, renewable resources, Nevada is building a strong, long-term energy economy for generations to come.

Globally, the energy sector produces the most emissions of any sector, accounting for over 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions.

Creative solutions outside of IOUs are needed to facilitate a clean, equitable, and just energy transition in the utility space.
This brief will explore alternative models outside of the IOU structure — electric cooperatives, publicly owned utilities, and community choice aggregators — and outline the benefits and drawbacks of each of these in achieving an equitable, clean energy transition.","The energy sector needs creative solutions for addressing the worsening and unevenly distributed impacts of climate change. There is growing scientific consensus that we have already surpassed 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming, the limit that would have prevented even more dire and irreversible climate consequences like permanent ice sheet melting, loss of entire ecosystems, and intensifying ocean warming. Instead, we are on a trajectory for 2.5 degrees Celsius warming by the end of 2100.

Ever-increasing global temperatures are directly related to more catastrophic events like intensifying droughts, floods, and extreme heat. These climate effects also have disparate impacts on racialized and historically oppressed communities, including communities of color, immigrant groups, the working class, LGBTQ+ communities, and those with limited English proficiency. This is true across educational attainment and age categories.

Longstanding structural forces including white supremacy, settler-colonialism, patriarchy, capitalism, and imperialism have produced deep systemic inequalities and power disparities across economic, social, and political outcomes, and these power differentials perpetuate uneven impacts of climate change. A mix of racist policies and practices stemming from these structural forces, including gerrymandering, mortgage and lending discrimination, and historic disinvestment, has created segregated, under-resourced communities that are especially frontline to environmental and climate catastrophes.

These compounding and intersectional factors have led to a lack of energy-efficient and healthy housing and have led to high energy burden (high amount for energy bills relative to income) for these same communities. Households with higher energy burdens are disproportionately headed by low-wealth people, Black, Latino, and Native American people, older adults, renters, and multigenerational families. In other words, people who have contributed the least to climate change are experiencing its worst effects, including those related to energy pollution and energy burden.

Burning fossil fuels like methane gas, coal, and oil is the leading contributor to the rapid and unprecedented warming over the last 10,000 years. These fuels release carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, which traps heat and warms the planet. Burning these fuels also releases other greenhouse gases and nitrous oxides, which are linked to adverse health outcomes like respiratory illnesses (including asthma), cancer, and heart disease.

These adverse health outcomes are disproportionately high across racialized groups. Due to systemic racism in lending and zoning laws, people of color, especially those who are low wealth, are more likely than other groups to live near oil refineries, gas plants, and other dirty energy infrastructure. Higher and disproportionate exposure to these facilities’ toxic emissions corresponds to higher rates of respiratory problems.

Overall, the electric power sector is second only to the transportation sector in terms of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States, 74 percent of all human-produced greenhouse gas emissions come from burning fossil fuels for electricity. Globally, the energy sector produces the most emissions of any sector, accounting for over 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. While the U.S. has seen a decrease in carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity sector due to investment in renewable energy resources like solar, wind, and geothermal technologies since the 1990s, energy-related carbon emissions increased by 7 percent in 2021, in part due to increased electricity demand as more of the economy electrifies.

Bold action is needed to mitigate the catastrophic and disproportionate climate and health harms from burning fossil fuels for electricity. Decarbonization is one of these bold and essential actions.

Decarbonization — the process of reducing or removing fossil fuels from production by switching to renewable energy resources in energy and economic systems — is necessary to slow or halt the adverse consequences of climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. Some scholars have coined the phrase “deep decarbonization” to describe more specific, impactful interventions, including energy efficiency measures (upgrading residential and commercial heating and cooling systems and insulating homes), removing carbon from the electricity sector (ending the use of coal and natural gas and switching to wind and solar energy on the electric grid), transferring clean energy to building and transportation sectors (solar-powered electric buses), and utilizing natural carbon sinks (replanting forests). Decarbonization must be conducted through the lens of equity and justice to fully and adequately address historic and present harms associated with fossil fuel-based pollution.

The electricity sector needs to deeply decarbonize, and to do so rapidly. However, the predominance of investor-owned electric utilities (IOUs) complicates, disincentivizes, and impedes clean energy investment and development for reasons explained in the Introduction.

Utility decarbonization targets can stem from legislative action like state climate laws, mandates from regulators at public utility commissions, emerging clean energy technology that is lower-cost and lower risk, market demand from customers or other stakeholders, or corporate environmental, social, and governance goals. Collectively, the electricity sector must reduce emissions by 80 percent by 2035 to limit its impact on climate warming, but within the current decarbonization efforts of IOUs, aggregate progress has been lackluster and is only slated to meet 50 percent carbon reduction.

In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) — the single largest piece of climate legislation in U.S. history — was signed into law to facilitate, among other things, widespread decarbonization. The IRA was intended to boost a clean energy transition for individuals, municipalities, nonprofits, and industrial stakeholders like electric utilities through subsidies, loans, and adders (a specific type of financial bonus) for energy communities (or, those communities historically overburdened by fossil fuel based pollution). Many core elements of the IRA — including Environmental and Climate Justice Block Grants, the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Fund, Home Energy Performance-Based Grants, Whole House Rebates and Training Grants, and the High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Program — are investments in low-income and disadvantaged communities to promote “legacy pollution reduction, affordable and accessible clean energy for disadvantaged communities, and a better quality of life and good jobs.”

The most prominent provisions of the IRA for utility-scale decarbonization are the Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit, with additional credits for low-income communities. Unfortunately, these tax credits for utility-scale solar and wind projects, along with other credits, rebates, and subsidies, are now sunsetting earlier because of tax code changes in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (H.R. 1) passed on July 4, 2025. With the effective repeal of the IRA, three impacts relevant to this brief are likely:

“Reduction in cumulative capital investment in U.S. electricity and clean fuels production by $0.5 trillion from 2025-2035.

Increase of greenhouse gas emissions by roughly 190 million metric tons per year in 2030 and 470 million tons in 2035 — or about 2 percent of 2005 emissions in 2030 and 7 percent in 2035.

Decrease in clean electricity generation in 2035 by more than 820 terawatt-hours — more than the entire contribution of nuclear or coal to the electricity supply today.”

Within the IOU space, the scale and pacing of decarbonizing was already lagging; the effective repeal of the IRA means even fewer industry incentives to decarbonize and more carbon pollution. Creative solutions outside of IOUs are needed to facilitate a clean, equitable, and just energy transition in the utility space.

If IOUs aren’t up to the monumental task of deep decarbonization in the name of an urgent climate crisis, what are the viable alternatives for electricity? This brief will explore alternative models outside of the IOU structure — electric cooperatives, publicly owned utilities, and community choice aggregators — and outline the benefits and drawbacks of each of these in achieving an equitable, clean energy transition.

Coinbase, one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges in the United States, has made a strategic decision to relocate its corporate domicile from Delaware to Texas. This move follows the approval of the majority of its stockholders through written consent and does not impact the company's current operations, office locations, or the trading of its shares. The decision is influenced by the favorable business environment in Texas, which is known for lower taxes, a pro-business climate, and a thriving technology ecosystem.

The rationale behind this shift stems from Texas's corporate laws that promote innovation and provide a more predictable legal environment. These laws come with lower litigation risks and enhanced protections for both boards and shareholders. As companies across various sectors reconsider their incorporation locations, Texas has emerged as a prime alternative due to these benefits.

#What Does This Move Mean for the Future of Coinbase?

This transition to Texas reflects broader trends among corporations exploring options beyond Delaware, especially following recent controversies regarding executive compensations that have raised eyebrows within the legal frameworks of some states. By opting for Texas, Coinbase seeks to leverage a more favorable regulatory atmosphere conducive to business growth.

This decision highlights the increasing interest of companies in finding more advantageous legal settings for incorporation. Texas's appeal as a destination for businesses looking to optimize their legal structures is becoming increasingly evident, positioning it as a formidable competitor to traditional hubs like Delaware in the corporate landscape.",https://d39vprqkrd8fxp.cloudfront.net/4eabbc94-a8c4-4f44-a6c6-68d573454ba5/icons/android-icon-192x192.png,N,,2025-11-12 11:04:16.108148

Our goal was to identify ways to change that.” “Participatory science is about science and people,” said David Bonter, co-director of the Center for Science and Engagement at Cornell.
Participating in science from home For many, observing nature from home offers an easy entry into science.
Democratizing discovery Community science invites anyone with curiosity and time to help advance research.
Dayer’s team is expanding who gets to take part in discovery while showing how welcoming science strengthens communities.","When Ashley Dayer, professor in the Department of Fish and Wildlife Conservation, talks about her work, she starts with a simple idea: Everyone deserves a chance to take part in science.

That belief inspired a new study from Dayer’s lab in Virginia Tech's College of Natural Resources and Environment that explores how to make one of North America’s largest bird observation programs – Project FeederWatch – welcoming to everyone who enjoys feeding and watching birds.

Run by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology and Birds Canada, FeederWatch invites participants across the U.S. and Canada to report bird activity in their backyards. The project connects people to nature while contributing to decades of data about bird populations.

Despite its reach, FeederWatch, like many community science programs, tends to engage a narrow audience. Dayer and postdoctoral researcher Kelley Langhans, the study’s lead author, partnered with colleagues from Cornell University, North Carolina State University, and The Ohio State University to understand how the project could better reflect the broader community of people who feed birds.

“Community science has been a great success for research,” Dayer said. “We know more about birds and ecosystems because of public contributions. But not everyone feels these projects are designed for them, which limits their benefits and creates data gaps. Our goal was to identify ways to change that.”

“Participatory science is about science and people,” said David Bonter, co-director of the Center for Science and Engagement at Cornell. “This study provides vital information for helping us understand how to engage more people in observation, learning, and sharing information about the natural world.”

The study, published Nov. 11 in Citizen Science: Theory and Practice, recommends that FeederWatch collaborate with community organizations, develop educational resources to support participant learning, and clearly show participants how their data support conservation.

Participating in science from home

For many, observing nature from home offers an easy entry into science. Feeding birds and recording observations can provide meaningful connection to nature and contribute to data used by conservation scientists worldwide.

Langhans and Virginia Tech graduate students, including co-author Chris Blume, hosted online focus groups with people who already feed birds but don’t participate in FeederWatch. With help from organizations that promote welcoming outdoor spaces, the team explored opportunities and challenges to making the project more inclusive.

Participants appreciated FeederWatch’s flexibility and the ability to take part from home. The program’s structure — allowing people to collect data on their own time — helps those with busy schedules or limited mobility connect with nature and contribute to science.

Many also spoke about the joy that participation brings. Counting birds offers a chance to notice nature, engage curiosity, and make a meaningful contribution to environmental research.

Supporting participation

Some participants saw the annual fee as a barrier, while others mentioned the need for adaptive technology or materials in additional languages. In response, the research team focused on how the project itself could adapt.

“When we think about growing participation, it’s about designing the project to be welcoming to everyone,” Langhans said. “Adjustments such as waiving fees, creating user-friendly digital tools, and increasing representation in staff and materials can open the door to a wider range of participants.”

By focusing on project design, Dayer said, community science programs can reach more people and produce stronger, more representative data.

“When more people take part, the science gets better,” Dayer said.

Democratizing discovery

Community science invites anyone with curiosity and time to help advance research. Projects like FeederWatch have transformed ecology by generating millions of observations that help scientists monitor species and environmental change.

When done well, these programs also benefit participants — growing skills, addressing local needs, and creating a sense of belonging and purpose. Dayer sees this as a return to community science’s original promise: to democratize discovery.

“Science should be open to everyone,” she said. “Community science was designed to give people the tools to observe the world around them and know they’re contributing to something larger.”

From data to healing

For Dayer, the impact of this work goes beyond research. After her mother underwent a heart transplant, one of the first things Dayer did was help her mother return to watching the bird feeders at her home.

“Watching the birds brought her peace,” Dayer said. “It was something she could do every day — to sit outside, notice what was around her, and feel connected again. That’s the heart of community science. It’s more than data. It’s about what those experiences mean for people.”

This spirit reflects the college's mission to connect people and the natural world through learning and stewardship.

A more welcoming future

Through their partnership with the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Dayer and Langhans are sharing their findings with community science programs nationwide. The team hopes the recommendations will guide future adaptations that make science more welcoming, flexible, and relevant to people’s lives.

Dayer’s team is expanding who gets to take part in discovery while showing how welcoming science strengthens communities.

“When everyone has the chance to participate,” Langhans said, “science truly becomes a shared endeavor. That’s how we all learn more about our world.”",https://news.vt.edu/content/dam/news_vt_edu/articles/2025/11/dowwoo1.jpeg.transform/l-medium/image.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:04:25.323267

—American Soybean Association","WASHINGTON — The American Soybean Association and the National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) sent a joint letter today [Nov. 12, 2025] to President Donald J. Trump urging swift finalization of key federal biofuel policies needed to strengthen domestic demand for U.S. soy and support farmers facing continued market pressure.

The organizations called for completion of several priority actions, including finalizing EPA’s proposed 2026 to 2027 Renewable Fuel Standard volumes, limiting RIN credit generation from foreign feedstocks and imported biofuels, discouraging imports of used cooking oil and beef tallow that displace domestic soybean oil, ensuring full reallocation of waived RVO volumes tied to small refinery exemptions, and issuing timely Treasury guidance for the revised 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit to reflect congressional changes that prioritize domestic agricultural feedstocks.

ASA has applauded the Trump Administration for its advocacy to secure American energy dominance and U.S. soybean farmers are eager to support domestically produced biofuels made with U.S. soy. Finalizing the 2026 and 2027 Renewable Fuel Standard volume obligations and updating 45Z tax guidance to reflect support for domestically-sourced feedstocks is urgently needed to expand domestic market opportunities for U.S. soybean farmers.

ASA CEO Stephen Censky said the administration’s decisions in the coming weeks will directly influence farmer profitability and future processing investments.

“Farmers need clear and consistent federal policy to expand domestic biofuel production and strengthen the market for American grown soy,” Censky said. “The administration has taken important steps to support U.S. biofuels, and it is essential that these policies are finalized before the end of the year.”

Roughly half of all U.S.-processed soybean oil is used in biomass-based diesel, making biofuels one of the most significant domestic markets for soybeans.

Environmental organizations that oppose the DEP’s intention to grant the permit have asked the department to hold a public hearing on the issue.

The DEP has not made a final decision on whether to hold a public hearing on the permit but will decide based on the substance of comments received during the comment period that ended last week, Aquiline said.

In a 25-page joint letter Nov. 3 to the DEP, the Environmental Integrity Project in Washington, D.C., and the Mountain Watershed Association, an environmental group in Melcroft, contended the DEP should hold a public hearing because of sufficient interest in the plant and its emissions as a large pollution source.

The draft permit “contains many substantive deficiencies that must be fixed before the permit is issued,” including failing to require adequate monitoring to assure compliance with pollution limits for several pollutants from multiple sources at the plant, the environmental groups stated. Those pollutants include volatile organic compounds, sulfuric acid mist and sulfur oxide from plant sources.

The company’s draft permit also should require testing of the smokestacks at least annually for seven pollutants, the Environmental Integrity Project and Mountain Watershed contended.

As the public comment period opens, stakeholders will have the opportunity to provide input on the proposed PFAS reporting refinements, shaping a more effective and practical regulatory framework.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is moving to simplify its rules for PFAS reporting, aiming to strike a balance between protecting public health and reducing burdens on businesses.

The agency’s new proposal under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) seeks to make reporting requirements more practical, eliminate duplicative submissions, and focus on collecting the most critical data about PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) – commonly known as ‘forever chemicals.’

With this approach, EPA hopes to ease compliance for manufacturers and importers while continuing to track the environmental and health impacts of these persistent chemicals.

Understanding PFAS and their risks

PFAS are a large family of artificial chemicals widely used for their water- and grease-resistant properties in products such as cookware, textiles, and firefighting foam.

Dubbed forever chemicals, PFAS persist in the environment and accumulate in the human body over time.

Studies have linked exposure to certain PFAS to adverse health effects, including liver damage, thyroid disease, developmental issues, and increased cancer risk.

Environmental contamination is also a concern, as PFAS can migrate from products into soil and water, creating long-term ecological impacts.

The 2023 PFAS reporting rule

In October 2023, the Biden Administration finalised a one-time PFAS reporting and recordkeeping rule under TSCA Section 8(a)(7).

This regulation required manufacturers, including importers, who produced PFAS between 2011 and 2022 to submit detailed data on exposure, environmental effects, and health impacts.

The rule, however, has faced criticism for imposing a nearly billion-dollar compliance cost on industry without providing clear guidance on how collected data would be used to protect the environment.

Significant IT system failures and administrative delays highlighted shortcomings in practical implementation, especially for small businesses and importers. Critics argue that the regulation burdens industry while delivering limited environmental benefit.

Proposed changes to streamline PFAS reporting

EPA’s new proposal seeks to reduce regulatory burdens while maintaining essential data collection.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin emphasises that the changes align with the ‘Powering the Great American Comeback’ initiative, aiming to provide regulatory certainty, lower compliance costs, and focus on the most relevant PFAS information.

Key proposed exemptions include:

PFAS present at 0.1% or lower in mixtures or products

Imported articles

Certain byproducts and impurities

Research and development chemicals

Non-isolated intermediates

Additionally, the agency plans technical corrections to clarify required data fields and adjust submission timelines, ensuring a smoother reporting process.

Zeldin commented: “This Biden-era rule would have imposed crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1bn in implementation costs on American businesses.

“This proposal is grounded in common sense and the law, allowing us to collect the information we need to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.”

Balancing safety and efficiency

The EPA’s proposal reflects a broader effort to implement TSCA Section 8(a)(7) in a way that supports both industry and environmental goals.

By targeting unnecessary reporting while retaining critical safeguards, the agency aims to collect meaningful PFAS data without overwhelming businesses.

""The Trump administration, unfortunately, has been setting bad policy in the United States and trying to undermine policy around the world.""
In the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), oil demand would peak ""around 2030"" and decline to 100 million barrels per day by 2035 before falling in subsequent years.
""But this year's report also shows Donald Trump's dystopian future, bringing back the old, fossil-fuel intense, high pollution Current Policies Scenario,"" he said.","Renewable energy is still expanding faster than fossil fuels around the world despite policy changes in the United States, with oil demand possibly peaking ""around 2030"", the International Energy Agency said Wednesday.

The Paris-based IEA presented different scenarios for the future of energy in its annual World Energy Outlook -- the first since coming under fire from the government of US President Donald Trump over its oil forecasts.

""The pace varies, but renewables grow faster than any other major energy source in all scenarios, led by solar photovoltaics,"" the agency, which advises mostly developed nations, said in its 518-page report.

In one scenario, ""policy changes mean that the United States has 30 percent less renewables capacity installed in 2035 than in last year's Outlook, but at the global level renewables continue their rapid expansion"".

The report comes as world leaders meet at the UN's COP30 climate conference in Belem, Brazil, which Trump and his government have shunned.

Trump, who has pulled out of the Paris climate accord, wants to expand oil and gas production and roll back the clean energy policies of his predecessor, Joe Biden.

The IEA had to walk a fine line when drafting its latest outlook as it has faced criticism from the Trump administration for projecting dwindling demand for fossil fuels.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright threatened in July to pull out of the IEA if it did not reform how it operates.

- 'Politically motivated' -

The IEA used three scenarios for its World Energy Outlook: one takes into account policies that are currently in place, another looks at ""stated"" government policies including measures that have yet to be adopted, and a third considers a world that reaches net zero emissions by 2050.

Under the Current Policies Scenario (CPS), oil and natural gas demand would increase by 16 percent to 2035 and rise further through to 2050.

The IEA had dropped such scenarios from its reports in 2020.

""That (CPS) scenario is entirely politically motivated,"" Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told reporters at COP30 in Belem.

""The Trump administration, unfortunately, has been setting bad policy in the United States and trying to undermine policy around the world.""

In the IEA's Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), oil demand would peak ""around 2030"" and decline to 100 million barrels per day by 2035 before falling in subsequent years.

In a report in June, the IEA had forecast that global oil demand would fall slightly in 2030, which would mark the first drop since the 2020 Covid pandemic.

The World Energy Outlook said demand for electricity is rising, fuelled by data centres and artificial intelligence in advanced economies and China, along with increasing use of air conditioning in developing countries.

In every scenario, China remains the largest market for renewable energy, accounting for 45 to 60 percent of their global deployment over the next 10 years.

Under every scenario, however, the IEA said the world would exceed 1.5C of warming above pre-industrial levels -- the most ambitious goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

""There is less momentum than before behind national and international efforts to reduce emissions, yet climate risks are rising,"" the report said.

Under the CPS, warming would exceed 2C around 2050 and 2.9C in 2100 -- and then keep rising from there.

In STEPS, warming would exceed 2C by around 2060 and 2.5C by 2100.

But in the net-zero scenario, it would peak at about 1.65C around 2050 and decline slowly after that, before dropping back below 1.5C by 2100, according to the IEA.

The IEA has ""confirmed that no single country can stop the energy transition, with oil and coal demand to peak by 2030 in its business-as-usual scenario"", said David Tong, global industry campaign manager at Oil Change International, a non-profit advocacy group.

""But this year's report also shows Donald Trump's dystopian future, bringing back the old, fossil-fuel intense, high pollution Current Policies Scenario,"" he said.

During these years, I’ve also done social service and environmental work. I have come to realize how interconnected the inner work of being a healthy human and the bigger efforts to be a healthy community really are. These are not separate, especially in our society right now. As I read comments on various news sources around our region, I realize that we really do have more in common than separates us – at least when it comes to the Google Data Center.

Each time Project Zodiac announces taking more wetlands, requires more unsustainable energy sourcing with ratepayers footing the bill, and applies for more massive diesel generators as back-up, I notice the breadth and depth of our community questioning if any potential benefit of this hyperscale AI data center in SE Allen County will be worth the resources they will extract. In the weeks since Indiana Michigan Power and Hatchworks, LLC have piled on four overlapping applications for more asks, I have met hundreds of new neighbors who have concerns about this center.

We, the people, understand that ordinary people bearing the cost of more energy production by I&M to fuel this complex is bad enough, but bearing the cost with our health and our lives is far too much.

To get into the nitty-gritty, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) uses a capacity of 25% to calculate its air permit limits. Emergency back-up diesel generators are allowed to run up to 100 hours per year for maintenance and non-emergency use, but could potentially be running much more. IDEM’s draft air permit allows the company to release over 980 tons each year of air pollutants! I want to be clear – there is no safe exposure to these ultra-fine particles emitted into the air (called PM 2.5) for human health. Even if there is compliance with the national and state standards, this does not ensure the air is healthy. Health impacts from exposure range from low birth weight, higher infant mortality rates, and cancer to asthma, COPD, and cardiovascular disease.

In a densely populated area, I believe there is no reason Google cannot reduce the total number of emergency diesel generators by increasing the use of battery storage, using renewable energy sources on site, and adding pollution controls to any generators on this site! As an innovative tech company that at one time aimed “to do no evil,” they could certainly bring innovation and ethics to DO better because we deserve better.

As we witness what is unfolding in other AI data center communities and look at the energy demand for this one, we can already predict that this is far from the last “ask” we will get that impacts our air, soil, water, energy and quality of life. More generators may follow, as these 177 massive generators are not nearly enough to keep this monstrosity going when the center is operating full tilt and the grid is unstable. We need to demand transparency about plans from Google regarding this site and urge our city and state leaders to be our advocates. The Indiana Department of Environmental Management must protect our community by requiring the best available control technology on any diesel generators at this site and deny this permit.

It takes a watchful eye to catch permit applications and be on top of the next vote at Citizens Square, but a large coalition of concerned citizens helps a little effort to make a big impact.

There are so many pressures that weigh on us and threaten to divide us, but one hope I have is seeing that throughout our community, we care about people’s health and life opportunities, not just for the wealthiest companies. We can be the best community when we make time to enjoy the goodness Allen County has to offer AND when we make time to invest in our community’s well-being. One engagement provides short-term sustenance and joy, the other makes way for a long-term impact of human resilience. Whether you are fascinated or repelled by AI technology, participate in the public process to learn more. Whether you feel ill-equipped but concerned or come armed with statistics and solutions, join the voices demanding that Google’s air permit be denied until they present a plan that literally has us breathing a little easier. Each of us is worth having the best chance at wholeness and health. Together we will foster a healthier community, one action at a time. Be of courage and hold fast to that which is good – we are worth this effort to protect Allen County.

,American Energy,2025-11-12 13:00:41+00:00,Energy-Storage.News,"71% of Americans surveyed support energy storage, but 'vocal minority' kill or delay projects",April Bonner,,,,,https://www.energy-storage.news/71-of-americans-surveyed-support-energy-storage-but-vocal-minority-kill-or-delay-projects/,"DeBellis says, “We found through the survey that actually, 71% of Americans support energy storage projects in their local community.
For us, this was a pretty surprising result, just because you see a lot of the attention-grabbing headlines in the news about energy storage.” He continues, “We found that only 29% of the Americans that were polled oppose energy storage, and that’s overwhelmingly the minority there, but that minority is very vocal about their concerns.” This vocal minority of Americans opposed to energy storage can significantly impact project development.
In these instances and others like it, fire was brought up as a major concern of residents located near BESS projects.
However, moderator Mike Ryan, the commercial director at developer Constantine Energy Storage, highlighted that public perception frequently contradicts this view.
This standard, titled NFPA 855: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems (ESS), is updated every three years and sets minimum requirements for installing energy storage systems across residential, commercial, industrial (C&I), and utility scales.","Cummings added, “It’s crucial the industry takes a proactive stance in both communication and standard setting. That means engaging early with local stakeholders, explaining the safety measures in place and pushing for modern codes and standards that reflect today’s technologies. We have to go beyond the minimum compliance thresholds.”

In April, Brian Cashion, Director of Engineering at Firetrace, wrote a guest blog for Energy-Storage.news, discussing how community opposition has the greatest potential to hinder the BESS sector’s growth.

“At a broader level, local communities are often unaware of the significant benefits that BESS sites can create, including lower electricity bills, cleaner air and more reliable power. Many local citizens, understandably, don’t want large infrastructure projects near their homes, fearing they could impact property prices and the aesthetics of the local area,” Cashion wrote.

Firetrace’s global head of clean energy, Joe DeBellis, expands on these ideas through the lens of the company’s new report and survey.

Firetrace International manufactures fire detection and suppression systems for various sectors, but with a particular focus on the renewables industry.

‘Unlocking Support for BESS’

The report, ‘Unlocking Support for BESS: How to boost public support for battery energy storage systems’, details the results of a survey of 4,000 people across the entire US, gauging awareness and attitudes toward BESS projects.

DeBellis says, “We found through the survey that actually, 71% of Americans support energy storage projects in their local community. For us, this was a pretty surprising result, just because you see a lot of the attention-grabbing headlines in the news about energy storage.”

He continues, “We found that only 29% of the Americans that were polled oppose energy storage, and that’s overwhelmingly the minority there, but that minority is very vocal about their concerns.”

This vocal minority of Americans opposed to energy storage can significantly impact project development.

DeBellis points out, “We’ve actually seen that through that 29% – various projects over the last few years. I believe there were upwards of nine separate projects that were rejected or delayed in the last year alone, solely due to safety concerns. That’s a lot coming from the vocal minority there that has concerns.”

In July, ESN Premium reported that Marion County in Oregon enacted a moratorium on utility-scale battery storage, following zoning law amendments approved by the Board of Directors (BoD) in June.

A similar situation was reported in June, when renewables developer Prospect14’s hybrid storage project application was reviewed and rejected by town authorities in Chino Valley, Arizona.

In these instances and others like it, fire was brought up as a major concern of residents located near BESS projects.

DeBellis notes of this common concern, “From that survey as well, we saw that 47% of the folks said that they’re going to be more comfortable with a battery energy storage site if they had a clear understanding of safety measures as well. That’s something that can be addressed very early on, not just when the public remarks that, ‘Hey, we’re a little bit concerned.’”

Providing BESS education

Effectively communicating the safety measures could go a long way in building trust with the public, because, as DeBellis highlights, about the 29% of Americans opposed to energy storage identified in the survey:

“Of that 29%, really half of that – so 52% of the folks that oppose energy storage – actually haven’t encountered information about battery energy storage at all. So, the way that we interpret that is a lack of information. It’s not necessarily that they’re truly concerned with the technology. It’s just they haven’t been educated enough.”

Kevin Smith, CEO of developer-operator Arevon Energy, also noted the importance of providing education and pushing back against BESS misinformation in a July interview with ESN Premium.

“If you’re not in the community from the beginning, a lot of misinformation starts circulating. People end up creating Facebook pages with all kinds of inaccurate information. That’s why it’s really important that we get in early and make sure residents have the right information.”

Smith continued, “Obviously, people are going to look online and find other perspectives, but we want to ensure they have accurate information from us so they can weigh that against whatever else they encounter.”

This task becomes increasingly difficult when, as seen recently, government officials parrot incorrect information about BESS safety.

In July, Josh F.W. Cook, the Administrator of the US EPA Pacific Southwest Region, addressed BESS fire incidents after the agency reached a settlement with IPP LS Power to oversee cleanup following a lithium-ion battery fire at the Gateway energy storage site.

Cook said, “I am alarmed by the incidents and impacts of utility-grade battery fires on first responders, specifically the professional firefighters who are exposed to horrible, toxic conditions when batteries catch fire. This settlement action is a step in the right direction, but the broader battery storage fire issue requires additional attention and EPA enforcement.”

While fire incidents involving BESS are serious, they are relatively infrequent, and the occurrence of failure incidents is decreasing. There appears to have been one incident to date in which firefighters in the US have been seriously hurt in a BESS fire incident. In 2019, at the 2.16MWh McMicken facility in Surprise, Arizona, members of a fire crew suffered injuries when an external door to an enclosure blew open while they were investigating.

The EPA did issue BESS safety guidance in August, which noted, “Since 2020, BESS failure incidents have decreased, but some recent fires have gained attention in the media.”

In the Firetrace report, DeBellis highlights what could be a crucial piece of info in helping developers gain support for BESS projects.

He says, “Roughly 70% of citizens said that if these energy storage sites created benefits, like cheaper electricity bills, they would be in favour of them.”

DeBellis continues, “68% wanted reliable power, two-thirds of folks highlighted local jobs and economic benefits as important factors to support.”

The company has also provided this information to the public in many instances, to help build community support and education around BESS.

“The responsibility for (Firetrace and the BESS industry) is to educate the community, educate the public, on technologies, different safety measures that can be done. I think that’s very important as technologies continue to evolve.”

DeBellis says, “It’s important to ask, ‘How do we get out ahead of some of these hurdles and navigate rough waters with some of these projects going up?’”

A similar sentiment was shared during the recent Battery Asset Management Summit UK & Ireland, where a panel of BESS owner-operators, investors, and technical services firms concurred that lithium-ion BESS is generally a safe technology in a discussion about safety strategies, technologies and best practice. However, moderator Mike Ryan, the commercial director at developer Constantine Energy Storage, highlighted that public perception frequently contradicts this view.

The BESS industry is constantly working to improve fire safety measures and communicate the safety of BESS.

In September, the US National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) released the latest version of its key safety standard for battery storage, NFPA 855.

This standard, titled NFPA 855: Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems (ESS), is updated every three years and sets minimum requirements for installing energy storage systems across residential, commercial, industrial (C&I), and utility scales.

The standards are adopted by local authorities having jurisdiction (AHJs), various US states, and are often referenced by stakeholders such as financiers and insurers.

In an article for PV Tech Power (Vol.43), Drew Bandhauer, a BESS engineer at Leeward Renewable Energy, stated that NFPA 855 is “the primary fire standard guiding BESS site design and installation, supported by critical sub-chapters, including NFPA 68, NFPA 69, and NFPA 72.”

In April, the American Clean Power Association (ACP), a group representing clean energy industry interests, published Battery Energy Storage: Blueprint for Safety, a safety framework guide for BESS. This was based on an evaluation by fire protection engineering expert group Fire and Risk Alliance, which examined historical data and research on fire incidents in the US over the past decade.

Both ACP and Fire and Risk Alliance stated that their assessment results did not suggest any risks to public health or neighbouring communities stemming from the studied fire incidents.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-74.png,N,,2025-11-12 11:03:13.132831

Billions Flow to US Nuclear Sector With Payoff Still Years Away Back to video

Article content

Article content

In theory, $80 billion can buy enough reactors to power all of Virginia’s Data Center Alley. In reality, traditional reactors take 10 years or more to build, while a highly anticipated wave of small, modular reactors has yet to produce commercial power. That means the only plants that will go into service anytime soon are a handful of shuttered facilities that can be restarted.

Article content

“There’s a lot going on, and nothing is going on,” said BloombergNEF’s head nuclear analyst Chris Gadomski.

Article content

That dissonance underscores how radically, and rapidly, the US energy system has transformed in recent years. Not long ago, utilities were shutting down costly nuclear plants and replacing them with cheaper natural gas-fired and renewable plants. The AI boom has since supercharged electricity consumption, straining power supplies and driving up prices. But while nuclear is suddenly in demand again, logistics and technology constraints threaten to thwart development even with President Donald Trump’s moves to streamline permitting and commit billions of dollars in funding.

It’s possible the nuclear industry can meet Trump’s goal of starting construction on 10 big nuclear reactors by 2030. But there won’t be a lot of wiggle room, said Wyatt Hartley, head of North American asset management for Brookfield Asset Management Ltd. The company is emerging as a key player in the industry, in part because it’s the majority owner of Westinghouse Electric Co., which is expected to be a key beneficiary of the $80 billion reactor deal announced last month.

Article content

“Nothing in nuclear happens overnight,” said Jeffrey Merrifield, a former commissioner with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Article content

Besides permitting, developers must line up buyers for the power and hire thousands of skilled workers. And some of the most critical components of a plant, such as reactor vessels and steam generators, can take as long as four years to manufacture and deliver.

Article content

Hartley expects some of those orders to be placed “in the very near term” but, realistically, it will take 10 years to get just two plants up and running.

Article content

Until then, some reactor developers are relying on natural gas. Fermi Inc., an energy real estate investment trust co-founded by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry that is developing a massive data center in Texas, placed orders for reactor components last month, but doesn’t expect them to go into service until the early 2030s. Start-ups Blue Energy Global Inc. and First American Nuclear Co. also expect their reactors to be completed next decade. All three companies are installing gas systems to supply data center customers as soon as possible.",https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/financialpost/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/reactor-revival-us-will-spend-more-than-350-billion-on-nu.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 10:01:29.946200

It is unclear whether the furloughs are related to this detention or a separate action—Qcells has not yet responded to PV Tech’s requests for comments on the decision—but the episode highlights the vulnerability in global solar supply chains that have undermined the US’ recent push towards greater domestic manufacturing of solar modules.
This imbalance means that US module manufacturers rely on foreign imports of critical components, such as cells, which are exposed to detention by the CBP.
“Our latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,” Stoepker said.
“Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains.","“As Qcells introduced new supply chains to support its growing solar panel manufacturing facilities in Georgia, the company was recently forced to scale back production while our shipments into the US were delayed in the customs clearance process,” explained Qcells spokeswoman Marta Stoepker to local news station WSBTV Atlanta.

Earlier this year, PV Tech reported that CBP had detained cells imported by Qcells from Korea to supply the company’s module manufacturing facility in Georgia. It is unclear whether the furloughs are related to this detention or a separate action—Qcells has not yet responded to PV Tech’s requests for comments on the decision—but the episode highlights the vulnerability in global solar supply chains that have undermined the US’ recent push towards greater domestic manufacturing of solar modules.

While the US has successfully expanded its module production—adding 50GW of new capacity last year alone—adding new cell capacity has proven more difficult, with just 2GW of new capacity added in the first nine months of this year. This imbalance means that US module manufacturers rely on foreign imports of critical components, such as cells, which are exposed to detention by the CBP.

QCells is working on what would be the US’s first c-Si integrated ingot-to-module production facility to minimise supply chain disruptions such as this; however, it is not due to be in operation until early next year.

‘No material from Xinjiang province’

The assumption is that Qcells is thought to not be in compliance with the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which prevents materials and components made in China’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), and that are suspected of being made with forced labour, from entering the US.

Fellow manufacturer Maxeon has seen its modules detailed by the CBP under this act, and while CBP has not specified the conditions under which the Qcells cells have been detained, Stoepker emphasised that the company’s products are not linked to the XUAR.

“Our latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,” Stoepker said. “Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains. We will soon be back on track with the full force of our Georgia team delivering American-made energy to communities around the country.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/QCells-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:03:16.908289

The report by the International Energy Agency said renewable energy, led by solar power, will grow faster than any other major source in the next few years and that coal and oil demand will likely peak globally by the end of this decade. The report noted that many natural gas projects were approved in 2025, due to changes in U.S. policy, indicating worldwide supply will rise even as questions remain about how it will be used. Meanwhile, global nuclear power capacity is set to increase by at least a third by 2035 after being stagnant for years.

The release of the annual World Energy Outlook coincided with U.N. climate negotiations in Brazil this week where global leaders are calling for ways to curb the planet’s warming.

Regional Dynamics

The IEA says building greater resilience in energy systems is especially important as data centers, heating and cooling, electrification and more drive energy demand. Investment in data centers is expected to reach $580 billion this year, exceeding investment in the oil supply, according to the report.

Growing economies including India and nations in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, will “increasingly shape energy market dynamics in the years,” the IEA said, noting their potential for solar power.

China, meanwhile, has accounted for half the global growth in demand for oil and gas, and more than half for electricity, since 2010.

“In a break from the trend of the past decade, the increase in electricity consumption is no longer limited to emerging and developing economies,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a release. Birol said that electricity use is also rising in advanced economies.

Nations are grappling with meeting demand while preparing for the risks brought on by the planet’s warming. The IEA says the world is falling short on universal energy access and climate change goals. Around 730 million people still live without electricity, according to the IEA, and despite progress, nearly one-quarter of the global population still relies on inefficient cooking methods that hurt their health or the environment. 2024 was also the hottest year on record.

Nations should diversify their energy sources and cooperate to expand supply chains for critical minerals used to make things like batteries for electric vehicles and components for solar and wind power generation, the IEA said. This also includes making quick improvements to the grid, energy storage and broader infrastructure.

“When we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,” Birol said. “With energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals – on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.”

Global Reaction

The Nov. 12 edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term. Trump’s administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the “endangerment finding” that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.

Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.

But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.

“The evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,” said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. “Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.”

Maria Pastukhova, energy transition program lead at climate change think tank E3G, said the report makes “the choices for the global energy system and the global economy unambiguous.”

“If countries want to grow their economies and protect their citizens from roller-coaster energy prices, they need to focus relentlessly on energy efficiency and the (decarbonization) of energy demand,” Pastukhova said.

Others, however, were critical. Ben Backwell, CEO of the Global Wind Energy Council, said the outlook does not fully capture the momentum in renewables, and that it should have emphasized the trajectory for renewable energy is accelerating, driven by the decreasing cost of the technologies, strong policy support and the move toward electrification.

“We’re accelerating,” he added. “You can see it all around the world and we can see it in our numbers for last year, but also in our numbers for the first half of this year. It looks very, very exciting, both for wind and for solar, in fact, and for next year, even more so.”

Q4: Are electric vehicles too expensive for most Indian buyers?
Q6: Isn’t the electricity used to charge EVs still polluting if it comes from coal?","Q1: Is charging an electric vehicle really time-consuming and inconvenient?

A: Not anymore. Modern EVs support fast-charging systems capable of replenishing up to 80 per cent of battery capacity in about an hour. For everyday use, most owners charge their cars overnight using home chargers, while an expanding public charging network across major cities and highways further adds to the owners' convenience.

Q2: Do electric vehicles still have limited range?

A: That’s no longer the case. Thanks to improvements in battery efficiency, several EVs sold in India today can travel over 300 kilometres on a single charge. For longer drives, fast chargers installed along highways are helping reduce “range anxiety,” making EVs more viable for intercity travel.

Also watch: Volvo EX30 Review | A Super Practical EV

Q3: Are electric vehicles unsafe to drive in heavy rain or waterlogged areas?

A: EVs are designed to operate safely even in challenging weather. Their batteries are sealed within IP67-rated enclosures, allowing them to withstand submersion in water up to one metre deep for 30 minutes. This ensures protection against short circuits and maintains safe performance during monsoons.

Q4: Are electric vehicles too expensive for most Indian buyers?

A: Although EVs do cost more the traditional ICE vehicles, as battery production costs reduce and in-house manufacturing scales up, EVs are on track to become more affordable. In addition, government subsidies, state incentives, and tax benefits further reduce upfront prices. Lower running and maintenance costs also make EVs cheaper to own over the longer run.

Q5: Is India’s charging infrastructure still inadequate?

A: The network is expanding steadily. India now hosts over 26,000 public charging stations alongside thousands of private chargers in housing societies and workplaces. Government and private-sector initiatives are pushing for chargers every few kilometres along highways, making EV ownership increasingly practical. However, not all chargers are always operational, and the country requires more chargers to be installed to satiate India's rising EV charging demands.

Q6: Isn’t the electricity used to charge EVs still polluting if it comes from coal?

A: While India’s grid still relies on fossil fuels, EVs remain cleaner overall due to higher energy efficiency and lower lifecycle emissions. The country’s energy mix is also changing, with renewables like solar and wind steadily increasing their share. Homeowners using solar panels for charging can reduce their carbon footprint even further.

Q7: Are lithium batteries and EVs inherently dangerous?

A: EVs are built with advanced battery management and thermal safety systems that significantly reduce risks. Global and Indian regulations now mandate rigorous testing and certification to prevent overheating and short circuits. Following manufacturer-recommended charging and maintenance practices ensures safe, reliable use.

Q8: Do EVs really reduce pollution overall?

A: Yes. According to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA), EVs emit 25–40 per cent less carbon dioxide across their lifetime compared to petrol or diesel vehicles, even after accounting for electricity generation and battery manufacturing. As India’s grid becomes greener, that gap will widen further.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/12/1600x900/logo/Delhi-and-India-more-broadly-need-structural-polic_1752246571010_1762948753311.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 13:02:35.710906

Hydrogen has seen significant growth over the past few years, with California displaying a special proclivity for the renewable energy resource. Some have noted that the shelving of federal funds is merely a punishment for California’s Governor waging a social media war with US President Donald Trump.

The cancellation of federal funds has been a hit to the California hydrogen dream

Hydrogen has long been overlooked by the international energy community as a viable energy resource, however, that reality has started to shift in recent years as many nations now have strategic plans and policies in place to boost hydrogen production and usage, While the majority of the United States has steered clear of hydorgen, California has plans to become the spirituial home for hydrogen in the United States.

Those plans for California to embrace the hydrogen sector have hit a major snag recently, with the federal government rolling back any progress made in the previous administration that aimed to boost the renewable energy sector in the United States. State-run ARCHES green hydrogen hub has been forced to halt development as the Trump administration has canceled over $1.2 billion in DOE support.

California has been waging a theoretical war with the current administration

Many insiders have noted that the real reason behind the cancellation of federal funds for ARCHES is the latest conflict between US President Donald Trump and California’s Governor Gavin Newsom. Newson has been posting satirical posts online that mock the President’s online style, not to mention the redistricting vote that California recently held to offset a similar move by Texas.

The Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems was supposed to establish a home for hydrogen in America

The joint project was supposed to build a flagship hydrogen hub in California, connecting several hydrogen facilities to a state-run project aimed at boosting production and usage of the renewable energy resource. However, the federal government has opted to cancel funding for the project as part of a broader fiscal cut to the budget.

The ARCHES project boasted support from several institutions and organizations that aimed to boost the standing and reputation of the American hydrogen sector, such as:

California Governor Gavin Newsom’s Office of Business and Economic Development (GO-Biz)

the University of California

The State Building and Construction Trades Council

Renewables 100 Policy Institute

ARCHES was set to receive the largest single allocation of the $8 billion Hydrogen Hubs Program, which was set to roll out in the near future. The initial plan for the ARCHES project was to connect hydrogen pipelines and infrastructure to deliver 220,000 direct jobs in the energy sector and hopefully attract business from the state’s largest companies, such as Amazon, Chevron, GE, Toyota, and Plug Power.

The US embrace of the hydrogen sector has lagged behind the rest of the world, with Europe backing an early-stage development of a Baltic Sea Hydrogen project.

The news comes after the French automaker terminated its project with technology firm Valeo focused on rare-earth-free EV motor and is part of efforts to reduce cost.

China accounts for about 70% of global rare earths mining and 85% of refining.

Beijing’s tightening export curbs have forced the industry to race for alternative supply.

Renault has deployed rare-earth-free motors since 2012 and said in late 2023 it was collaborating with Valeo on a higher-power, more compact unit.

One of the sources said: “The E7A engine project is no longer being done with Valeo. It will be done entirely in-house across the entire value chain, except for the stator which could be bought from a Chinese supplier.”

Even if a Chinese company supplies the stator, Renault plans to manufacture the motor at its Cléon plant in France.

STMicroelectronics will provide silicon carbide modules for the inverter.

A representative for Renault’s EV subsidiary Ampere said, “A Chinese partner is a possibility” but a decision is yet to be made.

Valeo did not comment.

The new rare-earth-free motors are slated to power Renault’s next generation of compact EVs from 2028.

The E7A motor is expected to deliver 200 kW, around 25% more than current units used in models such as the Scenic.

It will incorporate an 800-volt system, double that of current Renault EVs, to shorten charging times.

The motors are part of CEO Francois Provost’s strategic plan due to be presented in March.

The company has increasingly turned to partners in recent years to speed up and reduce the cost of EV development, including Chinese suppliers.

Dampening a solar boom The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.","At least three Republican lawmakers took advantage of a decades-old rooftop solar credit that will end in January due to President Donald Trump’s megalaw, according to a review of property records and satellite imagery by POLITICO’s E&E News.

The lawmakers — with solar arrays on a California villa, a $3 million Utah manse and an off-the-grid Kentucky homestead — all supported ending the perk this summer that sliced thousands of dollars off the cost of installing their panels.

California Rep. Ken Calvert, a long-serving Republican who was thrust into a race next year with a member of his own party when the state redrew his conservative district, defended voting to end the solar credit that he used about 15 years ago to offset the cost of putting two rows of panels on the back roof of his ranch-style house in Southern California.

“It never was supposed to be permanent,” Calvert said of the credits — a line echoed by other Republicans who criticized renewable energy as unreliable and dependent on subsidies. The law that Trump called his “one big beautiful bill” passed Congress with no Democratic votes and the support of all but five Republicans.

E&E News examined the rooftops of 112 members of Congress: every Senate Republican and 59 House GOP lawmakers who are in leadership or facing tough reelection races.

The search found that at least seven Republican lawmakers had rooftop panels. Three of them acknowledged using the federal tax credit to help pay for the arrays. One couldn’t recall. Another had leased a solar system that was indirectly subsidized via a separate tax credit for installers. And two other lawmakers didn’t respond to questions about their panels, which were on properties they had recently owned.

In addition to Calvert, the other Republican lawmakers who are known to have collected the residential solar credit are Sen. John Curtis of Utah and Rep. Tom Massie of Kentucky, a libertarian who voted against Trump’s megalaw but said in an interview he supports rescinding the solar subsidy — and all tax credits. Curtis said Democrats and solar companies “knew that it was time for the subsidies to go.”

The revelations come at a time of rising utility rates and increasing politicization of energy as the Trump administration scraps grants, loans and permits for solar, wind and other renewable energy technologies. The president has dismissed solar panels as part of Democrats’ “green new scam” and called them “a blight on our country.”

Trump’s megalaw reinforced the partisan divide on energy. While the legislation primarily extended tax cuts passed in the president’s first term and provided $300 billion for border enforcement and military programs, it also slashed over $484 billion in clean energy incentives. Despite the megalaw’s deep cuts for climate programs, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that it would add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.

The law was a double-whammy for the solar industry. It speeds up the phase-out of both the rooftop solar subsidy tapped by Calvert, Curtis and Massie as well as another credit relied on by project developers to cut the price of leased panels. At the same time, it boosted an oil subsidy created in the early 1900s and included other provisions to increase the production of fossil fuels that are primarily responsible for global warming.

“There has been a push, as you know, for a long while to get rid of those tax credits,” said Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, whose Capitol Hill rowhouse roof has been layered with solar panels for about a decade. “And then when you had Trump come into office, he made it very clear that this was not something that he was going to continue supporting.”

A key swing vote on the megalaw, Murkowski couldn’t recall if she received the credit, which can save homeowners thousands of dollars by refunding 30 percent of the cost of buying and installing panels. Analysts say almost everyone who buys a new solar system — the average cost of which is now about $30,000 — files for the benefit.

Rise and fall of solar subsidies

Congress first established a tax credit for some residential solar investments in 1978, but the subsidy expired in 1985.

The tax credit was revived in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 — a sweeping law signed by President George W. Bush that Murkowski and Calvert voted for at the time.

In the years since, the so-called residential clean energy credit has been extended and broadened in scope several times, most recently when Democrats passed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 with no Republican votes. The clean energy spending package would have allowed homeowners to claim tax credits of between 22 and 30 percent of the cost of qualifying solar, wind, geothermal and battery projects through 2034.

Then on July 4, Trump signed the megalaw that moved up the expiration of the residential clean energy credit by nearly a decade.

The legislation also accelerated the end of a 30 percent investment tax credit that’s used by solar installers to lower the cost of leasing panels for their customers. That solar credit will now largely disappear at the end of 2027, at least five years earlier than it would have.

New York Rep. Mike Lawler lives in a suburban home in the Hudson River Valley with rooftop panels that he leases from Vivint Solar. His district narrowly supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, making him one of the most vulnerable Republicans in Congress.

Lawler was among a group of GOP lawmakers who repeatedly urged House leaders to protect clean energy subsidies when the party was overhauling the tax code this year. Those efforts were largely unsuccessful, and Lawler voted for the bill.

“We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we were able to keep a lot of the provisions and labor standards, etc.,” he said in an interview.

The panels on Lawler’s house have helped him avoid the impacts of rising electricity costs. Since he began leasing the solar system in 2016, it has saved him “a few thousand bucks,” he estimated.

“Look, they were going to expire,” Lawler said of the solar subsidies. “And it was phased out — a little more accelerated than some would like — but people are still able to utilize them.”

Lawler indirectly benefited from the investment tax credit, analysts say, because it helps companies reduce the costs their customers pay for leasing rooftop solar systems. After 2027, when the investment tax credit disappears, it could be harder for people to lease panels or buy electricity from community solar projects, according to Zoë Gaston, an analyst at the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.

“Solar will definitely be more expensive,” she said. “It could be as much as a 30 percent increase. I know from talking to lots of installers that they’re trying to find other opportunities to cut costs.”

California Reps. Darrell Issa and Young Kim, both Republicans who voted for the megalaw, also had solar panels on homes they once owned. Public records show Issa sold his property last year. Kim transferred hers to a family trust in 2024 that now operates it as a rental property. She is facing a primary from Calvert.

Their offices did not respond to questions about whether the lawmakers had taken advantage of federal subsidies to purchase or lease the panels.

Dampening a solar boom

The use of rooftop panels by Republicans illustrates the growing economic appeal of solar energy, industry data shows.

A renewable energy trade group estimated in 2004 that the nation installed enough panels that year to produce a total of 58 megawatts of power, enough for about 8,000 homes. Installations have exploded in popularity since then. Last year, the U.S. added over 50 gigawatts of solar capacity — 865 times higher than 2004 levels — with 4.8 GW of that annual growth coming from the residential sector alone, according to solar industry data. Seven percent of U.S. homes now have solar systems.

The megalaw is likely to blunt the solar boom as it amplifies other challenges facing the industry, such as high interest rates and Trump’s tariffs, according to analysts. Three large companies have already filed for bankruptcy protection this year, with more expected to become insolvent in the coming months. Wood Mackenzie estimates that solar installations over the next decade would be 17 percent lower than it had previously forecast.

Curtis and Murkowski both argued that phasing out solar subsidies was necessary.

“I think universally, everybody — including our Democratic colleagues, including the industry — knew that it was time for the subsidies to go,” said Curtis, who along with Murkowski shaped the megalaw to make it slightly less difficult for companies to access the investment tax credit before it ends. “Nobody fought harder than I did for the off-ramp for those, because I felt like the off-ramp was appropriate.”

Democrats and solar companies disagreed with Curtis. Abigail Ross Hopper, the head of the Solar Energy Industries Association, warned on July 1 that the compromise legislation he and Murkowski had brokered “will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide.”

Curtis founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in 2021 while he was serving in the House. Two years later, he invited a climate media company to tour his home in Provo, Utah, where he showed off his solar panels and geothermal heat pump, while bragging about the hundreds of dollars per month they helped him save in energy costs. The panels and heat pump were both eligible for the residential tax credit he voted to terminate.

Back on Capitol Hill, Murkowski said her husband decided to install panels on their rowhouse about a decade ago. The senator, who once chaired the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, couldn’t recall if they had filed for the federal tax credit.

“He was a real skeptic of solar and solar panels, more specifically, because he didn’t think that they were really going to make a difference for him as a consumer, as an individual,” Murkowski said, referring to her husband, Verne Martell.

What changed his mind, she said, was seeing the electricity savings of his then-87-year-old mother, who has solar panels on her home in Maui, Hawaii.

“It was an education for him that allowed him to do more research about how it might work in Washington, D.C.,” Murkowski said. “I do like the fact that our utility bills are really manageable now. And you know, it took a while, but it paid off.”

New fossil fuel subsidies

Republicans’ justification for killing rooftop solar credits are undercut by their continued support for incentives that go to the fossil fuel industry, argued Jesse Lee, a former senior adviser to the National Economic Council during the Biden administration.

“We’ve had subsidies and tax credits for oil production for more than a century. So I don’t really understand this argument that all clean energy tax credits must come to an end,” said Lee, who is now a spokesperson for the environmental advocacy group Climate Power.

“And not only did they leave the century-old oil industry subsidies untouched, they gave new tax loopholes to the oil industry,” he added. For instance, the megalaw established a 2.5 percent production tax credit for steel-making coal, cut royalty rates for coal mining and oil drilling on federal land, and eased restrictions on tax deductions for oil drilling costs — a subsidy that dates back to 1913.

Murkowski wasn’t comfortable with the megalaw’s energy contradictions.

“It’s kind of putting your finger on the scale, if you will, and picking winners and losers in the energy space,” she said. “I don’t think we should do that.”

But overall, she thought the bill was “more positive than negative in a lot of different areas,” she said. Murkowski was one of the final Republican holdouts on the bill, which passed the Senate with a tiebreaking vote by Vice President JD Vance.

Massie, whose Kentucky farmhouse appears to have more solar panels than the homes of his GOP colleagues, was one of only two House Republicans to oppose the megalaw. He voted against it because he thought the bill didn’t go far enough in cutting energy and health care subsidies.

“I would end all the tax credits. For everything,” said Massie, who earned a master’s degree in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has enough solar and battery systems to live off the grid. “I bought the bulk of mine before the federal tax credit.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/d7/41/b41a2dcd46419e20c32ff86c2217/main-ee-solarcredits-new.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:10.805356

Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who is set to retire after 34 years representing the heart of Manhattan. The video was not cheeky, controversial and eyebrow raising as much of his content as “JackUno” often is.

Instead, Schlossberg notified his nearly 800,000 follower in a serious and earnest tone of his desire to represent his hometown district and fight against the Trump administration from within the halls of Congress.

It should be specifically about young candidates — any age candidates — who understand policy and how to compete in this political environment, which is toxic.”

Like other Democrats, Schlossberg sees President Donald Trump’s policies and behavior as causing what he called corruption, affordability and constitutional crises. But unlike other elected Democrats and candidates, the New York City native is leaning into his influencer credentials to fuel his first run for elected office. He sees taking it to Trump on social media as not just clickbait but a necessity in an attention economy dominated by right-wing X posters, podcasters and YouTube influencers spreading the Trump gospel.

“One thing we can do is elect candidates who know how to communicate and cut back in this toxic political environment that we find ourselves in,” Schlossberg said. “New media is completely polluted and the air is dirty. I figured out a way to breathe in that environment, and we need to elect candidates who understand how to do that, and I think that’s what makes me an effective representative.”

Schlossberg isn’t shying away from the personal nature of the fight against Trump — who has sought to dismantle the Kennedy legacy — or against his cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who Trump appointed Health and Human Services secretary after a failed presidential run that was Camelot-coded.

Schlossberg’s online following ballooned last year, in the lead-up to the 2024 presidential election, as he tried on various characters and presented his followers with accented impersonations. He was the first in his family to publicly criticize his cousin, and drew attention for trolling the now-HHS secretary and Trumpism.

Schlossberg also appeared as a surrogate on the 2024 campaign trail, spending the months ahead of the election traveling the country and making cameos in viral videos with elected officials in hopes of turning out young voters. Schlossberg’s “trolling for a cause” model, as he called it, recently has been embraced by high-profile Democrats such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and others who have started posting slightly unhinged or lacerating social media messages directed at Trump and MAGA world, oftentimes in all caps and with exaggerated punctuation.

“In the lead-up to the 2024 election, I saw a problem that I wanted to do something about, and that’s that the internet and new media is dominated by the right — and it has been for a decade,” said Schlossberg. “I want to offer a different perspective, an alternative perspective, and get the Democratic Party’s message out there to reach people. So I use my own creativity, a little bit of courage, to put my neck out there and speak up for what I believe in. And I learned a lot doing that.”

But Schlossberg’s in-real-life takeaway from his experience on the campaign trail wasn’t as sarcastic or mischievous, departing from his online brand.

“I learned that the Democratic Party is not dead or dying there,” he added. “I met thousands of people across the country. I went to almost every single swing state, and I met people, young and old, who are excited to join our cause and do whatever they can to stop this president from enacting his agenda.”

Schlossberg joins a growing primary field for Nadler’s heavily Democratic district in which a primary win is tantamount to victory. Micah Lasher, a New York state assembly member and Nadler protégé, jumped into the race in September, along with Liam Elkind, a 26-year-old nonprofit founder. Nadler told The New York Times last month that any endorsement of a successor “is way down the road.”

If elected, Schlossberg could serve in Congress while his cousin holds a Cabinet position. As HHS secretary, RFK Jr. has departed radically from his uncle’s Democratic legacy, slashing health research funding, laying off hundreds of federal workers, and weakening vaccine policy. Schlossberg argued that fighting the Trump administration is not just about his family’s legacy, but about the “generations of Americans and New Yorkers who fought and sacrificed to build this country.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251111-jack-schlossberg-kennedy-congress-es-571c58.jpg",N,,2025-11-12 07:01:15.931091

Young people and those with higher education are the most optimistic.

The transition to a sustainable economy — based on renewable energy and clean technologies — have broad popular support in Brazil. According to research released by the Brazilian Agency for Industrial Development (ABDI) in partnership with Nexus, Three out of four Brazilians believe that the green economy will bring new jobs..

The survey indicates that 75% of respondents believe that the shift to a sustainable economic model will be accompanied by... generating job opportunities, while only 16% express pessimism regarding this scenario. The research therefore reinforces that the advancement of clean energy is seen not only as an environmental response, but also as a solid alternative for social and economic growth.

Positive outlook across all income levels.

According to the study, the perception that the green economy can boost the job market is stronger among higher-income individuals. Among those who receive above five minimum wages78% believe that the sustainable transition will create new jobs. The same percentage is observed among those who earn from two to five minimum wages, followed by 76% among those with income between one and two minimum wages.

Even among workers who receive up to a minimum wageHowever, optimism remains high: 67% say they expect an improvement in job opportunities. These numbers indicate that confidence in job growth is strong. renewable energy It is widespread across all social strata, albeit with varying degrees of intensity.

Education and professional qualifications influence perception.

The study also shows that education has a direct impact on the vision of the future of the green economy. Among Brazilians with complete higher education79% believe that the transition to a sustainable model will increase job creation. Among those who completed the... high school, 78% share this opinion, while 68% of respondents with complete primary education They believe that the green economy will bring improvements to the job market.

To Ricardo CappelliAccording to the president of ABDI, the advancement of renewable energies will require more qualified and better-paid professionals.

""Therefore, it is natural that those with more education and income are better able to see the opportunities that this change can bring,"" he highlighted in an official statement.

The official's statement reinforces the importance of investing in technical and technological education to meet the growing demand for professionals prepared to work in the low-carbon economy.

Gender, age, and region also shape the optimism of Brazilians.

The research shows striking differences in perception between demographic groups. Men 59% believe more in the creation of new jobs through the green economy than women (49%).

Age also influences perspectives on the topic. younger, between 16 and 24 years, are the most optimistic: 62% believe that the renewable energy New opportunities will open up. The same pattern holds true among people of 25 the 40 years (59%). Among the 41 and 59 years, the confidence rate falls to 49%, and among the over 60 years, it reaches 46%.

Terry McAuliffe has joined Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future as a co-chair to promote natural gas as a route to long-term energy reliability as renewable energy sources are built out, the organization announced Tuesday.

The organization promotes moving away from coal burning plants and using natural gas to reliably support solar and wind power generation. Touted as advocates for an “all of the above” energy profile, the group is expanding their reach into the commonwealth to promote gas power alongside renewable energy in hopes to bring down utility bills while cutting emissions, despite the commonwealth’s plan to eventually eliminate fossil fuels.

“As a Virginian who knows the importance of natural gas to my Commonwealth’s economy, I believe that we must come together to secure a reliable and affordable energy future,” McAuliffe said in a statement.

McAuliffe will lead the organization with former Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, former U.S. Reps. Kendrick Meek of Florida and Tim Ryan of Ohio and former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter.

The group points to studies that suggest transitioning to 100% renewable energy will be cost prohibitive and meeting peak demand for energy will prove a challenge. Natural gas in conjunction with renewable sources will allow the demand to be met at a reasonable cost, the group has said.

Reporting by the Guardian and Floodlight show that Natural Allies is backed by fossil fuel companies to appeal to young, liberal, non-White constituents. Their mission is to focus on how gas is “cleaner” than coal, yet fossil fuels remain a major driver in climate change.

Ryan said this strategy “can show Democrats they don’t have to choose between environmental progress and economic reality. We can lead on both fronts.” Environmental groups believe the messaging from the group is “greenwashing” the impacts of gas power on the climate.

Natural Allies states that they work with lawmakers to educate them on how they can marry gas power and renewable energy to meet their states’ needs. The group is largely focused on Virginia, New York, and New Jersey and stresses the significantly lower carbon emissions that natural gas emits compared to coal fired plants.

In Chesterfield, that is a common argument made in support of the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a proposed gas peaking plant to be built on the site of a former coal plant. Hundreds of residents in the area have been fiercely opposing the plant and say they want to prevent additional pollutants being released into the surrounding communities.

Still, Natural Allies’ website reads that “Without natural gas, higher-emitting fuels like coal and oil would be needed to keep lights on. Additionally, rising energy costs will disproportionately impact vulnerable households — worsening health, education, and economic outcomes.”

McAuliffe served as Governor of Virginia from 2014-2018, before the Virginia Clean Economy Act passed in 2020 – which mandates utilities retire gas powered plants by 2050. Virginia is also one of the largest energy importers in the country and is facing a demand crisis with hundreds of power thirsty data centers on the grid and more expected.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/mcauliffe-campaign-stop-richmond-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 11:07:11.643747

The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act.
Bennet and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted against the measure because it “did nothing” to extend the tax credits expiring at the end of the year, Bennet said.
He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S.
The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said.","After the Senate passed a stopgap funding bill that does not include extended Affordable Care Act tax credits, U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet is not confident that a future floor vote in the Senate will lead to an extension.

“I don’t have confidence about how that vote is going to turn out,” Bennet said in a press call Tuesday. “I don’t expect any Republicans in the Senate to change their vote, and I don’t expect the House to try to pass that bill. We could end up being surprised by that, but I wouldn’t hold out hope for that.”

The U.S. Senate voted 60-40 Monday on a stopgap spending bill that will reopen and fund the federal government through Jan. 30 following the longest shutdown in U.S. history. Members of the House of Representatives began traveling back to Washington, D.C. this week, as the chamber will need to pass the Senate-approved measure before the government will reopen.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats a floor vote on an extension of the tax credits will occur in December, part of a deal struck with seven Democrats and one independent to advance the spending bill, despite it not including an extension of enhanced premium tax credits to support Americans who purchase health insurance through the individual marketplace.

The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. In the absence of those enhanced federal subsidies, the average cost to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace, will more than double next year.

Bennet and U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, both Colorado Democrats, voted against the measure because it “did nothing” to extend the tax credits expiring at the end of the year, Bennet said. He said he thinks the Democrats who voted to pass the stopgap measure made a judgement that the downsides of continuing the shutdown overrode the benefits.

“I obviously didn’t share that judgment, but that was their judgment,” Bennet said.

While he is “deeply disappointed” with the outcome in the Senate, Bennet, who is running for Colorado governor in 2026, said he will continue to push for an extension of the tax credits as well as broader reform of the country’s health care system. He is “recommitted more than ever” to advocating for a universal health care system in the U.S.

The shutdown was not a waste of time because “fighting for Americans’ health care is not a waste of time,” Bennet said. But he said there is no plan B to help Coloradans facing higher insurance premium costs.

“For months, we urged President (Donald) Trump and Republicans to come to the table and extend the tax credits — which are already existing law and simply need to be extended — to give families a little bit breathing room, to make healthcare a little bit more affordable, and they’ve refused,” Bennet said.

Bennet declined to say if he still supports Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who has faced calls from progressive groups and some Democratic House members to step down from leadership after failing to hold his caucus together in the shutdown fight.

Americans will make the judgement that Democrats continue to fight for affordable healthcare while Republicans make it more expensive, Bennet said, as Republicans have fought against the Affordable Care Act since it was first introduced.

“We now know that we will never have an improved health care system as long as Donald Trump is our president and we have a majority of Republicans in the House and the Senate,” Bennet said.

Many major federal government operations have been shut down since Oct. 1. The Trump administration laid off many federal workers during the shutdown, a move that will be reversed under the Senate-approved measure. Bennet said his office will work to reach out and make sure workers who were laid off in Colorado know that they could be reinstated.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-11-at-4.24.05 PM-2048x1309.png,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:18.525390

Q: What advantages do U.S. automakers have?","Detroit’s automotive leaders are sounding alarms as Chinese automakers rapidly expand in the global electric vehicle (EV) market, highlighting both opportunities and challenges for the U.S. industry. While China’s automotive sector has surged under extensive state support, U.S. executives insist that adopting similar practices is not a feasible or desirable path.

Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley described Chinese EV companies, including BYD Co. Ltd., which sells models under $10,000, as “an existential threat” to traditional U.S. manufacturers. However, he emphasized that American companies have distinct advantages in infrastructure, innovation, and workforce experience, which can help them maintain a competitive edge.

“Ford will always advocate for policies that level the playing field,” Farley told The Detroit News. “We’ve made progress in the U.S., but government support still lags behind the extensive subsidies and incentives offered by China.” Farley also noted growing bipartisan support for policies aimed at strengthening U.S. automakers’ global competitiveness.

China’s dominance in automotive manufacturing is the result of decades of coordinated policy efforts. After the 1980s, foreign automakers entered China through joint ventures with domestic companies, often state-controlled, and the market only exceeded 2 million vehicle sales annually after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. By 2024, China’s annual vehicle sales topped 31 million, with EVs and plug-in hybrids now representing the majority of the market.

Experts point to China’s long-term industrial planning, particularly the 2015 “Made in China 2025” initiative, as a critical factor in the country’s sustained growth. According to Bill Russo, CEO of Automobility Ltd., “China’s consistency in policy and industrial direction gives it a significant advantage over the U.S., where regulations and incentives often fluctuate with political changes.”

Chinese EV manufacturers have benefitted from at least $230 billion in subsidies between 2009 and 2023, not including regional incentives or support for battery production and infrastructure. These subsidies, combined with low-cost labor and rapid automation, allow companies to price vehicles aggressively, fueling intense domestic competition often referred to as “involution.” While some companies, such as BYD, have seen net income declines due to the competitive market, government interventions aim to stabilize pricing and shift focus toward innovation and vehicle features.

U.S. automakers are adapting to these pressures. Ford has launched its Universal Electric Vehicle (UEV) platform, aiming to produce a midsize EV truck priced around $30,000 at the Louisville Assembly Plant by 2027. The company seeks to match Chinese production costs while maintaining U.S. labor standards and sustainability practices. Similarly, Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe noted that while Chinese firms benefit from subsidies and low-cost labor, their manufacturing methods and technology are not inherently superior to U.S. standards.

Concerns over intellectual property, supply chains, and national security are also shaping U.S. strategies. China controls large segments of critical materials such as rare earths and EV battery production, prompting U.S. policymakers and companies to prioritize domestic sourcing and innovation to protect competitive advantages.

Despite these challenges, the U.S. automotive industry retains significant strengths, including a highly skilled workforce, strong university-industry collaboration, established consumer loyalty, and experience in large-scale manufacturing. Experts argue that leveraging these assets while investing in EV technology, supply chains, and partnerships can allow American automakers to compete globally without replicating China’s intensive and often ethically problematic practices.

As the EV race accelerates, executives like Farley and analysts warn that the stakes for U.S. manufacturers could not be higher. “We’re in a global competition for manufacturing dominance,” Farley said. “China wants every one of our jobs, and we need to respond strategically without compromising our values or workforce standards.”

FAQ

Q: Why are Chinese automakers a threat to U.S. companies?

A: Chinese EV manufacturers benefit from extensive subsidies, low-cost labor, and government-backed industrial policies, allowing them to produce vehicles at lower prices and gain global market share.

Q: Can U.S. automakers match Chinese prices?

A: U.S. companies like Ford and Rivian aim to reduce costs through advanced production platforms, economies of scale, and innovation, but direct cost parity is challenging without compromising labor and ethical standards.

Q: What advantages do U.S. automakers have?

A: Legacy infrastructure, experienced workforce, consumer trust, and research collaborations with universities give U.S. manufacturers a competitive edge in quality, safety, and innovation.

Q: How is the U.S. government supporting automakers?

A: Policies include EV tax incentives, tariffs on imports, domestic supply chain support, and regulations to protect intellectual property and industrial independence.",https://crispng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1020.jpeg,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:58.277256

Nat Bullard (15:38.04) But we’ll see that much equivalent instantaneous storage capability deployed probably by the same time that the Texas Energy Fund plants have been built.
When the Texas Energy Fund assets are fully commissioned at whatever price point it is, what market are they competing in?","This is part 2 of my conversation with Nat Bullard. Check out Part 1 here:

We talk a lot about the grid of the future. The truth is, that future is already showing up in Texas.

Batteries are being built at record pace, data centers are chasing cheap and reliable power, and Texans are adding gigawatts worth of backup systems in homes, schools, and factories.

I sat down with energy analyst Nat Bullard to ask a simple question: if we look at what is actually being built — not the rhetorical arguments happening online, but what is actually happening around the world — where are energy systems headed?

We started with a comparison of batteries and gas peakers. Batteries respond in milliseconds, don’t rely on fuel deliveries during a freeze, and can make money all day providing grid services between scarcity events. Increasingly, duration is less of an issue as prices fall.

As Nat reminded us, during Winter Storm Uri it was “largely things in the thermal fleet” that failed. Winterizing batteries is likely much less onerous and complicated than winterizing gas plants.

Behind-the-meter systems are also booming. One- to ten-megawatt batteries can turn schools or factories into mini-resilience hubs. If Texas keeps adding storage at this pace, we could end up with the equivalent of dozens of peaker plants—only more responsive and decentralized.

Share

Nat concluded with a description of his family as a mix of, a ground source heat heat pump, a mini split, and a Franklin stove. A small hybrid system built to ride out different conditions.

That is a good picture of where ERCOT is headed: a mix of gas and batteries, large wires and local resources, data centers and smart devices. The question is whether we design structures to speed up that hybrid grid on purpose or stumble along and end up there eventually anyway. The first path costs a lot less.

The more we learn from what’s actually happening — the focus of Nat’s excellent annual decarbonization presentation — the more cost effective our decisions will be for Texas.

Doug Lewin (00:06.422)

Welcome to the Energy Capital podcast. I’m your host, Doug Lewin, and welcome to part two of my conversation with Nat Bullard. Nat, as you heard last week, is the co-founder of Halcyon. He is also the one who puts together a fantastic energy transition and decarbonization presentation that comes out every January, which we talked about in this podcast. All around, one of the great experts on all things energy transition and decarbonization. I learned a ton from talking to Nat. I couldn’t let him go after the usual 45 to 50 minutes. We ended up going long, so we split it into two parts. This is part two.

So that kind of leads me to where I wanted to go next. You obviously do a whole lot of tracking of batteries. We’ve been talking about electric vehicles a lot. Obviously batteries first started their performance improvement and cost declines because of their use in computers and phones. But now we’re seeing them go into cars on a mass scale and now onto the grid in a really mass scale. I mean, how do you think about that as far as the price comparisons for batteries, particularly gas peakers? Combined cycle, I would almost put in a little bit of a different category because you’re talking more about something that’s going to have a much higher utilization. These days, I think there weren’t a lot being built. There were very few being built, particularly in Texas, but I think just about anywhere with data centers, I think we’ll see some more built.

But still in Texas, for instance, in the Texas Energy Fund—this is obviously the subsidy program the Texas legislature put in place a couple of years ago, $7.2 billion in subsidies for gas plants—something like 80% of the projects that applied and were chosen, I think it actually is closer to 85%, were peaker plants. And that’s because we do have an energy-only market. Like you said, in a market, people respond to incentives. The incentives are for short bursts of very high prices. And when you start to stack the peakers up against batteries, and of course the old thing was, you can only go an hour or two, an hour or two is enough for 90, 95% of the high prices in the market. And for the rest, now we’re starting to get to where batteries are going to four or five, six, even longer hour durations. So how do you think about both the price comparison and then the attributes? How do you think differently about the attributes of a peaker versus a battery? Are they really doing the same thing?

Nat Bullard (03:13.294)

What’s so funny—we had this four-hour standard, more or less. And what’s fascinating about that to me is that is largely an artifact of regulation, not of anything technical. In California back in the day, all you would get paid for was four hours worth of storage. So guess what? Everybody optimizes around this artificially binding constraint that I think we’re starting to see people move past. Again, energy-only market—if there was any place that is going to be ready to do more, or for that matter, to do less, it would be Texas. And also to combine things. When I talk to the biggest of the developers, what their view is, is to meet, let’s say a 500-megawatt load for a data center, the quickest path, the critical path is probably going to be mostly renewable electrons. And within that almost entirely, probably solar, a bunch of batteries. And then you have a combustion turbine to serve the rest of the purpose, but it comes in kind of after the purpose served, obviously, by the generation, but also by the storage.

And that kind of stack is the one that seems to be moving the quickest, probably at the lowest cost, and probably the best fit for anybody who’s out there operating. It’s also the one in the future that, if you want to think about future-proofing it, you’re not talking about having to rip out 600 megawatts of solar and 3,000 megawatt-hours of batteries or whatever you might be doing. You’re talking about keeping those, improving them with software, with new hardware, and then altering the final step at the end. If you were to make this a zero-carbon or zero-net-emissions in the long run, maybe the combustion turbine is running on hydrogen. Maybe you’re doing some kind of durable binding, verified carbon removal to cover the cost of the emissions that are there.

So I guess my way of thinking is to be a bit more ecumenical about all of this and also watch what the smartest people who build stuff are already doing, watch how they’re going about it and thinking about doing this and viewing these things as generally part of a portfolio approach as opposed to either “if this then that” or an “either/or” approach. Not like if I’m doing this I therefore have to do that, but I’m doing that because it makes the most sense and not I’m doing this or I’m doing only that. Now there are constraints elsewhere. Again, Texas is a unique market where if you have the land and the wherewithal to go build a 500-megawatt data center, you probably can locate the land and have the wherewithal to do a similar amount of power generation. It is less the case in, say, Pennsylvania or in Maryland. So it’s going to be different elsewhere, but you all have a unique market down there for this kind of thing.

Doug Lewin (05:51.948)

Yeah, it’s incredibly challenging here too, but I think it is more doable than in those other places. I also think that there is too much kind of either/or. I think there’s actually benefits to having both on the system—gas peakers and batteries. Obviously batteries, whatever the duration is, they are duration-limited at some point. They’re going to run out. Now the sun will come back up and charge them or wind blows and charges them or turn the gas plant on and charge them, if you have enough power to do that. And we also get times when the gas plants aren’t working, particularly in extreme cold. We’ve had severe problems with that. Having a battery that can operate while you’re getting people to the site to figure out what’s going on with the gas plant to get it working, right? Or getting that gas plant turned on so the battery can recharge. There’s actually, I think, a bit of a symbiosis there.

And from the emissions perspective, if gas peakers allow you to displace other much more higher emitting baseload plants and still have the capabilities of those thermal units, you may not get your system to zero, but if you get it damn close, because we’re nowhere close to zero right now. So like, yeah, it’ll still be progress.

Nat Bullard (07:10.252)

That’s right. The best renewable developers I know are relentlessly practical people. I would argue that power developers in general are relentlessly practical, but renewable developers, maybe I should uplevel a little bit, are ruthlessly practical. And if this is going to be the path to market, then that makes most sense. As a quick thought experiment, when you mentioned about batteries, batteries operating until you can go turn on your combustion turbine is fascinating, right? If you think about during Winter Storm Uri, what assets had seized up was largely things in the thermal fleet that had seized up and were not able to provide this, that, and the other services at that time. If you’re a new battery, winterizing it is probably more straightforward than winterizing an existing thermal plant.

I remember at that moment, because I still had access to all this North America-wide data, during Winter Storm Uri, people were like, does this mean gas plants don’t work? And I said, let’s take a quick look at Saskatchewan right now, which is at the heart of the polar vortex that has dipped down to Texas. And it was like well below zero degrees Fahrenheit and everything’s running. But that’s because that’s within the normal design parameters. So a lot of this is thinking about how are we going to parameterize our future? And it’s a lot easier to parameterize brand new assets for something different than those that are already existing.

So I appreciate your practicality in thinking about this. I know that developers think that way. I know that given the capability that all grid operators want to think that way too. So let’s watch closely to see in an energy-only and competitive market, what moves fastest, what moves first, what has the most flexibility, literal and figurative, what’s the most supple in terms of how the capital markets are going to treat it, what has the most supply, what can provide the most capacity, you name it. All of these things, I think, will become more clear and less ideological one way or another over time.

Doug Lewin (09:11.342)

I want to ask you also just what you’re seeing. I don’t know how much you’re tracking this, but residential battery—we’re recording on October the eighth and today Base Power in Texas announced they just raised their Series C of a billion dollars. And by the time this podcast comes out, there’ll be another one out where Zach Dell was on a panel that I’d moderated at Gulf Coast Power Association, where he said they’re doing 20 megawatts per month at this point. It’s a small company on kind of a growth trajectory. And that’s just one company, right? Tesla’s doing batteries. I mean, I want to test this against you. I am very, very bullish on distributed batteries. We’ve also seen, by the way, there is some good data on this. Maybe this will make it into your slideshow in January. I’ll send you this slide.

There is a slide that ERCOT has on distributed energy resources in Texas. The fastest growing segment in Texas—well, the bulk battery storage is growing—but on DERs is between one and 10 megawatt batteries. There’s developers all over ERCOT putting in 9.9s, because when you get above 10, you reach a certain threshold where you change your status and the way you interconnect. There’s just tons of these 9.9-megawatt batteries. So between garages and this one to 10 segment, which literally doubled from ‘23 to ‘24, I really think this is going to be a mega trend and one that is really, really good for the grid for the very things we were just talking about, these reliability and resiliency problems, having batteries scattered all over. Is that something you’re tracking? Have any thoughts or stats or anything like that on?

Nat Bullard (10:49.526)

At Halcyon, we’re tracking now—we just set up another subscription to cover this—is going to be looking at the grid-tied battery and energy storage systems. So those that, again, go through a kind of public certification and necessity process. The speed with which these things are happening is fascinating because it’s consumer-led. Obviously, policy and regulation informs it. But there are other dynamics at work. There are neighborly dynamics to it. As we know, if you’re the only house on the block that’s got power during another winter outage, your neighbors are going to notice. And hey, you’re going to invite your neighbors over to charge up.

My folks when they were still with us, when they had a farm in coastal Virginia and they had a gen set because hurricanes would come and knock things out for like a week at a time. And just as an anecdote, the only thing that they ran their gen set for was the chest freezer full of meat and fish that people would give them in exchange for cords of firewood. And so people will find a way to put power to use and do something with it and help each other out.

I would say that the one to 10 megawatt—was that the battery size that you quoted?

Doug Lewin (11:58.666)

Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Nat Bullard (12:00.814)

So again, listen, why is it 10 megawatts? No reason, except there’s a tripwire and regulatory above that at which you shall not pass. But I mean, I’ll give you something fascinating. So I was looking recently at some data from Australia, smaller in every way than Texas, and they have a new incentive for batteries. So Australia has installed just under 800 megawatt-hours of batteries residential only in two months under a new support mechanism. Like these things go really quick and you can watch how people optimize up to their limit. And what’s really cool was that they do it with smart providers who are ideally looking out for their best interests, but they do it according to their ability and according to their need, according to their financial ability and according to their need for stored power. And that’s really cool.

What other models are going to get built on top of that? I think is a really good question for us to be thinking about and to be asking. But also it’s one that we can observe. We’ll be able to see that as markets take off and start to ship more and do more. It’s funny, I can’t remember who it was. I was listening recently talking about vehicle to grid. I think it was on Shayle Kann’s podcast and the discussion was like, we should think about rebranding it from vehicle to grid to vehicle to home. Vehicle to grid—I’m supporting the abstraction of everybody. Vehicle to home—I am in a blackout, but I can watch telly. Like that’s different.

Doug Lewin (13:26.006)

Absolutely. And like you said, help your neighbors. I think that’s really—people want to do that kind of stuff. Some people will—there are people, I’m not doing that as long—if it came to it, of course you’d help your neighbors and you’d be happy to do it. I just actually recorded a podcast with Brett Biggart. He’s the CEO of Freedom Solar, which is the, or one of the largest installers in the state of Texas. And he said, attachment rate in Houston right now is 90%. So 90% of the solar installations they’re doing—for new systems, 90% of the systems they’re installing include storage at this point, which kind of makes sense, because if you’re in Houston and you just lived through Hurricane Beryl and you’re worried about the next hurricane, why would you get solar without storage? So I really do think we’re going to see this more.

Nat Bullard (14:10.22)

And you know, I’m also fascinated to think of this not just as an installation, but as the beginning of a relationship in the sense that’s not just a relationship with a vendor, but a relationship with how you think about power and the grid. Like if you’ve even done this, you were probably not going back and you’re going to have somebody come to you in four or five years, buying your old battery off of you and getting you twice as much storage for the last money or whatever it might be. There’s a lot of different ways we could cut this. But for people to come in and be like, do you want to get much more for the same dollars or do you want to pay less and get the same as you’re getting right now? Like there will be a lot of things that come in here and there’ll be a lot of innovation in terms of getting these things to market for everybody. And let’s see what happens.

It’ll be done, I think, in a—it’s definitely not permissionless because you literally need permission to do this—but it will be done in a much more literally distributed fashion than the Texas Energy Fund. This isn’t the Texas Energy Fund approving $7 billion that goes out to what, no more than 30 entities. How many total plants are gonna draw funding from the Texas Energy Fund?

Doug Lewin (15:22.798)

That’s a good question. I think it’s 15 to 20 or something like that. Yeah, right. The sizes vary as some of them drop out and others get in, but we’ve seen some as big as a gigawatt, some as small as 100 megawatts. I think it’s like, because they’re trying to get 10 gigawatts, it’s probably about 15 to 20.

Nat Bullard (15:38.04)

But we’ll see that much equivalent instantaneous storage capability deployed probably by the same time that the Texas Energy Fund plants have been built. And into what market? This is another great question for those of you who are thinking from a market’s perspective. When the Texas Energy Fund assets are fully commissioned at whatever price point it is, what market are they competing in? Are they competing in a market that’s installing a gigawatt-hour of distributed storage a month in Texas? It’s entirely within the possibility that that will be happening four or five years’ time. And then what? Right?

One of the things that you do such a good job of, and I would hope to be able to do, is ask the next question for people, which is if you’re in the combined cycle business in Texas, are you watching what the Base Powers of the world, the Freedom Solars of the world are doing when they’re watching battery installation or their attachment rates because an electron is an electron. Obviously there’s plenty of other qualitative things that come into it, but it’s really worth keeping an eye out on this stuff as it goes.

Doug Lewin (16:34.734)

It absolutely is. All right. So you, if I’m not mistaken, you started your career as a solar analyst, right? At NEF?

Nat Bullard (16:41.5)

I did.

Doug Lewin (16:42.5)

So solar, obviously we’re in a moment right now as one of your slides showed, I think 600 gigawatts of solar installed in 2024. Is that about right? It looks like we’re probably trending higher. Chinese capacity, again, one of your slides crested over a terawatt. I believe last year or maybe in 2023 they have a terawatt of capacity that they could produce. That is astounding. I think most of the audience probably knows this, but just to be sure to put that in perspective, the entire installed base of the United States of America is about 1.2 terawatts. So the Chinese could produce that entire amount in a given year. So when you’re talking earlier about exporting to Africa and other places, right? Latin America, Southeast Asia, et cetera, they’ve got plenty of capacity to do that.

Let’s talk a little bit about the outlook for solar. Are we going to reach a point where we’re like, okay, yeah, 600 gigawatts, 800 gigawatts, like that’s where it’s going to stop? Or do you see that that kind of growth is going to continue as we pick up with data center load growth and that kind of thing?

Nat Bullard (17:47.158)

It is a fascinating technology that I think confounds other ways of thinking by analogy. And you just have to sort of YOLO it and think about the incentive of building for the manufacturing side, Red Queen style. You’ve got to run to stand still. You’re always competing against more efficient plant, more efficient models. Your equipment depreciates very quickly. So there’s no such thing as like a 15-year-old solar manufacturing line that I know of that anybody would pay anybody for. So everybody’s doing more constantly. There’s always an urge to sort of tap these companies down so that they can make more money. It never seems to work in a durable fashion, but like the upstream issues of solar manufacturing are meaningless to the downstream advantages of anybody trying to buy and install and build comfortably within capability that we’re shipping a terawatt of PV modules every year, which would account for, currently there would be like multiple single-digit percent of total electricity demand every year being added from just solar electrons.

The question is, to my mind, less how much of that can be built and more what’s the rest of demand going to be? And how much demand inception is there going to be by this? Like if I think about all these exports to sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, that’s providing electricity that didn’t previously exist. It’s not displacing demand for electrons. It is potentially displacing potential future demand for thermally generated electrons, but it’s not displacing some existing demand. That’s only happening in places that have a grid. That’s more of an example as your guest Bill McKibben talked about in Pakistan. So I just think we should watch carefully how the rest of the world is approaching this and think as well about how a system will begin to design itself around the kind of native conditions of very, very low cost, but variable as available electrons with this generation profile and just lay that in. This is a truth. And now what?

Either what are you going to do to match your demand to that supply or what are you going to do to mitigate it? What are you going to do to smooth it, store it? How are people going to sort of configure themselves around that? And that’s where flexibility on the demand side is to me, the more interesting question for the future than it is. How much solar are we going to manufacture? That’s a question that is honestly, it’s almost like hilarious. Like it’s fever dream stuff for me as an analyst almost two decades ago, right? The IEA would come out and be like, there’s no problem meeting that narrowly defined net zero goals of solar already to the middle of the century, because there’s just so much being made and there’s so much capacity. Like you just have to sort of take that as a given and then start to think more creatively and constructively about every other thing that happens to outstrip that.

Doug Lewin (20:48.238)

Totally. I think that’s exactly right. And I think also your point about Africa is a really good one, right? And again, you have this slide of 10 or 12 different African countries and some of them as much as 57% of their power is coming from—these are countries that—and this is one of the things that drives me crazy about some of the crowd that is pro-fossil fuel and anti-everything else. I don’t mind people that are pro-fossil fuel. I do mind people that think that somehow emissions and pollution just aren’t a problem. Like even if you didn’t believe in climate change, we’ll put that aside. There’s pollution that obviously impacts human health from fossil fuels, and we should at least take that into account.

But the people that are just pro-fossil fuel and anti-everything else are like, if you hurt fossil fuel production, Africa will never get electrified. And I’m like, how long have we been producing fossil fuels? Stop kidding yourself that the United States or anybody else is going to fund the buildout of a macro grid. You’re going to build central station plants and you’re going to build high voltage transmission lines and you’re going to build an entire distribution system in Burkina Faso. No, you’re not. But you might put solar panels and batteries and LED light bulbs, just like the Pakistan example Bill McKibben gives, right? They’re literally—forget this about solar—they’re solar modules. They are modular. You could do one at a time and add to them. And the fact that it is producing power in concert with what is one of the most important energy uses for human health, which is air conditioning, which still a lot of the world does not have to any appreciable measure.

Like solar and air conditioning go so well together. And to think that somehow if we don’t fully develop fossil fuels, Burkina Faso is not going to get electricity. It’s insane. And it kind of drives me crazy. So I do think this is one of the places where solar will really stand out is really bringing power to billions of people around the world that just don’t really have it in any appreciable way.

Nat Bullard (23:03.872)

And one other thing to add on that, and it’s brought me back to my point about thinking about distributed storage in Texas is to ask the permission framework on which this happens. No one that’s importing solar modules from China to Zambia or to Mongolia is looking to whatever policy and politics-driven examples are happening elsewhere and saying, well, if this is being said in the United States, then I guess I shouldn’t do this. They don’t care. There’s essentially no overlap there whatsoever. And so another way to view this is that these are rhetorical discussions that we tend to have that are becoming increasingly academic.

And so it reminds me of the old joke about the French philosophers that that’s all well in practice, but how does it work in theory? Like this is sort of how these arguments are now starting to go. And so I would urge us all to be as observational as possible about all of this. And to also remember what is being observed and what is being adhered to elsewhere. Like, I don’t really think that there are a lot of solar module importers in Algeria who are following policy and politics-driven discussions elsewhere at the moment and using those as the basis for their business.

Doug Lewin (24:25.9)

Right. They’re just buying Chinese panels and batteries and electric vehicles as fast as they can.

Okay. So you talked about flexible demand. I want to talk about that next. And this might be a good last segment for this, coming back to where we started. The load projections for data centers, you have a great slide. I think this is the first time I saw this slide. I think Grid Strategies had a really good report that had something like this too, because I hadn’t seen quantified the data center demand in Texas, and you had a slide on this that in 2023 it was about 22 terawatt-hours. I would imagine in your next iteration of the slideshow, that number is going to be much, much higher.

And one of the things that is really interesting that is happening here right now, Nat, we talked earlier about the 85.5-gigawatt peak. That was in 2023. In 2024, it was a little less. It was like 85.1 or something. This year, throughout the summer in 2025, we were right at about 84. Now, it wasn’t as hot this summer as it was the last few, but it was still—people around here say it was a mild summer, but they’ve got recency bias. It was actually in the top third for hottest summers ever recorded compared to the last three years before that, which were all top six, not even top 6%, top six out of 150 years. It seemed cool.

So we’re seeing this lowering of the peak, but a significant increase of the minimums. Every single minimum this year is higher, and some of them, some months 20 to 25% higher. Some of that is driven by climate change, because even though it’s not as hot in summer, the nighttime lows aren’t as much. But a lot of that is being driven by data centers, and it’s being driven by flexible demand. So there’s flexible demand on the bulk side of data centers, crypto miners, those kinds of entities using power more off peak. I’d love for you to talk a little bit about the potential you see there, but then also that flexible demand on the smaller sites. We’ve already talked about residential batteries. That is like the ultimate flexible demand, right? You’re going to fill those batteries when there’s plenty of power, but we can also think about homes, if they have some minimum level of insulation at least as thermal batteries and actually moving demand around to create a system that has higher utilization, lower peaks, lower net peaks. How do you think about that? How are you tracking that? And yeah, what do you see as some of the trends in that space?

Nat Bullard (27:06.678)

I’m not tracking it much yet, but I’ll walk through my thought process on how I consider this, which is there’s no one who wants to go and set this up on their own. There’s also no one who wants to have no control over things. So there needs to be a really subtle, well-designed behavioral economics sort of modality here to have people saying like, yeah, use my home as one way or another, a thermal asset for the grid. Crypto mining—great. Like that’s a pretty clear incentive structure for people to be like, do this now, don’t do that then. Homes and consumers are a little bit more subtle, a little bit more fickle. Maybe it would be another way to say it. So I want to watch very closely to see what emerges that acknowledges that aspect of consumer nature. Right. How do you make it so people don’t feel like they’re getting surge priced, but they do want to opt out of something. How do people feel rewarded in a way that’s not just virtue signaling for doing something at the right time.

And you already alluded to it. How do you optimize other things around that? Well, if your house is a lot better insulated, then your thermal envelope is going to be better and your thermal battery capability, so to speak, is also going to be much better. Like if your house is essentially a leaky sieve, because it’s from the 1930s and it hasn’t been insulated, then you are going to pay a price for not cooling it at that moment. If it is insulated, then it’s much less of a big deal to you to go and do a ride through. This is why the classic old industrial and large commercial demand response was something like an industrial freezer, right? Things are chilled to well below zero degrees C. It’s not like a 30-minute ride through is going to make 80,000 pounds of beef rot instantly. Like there’s enough time for 30 minutes, whatever it might be for things to be okay.

You need a housing stock and a capability that’s better designed around that. That could be part of the package that goes into designing that to begin with, which is I’m not asking you to boil and bake here. What I’m asking you to do is in exchange for this, I’m also going to make sure that your house is more comfortable for everything. I do think this is a really important thing to consider. This is anecdotal data because I’ve seen it written about in multiple markets, but you have people in parts of the United States. It’s more common in Appalachia and in the mid-Atlantic who have an older home for which they have summer power bills higher than their mortgage. Like that’s not a state of affairs that we should be encountering. And how do we remedy that? It’s not just cheaper power. It’s a better thermal envelope. It’s a better business model to help shave the peak off for them or to pay people for not using it at certain moments.

But it’s very episodic. Not everybody’s like that, obviously. It can be very, very acute. But how do we, in a full stack, policy, regulation, society, behavior, business model, economics, finance, come together to make sure that we can meet all of those needs for everybody involved in a smart and quick and reliable way?

Doug Lewin (30:18.754)

That’s a huge question. Yeah, right? Look, it’s one that I’ve spent a long time on, I’m going to spend a lot more time on. You were talking about gigawatt-hour of batteries a month on the residential side. We could see that kind of scale. I also wonder if we can’t start to get to gigawatt scale of reduction of, for instance, winter peak in Texas. We’re worried about winters and Winter Storm Uri. We’ve got all this inefficient resistance heat. We know the heat pump technology is out there. I was really heartened in that conversation I had with the Freedom Solar CEO, Brett Biggart, that one of the ways he’s responding to the removal of the tax credits is he set up an HVAC company. Because he’s like, I have these relationships with people that have solar and storage. They probably have a really inefficient HVAC. Next time it breaks, I’d like to give them the high-efficiency heat pump.

If we can think about the integrated demand side, we can have a system that can take much more load growth. Again, not just data centers, it’s industrial electrification, transportation electrification, all of these things, which leads me to one other thing I did want to ask you about is one of the smartest people I’ve ever heard talk about energy. I am curious about how you think about primary energy. There’s been this big debate at the federal level around—it was Chris Wright, the secretary of energy said the other day, he doesn’t think in his lifetime we’ll ever get to 10% of global energy being solar. Now we were just talking about 600 gigawatts in 2024. He’s kind of playing a game there where he’s talking about primary energy as useful energy. Solar’s probably already pushing four or 5%, something like that. But this is where I think that the shift has to happen is we have to think about like, how do we use energy in the maximal possible way with as little waste as possible, then you’re really optimizing the economy.

Nat Bullard (32:12.568)

So the way that I think about that one is that the solar competition with primary energy is like, how good is it competing with 60% waste? How good is solar competing with mostly exhaust heat, rejected heat and emissions? To be less cheeky about it, what I think we’re likely to see is more and more things that are directly electrified by the final energy that is provided by solar and therefore changes the frame. So the good reliable modeling to think about the long future when it’s deeply decarbonized is that actually primary energy demand goes way down because you’re removing that waste heat rejection element of the equation. And you’re going to a world of even resistance heat in Texas that would be powered by solar directly. Like imagine it’s on your roof. You’ve got solar on the roof. You’ve got your battery. You have your even inefficient resistance baseboard.

What you do not have in there is the coal plant that’s maybe running at 30 to 35% efficient, all the transmission and distribution losses, all the conversion losses in the middle to then reconvert that into resistance heat. Like that’s something that is more cognitive at first than anything we need to think and imagine that that’s going to be the way that things go. But I would not bet against solar, particularly not in a lifetime fashion. That requires a suspension of disbelief in a way in the trend that was happening. It also is not using some very evidence-based imagination, I think, to think about what might be happening in the future and to be relatively neutral about all that kind of thing.

It’s a matter of what you’re competing with. And then as with any of these distributed technologies that get cheaper and better over time, not just what do they engage with at first and not just what do they displace. Well, what do they create? Like what different models are going to be created out of that process that changes the way that we think about this as the equivalent of thermal fired primary energy.

Doug Lewin (34:21.078)

Yeah. And on the piece of resistance heat, right? The bigger thing would be at night, right? When it’s really, really cold, you would have to then run your resistance heat with batteries where you would have some losses, but still far less than with fossil fuels. That’s of course partly why you’d want to have a heat pump because otherwise you’d have to size the battery to an absurdly high level. But your point remains, you’d have no waste.

Nat Bullard (34:45.235)

You know, my family farm’s frontier technology model for running the farm throughout very cold winters, ground source heat pump, one mini-split unit upstairs and a Franklin stove. Great.

Doug Lewin (34:58.853)

Yeah, that’s one way to do it. And it worked.

Nat Bullard (34:59.448)

The house was a little dry. Not going to lie to you. It was a rather low humidity house, but yes, price was right.

Doug Lewin (35:08.344)

There you go. All right, last thing. So earlier, I think at the beginning, I asked you one of those multi-layered three-part questions, and I don’t think we got to the third part, which is what’s coming in the 2026 slideshow? Drop a couple of nuggets to the audience of what they can look for that might be different in the 2026 slideshow.

Nat Bullard (35:27.682)

I’m not—if it’s going to be thinking about trade flows again, how that’s manifesting in markets outside the US. It will be thinking about pricing, how changes in electricity impacted pricing. I will be calling you up and asking you, Doug, what’s the very best ERCOT data set for me to pull in terms of volatility and prices here. I will do my best to look at other markets as I always do outside the US to try to help everybody see things as clearly as possible.

My one last thing I always hope is that I get a good clear view of the present moment. That’s my goal. That in and of itself, I think, helps us talk longer about the future. The challenge in thinking about the future is that a lot of people don’t even adequately understand the present moment. People are living in different, informationally living in a different present, not just a different future, but a different present. And how can I pull this in really quick? I had a couple of dinners in New York at Climate Week. Even people in the US are well informed. One of the arguments is like, look at India, India’s emissions are going to go crazy. I was like, India’s emissions from fossil fuels topped last year and were rather flat in the first six months of this year. Like I didn’t know that. It was like, well, I’m not saying you should have known it, but it’s something to know. Let’s put it that way.

I’m very accommodating in terms of what people know and don’t know because we all have areas of focus. We all have things we look at.

[4] Bronwyn Cumbo, ‘Australia is set to get more AI data centres.","The growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving profound transformation in global data infrastructure and energy demand. The integration of AI into a range of commercial and industrial products, from refrigerators to virtual assistants, is placing mounting pressure on both domestic and foreign energy networks. With global data centre demand projected to surge 165% by 2030, concerns around the adequacy of existing legal frameworks, energy access, and environmental sustainability have been raised.[1] This article will explore the significant energy demands of AI, the capacity for the NEM and national transmission infrastructure to adapt, and international responses to this evolving demand-side challenge.

What’s the issue with AI’s energy demands?

Data centres are already significant energy consumers, and the rapid uptake of artificial intelligence – particularly generative AI – is accelerating this trend. AI requires immense computational power, placing growing demands on both existing and new data centres. As AI products and services become further embedded in the economy, data centre energy consumption will continue to rise.

Globally, the scale of this demand is striking. For example, ChatGPT alone is estimated to use 39.98 GWh of electricity and 148.28 million litres of water daily for cooling.[2] Meeting the worldwide appetite for AI is projected to require $5.2 trillion in capital expenditure by 2030.[3]

In Australia, data centre development is accelerating. AI-intensive sectors such as finance and telecommunications are driving a substantial surge in demand for high-performance data infrastructure.[4] These facilities require uninterrupted, highly reliable electricity, placing disproportionate pressure on local energy distribution systems. Data centres already consume approximately 4–5% of Australia’s electricity,[5] with projections suggesting this could rise to 8% by 2030.[6]

As the scale and complexity of data centres expand, so too do the regulatory challenges surrounding AI deployment. In response, the Federal Government has introduced the Voluntary AI Safety Standards, encouraging companies to self-regulate across all stages of AI development and implementation.[7] While a positive step, the voluntary nature of these standards leaves room for inconsistency and non-compliance. Introducing mandatory regulations would likely be more effective in ensuring responsible, industry-wide adoption of AI and its supporting infrastructure.

Meeting AI’s growing energy demands will require major investment in both infrastructure and policy reform. Yet AI is evolving rapidly, outpacing the development of domestic and global energy systems. Without timely and consistent investment, energy prices may surge – ultimately leaving consumers to bear the cost of the AI revolution.

International responses

United States of America

The United States has adopted a multi-pronged strategy to manage rising AI-related energy demand, focusing on investment, regulation, and research. Through the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, the federal government is directing billions of dollars toward grid modernisation, clean energy expansion, and semiconductor manufacturing critical to AI development.[8] The Department of Energy is also conducting assessments on improving data centre efficiency and developing performance standards in light of growing AI workloads.[9] However, the continued viability of these federal programs remains uncertain under the Trump administration, which has expressed a desire to repeal the Biden-era AI and clean energy initiatives.[10] As a global hub for AI, the United States’ regulatory volatility will influence the industry’s future growth.

China

China’s energy generation development and policy has shifted significantly as AI becomes a cornerstone of the digital economy. China has responded to escalating AI energy demand by implementing its “Eastern Data, Western Computing” policy. This police relocates energy intensive computing centres to western provinces with abundant renewable resources.[11] Also, new data centres must meet stringent energy efficiency and carbon intensity benchmarks, with projects failing to comply denied approval. The policy is designed to balance regional development, reduce pressure on eastern urban grids (which trend toward higher residential concentration), and align AI infrastructure with China’s broader dual-carbon goals: peak emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060.[12]

Ireland

Ireland is a case study on AI regulation and infrastructural lag. The nation is facing an unprecedented surge in energy consumption from AI and data centre operations. In 2024, data centres accounted for 21% of the nation’s total electricity use, overtaking all urban residential consumption.[13] This rapid growth has raised concerns about energy affordability, grid reliability, and compliance with European climate targets. In response, Ireland’s energy regulator has proposed a policy requiring data centres to match their energy load with equivalent new power generation.[14] This approach shifts the burden of infrastructure expansion – across generation, transmission, and storage – onto developers, effectively making data centre approval contingent on securing additional supply.[15]

Looking Forward

The energy demands of AI are no longer a future challenge but a present and escalating reality. Countries at the forefront of AI adoption are beginning to experiment with policy tools to avoid grid instability, rising costs, and environmental backsliding. Internationally, a clear trend is emerging as governments shift responsibility for infrastructure upgrades onto data centre developers. While the regulatory mechanisms vary, the common goal is to integrate AI into energy systems without compromising grid security or climate targets.

In Australia, a more coherent, enforceable framework is necessary. Current state-federal fragmentation, coupled with voluntary AI guidelines, lacks the clarity and enforceability needed to support long-term planning. Looking ahead, policy reform will likely focus on mandatory emissions reporting, enhanced environmental approval standards, and greater integration of data centre load into national transmission planning. Australia may also consider following international models by linking new data centre approvals to infrastructure contributions or renewable procurement. If the energy transition is to remain viable in an AI-driven economy, legal frameworks will need to evolve just as quickly as the technologies they aim to govern.

In 2023, Petro pledged to stop approving new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal.
Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil.
Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says Guy Edwards, who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex.
He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil.","TAGANGA, Colombia – On Colombia's Caribbean coast, a fishing village lies in a cove where green hills meet the turquoise sea.

A few years ago, oil companies found natural gas off the coast and now plan to drill Colombia's deepest gas wells there.

It's been more than a century since Colombia began drilling for petroleum. But the country's president, Gustavo Petro, wants these wells off the coast to be among Colombia's last.

Petro is one of the world's most outspoken leaders on the need for urgent climate action. Key to his administration's climate agenda is transitioning the country away from fossil fuels, the single-biggest driver of global warming.

In 2023, Petro pledged to stop approving new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal. On the world stage, this was a big deal. Colombia is the biggest coal producer in South America and one of the region's largest oil producers. Scientists say that to reach global climate targets, some fossil fuel producers will have to leave oil, gas and coal in the ground. Stopping new fossil fuel exploration is a pivotal step.

Now the question is: how is Colombia's energy transition going?

When it comes to growing its renewable energy sector, the country has made progress, says Margarita Nieves Zárate, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, a research group. Meanwhile Colombia's government oil company, Ecopetrol, is continuing its multi-year strategy of diversifying away from oil.

But Colombia's energy transition has also faced obstacles - some external, and some of Petro's own making, says Ana Carolina González Espinosa, senior director at the nonprofit Natural Resource Governance Institute. While Colombia has become a global poster child for saying no to fossil fuels, it isn't such a simple story, González Espinosa says.

""I remember the international community, and especially the climate community, clapping,"" she says. ""But maybe they didn't look at all of the challenges that this government would have to overcome.""

""It is not a happy story, it is not a sad story, it's just a real story,"" she says.

Why Colombia is doing this

Many in Colombia's government see the transition away from fossil fuels not just as good for the climate, but as a prudent economic strategy.

Colombia is not a petrostate with extreme reliance on fossil fuels like its neighbor, Venezuela, is. It has manufacturing and tech industries, agriculture, and a growing tourism sector.

But the oil and coal industries are still critical sources of taxes and export revenues. Demand for fossil fuels is expected to fall over time with the global energy transition, and that poses serious risks for the country, according to a study from insurance broker WTW and the Universidad de los Andes. The study found that if Colombia is too slow in transitioning away from fossil fuels it could face lost economic output equivalent to around 27% of its GDP between now and 2050.

Also, Colombia's oil sector isn't very competitive compared to some regional neighbors, says Guy Edwards, who researches Colombia's energy transition at the University of Sussex. He points to Colombia's declining oil reserves, and how – even before Petro pledged not to award new oil and gas exploration contracts – the country wasn't seen as a great place to find oil. A recent oil industry bright spot was the major gas discovery in the Caribbean, but it's deep and expensive to develop.

"" If we don't think about how to diversify the economy,"" González Espinosa says, ""then we are going to be in trouble.""

Today Colombia's national oil company, Ecopetrol, is diversifying, says Julián Lemos, corporate vice president of strategy and new business at Ecopetrol.

The year before Petro took office, the company acquired an electricity transmission company. In recent years, they've acquired more solar and wind projects. And they're investing in geothermal energy, drilling deep into the earth to create electricity.

""The hydrocarbon business will remain as part of our company,"" Lemos says, ""but we will gradually increase the participation of businesses that are not related to crude oil, such as renewable power, transmission.""

""We need to, as a company, be prepared to lead the country in the transformation of our fuel system. And in the transformation of our energy supply matrix.""

Renewable progress and failures

A key part of Colombia's transition away from fossil fuels is growing the renewable energy sector. Much of that growth has come from solar, says Andrés Camacho, the former minister of mines and energy under Petro.

Solar made up around 9% of the country's total installed power capacity in 2024, according to data from XM, Colombia's electricity market operator. That's up from roughly 1.5% in 2022.

Petro's government has introduced something called ""energy communities,"" funding solar and battery projects for Colombian communities that lack regular electricity. The government is trying to attract international financing for some of these community-scale renewable projects. And the government recently streamlined the environmental licensing process for solar making it more efficient, says Manuel Schulte, chief executive of Colombian renewable developer Colibri Energy.

But Colombia's renewable energy sector has faced challenges. In some parts of Colombia the grid still isn't big enough to handle many of the new renewable projects. And many of Colombia's big wind, solar and transmission projects are on land belonging to indigenous communities. The government and private sector still haven't done enough to involve indigenous groups in planning, Nieves Zárate, the renewable energy researcher, says.

Struggles with local communities are among the reasons why some foreign investors have given up on renewable projects, particularly wind projects. The national oil company, Ecopetrol, has acquired some of these abandoned wind projects.

Losing the messaging fight

Petro's energy transition policies haven't been popular with many Colombians. According to Susana Muhamad, former environment minister in Petro's cabinet, the government often encountered the ""myth,"" she says, that the country's energy transition ""will be an economic hindrance.""

"" The opposite,"" Muhamad says. ""What we see is that making [an energy transition] that is planned will be economically beneficial.""

Edwards says a lot of opposition to Petro's energy transition agenda was stirred up in the Colombian press. His research finds several Colombian newspapers and magazines have mostly framed the pledge not to award new oil and gas contracts as ""disastrous for the Colombian economy.""

Still, González Espinosa thinks Petro's government fumbled the ball on messaging. She says the government didn't focus enough on the local benefits of the energy transition, like how it will help the Colombian economy, and the health advantages of moving away from fossil fuels.

"" They didn't resonate with the national audience,"" González Espinosa says in an email. ""It was all about climate and that argument is not always very easy to sell without connecting it to local realities.""

Looking to the future

Petro's term ends in 2026. Looming over next year's election is a question: Will Petro's policies around stopping fossil fuel expansion outlast his administration?

Colombia's president is a vocal opponent of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a type of oil and gas extraction. Many of the presidential candidates have indicated they'll authorize fracking. While Petro's government has put forward legislation in congress to ban fracking, they haven't been able to get it to a vote.

As for Petro's pledge to stop awarding new exploration contracts for oil, gas, and coal, Estefanny Pardo, mining attorney at Holland & Knight, says a right wing government could reverse it.

""The current government has made a mistake, which is that instead of processing everything as a law to be approved by the congress of the republic, they have issued their own decrees and resolutions that could be repealed or changed by the next government,"" Pardo says in Spanish.

An upcoming conference

Andrés Gómez is Latin America coordinator of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation treaty, an initiative to make a global treaty to phase out fossil fuels. Colombia was one of the first oil-producing countries to join the movement in 2023.

Modeled after treaties to stop nuclear proliferation and landmines, the goal is to create a binding international agreement to stop expanding fossil fuel production.

Next spring, before the country's presidential election, Colombia will host the first international conference for the phase-out of fossil fuels.

If the upcoming conference marks the formal beginning of the treaty-making process, Gómez says in Spanish the incoming Colombian government may still be interested in seeing it through.

""Steps are being taken that have never been taken before.""

At the same time, there is a growing need for inexpensive, clean energy.
Energy-efficient appliances like freezers, fans, and televisions that integrate seamlessly with Sun King’s solar systems, as well as smartphones, are among the many solar products and electronics that Sun King designs, installs, and finances.
Kenya is positioned as a major player in this new chapter, which is a historic development that connects solar energy distribution and local industrial development in Africa.","Kenya is now home to Sunking’s first African manufacturing facility. Sun King is one of the world’s leaders in solar off-grid energy. By localizing production, this action signifies a significant strategic change from merely distributing goods across the continent. It is being presented as a major boost to Africa’s clean energy ecosystem, industrial capacity, and local manufacturing.

Sun King was established in 2007 and provides homes and small businesses with solar kits and appliances, such as fans, lights, and televisions. One in five Kenyan households now own a SunKing product, according to the company, which claims to deliver over 330,000 solar kits per month throughout Africa, a notable increase from 10,000 in 2017.

The company’s solar systems will be effectively integrated with solar-powered smartphones and televisions that will be assembled at the new facility. With the potential to scale up as demand increases, it will be able to produce up to 700,000 units per year.

What was said

T. Patrick Walsh, Sun King’s co-founder and CEO, stated,

“This facility enables us to harness Africa’s talent and ingenuity while delivering affordable, high-quality products.”

The Nairobi plant will help shorten supply chains, lower logistics costs, and increase product accessibility, according to the company, which serves millions of customers in Asia and Africa. In order to bolster local supply and manufacturing networks, it intends to eventually open a second plant in Nigeria. The company wants to reduce its environmental effect and increase the value of local economies by moving production to Africa.

Wale Aboyade, the company’s senior vice-president for public policy and government relations, stated, “Our new facility in Kenya reflects Sun King’s long-term partnership with governments and communities to advance Africa’s manufacturing capacity.”

Sun King’s investment coincides with the continent’s growing need for reasonably priced, clean energy as well as rising investor interest in cleantech and climate-focused sectors.

The timing couldn’t be more vital. Despite only making up around 2% of the world’s manufacturing value at the moment, Africa’s population is expected to double by 2050. Inclusive economic growth requires the development of industries that create skilled jobs, and Sun King’s facilities are a significant step in that direction.

At the same time, there is a growing need for inexpensive, clean energy. One in five Kenyan households now receive Sun King’s products, and the company now distributes over 330,000 solar kits monthly throughout Africa, up from just 10,000 in 2017. The company already has almost 40,000 employees worldwide, with 99 percent of them working in Asia and Africa, demonstrating its strong ties to the areas it serves.

Energy-efficient appliances like freezers, fans, and televisions that integrate seamlessly with Sun King’s solar systems, as well as smartphones, are among the many solar products and electronics that Sun King designs, installs, and finances. Millions of homes and small businesses rely on these products for connectivity and clean power.

Conclusion

In the end, Sun King’s choice to produce in Africa is an indication of their faith in the continent’s capacity to sustain itself. The business is contributing to the development of a cleaner, more robust, and self-sufficient energy future for the region by manufacturing locally, educating its employees, and creating for African realities.

To sum up, this is more than just the opening of a new factory. Kenya is positioned as a major player in this new chapter, which is a historic development that connects solar energy distribution and local industrial development in Africa.",https://amebopreneur.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-6-e1762935987402.png,N,,2025-11-12 08:00:32.764976

Treating toxic waste is a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions; hence, increasing the cost of greenhouse gas emissions also makes treating toxic waste more expensive.
First, the facilities whose toxic emissions increased the most were those that relied on treating toxic waste after producing it.
Third, facilities increased toxic emissions the most for the least harmful chemicals—those least likely to invite increased scrutiny.","Researchers, however, have paid less attention to the impact of cap-and-trade programs on other environmental outcomes, such as toxic chemical emissions. This is a crucial oversight. California facilities subject to cap-and-trade increased toxic emissions by 75 percent on average between 2013 and 2018—the first five years of the program. This is a startling increase given that California has historically had some of the lowest levels of toxic emissions in the United States. No comparable increase occurred among facilities not subject to cap-and-trade in California or other states. Could cap-and-trade programs be causing firms to reprioritize their efforts away from reducing toxic chemical emissions toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thus improving one environmental outcome while worsening another?

We investigated this question by comparing California facilities subject to cap-and-trade with similar facilities in other states not subject to cap-and-trade. Our research uses detailed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) emissions data on 1,100 large US manufacturing facilities from 2010 to 2018. Our findings reveal that toxic emissions from facilities subject to cap-and-trade policies were about 26–42 percent higher on average in the five years after the introduction of the program than they would have been otherwise. Why? Treating toxic waste is a substantial source of greenhouse gas emissions; hence, increasing the cost of greenhouse gas emissions also makes treating toxic waste more expensive. As a result, cap-and-trade has inadvertently prompted firms to strategically cut back on their efforts to treat toxic waste, causing them to release more of it. Indeed, the more a facility reduced greenhouse gas emissions from its waste treatment processes after cap-and-trade was imposed, the more its toxic emissions increased.

Our research finds additional evidence that the increase in toxic emissions resulted from firms’ strategic choices. First, the facilities whose toxic emissions increased the most were those that relied on treating toxic waste after producing it. The smallest increases came from facilities that modified their manufacturing process to produce less toxic waste to begin with. Second, facilities that incurred recent EPA penalties for their toxic emissions increased their toxic emissions by less, presumably because these firms were trying to avoid additional penalties. Third, facilities increased toxic emissions the most for the least harmful chemicals—those least likely to invite increased scrutiny. Finally, even facilities not subject to cap-and-trade increased their toxic emissions if they were owned by firms with other facilities that were subject to the program. These observations suggest that firms are strategically choosing to increase toxic emissions at the corporate level.

Overall, our study shows that a major policy initiative meant to combat climate change has had the unintended consequence of increasing toxic emissions by causing firms to cut back on their voluntary environmental efforts. These findings have important social implications. Increased levels of toxic emissions have been linked to several serious health conditions—including asthma, cancer, and infant mortality—as well as ecological damage and economic harm. Although California’s cap-and-trade program reduced greenhouse gas emissions, the sharp increase in toxic emissions may pose a higher risk to California residents. Our study thus highlights the need for a more holistic approach when designing environmental regulations, one that considers the connections between different environmental goals.",https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/styles/optimized/public/2022-04/climate-change-2.jpg?itok=riOdvZ0b,N,,2025-11-12 10:00:26.789466

Addressing a ceremony marking the 80th founding anniversary of the sector (1945–2025) and its first patriotic emulation congress held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment on November 12, the Party leader stated that developing agriculture and protecting natural resources and the environment are not merely economic responsibilities but also vital political, cultural, social, security, and defence missions.

The ceremony also saw the attendance of former Politburo member, former General Secretary Nong Duc Manh; former Politburo member, former State President Truong Tan Sang; Politburo member, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh; former Politburo member, former Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung; former Politburo members, former National Assembly Chairpersons Nguyen Sinh Hung and Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan; former Politburo members, former Standing members of the Secretariat Phan Dien and Tran Quoc Vuong, among others.

The Party chief commended the accomplishments made by the sector through emulation movements during the last five years, and throughout its 80-year history of formation and development. He attributed the achievements to the wisdom, dedication, and efforts of generations of officials, workers, farmers, intellectuals, and enterprises, as well as the leadership and guidance of the Party and the State.

However, he pointed out major and complex challenges that the sector is facing in economic development, resource management, and environmental protection, stressing that issues related to natural resources, the environment, and climate change, along with internal limitations in agriculture and rural areas, are becoming major bottlenecks hindering the nation’s goal of rapid and sustainable development.

These challenges go beyond economic and technical dimensions, touching on political, social, security, and ethical aspects of development, and therefore demanding strategic foresight along with bold and resolute actions in the new era, the General Secretary said.

He urged the sector to continue renewing its mindset and take stronger and more effective actions to contribute significantly to the success of the upcoming 14th National Party Congress and the nation’s prosperous and sustainable development.

General Secretary Lam called for strengthening institutions and policies to lay a strategic foundation for the new period; and accelerating the comprehensive review and full institutionalisation of the Party’s guidelines on agriculture, farmers, rural areas, resource management, environmental protection, and climate change into the legal framework.

He stressed the need to set up mechanisms for controlling power, ensuring transparency and openness in land planning, allocation, leasing, land-use conversion, and resource exploitation, while preventing group interests, corruption, and wastefulness.

Attention must be given to strictly managing, fairly regulating, and restoring river and lake ecosystems and groundwater; controlling pollution; proactively adapting to climate change; upgrading irrigation systems, dikes, and reservoirs; applying technology for flood, landslide, and salinity intrusion warnings; restoring protective and mangrove forests and conserving biodiversity; and fully addressing environmental pollution in large cities, industrial zones, craft villages, and river basins, he said.

Science, technology, innovation, digital transformation, and data must be key drivers of agriculture production, covering everything from crop and livestock breeding, biotechnology, and automation to traceability, logistics, and digital commerce, he said, noting that collaborative models linking scientists, businesses, cooperatives, and farmers should be promoted, while extension services must be practical and closely tied to fields and production facilities.

The Party chief requested a decisive resolution of administrative bottlenecks in land, resource, and environmental management, as well as challenges facing farmers and businesses in accessing capital, land, and scientific and technological resources.

He suggested restructuring the agricultural sector toward ecological, organic, and circular models with high-tech applications to generate higher added value; shifting agriculture from extensive growth to intensive development, focusing on quality, value addition, and brand building; developing national brands, expanding markets, and integrating more deeply into global agricultural value chains; and building model new-style rural ecosystems with comprehensive infrastructure, clean environment and civilized rural society.

He expressed his belief that the sector will continue to uphold its proud tradition, strongly renew mindset, take bold and effective actions, dare to innovate and take responsibility, and make the greatest possible contribution to the nation’s development.

The Party General Secretary called on all officials, public employees, workers in the sector, as well as scientists, entrepreneurs, cooperatives, and farmers nationwide to unite and innovate further, successfully achieving set goals and building the model of “Ecological agriculture – modern rural areas – civilised farmers” model.

At the event, the Party leader presented a First-class Labour Order to the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment for its GDP growth, as well as in recognition of its outstanding contributions to the nation’s socio-economic development.

On this occasion, Minister of Agriculture and Environment Tran Duc Thang launched a patriotic emulation movement, calling on all officials, public employees, and workers of the sector across the country to promote innovation and creativity, turn aspirations into concrete actions, towards accomplishing all tasks entrusted by the Party, State, and people./.",https://mediaen.vietnamplus.vn/images/f579a678cf9e90879541752073c26005d8fe7312e689c8acf02f7fa1571fefe9aadcc81920719f07bf6f07a5b8d3ae096d1811f5e396ffb309611b8337595828/agriculture.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-12 07:01:30.495283

By now, you've probably heard the rumor that Ford may be dropping the F-150 Lightning due to the EV credits evaporating and electric trucks occupying a relatively small corner of the already niche electric vehicle market in the US.","""I wouldn't mind driving an electric pickup, but they're so expensive!"" That's something you hear a lot, seeing as a Ford F-150 Lightning starts at an MSRP of $62,995 for the 2025 model year, and a Rivian R1T starts at $69,900, but an entry-level 400-horsepower combustion-powered F-150 can be had for just $37,290 for 2026, and a Tacoma starts at $32,145. If you need a practical, daily driver that can haul some furniture now and then, it's hard to justify spending twice the price just to go electric.

But here's the good news for people who haven't bought into the electric revolution just yet: these trucks depreciate as fast as a carton of milk. It seems like as soon as they're sold, they're ready to go for half their original price. That's a bummer if you're trying to trade a two-year-old Lightning in for something newer, but, if you're a patient buyer, the model could save you tens of thousands of dollars on a practically brand-new truck. Here's what you need to know if you're looking to make that work in your favor.

The Days Of Underpowered Electric Vehicles Are Over

You don't necessarily want to buy something just because it's selling for half its original price, right? Let's compare the specs of entry-level models.

You really can't go wrong with any one of these trucks when it comes to sheer performance specs. However, range is critically important if you're considering any long-haul towing. In the past, we've reported on the Cybertruck's range being cut nearly in half when towing a two-ton trailer, which accounts for way less than half of its maximum capacity. The Model X actually turned out to be the better tower, pulling the trailer around 256 miles.

A study shared by Fiver-O in the F-150 Lightning Forum compares the Rivian R1T to the Lightning, finding that they both lose plenty of range while towing a heavy load. However, the Lightning's available upgrades, such as ProTrailer Backup Assist, and its ability to utilize trip data and GPS planning to provide a more accurate range estimate, make it the easy choice if you're looking for a work truck. Meanwhile, the Silverado EV boasts the most impressive overall range among the entire lineup.

Electric Pickups Are Losing Around Half Their Value In The First Two Years

Vehicles are expected to lose a significant portion of their value immediately. However, a typical gas-powered F-150 is still worth more than 60% of its sale price after two years, and a Toyota Tundra takes over a decade to lose 50% of its value. Electric vehicles are lucky to retain that much after two years on the market. Here's how the leading battery-powered trucks stack up according to data from CarEdge and iSeeCars.

Please note that any projections beyond the first few years are based on current trends. None of these trucks has been on the market for all that long. Now, are any of these trucks likely to bounce back or hold steady at 40% or 50%? Stranger things have happened, but a lottery ticket would be a safer investment than betting on the long-term value retention of an electric pickup.

The Cybertruck may be the biggest surprise here, as it is the only one of these trucks projected to retain half its value after five years on the road. Meanwhile, the Lighting and the Silverado are the fastest depreciators of the bunch. The Silverado actually loses nearly half its value in the first year alone, selling for around 53% of its original price just one year after it rolls off the dealer's lot. The Lightning takes two years to get there, selling for 52.08% of its original value after two years on the road.

Can You Count On An Electric Pickup?

Note, for the following JD Power Quality & Reliability ratings, that JD Power does not have separate ratings for the Silverado EV and the F-150 Lightning at the moment. This means that the ratings listed here are for the respective nameplates overall, while the R1T and Cybertruck ratings are specifically for the R1T and the Cybertruck. The maintenance estimates come courtesy of CarEdge.

It can be challenging to ascertain reliability when a vehicle has only been on the market for a few years. According to AAA, the annual maintenance cost for an electric vehicle should average around $949, which is $330 less than AAA's estimate for a gas-powered vehicle.

The Cybertruck Has Its Issues, But So Do The Other Electric Pickups

Much has been made of the Cybertruck's issues when it comes to build quality. We've seen panels flying off on the highway and carwashes turning the trucks into expensive bricks. In Tesla's defense, a new Cybertruck is less likely to fall apart than an older model. But we're specifically looking to get a deal on a used model, so what good does that do us?

The other trucks on this list have also had their own share of embarrassing recalls. More than 29,000 Lightnings were recalled earlier this year for suspension problems. The Silverado EV has been recalled for malfunctions in the electronic stability control system, and Rivian had to recall around 28,000 units back to the shop in June for faulty turn signals.

Used Silverado EVs And F-150s Lightning Are The Most Affordable Electric Trucks, New Or Used

If you're looking to use depreciation to your advantage and get a great deal on a basically new pickup, the Silverado EV and the F-150 Lightning are the only reasonable choices on this list. These trucks both lose around half their MSRP value after just a couple years on the road, and they start at lower MSRPs than the Rivian R1T or the Cybertruck to begin with.

A 2023 Ford F-150 Lightning initially sold for a base MSRP of $49,995. According to CarEdge, that would put the current resale value at around $26,037. Kelley Blue Book estimates it a bit higher, at a fair market price of $31,968, assuming around 15,000 miles a year.

The Silverado EV, meanwhile, hasn't been around for long enough to take full advantage of depreciation. The oldest Silverado EV on the market is the 2024 model, and a lot of the data found on iSeeCars and CarEdge, as it pertains to depreciation, is theoretical, based on market projections. So we're still waiting for the first significant drop in sticker price.

The F-150 Lightning Is The Best Buy On The Used Market

The Ford F-150 Lightning ultimately wins our comparison almost by process of elimination. The Ford has been around long enough to have shed a significant amount of market value, and it's one of the most affordable models available, even if you're buying brand-new. Upon reviewing AutoTempest, we identified the following listings.

A 49,043-mile 2022 Lightning XLT is selling in Virginia for $26,999.

A 40,053-mile 2022 Lightning Pro is selling in Florida for $34,084.

A 32,195-mile Lightning Pro is selling in Washington for $34,998.

A 43,719-mile 2023 Lightning XLT is selling in New York for $34,900.

A 30,885-mile 2023 Lightning XLT is listed for sale in North Carolina for $36,450.

These listings are only provided as an example. There's no telling what will be available in your area when you're ready to run a search of your own. But these numbers should illustrate that those KBB and CarEdge estimates aren't just whistlin' Dixie.

By now, you've probably heard the rumor that Ford may be dropping the F-150 Lightning due to the EV credits evaporating and electric trucks occupying a relatively small corner of the already niche electric vehicle market in the US. There's always a chance that this could turn the existing F-150 Lightnings into collector's items, but we wouldn't count on it. When a vehicle is canceled for disappointing sales, the tendency is usually for the price to keep falling, so, at the very least, you don't need to worry about missing the boat when it comes to getting a great deal on a slightly-used F-150 Lightning.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cropped-f-150-lightning_lariat_rally-course_01.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-12 08:01:29.726846

A Repair Mindset: In a global economy that runs on consumption, products aren’t always built to last.
“Waste drives the economy, it turns out,” Mark Miodownik, a materials scientist and engineer at University College London, told me.
Miodownik said repair cafes in London have a similarly communal vibe.
Or can we be smart and come to our senses before we hit a disaster?” Miodownik thinks we can, and repair cafes are part of what’s fueling his belief.","Last Friday, a group gathered inside a building in East London, holding an unusual medley of used goods, from tattered teddy bears and old shoes to an elegant but broken vintage blender.

These people weren’t there to donate their weathered wares. They were there to resurrect them.

Welcome to the “Repair Café” at the University College London, an occasional event where locals can bring their damaged items to be fixed by a team of experts and engineers, free of charge. The project is part of a growing chain of more than 2,500 workshops popping up around the world to help reduce rampant consumption by building “a culture of care and repair,” according to the nonprofit Repair Café International Foundation, which launched in 2010.

As carbon-hungry consumer production and its subsequent waste surge to all-time highs, experts say that the concept can help curb pollution while promoting a more circular economy. But a few major barriers stand in the way of this repair revolution. Among the top threats? Free, one-day delivery.

A Repair Mindset: In a global economy that runs on consumption, products aren’t always built to last.

The rise of cheap, fast fashion has led to shorter life cycles for clothes, with items often lasting less than 10 wears before falling apart. Big technology companies, such as Apple and Microsoft, have been accused of and sued for deliberately designing phones or laptops with limited lifespans or that cannot support updates to spur consumers to buy newer models.

In certain cases, companies have created products with incredibly long lifespans, but discontinued them after realizing they generate less revenue because users don’t have to buy them as frequently. Light bulbs, for example. A discontinued incandescent bulb—nicknamed the Centennial Light—is still working more than 120 years later at a fire station in California (there is a livestream to prove it).

This consumerism has led to massive waste. Each year, billions of tons of discarded products end up in landfills around the world or overflow into the ocean and other fragile ecosystems.

“Waste drives the economy, it turns out,” Mark Miodownik, a materials scientist and engineer at University College London, told me. He helps run the college’s repair cafe events. “Of course, the downside of it is that it will reach physical limits of the planet to absorb all the waste, and we’re reaching them now, and we haven’t really taken care of that bit of the problem.”

To buck this consumerist culture, Amsterdam-based sustainability advocate Martine Postma organized the first official “Repair Cafe” in 2009. It has since grown into an international network of tinkerers who have expanded or iterated on the concept to fit their local communities. New York alone has nearly 70 cafes across the state, which host at least one event each year to help locals bring their beloved jewelry, home goods or technology back to life.

Suzie Fromer has spent three years as a coordinator at the nonprofit Sustainable Hudson Valley, which helps organize and run dozens of cafes in the region. She told me that at the nearly 160 cafe events held last year, volunteers fixed more than 7,400 items. Lamps are the most commonly brought items, but fixers have repaired everything from decorative vases to beloved doll houses.

“It changes your relationships to your things because you no longer see them as something that you’re bothered by and have to throw out. It’s something you can work with. … It’s an item that can be repaired, and it can last a long time,” Fromer said.

It isn’t a drop-off service; rather, people sit with the fixer to try to learn how they might be able to repair their own items in the future, which has helped build a sense of community at each event, she said. Sometimes there are emotional moments; for example, Fromer, a jewelry designer in her spare time, recently helped someone repair a necklace their uncle had given to them before he passed away.

Jewelry often “has value, you know, separate from its financial costs,” she said.

Miodownik said repair cafes in London have a similarly communal vibe. In fact, a 2024 report by his team found that repair activities such as cafes have broader mental health benefits, from skills development to social inclusion and wellbeing.

“There is a sort of rejection of the disposable culture, but you don’t feel that vibe in the room. It’s actually people just trying to resurrect these beloved objects,” Miodownik said. “I think the truth is that people aren’t coming thinking they’re going to go away with a lot of skills, but they are going to come away feeling supported and that they know people with the right skills, and that they might have something to offer, too.”

Right to Repair: Experts say a few major hurdles are preventing repair culture from dominating modern society.

For many products, such as clothes and appliances, buying a new product can often be cheaper than fixing the one you own. The convenience of free, rapid shipping also means that you are likely to get a new product faster than your old one can be fixed if the repair is more complicated—or there may not even be someone nearby with the expertise to fix it, Fromer said.

On top of this, some products, such as phones, cars and tractors, are produced in a way that prevents mechanics from accessing diagnostic tools or broken parts without taking it to the manufacturer. For example, repair advocates have pointed out that Apple AirPods are extremely difficult to disassemble and repair without damaging the casing, Vox reports. States including California, Colorado and Minnesota have passed “Right to Repair” legislation to protect consumers’ ability to fix or modify their purchases, but many states still lack these safeguards.

If the current rate of consumerism and waste continues, Miodownik said that at some point “we are going to hit a wall.”

“Carbon dioxide in the air is going up, plastic in the sea is going up, microplastics in our blood [are] going up. You just look at any of these metrics of our consumerist addiction, and that’s going to kill us,” he said. “There’s going to be a big wall and the question is, when is the big wall going to cause such destruction that people come to their senses? Or can we be smart and come to our senses before we hit a disaster?”

Miodownik thinks we can, and repair cafes are part of what’s fueling his belief.

“You see people’s delight in bringing these things back to life,” he said. “Their lives are just as rich having a repaired thing that’s old than if they bought something new.”

I asked if he practices what he preaches, and whether he had ever repaired the sweater he was wearing during our Zoom interview.

“I’m afraid that’s true,” he said with a laugh, holding it up to show off a stitch in the side.

More Top Climate News

An analysis by The Washington Post found that Democrats in the United States have largely pulled back from messaging around climate change in social media posts, podcast appearances and speeches. The reporting reveals that references to “climate change” peaked in August 2022 when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act under President Joe Biden. Now, the analysis found, Democrats are instead focusing more on energy and electricity costs.

“The pendulum is going to swing back, for sure,” Jason Bordoff at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University told The Post. “We know that the impacts of climate change are going to be quite bad, and I don’t think people can ignore those forever.”

The Senate passed a bill on Monday to end the longest government shutdown in history, which is now headed to the House for a final vote as soon as Wednesday. However, the delay has caused widespread damage to crucial government programs and the people who depend on them. One of the hardest hit has been the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps provide food for around 42 million Americans. While the program has been paused, Indigenous groups have emphasized the importance of traditional practices for hunting and farming to secure food and increase food sovereignty, Miacel Spotted Elk reports for Grist.

The United Nations’ 30th climate conference, COP30, is in full swing as representatives meet in Brazil to map out the next steps to lower greenhouse gas emissions and curb climate change. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is in attendance and has been taking shots at the Trump administration’s absence and recent tariffs on the host country, Reuters reports.

“We’re in Brazil, one of our great trading partners, one of the world’s great democracies. I mean, hell, home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with instead of giving the middle finger with 50 percent tariffs,” Newsom said at a global investors summit held on Monday in São Paulo.

“The bill, as it now stands, overrides the regulatory frameworks of several states, cancels the collective decisions of hemp consumers and destroys the livelihoods of hemp farmers,” Paul said on the floor ahead of the vote.
Many said they were caught by surprise when the funding bill text was unveiled on Sunday.
The industry is largely unregulated, they argue, and Congress in 2018 failed to distinguish between intoxicating and non-intoxicating hemp products.
The new language, McConnell said, will “keep the dangerous products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp industry for farmers.”","The Senate late Monday passed a funding package that would reopen the government and fund the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration. Tucked into the funding bill is a provision that would re-criminalize many of the intoxicating hemp-derived products that were legalized by the 2018 Farm Bill.

Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) waged a last-minute fight to try to keep the provision out, threatening to drag out the process of debating the underlying bill until he got a vote on an amendment to strip the language.

He got the vote on Monday; Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) were the only Republicans who voted in favor.

“The bill, as it now stands, overrides the regulatory frameworks of several states, cancels the collective decisions of hemp consumers and destroys the livelihoods of hemp farmers,” Paul said on the floor ahead of the vote. “And it couldn’t come at a worse time for America’s farmers. Times are tough for our farmers.”

The provision “prevents the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products,” according to a Senate Appropriations Committee summary.

The proposal was first included in the House’s funding bill for the Department of Agriculture, but it was removed from the Senate version over the summer following a disagreement between Paul and his fellow Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell.

Hemp industry representatives and lobbyists have spent months campaigning against the language. Many said they were caught by surprise when the funding bill text was unveiled on Sunday.

McConnell was a champion of legalizing hemp in the 2018 Farm Bill. But he’s since soured on what he says is a “loophole” that companies use to take legal amounts of THC (or tetrahydrocannabinol) from hemp and turn it into intoxicating substances.

The industry is largely unregulated, they argue, and Congress in 2018 failed to distinguish between intoxicating and non-intoxicating hemp products. As such, THC products are widely available for sale on store shelves.

The new language, McConnell said, will “keep the dangerous products out of the hands of children while preserving the hemp industry for farmers.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/64369d192cac14.03776818.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-12 08:58:58.300015

By Billy House

Long Island’s congressional delegation should show a unified, bipartisan front in convincing Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin against delaying enforcement of new limits to so-called ""forever chemicals"" in drinking water, environmentalists say.

""This is not a controversial issue. This is not a Republican or Democrat issue,"" said Adrienne Esposito, executive director of the Citizens Campaign for the Environment, based in Farmingdale. ""The issue of safe drinking water has always bridged the gap between political parties.""

Drawing controversy is the recent decision by the agency under Zeldin to postpone a deadline by two years, to 2031, for water utilities or public water systems to comply with new federal water standards for the targeted polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS.

That extended a previous 2029 deadline finalized during the administration of former President Joe Biden.

All four Nassau and Suffolk U.S. House members told Newsday Wednesday they're each fully behind efforts to deliver safer, cleaner drinking water solutions for Long Islanders. Some instances were provided of funding and technical assistance already secured to help water suppliers to add the necessary filtration and other equipment.

But there was little sign of a coordinated effort to get Zeldin to reverse the decision that will give utilities another two years to meet the new standards.

Rep. Tom Suozzi (D-Glen Cove) wrote a letter last week directly appealing to Zeldin, who previously represented Long Island's 1st Congressional District, on that issue.

Rob Hayes, with Environmental Advocates NY, said Nassau and Suffolk county residents have been ""bearing the brunt"" of a PFAS drinking water crisis in New York. He noted Zeldin was a congressman from Suffolk County, saying the Long Island congressional delegation is uniquely positioned to come together and get Zeldin to ""step up"" and do the right thing.

Esposito echoed that the four Long Island lawmakers should be working together to convince Zeldin.

""There is absolutely no reason to delay the public health need,"" she said.

Suozzi’s letter to Zeldin last week argued against the two-year compliance delay, noting studies — including from the National Institutes of Health — have found PFAS in drinking water is associated with a higher incidence of a variety of cancers.

The EPA’s press office acknowledged receipt of that letter, but on Wednesday

declined to comment further.

In a statement Wednesday, Suozzi said, ""I’ve made cleaning up the water on Long Island a priority because we all must.""

He ticked off several instances where he has succeeded in securing tens of millions of federal dollars for PFAS filtration projects and other efforts, and said, ""We need the EPA to make this a priority, too. I’m fighting on every front to get it done.""

Rep. Andrew Garbarino (R-Bayport), said in a statement, ""Ensuring Long Islanders have access to clean drinking water is one of my top priorities in Congress."" He added he will ""continue working with the EPA, the Suffolk County Executive, and the Suffolk County Water Authority to make sure our federal and local partners have the resources they need.""

But he did not say if he Zeldin should reverse course on the compliance deadline.

Freshman Rep. Laura Gillen (D-Rockville Centre), in Congress for just nine months, was more clear: ""Rolling back PFAS protections puts Long Island families’ health at risk. These cancer-causing ‘forever chemicals’ are already in our water, and delaying action will only put more people in danger.

""Administrator Zeldin should put protecting the health of Long Islanders and the American people first by ensuring our communities have safe, clean drinking water now,"" she said.

But Rep. Nick LaLota (R-Amityville), Zeldin's successor whose office secured millions of dollars worth of drinking-water safety and cleanup project funding jabbed, ""Democrats can’t have it both ways — claiming to care about clean water while voting last week to shut down the EPA and the entire government.""

He was referring to the current Republican and Democratic standoff over a bill to keep government funded past next Tuesday.

""I’ve delivered real clean drinking water dollars for Long Island families, while they’ve delivered only hypocrisy,"" he said of the Democrats.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b72eb5b8ab7222baffc8dbb/5b7f05ddcd8366e8f19436ec/6913ff4497f7b672128a27ea/1762918545133/News+Logo.jpg?format=1500w,N,,2025-11-12 10:00:31.547848

Coal power is steadily declining in Australia as renewables surge, owing primarily to market forces.","Australia’s power sector is steadily shifting away from coal and toward running on 100% renewable energy. Now the country is trying to ensure some of its biggest electricity users — aluminum smelters — aren’t left behind in the clean-energy transition.

The Australian government is developing a Green Aluminium Production Credit, or GAPC, to reduce the cost of using solar, wind, and energy storage to power the country’s four giant smelters. The AU$2 billion (US$1.3 billion) program is part of a larger federal industrial policy that aims to decarbonize Australia’s economy over the next decade.

“Australia is sending a signal that it wants this industry to stay,” said Marghanita Johnson, CEO of the Australian Aluminium Council. ​“Therefore, what do we need to do to keep the industry during this challenging transition?”

Smelters everywhere are power-hungry facilities. That’s because the process of converting raw materials into aluminum can require hundreds of megawatts of electricity running at near-constant rates. In Australia, a country of nearly 28 million people, the four smelters consume roughly 10% of the nation’s electricity and contribute about 4% of total greenhouse gas emissions.

As in many places, renewables are the country’s cheapest new electricity sources, and battery storage costs are plunging. But the fact that wind and solar power aren’t available around the clock means that smelters need to procure more total megawatts from multiple sources to make sure that, at any moment, they have enough capacity to operate, Johnson said.

Australia’s Department of Industry, Science and Resources is still finalizing the design of its GAPC. Generally, though, it will cover between 30% to 40% of the extra costs associated with using renewables to produce aluminum instead of conventional sources like coal and gas. The program will provide credits to aluminum producers for every metric ton of ​“green” aluminum they produce for up to 10 years, starting from the 2028-2029 financial year.

The initiative is part of an emerging movement by countries to subsidize or otherwise support domestic heavy industries as they work to decarbonize, said Chris Bataille, an adjunct research fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy.

He noted that, under the Biden administration, the United States had been considering developing tax credits to incentivize industrial manufacturers to use more renewable energy, though those discussions have sputtered under the second Trump administration. In China, meanwhile, the central government is investing more money into projects that reduce or replace coal use in sectors like steel, cement, and chemicals.

”This is going to be a big question going forward: How [can countries] get these big industries off of fossil fuels and onto using variable renewable power, and all the adaptations that are necessary?” Bataille said.

Aluminum smelters typically sign long-term contracts with utilities that lock in the price of electricity the companies pay over years or decades. In Australia, those contracts are coming to an end, and as manufacturers look to sign new deals, they’re finding themselves in a dramatically different energy market, Johnson said.

Today, three of Australia’s smelters get most of their electricity from coal-fired power plants: Rio Tinto’s Boyne Island facility in Queensland, Alcoa’s Portland plant in Victoria, and Tomago Aluminium’s smelter in New South Wales. Only Rio Tinto’s Bell Bay smelter in Tasmania runs predominantly on hydropower.

Coal power is steadily declining in Australia as renewables surge, owing primarily to market forces. About 90% of the aging coal fleet will likely be gone by 2035, and the rest could shutter later that decade, the head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, which oversees the nation’s power markets, recently told Canary Media’s Julian Spector. (Australia banned nuclear energy decades ago, so it’s not an option.)

For now, coal still accounts for 46% of Australia’s annual electricity production, according to the International Energy Agency. Renewables contribute about 35%, though existing projects aren’t necessarily located near smelters that need them.

Rio Tinto, which owns a majority share of Tomago Aluminium, warned in late October that the smelter is bracing for a potential shutdown by the end of 2028 owing to the soaring costs of both ​“coal-fired and renewable energy options from January 2029” that would make the facility’s operations commercially unviable. Tomago is the country’s largest smelter, accounting for about 40% of Australia’s annual aluminum production.

“There is significant uncertainty about when renewable projects will be available at the scale we need,” Jérôme Dozol, CEO of Tomago Aluminium, said in an Oct. 28 statement.

Johnson said Tomago’s troubles point to the broader limitations of initiatives like the GAPC. While the production credit can reduce power costs for smelters, other measures are needed to support the buildout of not just wind, solar, and battery storage but also transmission lines and grid infrastructure that connect the resources to the energy-gobbling smelters.

The Australian Aluminium Council is also advocating for energy policies that reward smelters for the benefits they are able to provide to the grid. For example, smelters can rapidly reduce their power consumption for about an hour at a time to help stabilize the system during emergencies. Alcoa is participating in such a demand-response program in Australia, as is Rio Tinto’s Tiwai Point smelter in New Zealand. Aluminum plants can also be an important source of demand for solar power plants in particular, since factories use plenty of power during the day when households generally consume less.

“We’re doing a lot of work here in Australia, in terms of the energy transition and how all these pieces of the puzzle need to fit together,” Johnson said.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Rio-Tinto-Bell.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=4393c4a35dd974461e7cf765cea57214,N,,2025-11-12 08:58:43.609833

The project joins a crowded field aiming to move more natural gas from Texas hubs to meet growing LNG demand in Louisiana.

Boardwalk proposes to build 155 miles of greenfield pipeline and upgrade existing facilities on Gulf South to provide at least 1.45 Bcf/d of capacity from Katy and Carthage to the Gillis hub in southwestern Louisiana. The company expects the project to enter service in November 2029.

Gulf South has executed a precedent agreement with a foundation shipper for 1.45 Bcf/d, enough to proceed with the expansion, according to the announcement. The open season will gauge additional interest to potentially upsize the project.

Texas Gateway is one of several proposals designed to boost gas supply to Gillis. Kinder Morgan (KMI) is developing Trident Intrastate and the Texas Access Expansion on its Louisiana Pipeline, WhiteWater and Venture Global (VG) are partnering on Blackfin Pipeline and CP Express, and ARM Energy Holdings recently announced a final investment decision (FID) on Mustang Express Pipeline. However, Texas Gateway stands out from the other projects in its choice of route. The new greenfield line would run directly between Carthage and Gillis, opening up egress from the rapidly developing Western Haynesville and the egress-constrained Shelby Trough.

Currently, East Daley Analytics estimates there will be 23.3 Bcf/d of existing and FID’d capacity into the Gillis hub and the surrounding LNG export region by 2030. That is just enough capacity to meet our expectations for LNG feedgas demand, but there are several more facilities and expansions in development that would require more inbound supply to run full. Assuming projects like Sabine Pass Stage 5, Lake Charles LNG, and Commonwealth LNG are all able to make FID, Gillis could see as much as 28 Bcf/d of LNG demand by the early 2030s. In this scenario, Texas Energy Gateway would not be the last pipeline project built in the region.

East Daley estimates the daily stacked rate on KMI’s Trident and Texas Access is ~$0.55/Mcf, while the stacked rate on Backfin and CP Express is ~$0.40/Mcf. We speculate that the rate on Mustang will also be in the ballpark of $0.30-0.40 given the shorter route relative to the paths offered by the other projects.

Given that Texas Gateway is a combination of greenfield pipeline and existing facility upgrades, we speculate that the project can offer better returns than some of the alternatives that are purely greenfield expansions. Additionally, the Boardwalk project is unique among these options, as it offers full-path service from Katy to Carthage to Gillis on one system.

See East Daley’s Southeast Gulf Supply & Demand Report for more information on the regional market. We expect the open season volumes offered on Texas Gateway will be enticing to LNG facilities looking to expand supply diversity and gain access to a very liquid Katy hub. – Oren Pilant and Zach Krause Tickers: KMI, VG.

Gillian Martin MSP, Cabinet Secretary For Energy & Climate Action

Scotland’s future prosperity will be built on renewable energy, with offshore wind at its centre. It offers a once-in-a-generation chance to drive economic growth, foster innovation and create high quality jobs across the country.

Offshore wind is already delivering real and lasting benefits to communities across Scotland. The Beatrice Offshore Wind Farm is a clear example, combining the generation of clean electricity with project investment in the Highlands and Moray. Since becoming fully operational in 2019, it has had the capacity to power up to 450,000 homes at any one time, created long term skilled jobs with up to 90 personnel now safely operating the wind farm, established a long-term operations and maintenance base at Wick Harbour, and provided £6 million in community benefits.

Over the next decade, the sector can support thousands more skilled roles, from the hands-on work of building and maintaining turbines and offshore structures, to the engineering and design of the systems that keep them safe, efficient and connected to the grid. These careers can inspire young people, provide security for families and open new opportunities for those moving into the sector as part of a just transition.

Realising these opportunities means building on and expanding the excellent training provision already in place as well as testing out innovative new approaches. We need to continue to work in partnership across private and public sectors to ensure that we have enough people with the right skills at the right time to realise the benefits we all want to see.

Earlier this year, the Scottish Government convened the Offshore Wind Skills Short-Life Working Group with industry and public sector partners to identify the priority job roles for the sector, agree a common set of objectives, and commit to additional actions to be taken forward from now into 2026/27. This plan marks the first step in a long-term, coordinated programme of joint work to position Scotland as the world’s leading destination for developing the offshore wind workforce of the future.",https://www.gov.scot/assets/images/logos/SGLogo1200x630.png,N,,2025-11-12 08:01:08.916719

“President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam.","BELEM, Brazil(AP) — Calling America’s absence from key United Nations climate negotiations “doubling down on stupid,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the United States risks being left behind as an economic power.

Newsom, a Democrat eyeing a 2028 presidential run, is so far the highest profile of several U.S. governors and mayors at U.N. climate talks being hosted in Belem, Brazil. They say they are here to tell the 195 nations who are trying to fight climate change that much of the United States is doing its best despite Trump administration policies overturning environmental regulations and aiding the production of dirty fuels, such as coal, while stymying green energies like wind and solar.

As he did during his first term, President Donald Trump is also pulling America from the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set international goals to limit average global temperature rise.

Newsom's presence as governor of the most populous U.S. state serves to draw a clear contrast with Trump's absence. He said Trump's decision to skip the talks tells the world: “You don’t matter, we don’t care.”

“This idea that somehow we can put up walls, we can put up barriers, we could put up tariffs, we put up our middle fingers and just turn our back is lunacy,"" Newsom said during an exclusive Associated Press interview at the climate talks in Belem, a city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. ""And every other country in the world understands that. That’s why every other country in this world is moving in a different direction.”

Even Russia and Saudi Arabia get it and are going green, but not Trump, Newsom said. U.N. organizers said only four nations are absent from the negotiations called COP30: Strife-torn Afghanistan and Myanmar, tiny San Marino and the United States, which over the century has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide in the air than any other nation.

California, with nearly 40 million residents, is a major economic hub and on the forefront of national climate policy. But the Trump administration has sought to roll back the state’s power to set aggressive climate policy, most notably by blocking a California regulation to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars within the next decade.

“This Trump administration, his acolytes and the supine Congress led by Speaker (Mike) Johnson, are doubling down on stupid,” Newsom said.

“We’re ceding cheap energy, green energy, infrastructure, supply chain manufacturing. We’re ceding economic power to other countries, notably China, taking advantage of that absence,” Newsom said. “And they’re going to clean our clock economically unless we wake up to the economic imperative and opportunities of low carbon regrowth.”

Trump, who actively solicited money from the fossil fuel industry during his last campaign, has massively deregulated industry that spews heat-trapping gas and cut subsidies to renewable energy. This would give America — the No. 1 oil producer in the world — energy independence and cheaper prices, he has said.

“Governor Newscum flew all the way to Brazil to tout the Green New Scam, while the people of California are paying some of the highest energy prices in the country. Embarrassing!,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement, using one of Trump's favored nicknames for Newsom. “President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam. These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s common sense energy agenda.”

Climate change is undeniable, despite Trump calling it a hoax, Newsom said.

“If you don’t believe in science, and a lot of people apparently don’t, you have to believe in your own eyes,” Newsom said. “Nighttime temperatures, record-breaking heat globally, acidification of our oceans, impacts on our coral reefs. You’re not able to go where your grandfather brought you for the first time, your dad brought you and bring your kids because there’s another fire and it’s another closure and the air quality’s been degraded.”

California has warmed 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit (1 degree Celsius) in the past 30 years — slightly more than the U.S. as a whole — and gets nearly 7 inches of rain (17.7 centimeters) less now than it did in 1995, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration records.

Some of California's largest and most destructive wildfires in history have sparked in the last five years, including two January infernos that devastated neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles. The previous winter, meanwhile, brought record-breaking rainfall as multiple atmospheric rivers pounded the state.

“I’m just privileged to represent one of the most blessed and cursed states in the world that’s on the tip of the spear of the impacts of climate change,"" Newsom said. “How about the simultaneous crisis of wildfires, drought, and floods stacked on top of each other.”

“Anyone paying attention here?” added Newsom.

At home, Newsom has confronted the economic and political realities of pursuing the state's ambitious goal of by 2045 reaching carbon neutrality, or taking as much carbon pollution from the atmosphere as emitted. He recently signed legislation to boost oil production in part of the state, and his party has grappled with how to confront high gas prices. California also has some of the highest electricity rates in the country.

California is also dealing with the massive energy and water demands of data centers by keeping its last nuclear plant running longer than planned, adding huge chunks of solar power and battery storage and investing in nuclear fusion, Newsom said. Those energy needs will grow as AI continues to boom. Many of the nation's top AI companies are headquartered in California.

Veteran climate negotiations analyst Alden Meyer of the European think tank E3G said it was unfortunate that America's federal government was not participating in the talks.

“But it is very positive that we have these other leaders from the United States that are here in Belem,” he said.

Now, the AFPM, or the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, has submitted comments to the EPA, or the Environmental Protection Agency, regarding its proposed supplemental rulemaking to the 2026-2027 Renewable Fuel Standard. The EPA has become a vestige of the US energy industry and regularly proposes changes to mandates and regulatory standards for US energy generation.

The EPA has added an addendum to its June RFS proposal, which has been lamented by the AFPM

The EPA has a somewhat controversial reputation in the US energy industry as it regularly delivers bad news for energy companies and petroleum producers. In June, the EPA released its initial RFS proposal, but recently amended it as it seeks to add to the already historic 2026-2027 RFS biofuel blending mandates.

The EPA has stated that the plan is to waive RFS costs from certain refineries over the period between 2023 and 2025 for the next tranche of RFS obligations. Renewable Fuel Standards were initially created by Congress way back in the mid-2000s, and the aim was and still is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expand the United States’ renewable fuel sector while also reducing reliance on foreign oil imports. Sounds good, right? Not according to some.

The AFPM has lamented the proposal by the EPA, pointing to the incredible compliance costs in the future

While some might view the RFS proposal as a step in the right direction, the AFPM has noted that by reallocating the RFS mandate, the energy industry’s compliance costs will skyrocket beyond the already historic expenses we are already seeing, noting that the estimation is already sitting at an astonishing $150 billion for 2026/27. The EPA released a statement that kicks the can of responsibility back down the Presidential line to the previous administration.

“This proposal is an important step in the EPA’s tireless work to repair the damage done after four years of the Biden-Harris Administration neglecting key components of the RFS program, including threats to transform the RFS program into a subsidy for electric vehicle charging stations as part of a larger strategy to electrify the transportation sector. – EPA statement on RFS reallocation

Reallocation would raise the RFS well beyond what the market claims is acceptable

The American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers has lamented the move proposed by the EPA to reallocate RFS, and has stated that the reallocation will raise biofuel feedstock costs and force the United States to continue to rely on foreign imports, the polar opposite of what the RFS is designed to do. The AFPM has noted that the EPA’s reallocation mandate will significantly increase soybean oil costs, thereby raising RFS compliance costs to record levels.

If that does happen, market analysts have noted that the total RFS costs, which we should mention are paid by American consumers and refiners, will increase from the projected $150 billion to an astonishing $190 billion over 2026 and 2027. With the latest round of sanctions on Russia placing the energy sector internationally in a precarious position, any other increases in compliance costs could negatively affect the US energy sector.

An estimated $1.6 billion in clean energy factories and projects were cancelled in September facing pressure from Trump administration and 500 solar projects, nearly 116 gigawatts (GW) of capacity, are also at risk, according to industry analyses.

There has been a steady drum beat of cancellations for clean energy industrial projects in 2025, now totaling $24.3 billion for the year, according to an analysis by E2, a clean energy industry group.

September cancellations hit four major battery storage and electric vehicle (EV) facilities in Kansas, Michigan, North Carolina, and Tennessee.

General Motors downsized EV production in Tennessee and Kansas and Natron Energy shuttered its Michigan plant and halted a planned $1.4. billion North Carolina factory.

For the year, manufacturing projects account for almost all the investment cancellations, about $19.8 million, with battery storage and EV projects making up three-quarters of the scrapped projects.

“The findings underscore the growing risk that federal and administrative policy rollbacks—especially the removal of clean energy incentives—are destabilizing one of the nation’s fastest-growing industries, with ripple effects across supply chains, manufacturing hubs, and rural economic development,” the E2 analysis said.

A study by the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) also identified 500 solar projects at risk due to “political attacks on the solar and storage industry.”

President Donald Trump has called solar energy part of “the scam of the century” and the administration’s budget bill adopted in July rapidly sunsets federal tax credits for wind and solar. In addition, permitting approvals and awarded funds have been slow in coming.

SEIA, using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, said it identified 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects that have not yet received all the required federal, state and local permits and are “at risk of being targeted by the administration.”

Projects must start construction by July 1, 2026 or be in operation by Dec. 31, 2027 to receive the federal Production Tax Credit and Investment Tax Credit. The two credits can cover as much as 50% of the cost of a project.

The 116 GW of projects make up more than half of all new power planned to be built in the United States through 2030 and are spread across 44 states.

The states with most projects in jeopardy, according to SEIA, are: Texas with 165 projects, New York with 53 projects, and Virginia with 32 projects.

Based on projected new capacity, the states hardest hit would be Vermont where its two solar projects make 97% of the new capacity for the state, Nevada where eight projects make up 94% of new capacity, and Oregon where 9 at-risk projects make up 93% of slated new capacity.

“This federal red tape also undermines the energy security and policy certainty that businesses need to plan for the future,” said SEIA.

E2 also did a geographic and political analysis the factory cancellations finding that while Democratic congressional districts and states are losing the most from the administration cancelling federal clean energy funding, Republican districts are losing the most from private-sector cancellations.

“More than $12.4 billion in investments that would have created almost 15,000 jobs have been cancelled in Republican districts so far in 2025,” E2 said. “Over $7.5 billion and 5,000 jobs have been lost in Democratic districts.”

There were $542 million in clean energy investments announced in September with the biggest being Hitachi Energy’s $457 million grid manufacturing facility in Virginia.

Rapid Retooling of South Carolina Facility

Clarios plans to fast-track the restart of currently idled infrastructure at its Florence, South Carolina facility to quickly expand battery recycling capacity and add critical mineral processing capability. This existing site provides one of the fastest routes to scale and secure domestic capacity. With major infrastructure in place, the facility represents a unique opportunity to expand battery recycling in the U.S.

New U.S. State-of-the Art Greenfield Facility

Clarios is in the site selection and engineering phase for a planned state-of-the-art U.S. based battery recycling and critical mineral processing facility. This facility would represent a major investment in U.S.-based recovery and refining, creating a cornerstone for domestic supply chain resilience. Once operational, it will help ensure American capacity essential for growing demand and energy independence.

North American Capacity Expansion

To immediately increase U.S. available battery supply, Clarios is implementing A.I., automation, and capacity upgrades at its existing North American facilities in Mexico. These enhancements will increase throughput and efficiency, ensuring an increased flow of recycled critical materials to U.S. manufacturing sites, essential for the resilience of the North American supply chain.

Collectively, these initiatives would provide additional recycling capacity of up to 400,000 MT.

To complement these investments, Clarios will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire existing battery recycling capacity.

Taken together, these initiatives will allow the company to further scale battery recycling, accelerating efforts to secure supply chains and meet growing demand.

This marks a significant step forward in Clarios’ commitment to help advance American energy independence, support the circular economy, and ensure long-term access to essential materials for advanced energy storage technologies. These strategic initiatives are components of Clarios’ $6 billion American Energy Manufacturing Strategy, announced earlier this year, which aims to advance American energy and critical mineral independence by strengthening the nation’s critical supply of batteries essential to start every vehicle in the U.S. and would expand existing operations, build new facilities, unlock innovation and create American jobs.

Wolfe said rising costs for electricity and natural gas will make home heating more expensive for most families this winter.
The National Energy Assistance Directors Association projects average home heating costs will rise 7.6%, from $907 last winter to about $976 this season.
For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter.
Wolfe encourages families to take small, consistent steps to manage heating costs before winter peaks.","ATLANTA — This week's cold blast is setting the stage for winter, and experts say heating your home could cost more this year.

“Everyone is saying prices are going up,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. ""Nobody is saying prices are coming down.""

Wolfe said rising costs for electricity and natural gas will make home heating more expensive for most families this winter. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association projects average home heating costs will rise 7.6%, from $907 last winter to about $976 this season. Families using electric heat will see the biggest jump — up 10.2% to about $1,205 — while natural gas costs are expected to rise from $639 to $693.

The organization, which represents state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, said electricity and natural gas prices have been climbing at more than twice the rate of inflation, driven by higher gas prices, growing demand from data centers and grid maintenance.

“Electric utilities are rebuilding the grid, and that’s pushing up prices,” Wolfe said. “Data centers are also placing new demands on the grid, which is driving up costs even more.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2025–26 Winter Fuels Outlook, the majority of Americans heat their homes with natural gas or electric heat, with 46% using natural gas and 43% using electricity. The EIA’s outlook is less bullish, forecasting the average electricity bill will rise about 4% from November through March 2026, to a national average of about $1,130.

For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter. The EIA expects heating oil and propane costs to fall by just under 10%, while NEADA predicts savings closer to 5%.

Wolfe encourages families to take small, consistent steps to manage heating costs before winter peaks.

“Every one degree you turn your thermostat down can save about 2% on your bill,” Wolfe said. “Turn it down gradually — one degree a week — so you stay comfortable.”",https://media.tegna-media.com/assets/CCT/images/bc4a27be-180e-4669-acdf-523c3abcc992/20251111T161005/bc4a27be-180e-4669-acdf-523c3abcc992_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-12 00:58:20.320969

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

The companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.

As an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.

(Reuters) -Global sales of fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles rose 23% in October to 1.9 million units, driven by strong demand across major markets, market research firm Rho Motion said on Wednesday.

WHY IT’S IMPORTANT

Europe led regional electric vehicle growth with strong demand in Germany, France and the UK, while overall sales eased after a peak month and the European Union approved more battery projects.

China is the world’s biggest car market and accounts for more than half of global EV sales, which in Rho Motion’s data include battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.

The price parity between electric and ICE vehicles in China is a lot closer when compared with the European or the North American markets, Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester said.

North America was a drag on monthly figures, with EV sales down 41% following record highs in August and September, as demand eased after a $7,500 tax credit expired, Lester added.

Battery-electric vehicles remain much pricier than comparable internal combustion models in the U.S., contributing to steep October sales declines across major automakers.

BY THE NUMBERS

Global sales of battery-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids rose 23% to 1.9 million units in October, Rho Motion data showed.

Chinese sales rose to about 1.3 million vehicles. European sales jumped 36% to 372,786 units, while North American sales dropped 41% to 100,370. Sales in the rest of the world jumped 37% to 141,368 vehicles.

KEY QUOTE

“In Europe, the overall year-to-date growth figure remains relatively high and we’re expecting strong sales towards the end of the year,” Lester said.

“Chinese automotive market is expected to show strong growth in November and December, helped by pull forward effect as the country is moving from a full purchase tax exemption to just a 50% exemption on NEVs,” he said.

This expansion seeks to strengthen energy security, reduce the use of coal and optimize the use of renewable sources.

Construction of the battery storage plant

The company filed the plan with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, proposing to double the previously approved capacity. In addition to the 300 MW authorized, another 300 MW will be added, making Sherco a strategic hub for regional energy storage. In addition, an additional 135.5 MW of capacity is planned at Blue Lake(Shakopee) and the Sherco solar plant will be expanded with an additional 200 MW at Clear Lake.

According to Xcel Energy, the technology used will be of LFP (lithium iron phosphate) cells(lithium iron phosphate) cells, known for their high reliability and discharge capacity of up to four hours. These systems will make it possible to store electricity generated by wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas sources for release at times of high demand.

The Sherco battery project will generate more than 150 construction jobs, all unionized, and will contribute close to $200 million in local taxes. The Blue Lake project will generate 55 jobs and an estimated tax contribution of $60 million. These developments will benefit from federal tax credits of up to 40%, allowing Xcel Energy to pass these benefits directly to consumers through lower bills.

In addition, Xcel Energy plans a fourth phase for Sherco Solar, bringing its total capacity to 910 MW by 2029. The plant, the largest in the Upper Midwest in solar generation, has two operational phases, while the third phase is under construction.

This set of projects consolidates Xcel Energy as a key player in the transition to a decarbonized electricity grid in the central United States. In addition to reducing its dependence on coal, the company is committed to an infrastructure that integrates renewable energies, improves grid resilience and maintains a focus on affordability for users.

Baker Hughes to supply key refrigerant compressors for LNG terminal.","Baker Hughes has agreed to supply key equipment and take a stake in Glenfarne’s Alaska LNG project. The move adds impetus to one of the largest planned energy developments in the U.S.

The companies announced the agreement on Monday, November 10, 2025 in Washington, D.C., where U.S. officials highlighted the project’s potential impact on national energy security. Baker Hughes will provide refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power equipment for the North Slope gas treatment facility, along with an undisclosed strategic investment in the project.

The Alaska LNG Project, estimated to cost approximately $44 billion, would include constructing an 807-mile-long, 42-inch diameter pipeline from the North Slope to a liquefaction facility on the Kenai Peninsula. A second phase will include an export terminal capable of producing up to 20 million tonnes of LNG per year.

Glenfarne, which took over as lead developer earlier this year, has secured preliminary deals with buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand for about 11 million tonnes of LNG annually, more than half what’s needed to reach a final investment decision.

Development Phases

The project is structured as two standalone phases. Phase One covers the pipeline that will answer Alaska’s domestic energy requirements, with engineering work to be complete by December. Phase Two includes the export terminal. A final investment decision is scheduled for late 2026.

The project is part of a broader U.S. effort to increase LNG exports and meet growing demand in Asia. Observers say that while the Baker Hughes deal strengthens the project’s industrial readiness, financing, logistics, and market conditions will remain key factors in determining whether the full project moves forward. While the Alaska LNG project moves forward, the Constitution Pipeline remains uncertain, though discussions continue about potentially reviving it.

Glenfarne’s North American LNG portfolio now totals nearly 33 million tonnes per year across projects in Alaska, Texas and Louisiana. Baker Hughes also supplies equipment for Glenfarne’s Texas LNG development.

If completed, Alaska LNG would connect one of the world’s largest untapped gas reserves with international markets, possibly giving a boost to U.S. energy exports and Alaska’s local economy.

In June 2025, California and a coalition of 10 other states in State of California et al. v. United States et al., No. 4:25-cv-04966-HSG (N.D. Cal.) filed a lawsuit challenging the authority of congressional Republicans and President Trump to revoke a waiver granted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the waning days of the Biden administration permitting California to adopt more stringent emissions standards than those imposed under the federal Clean Air Act (CAA). Now auto industry participants will have to wait until at least early 2026 to learn whether they will need to comply with these emissions standards, after California and the other states in October 2025 filed an amended complaint mooting a pending motion to dismiss.

The Regulatory Backdrop: California’s Unique Clean Air Act Waiver Authority

Under the CAA, states typically are preempted from setting their own vehicle emissions standards. The CAA authorizes California to request from the EPA a special preemption “waiver,” however, which if granted, permits that state to adopt stricter emissions standards given historic air-quality challenges there. Moreover, although other states may not request such a waiver, Section 177 of the CAA permits states to follow California’s lead and adopt the emissions requirements imposed by California regulators (the “Section 177 States”).

In the closing days of the Biden administration in December 2024, the EPA granted three preemption waivers allowing the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to implement its Advanced Clean Cars II (ACC II), Advanced Clean Trucks (ACT), and Omnibus Low NOx (Low NOx) rules. These rules and the EPA waivers would have allowed California and the Section 177 States to, among other things, require the complete phase out of the sale of new gas-powered passenger vehicles in those states by 2035 and require more heavy-duty trucks to be zero-emission vehicles.

Congressional Review Act Challenge to California’s EPA Waivers

In January 2025, congressional Republicans formally challenged the EPA’s grant of these waivers by invoking the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The CRA is an oversight tool that allows Congress to revisit and revoke federal agency rulemaking actions by requiring all final rules to be submitted to Congress and allowing any member of Congress to introduce a joint resolution disapproving an agency’s final rule. A CRA resolution passed by Congress and signed by the President has the force and effect of federal law and prevents the rule in question from going into effect. Moreover, no agency rule revoked under the CRA can be reissued by a federal agency in the same or “substantially similar” fashion.

On June 12, 2025, President Trump signed three joint resolutions under the CRA that revoked the three California CAA waivers. As a result, California and the Section 177 States no longer had the authority to implement and enforce the ACC II, ACT, and Low NOx rules in their states. If these CRA resolutions are upheld, those waivers arguably could not be granted by the EPA again in the future, effectively curbing California’s regulatory power in this area.

California and Affected States Bring Lawsuit Challenging CRA Authority

The same day the CRA resolutions were signed into law, California and a coalition of 10 other states filed a lawsuit in federal court in California against the EPA, the federal government, and related entities alleging that the use of the CRA to revoke the waivers was improper. Their argument focus largely on the EPA’s historical treatment of preemption waivers as case-specific adjudicatory orders, not rules. That distinction is critical, because the CRA is only available to Congress to review “final rules,” a term with a specific meaning under Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and for the purposes of the CRA.

Even before the federal government responded to the complaint, numerous industry participants sought to intervene, voicing serious concerns about both the technological feasibility of ACC II, ACT, and Low NOx emission standards and the consumer demand necessary to make them commercially viable. This included a motion to intervene filed on September 5, 2025 by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation (“Auto Innovators”) and the National Automobile Dealers Association (“NADA”), trade associations representing the interests of U.S. automobile manufacturers and dealers, respectively. These associations argued their members would suffer direct and substantial economic harm if the EPA’s preemption waiver were reinstated, particularly “in light of California’s threat that it will retroactively enforce the ACC II regulations as to vehicles already sold and as to model years already past, should it be successful in this litigation.”

Motion to Dismiss Met with Amended Complaint

For automakers, suppliers, dealers, and ancillary sectors, the stakes are high. Regardless of its outcome, the case is likely to heavily impact the future of U.S. vehicle-emissions policy, including vehicle design, manufacturing investments, supply chains, and market roll-out strategies. On September 19, 2025, the United States moved to dismiss the complaint filed by California and the other states, arguing that Congress and the President had acted within their authority under the CRA. Rather than oppose this motion, California and the other states on October 10, 2025 filed an amended complaint, mooting the federal government’s motion to dismiss and the multiple motions filed by potential intervenors—including Auto Innovators and NADA—seeking to file amicus briefs in support of the federal government’s motion.

On October 23, 2025, the court entered an order requiring that the United States file its renewed motion to dismiss by November 23, 2025; responses from California and the other states be filed by December 23, 2025; replies be filed by January 19, 2026, with a motion hearing set for January 29, 2026. It appears auto industry participants will have to wait until at least early 2026 to learn whether they will be required to comply with these stringent new California emissions standards. Longer term, it remains to be seen whether these developments will curb the ability of California to adopt regulations requiring manufacturers and dealers to phase out the sale of new gas-powered passenger vehicles in that state, and by extension, the Section 177 States.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15875_2214.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 23:00:34.316867

However, Richmond residents at last Thursday’s meeting said a lack of urgency and transparency around the cleanup is nothing new.
Early this year, the EPA launched a robust community consultation process and proposed a timeline for developing a second cleanup plan.
“The regulatory agency staff… are not telling us anything about the proposed cleanup plan, they are adamant,” said Janet Johnson, Richmond Shoreline Alliance coordinator.
Neither the earlier EPA plan nor the community’s proposed plan has a solution to the disposal problem.","On the 37th day of the federal government shutdown, about two dozen Richmond residents and environmentalists met at Easter Hill United Methodist Church to discuss the cleanup of the United Heckathorn Superfund Site.

The Environmental Protection Agency is responsible for monitoring and decontaminating the site, which includes the Lauritzen Channel (pictured above) in Richmond’s Inner Harbor and an adjacent section of land. The federal government shutdown has delayed the development of an agency-approved cleanup plan. However, Richmond residents at last Thursday’s meeting said a lack of urgency and transparency around the cleanup is nothing new.

The EPA first attempted to remove the carcinogenic pesticides dieldrin and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane in the 1990s by dredging sediments from the channel and laying a concrete cap over the land portion to contain toxic substances, but a 2016 study showed that toxins remained in soil, sediments, water, and tissues of marine organisms, so the agency went back to the drawing board.

Early this year, the EPA launched a robust community consultation process and proposed a timeline for developing a second cleanup plan. It promised to lead six open community meetings and additional meetings with representatives from the environmental nonprofits Richmond Shoreline Alliance, SF Baykeeper and the Sierra Club. The EPA planned to release the plan for public feedback in early 2026.

At the first five meetings, EPA representatives shared information about the Superfund process and details about the site’s history, contaminants and resulting health risks. They told how the site was home to the United Heckathorn Chemical Co. from the mid-1940s to the mid-1960s. The company was one of several in the area that manufactured or shipped pesticides, including DDT, which the federal government banned in 1972, and dieldrin, which was banned the following decade. Both pose a plethora of health risks — from cancer and respiratory issues to damaged reproductive and nervous systems.

Last month, the EPA was supposed to hold the sixth and final community meeting about ridding those chemicals from the Lauritzen Channel, which feeds into the San Francisco Bay. But the meeting has been pushed back to January.

Feeling left out

An EPA spokesperson said the delay was agreed to by community partners, given the government shutdown. Environmentalists involved in these conversations said uncertainty over if and when EPA employees involved in the project would be furloughed during the shutdown was the deciding factor.

Residents and environmental groups said that they felt frozen out of meaningful dialogue even before the shutdown.

“The regulatory agency staff… are not telling us anything about the proposed cleanup plan, they are adamant,” said Janet Johnson, Richmond Shoreline Alliance coordinator.

This prompted RSA, the Sierra Club and SF Baykeeper to draw up a separate cleanup plan based on consultations with engineers, environmental scientists, former government workers and the community. They propose draining the Lauritzen Channel, then removing all contaminated soil, sediment, rocks and industrial debris.

More than two months after submitting the plan to the EPA, the coalition has received no response to the proposal. The agency told Richmond Confidential that the government now plans to release its plan in the first half of next year.

Without divulging the government’s plan, an EPA spokesperson stated in an email that “the EPA’s focus has been, and will continue to be, fulfilling the agency’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment by cleaning up the marine sediment area of the United Heckathorn site.”

The pace of the cleanup process has been a source of frustration for residents, who note that the neighborhoods nearest the site are low income and predominantly Black and Latinx communities.

“If it was another area, would it have been 30 years to take care of it? I don’t think so,” said Linda Whitmore, a Santa Fe neighborhood council member, at Thursday’s meeting.

Disposal remains a problem

Lejon Fahim Reese, another Santa Fe neighborhood council member, highlighted generations of health issues in his community. “Just growing up down there, my grandmother passed of cancer, and there’s a lot of people being affected.”

Residents also raised concerns about where any contaminated material would be disposed of. When the channel was first dredged in the 1990s, Richmond journalist Vernon Whitmore followed the dredged material to a landfill in the Arizona desert. He said he was shocked to see the landfill bordered a Native American reservation.

“The dumpsite is dirty and dusty. The wind is plowing. That made me think, they’re breathing in all this toxic dust,” Whitmore said. “It was really sad.”

Toxic compounds like dieldrin and DDT never break down. Neither the earlier EPA plan nor the community’s proposed plan has a solution to the disposal problem.

Johnson, of the Shoreline Alliance, urged those in attendance at the meeting to keep pushing the cleanup process forward.

“Especially in light of the challenges posed by climate change and sea level rise, our community must advocate strongly for the complete removal of all contaminated materials,” she said. “This is not just an environmental issue. It’s about ensuring the health and safety of our community for generations to come.”",http://richmondconfidential.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/lauritzenchannel.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 21:06:05.930214

This year’s abrupt shift in federal energy policy has sent the US decarbonization journey into a tailspin. Nevertheless, the tea leaves are lining up for a fresh burst of wind and solar activity after the current occupant of the White House decamps as scheduled on January 20, 2029 — peacefully this time, one hopes. One good indicator is the pace of activity in the long duration energy storage field, where long years of R&D are finally beginning to pay off.

The Long Road To Long Duration Energy Storage

Traditional lithium-ion batteries have already enabled wind and solar energy to become a widespread feature in the nation’s electricity grid. To get to the next level of renewable energy saturation, though, the grid needs new energy storage systems that can store more clean kilowatts for longer periods of time. Decarbonizing industrial processes also requires longer lasting, more powerful energy storage systems.

That’s going to be a tough row to hoe. Currently, a single, century-old technology — pumped hydro — commands about 95% of utility-scale long duration energy storage capacity in the US. Hydropower innovators have been devising new systems to expand the reach of pumped storage, but access to water resources will continue to be a limiting factor.

The search for more flexible, transportable, and economical long duration energy storage systems has ranged far and wide, with thermal storage being a particular area of focus. Thermal systems transfer wind or solar energy into a storage medium, the molten salt in concentrating solar power plants being one example.

In 2018, the US Department of Energy launched a new initiative aimed at stimulating investor interest in new long duration energy storage systems. Called DAYS (short for Duration Addition to electricitY Storage), the program set a goal of 10 hours and up, far longer than the capabilities of conventional lithium-ion batteries.

One of the first US startups to receive funding through the DAYS program was the California firm Antora Energy. In 2019 the company received a grant through the Energy Department’s ARPA-E office for the delivery of a “thermophotovoltaic heat engine capable of efficiently and durably converting high-temperature heat into electricity,” aimed at decarbonizing industrial processes.

All That Hard Work Is Beginning To Pay Off

As the name suggests, thermophotovoltaic devices convert heat to electricity. TVP technology began surfacing in the 1990s. Though it initially resisted commercial application, it began to show more promise by the time DAYS launched, and the Energy Department decided to give it a closer look.

“[The new battery] will seek to double panel efficiency through new materials and smart system design, potentially enabling a cost effective grid storage solution,” the Energy Department noted.

Antora’s “heat battery” solution can function as a TVP device or it can deliver direct high-temperature heat for industrial processes. Either way, the same basic economic factor is at work. The battery can soak up excess wind and solar power when electricity rates are low, and deploy it whenever needed.

“Antora leverages renewable electricity to heat blocks of solid carbon — a low-cost, earth-abundant, and safe storage medium that’s used extensively across industries — to glowing hot temperatures in an insulated battery module,” the company states. “The stored heat is then reliably delivered at the scale and temperatures that large industrial operations demand, or can be converted directly into electricity using Antora’s TPV technology.”

Scaling Up Long Duration Energy Storage

Antora came into the DAYS program with a head start through the Shell GameChanger Accelerator at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, which verified a 35% conversion efficiency for the technology. By 2023, Antora achieved two milestones considered necessary for commercial applications, providing heat at 1,800°C while achieving a conversion efficiency of 40%. The benchmarks earned Antora a combined total of $4 million in new grants from ARPA-E and the California Energy Commission that year.

That was peanuts compared to last year. In 2024 Antora nailed down $150 million in Series B funding, with Decarbonization Partners in the lead. Last March, the Energy Department also selected Antora to receive a substantial award for commercial scaleup under its Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, though the office has since been vaporized by the Trump administration.

Energy Department or not, Antora is still on track for commercial scaleup. In 2023 the company announced plans to build a manufacturing facility in San Jose, and earlier today the software-based advanced manufacturing systems engineer Manufacturo took note of its role in lifting Antora beyond the prototype phase.

“As they moved from engineering prototypes to real production, they needed an operational backbone that could keep pace with rapid iteration while establishing audit-ready traceability for future scale,” Manufacturo explained.

“When I started at Antora our production floor was an empty building. Manufacturo is one of the tools we relied heavily on to rapidly scale into our current steady-state production line,” said Antora’s New Product Introduction Manager, Ian Reed, in a press statement.

Next Steps For Long Duration Energy Storage

As described by Manufacturo, the operation is in the pilot phase leading into volume production. “As routings and approvals stabilize, the team is progressing from pilot cadence toward a regular output rhythm. The emphasis is a predictable drumbeat without adding friction on the floor,” Manufacturo explains.

Meanwhile, Antora already has several irons in the fire, including a proposed hookup with POET’s Big Stone City biofuel plant in South Dakota and a potential agreement with Shell to assess its technology for use in chemicals production, among other processes.

Keep an eye on the renewables-friendly state of New York for additional activity. In June of 2024 Antora received an award of $14.5 million from ARPA-E, part of which was earmarked for an energy storage partnership between Antora and Con Edison, the utility covering New York City and Westchester County.

In 2024, Con Edison produced a detailed plan for decarbonizing its district steam network, based on an initial assessment of two dozen clean energy technologies. From that pool, Con Edison selected thermal energy storage as one of three technologies that will drive its near term steam decarbonization efforts, along with electric boilers and industrial heat pumps.

“These assets represent the most technologically- and- commercially-mature decarbonization technologies available, the use of which would result in the electrification of up to one third of the total steam capacity by 2035,” the company states.

A strident political foe of U.S. President Donald Trump, Newsom has for months been teasing a run for the White House in 2028. On Tuesday and Wednesday, he is expected to meet with officials from some of the 195 governments attending this year’s U.N. climate negotiations.

He has planned meetings with a series of subnational leaders, including the governor of Brazil’s state of Para, the location of the summit.

Though California is just one of 50 U.S. states, its economy is the world’s fourth-largest – making it a key player in influencing markets and energy policy.

“The reason I’m here is in the absence of leadership coming from the United States,” he said at an investors summit in Brazil’s financial hub of Sao Paulo on Monday. “This vacuum, it’s rather jaw-dropping.”

Newsom has touted California’s embrace of green tech, highlighting that the state has seven times more renewable energy jobs than fossil fuel jobs and reminding people that EV giant Tesla was founded in California. This is in sharp contrast to Washington’s climate denial and determination to boost global use of polluting fossil fuels.

Newsom also lamented the U.S. rollback on clean energy policy as ceding the fast-growing green-tech market to China.

“China gets it,” Newsom told investors. “United States is toast competitively if we don’t wake up to what the hell they’re doing in this space, on supply chains, how they’re dominating manufacturing, how they’re flooding the zone here, EU, elsewhere, Africa.”

China not only dominates the markets for electric vehicles, renewable energy components and batteries, he said, but it also leads in software while U.S. automakers like General Motors are “trying to recreate the 19th century,” Newsom said. GM recently slowed its production of EVs.

The United States has conspicuously snubbed this year’s COP30 summit, with Trump falsely declaring climate change a hoax.

Some diplomats worried that Trump’s Republican administration might try to disrupt the summit from afar.

Newsom, a Democrat, said last month that he is mulling a presidential run in 2028. He has started to parrot Trump’s brash style of messaging on social media.

Last week, California voters backed his proposal to redraw the state’s voting districts to offset redistricting in other states aimed at boosting the number of congressional seats held by Republicans.

Newsom told investors in Sao Paulo that Trump was emulating Russia and Saudi Arabia in turning the United States into a “petro state” and embracing Chinese-style “state capitalism” over the free market. He criticized Trump’s aggressive tariff policies as “madness from an investment perspective.”

“I feel like it’s modeled a little bit on President Xi, not President Reagan. The hell’s going on?” he said.

The existing and ""growing fast-charging network"" removes a major barrier to adoption for used EV buyers.
The used EV market is demonstrating remarkable resilience, bucking the trend of slower turnover seen across the general used car sector.
Market Predictability: The used market offers stability and predictability, contrasting with the new EV market where automakers ""tinker with pricing"" and incentives change monthly.
Risk Reduction: The used market offers more predictability than the volatile new EV market, appealing to a motivation for purchase certainty.","What is the The Mid-Price Electric Gateway Trend: Leveraging Off-Lease Value for Mass Adoption

This trend is defined by the rapid acceleration of used Electric Vehicle (EV) sales, which are selling significantly faster than comparable gas vehicles and even new EVs. The core implication is that affordability, driven by the influx of off-lease, three-year-old models, is now the primary catalyst for mass EV adoption.

The Velocity Discrepancy: Used EVs (specifically three-year-old models) are moving off dealer lots faster than the market average and much faster than hybrids. The Tesla Model S, for example, sells in 21.5 days compared to 29 days for the Toyota Corolla Hybrid. This speed indicates high consumer demand and limited available supply.

This rapid turnover signals a massive shift in consumer priorities, where the used EV's value proposition is immediately clear and highly desirable.

The market is no longer dominated solely by Tesla; models from Hyundai, Kia, Ford, and Audi are also seeing quick sales, indicating the trend is broadening across EV manufacturers.

The increased competition for these limited used units is one of the reasons buyers ""act fast,"" highlighting the supply constraint in this specific market segment.

Affordability as the Adoption Driver: The average price of many three-year-old used EVs is clustered in the mid-$20,000s (Model 3, Ioniq 5, ID.4, EV6). This price point is dramatically lower than the new car average of $50,000 and the original MSRPs of $50,000-$70,000.

This mid-price range makes high-tech vehicles accessible to consumers who are ""balking at new cars"" due to high inflation and rising transaction prices.

The affordability factor has surpassed the influence of the now-expired $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs, demonstrating a self-sustaining market dynamic.

The used EV provides a superior technology-to-price ratio compared to used gas cars, offering better performance and lower operating costs at the same price point.

Insight: The real tipping point for EVs is not new car incentives, but the maturing of the lease cycle creating an accessible mid-market price segment.

Why it is Trending: Price Pressure Meets Performance Value

The trend is gaining momentum because the soaring cost of new cars is forcing consumers into the used market, where EVs offer a superior value proposition in terms of technology and total cost of ownership (TCO).

New Car Price Ceiling: With the average new car price exceeding $50,000, used EVs in the mid-$20,000s provide a compelling alternative for value-seeking buyers.

This affordability factor is essential as buyers become more ""selective and cautious,"" taking longer to make purchase decisions on high-priced used gas cars.

The rising costs are causing market friction, which used EVs are uniquely positioned to exploit.

The used EV market offers a predictable and established price point, unlike the volatile new EV market.

Superior Technology and Performance at a Discount: For a price in the mid-$20,000s, used EV buyers gain access to vehicles with technology, acceleration, and quiet operation that is an ""order of magnitude better than used gas cars"" at the same price.

Buyers get a ""far more high-tech vehicle"" due to the rapid advancement of EV platforms over the past three years.

The promise of lower operating costs (fuel and maintenance) further enhances the total value proposition.

The existing and ""growing fast-charging network"" removes a major barrier to adoption for used EV buyers.

The Limited Supply Catalyst: The current scarcity—used EVs account for only 1.6% of the three-year-old market—creates a sense of urgency.

This low availability means buyers must ""snag the deal before it's gone,"" contributing to the faster days on lot (DOL) metric.

The supply constraint is a temporary, but powerful, market driver pushing up the sales velocity.

As EV sales grew rapidly only recently, the three-year-old supply is naturally limited, but this will change soon.

Insight: Used EVs are trending because they provide the best combination of price relief, functional technology, and performance thrill in the current inflationary auto market.

Overview: The Maturation of the Electric Vehicle Economy

The rapid sale of used EVs signifies the transition of the electric vehicle market from a fringe technology subsidized by incentives to a mature economic segment driven by supply, demand, and genuine consumer value.

The used EV market is demonstrating remarkable resilience, bucking the trend of slower turnover seen across the general used car sector. Edmunds data shows that while the average used car price rose by 5% to $31,000 in Q3 2025, used EVs are selling faster than gas vehicles, a trend now broadening beyond just Teslas to include high-volume models from Hyundai, Kia, Ford, and Audi. This momentum is not reliant on tax credits or aggressive incentives, but purely on the strong value proposition: getting a highly technological, performance-driven vehicle for an affordable price in the mid-$20,000s. The challenge remains supply, as three-year-old EVs are scarce (1.6% of the market), but this is forecasted to improve as the first large wave of new EV leases matures, ensuring the trend is likely to continue.

Insight:Used EVs are the true bellwether for mass electrification, proving consumer demand when the price is right.

Detailed Findings: The Dual-Action Blueprint: Price Point and Technology Premium

The success of the used EV market is rooted in the synergistic effect of hitting a mass-market price point while delivering performance and technology that drastically outperform gas equivalents.

The Affordability Cluster: The data clearly shows a cluster of desirable used EVs (Model 3, Model Y, Ioniq 5, ID.4, EV6) priced between $23,000 and $28,000. This makes them directly competitive with used mid-range gas cars like the Honda Accord or high-end used hybrids like the Lexus NX 350h, but with significantly higher original MSRPs and technology.

The initial price erosion from the original MSRP (e.g., Model 3 down from $57,009 to $24,447) creates a massive perceived value win for the used buyer.

This mid-price segment offers the greatest delta in value compared to new cars, which are averaging over $50,000.

The price drop essentially makes premium performance and technology accessible to the median consumer.

The Performance and Experience Advantage: Buyers are not just getting a ""green"" car; they are getting vehicles known for ""neck-snapping acceleration,"" silent operation, and high-tech cockpits.

This performance differential is a major selling point that used gas cars cannot replicate.

The driving experience is a core part of the value proposition, extending beyond mere cost savings.

Low operating costs (less maintenance, cheaper ""fuel"") further sweeten the deal over the expected lifespan.

Market Predictability: The used market offers stability and predictability, contrasting with the new EV market where automakers ""tinker with pricing"" and incentives change monthly.

This certainty is attractive to cautious buyers in an inflationary economy.

The stability reduces the fear of buying at the wrong time, driving faster purchase decisions.

The used market's transparent pricing process aids buyer confidence.

Insight: The market is rewarding functional and economic predictability combined with superior dynamic performance.

Key Success Factors: The Pillars of Used EV Momentum

The momentum of used EV sales is driven by a unique combination of external economic pressure, internal product superiority, and market dynamics.

Inflationary Economic Pressure: The soaring average price of new cars ($50,000+) and rising used gas car prices pushes buyers towards the used EV segment as the only remaining high-tech, affordable alternative.

The financial pain points of the broader auto market create a pull for used EVs.

The trend is externally driven by inflation and consumer budgeting.

The Lease Cycle Flood (Future Supply): The forecast that the current generation of new EV leases (purchased during the tax credit frenzy) will mature soon suggests an imminent strong supply wave.

Anticipation of this supply stabilizes expectations for future inventory.

Current buyers are ""snagging"" the initial scarcity before the flood arrives.

Technology & Performance Superiority: The core product delivers a quieter, faster, and more high-tech experience than equally priced used gas cars, offering an unmatched value-for-performance ratio.

This is an inherent, unchangeable advantage of the EV platform.

The technology is only three years old, remaining highly relevant and functional.

Expanded Brand Presence: The acceleration of sales across multiple brands (Hyundai, Kia, Ford, Audi, not just Tesla) validates that the trend is about the EV platform's inherent value, not just brand hype.

This breadth indicates market maturity and consumer acceptance of electrification generally.

Insight: The combination of economic necessity and genuine product excellence creates an irresistible buying climate.

Key Takeaway: Affordability Decides the Future of Electrification

The critical takeaway is that mass adoption of EVs is contingent upon achieving a sub-$30,000 price point, a threshold currently being met almost exclusively by the used market.

The Price-Point Mandate: The success of the mid-$20,000 used EV confirms that mass consumers are ready for EVs, but only at a significant discount from the new MSRP.

The market has clearly spoken: the sweet spot for widespread EV adoption is in the mid-twenties.

New EV manufacturers must accelerate cost reductions to compete with their own three-year-old models.

Demand Outpaces New Supply: Production bottlenecks and limited runs for new affordable models (like the cut in Nissan Leaf production or the ""limited run"" Chevy Bolt) mean the used market is the most viable path to affordable EV ownership for the near future.

The used market is providing the volume and pricing the new market cannot currently deliver.

The Predictability Premium: Consumer choice is increasingly driven by market transparency and predictability, which the used EV market currently offers over the volatile, incentive-heavy new EV space.

Buyers want certainty, and the used market delivers it.

Insight: The used car lot is currently doing more to accelerate electrification than the new car showroom.

Core Consumer Trend: The Value Electrification Pursuit

Consumers are actively seeking out the best functional technology and performance for the lowest possible price, driving them directly to the value proposition of off-lease EVs.

The core consumer trend is the Value Electrification Pursuit. This segment is financially pragmatic and technologically aware. They are primarily motivated by the desire to access superior EV performance and low operating costs, but without paying the high $50,000+ new car premium. They view the used market as the smart, low-risk way to ""buy into the future"" without paying a depreciation tax. Their decision is rooted in a sober calculation of technology-per-dollar and a desire to avoid the unpredictability of new car pricing.

Description of the Trend: Broadening Accessibility via Secondary Market

The Scarcity Factor: The current low supply (1.6% of three-year-old vehicles) contributes to the rapid sales velocity, forcing buyers to act quickly. This supply crunch temporarily amplifies the demand.

Brand Diversification: The shift from a Tesla-only phenomenon to one including models from Hyundai, Kia, and Ford indicates that the technology has been fully validated and is no longer reliant on the ""early mover"" status of one brand.

The Predictable Supply Cycle: The current high demand and low supply will soon be rectified by the maturing of the first wave of leased EVs, signaling a self-correcting supply cycle that will sustain the trend.

Insight: The secondary market is serving as the critical launch ramp for mass electrification that the primary market could not financially sustain.

Key Characteristics: Velocity, Mid-Price Clustering, and Brand Breadth

The trend is defined by its speed of sale, the tight clustering of desirable models at an affordable price point, and the broadening of brands participating in the accelerated turnover.

High Sales Velocity (Low DOL): EVs are selling significantly faster than the average used car (21.5 days vs. ~29 days), demonstrating intense, focused demand.

Mid-$20K Price Sweet Spot: The most desirable used EVs are priced in the mid-$20,000 range, confirming this price point as the market's most sensitive affordability threshold.

Broad Brand Representation: The top 20 fastest-selling used vehicles include eight EVs from diverse manufacturers (Tesla, Hyundai, Kia, Audi, Ford), proving the trend is platform-driven.

Insight: The data confirms that affordability is a function of price segmentation, with the mid-$20K range being the most potent driver.

Market and Cultural Signals: Inflation, Performance, and Supply Constraints

This trend is supported by clear market signals indicating consumers are reacting defensively to high new-car prices while simultaneously seeking high-performance technology.

New Car Price Rejection: The average new car price hitting $50,000 is the primary market signal driving buyers away from the new market and into the used EV segment.

Used Market Selectivity: The fact that average used vehicles are sitting longer on lots (as buyers are more ""selective and cautious"") contrasts with the quick turnover of used EVs, signaling that used EVs are a specific, highly sought-after category.

The Post-Incentive Demand: Used EV sales surging without the immediate lure of the $7,500 tax credit proves the demand is based on inherent economic value (TCO, depreciation, etc.), not just temporary subsidies.

Insight: The market is filtering for superior intrinsic value over low-quality inventory.

Consumer Motivation: Financial Relief and Technology Upgrade

Consumers are fundamentally motivated by solving two problems simultaneously: finding financial relief in an inflationary environment and accessing next-generation technology/performance.

Financial Prudence: The desire to avoid the ""egregious price tag"" of new cars is the initial motivation, making the mid-$20,000 used EV a calculated act of financial relief.

Performance Upgrade: The opportunity to acquire a vehicle with ""neck-snapping acceleration"" and high-tech features for the same price as a slower, aging gas car is a powerful performance motivation.

Risk Reduction: The used market offers more predictability than the volatile new EV market, appealing to a motivation for purchase certainty.

Insight: The core motivation is the calculated avoidance of financial and technological obsolescence.

Motivation Beyond the Trend: Escaping Automotive Volatility

Beyond the immediate price and technology benefits, consumers are motivated by the stability offered by the used market, escaping the volatility and supply issues plaguing the new EV sector.

Escaping Pricing Tinkerers: Buyers are motivated to avoid the new market where automakers ""tinker with pricing,"" seeking the stability and transparency of the used market.

Avoiding Supply Chain Frustration: The reality of limited-run new models (Nissan Leaf, Chevy Bolt) drives buyers to the used market, where they have a better chance of finding an available vehicle that satisfies their needs.

Lower Operating Costs: The motivation to secure lower long-term operating costs (lower fuel, less maintenance) is a rational economic decision that transcends the initial purchase price.

Insight: The secondary market provides a refuge of stability and certainty from the chaotic, high-cost primary market.

Description of Consumers: The Pragmatic Tech Adopter

Name:The Pragmatic Tech Adopter

Description: This segment is highly analytical and value-driven, possessing a strong awareness of EV benefits (performance, TCO) but refusing to pay the new-car premium. They research extensively to find the intersection of affordability and functional superiority.

Bullets:

TCO Calculator: Prioritizes the total cost of ownership (TCO), calculating fuel/maintenance savings against the purchase price.

Performance Enthusiast: Values the silent operation and immediate torque of EVs over the experience of similarly priced used gas cars.

The Smart Buyer: Views the sharp depreciation of new EVs as a benefit, allowing them to acquire near-premium technology at a substantial discount.

Insight: This consumer segment embodies the intersection of financial prudence and technological ambition.

Consumer Detailed Summary: The Value-Conscious, Performance-Seeking Buyer

Who are them:Pragmatic Tech Adopters & Second-Time EV Buyers. They often come from a background of hybrid ownership or are first-time EV buyers seeking value.

What is their age?: Broad range, likely 25-55, representing consumers who are settling into career/family but remain highly tech-aware and budget-conscious.

What is their gender?:Gender Neutral, as the motivation is rooted in economic and performance functionality.

What is their lifestyle:Commuters and Urban/Suburban Residents, benefiting from the growing charging network and prioritizing efficiency, quiet operation, and reliability for daily use.

How the Trend Is Changing Consumer Behavior: The EV Price Elasticity Test

Consumer behavior is shifting from a focus on new-car incentives to an active pursuit of used, off-lease vehicles to find the ideal price-to-technology ratio, proving the price elasticity of EV demand.

Shifting Search Habits: Consumers are now prioritizing searches for three-year-old EV models specifically to capitalize on the steepest depreciation curve and hit the mid-$20K price cluster.

Accelerated Purchase Cycle: The limited supply of used EVs forces buyers to act faster (21.5 days DOL), fundamentally altering the typical slow, cautious used-car buying process.

Brand Agnosticism (Post-Tesla): The quick turnover of non-Tesla EVs (Hyundai, Kia, Ford) shows consumers are willing to embrace a broader mix of brands, driven by the platform's value, not just one company's ecosystem.

Insight: The used market is performing a real-time price elasticity test, confirming that demand accelerates exponentially below the $30,000 threshold.

Implications Across the Ecosystem: The Secondary Market Dictates New Strategy

The performance of the used EV market has profound implications, forcing new car manufacturers to rethink pricing, incentives, and production strategies.

For Consumers:

Maximized Value: Consumers receive an unparalleled combination of technology, performance, and low TCO for a modest investment.

Predictability: The used market offers stability, allowing for more confident purchasing decisions compared to the volatile new market.

For Automakers/Dealers:

Used Vehicle Profit Center: The high turnover rate establishes the used EV segment as a new, highly profitable profit center for dealers.

New Car Price Review: Automakers are pressured to accelerate the introduction of genuinely affordable new EVs to compete with their own off-lease inventory, which is proving to be the stronger market draw.

Insight: The used EV market is the most crucial data point for determining the future cost structures of new EVs.

Strategic Forecast: The Used Supply Flood and TCO Focus

The strategic forecast suggests that the acceleration in used EV sales will continue, fueled by the imminent influx of off-lease vehicles, cementing the importance of TCO in marketing.

Massive Used Supply Wave: The coming flood of three-year-old leased EVs (vehicles bought during the initial tax credit rush) will temporarily ease the current supply constraint but keep prices competitive in the mid-market.

TCO-Centric Marketing: Automakers will shift marketing emphasis away from federal incentives to total cost of ownership (TCO), focusing on lower operating costs (fuel, maintenance) to justify the price premium of new models.

Used EV Certification Programs: Dealers and manufacturers will invest in rigorous used EV certification and battery health guarantee programs to build consumer confidence and sustain high used-car values.

Insight: The market will stabilize around a high-volume TCO-driven, certified used EV model.

Areas of Innovation (Implied by Trend): Battery Diagnostics and Secondary Market Infrastructure

Innovation must focus on reassuring used buyers about battery health and creating a seamless, transparent buying experience for these high-tech vehicles.

Certified Battery Health Report: Developing standardized, transparent battery diagnostics and reporting tools (like a CarFax for battery degradation) to address consumer fear regarding used EV battery life.

Fast-Charging Network Integration: Integrating fast-charging network subscription or credit packages into the used EV purchase to immediately improve the buyer's experience.

Predictive Pricing Tools: Creating sophisticated pricing models that accurately predict used EV value based on mileage, climate exposure, and charging history to stabilize the volatile market.

Insight: Innovation is needed to build trust and transparency into the secondary market's key risk factor: battery life.

Summary of Trends: The Electrification Principle

This trend is the rapid consumer embrace of three-year-old Electric Vehicles, driven by the value they offer in the face of high new-car prices.

Core Consumer Trend:The Value Electrification Pursuit: Seeking high-tech performance at a discounted, affordable price point.

Core Social Trend:Inflationary Adaptability: Consumers actively adapting purchasing habits to combat rising costs in high-value transactions.

Core Strategy:Secondary Market Disruption: Using off-lease supply to create the price point needed for mass EV adoption.

Core Industry Trend:Platform Validation: The broadening of sales beyond Tesla confirms the fundamental value of the EV platform across all major brands.

Core Consumer Motivation:Predictable TCO: Prioritizing long-term savings (fuel/maintenance) and price certainty over new-car status.

Core Insight:The Price Wins: The mid-$20,000 range is the definitive price threshold for mass EV adoption.

Main Trend:The Used EV Adoption Surge: The secondary market's performance is setting the pace for affordable electrification and defining the true consumer demand curve for electric vehicles.

Trend Implications for consumers and brands: Consumers gain immediate access to superior technology; automakers must quickly adjust new-car pricing to compete with their own used inventory.

Insight: The future of EV market penetration is found in its depreciation value.

Final Thought (Summary): The Silent Revolution of the Used Lot

The surge in used EV sales marks a silent, powerful revolution in the automotive sector. This trend is not about tax credits or green ambition; it's about pure economic value. As the average new car price breaks $50,000, the three-year-old EV, clustering affordably in the mid-$20,000s, has become the only viable path for the mass consumer to acquire superior technology. The rapid sales velocity across multiple brands—not just Tesla—proves that the EV platform, with its quiet performance and low operating costs, is fundamentally more attractive than an equivalent used gas car when the price is equal. The key implication is that the secondary market is currently the most effective catalyst for electrification, forcing automakers to address the critical issue of affordable new EV supply to prevent their own used vehicles from cannibalizing their market share.

Final Insight:The true mass market for EVs begins where the depreciation ends.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/9d60f9_0c6794c931174eebb93c87d38d4c926f~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1000,h_563,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/9d60f9_0c6794c931174eebb93c87d38d4c926f~mv2.png",N,,2025-11-11 22:04:54.446307

Extension has 101 centers across the state, with local agents working directly with growers to provide unbiased knowledge and leading-edge technology.
When it comes to feeding the world, we need discoveries that drive innovation, especially for small- and medium-scale farms.
Sarah Kirby, NC State Extension assistant director, said such partnerships between researchers and Extension agents are critical to the state’s agricultural future.","In what has become a nearly annual tradition, the North Carolina Plant Sciences Initiative hit the road this fall, giving researchers from multiple disciplines the chance to learn about key problems facing North Carolina agriculture.

This year’s Backroad Tour, held Sept. 29-30, took over 30 researchers from five NC State University colleges and N.C. A&T State University on a bus trip to the western part of the state.

Like tours in 2022 and 2023, this year’s expedition gave participants the chance to learn more about farm challenges and potential solutions and to build relationships with other experts, growers, agricultural leaders and Extension agents and specialists to tackle them.

As Rachel Vann, director of N.C. PSI’s platform for extension outreach and engagement, explained, “The overarching goal is to connect people who aren’t from an agricultural background with applied issues and stakeholders so they can really understand what are the problems that need to be solved, see them with their own eyes, and form teams to address those problems.”

To get to concrete solutions .. you have to have the computer scientist and the crop specialist and all of these other areas of expertise together, talking — and talking with the producers that have the challenges.

Along with staff and faculty from the N.C. PSI, participants included researchers from NC A&T and NC State’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS), College of Natural Resources, College of Engineering, College of Sciences and the Wilson College of Textiles.

As Amy Grunden, an N.C. PSI faculty affiliate and CALS’ co-interim associate dean for research, noted, “This kind of networking, along with seeing how these production operations really happen, is going to make a difference when it comes to innovation that helps our growers feed people.

“To get to concrete solutions that make a difference,” she added, “you have to have the computer scientist and the crop specialist and all of these other areas of expertise together, talking — and talking with the producers that have the challenges.”

Leveraging the N.C. Ag Analytics Platform

At the tour’s first stop at N.C. A&T State University in Greensboro, participants learned more about the N.C. Ag Analytics Platform and its capabilities, and they were encouraged to think about how it could be leveraged to address regional challenges and opportunities they’d hear about during the rest of the tour.

Funded in 2024 by the state General Assembly, the platform taps the power and potential of real-time and historical data to enable farmers to increase agricultural productivity and sustainability.

The platform is a partnership of NC State, N.C. A&T and SAS Inc. SAS’ Dominique Moon, N.C. A&T researcher Hermandeep Sharma and Ag Analytics Program Manager Brad Lewis discussed a range of platform projects designed to:

aid farmers’ decision making about soybean and dairy production

improve waste lagoon management

create interventions for producers with disabilities

centralize data from agricultural research trials

uncover patterns in consumer perceptions of value-added agricultural products

From Greensboro, the group traveled southwest toward Asheville. At a lunch stop, Joe French, assistant commissioner for agricultural services with the N.C. Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (NCDA&CS), discussed the devastating short- and long-term impacts that last year’s Hurricane Helene had on the agricultural industry on Western North Carolina (WNC) and other areas of the state, as well as the state of ongoing recovery efforts.

Seeing WNC Agriculture in Action

Participants spent the rest of the afternoon getting an up-close look at two important agricultural operations: Tri-Hishtil in Mills River and Apple Wedge Packers and Cider in Hendersonville.

Tri-Hishtil specializes in the greenhouse production of grafted plants, including seedless watermelons. Grafting involves joining the root stock of one plant with the shoot or bud of another to create plants with increased vigor and less susceptibility to soilborne diseases.

We’re only busy for six months out of the year, so every year I hope I get returning grafters. Otherwise, I’ve got to train for two weeks to get them up to speed. If you can do that cheaper with a machine, that’s a lot easier.

As he guided participants through the company’s greenhouse and grafting facility, General Manager Bert Lemkes described the need to automate the delicate, now labor-intensive grafting process in ways that don’t drive up what are already high seed costs.

“A good grafter does anywhere from 130 to 180 plants per hour,” said Lemkes, a member of the N.C. PSI Grower Advisory Council. “We’re only busy for six months out of the year, so every year I hope I get returning grafters. Otherwise, I’ve got to train for two weeks to get them up to speed. If you can do that cheaper with a machine, that’s a lot easier.”

After meeting with Lemkes, the tour group met with NC State Apple Wedge’s Greg Nix and Bryson Nix-Edney and Tom Kon, a NC State Extension apple specialist who has worked closely with them.

With a farmgate value of about $20 million, North Carolina’s apple industry ranks seventh in the nation, and Apple Wedge Packers and Cider plays an integral part.

Nix greeted the tour group in the company’s parking lot, talking over the engine noise and beeps of construction equipment completing a new 52,000-square-foot packing house and cidery.

A fifth-generation farmer, he started the packing business with his uncle in the 1980s, then began cider production in the 1990s. The family-owned company now packs and markets apples to grocery stores in the southeastern United States and beyond. A fire on Jan. 31 had destroyed the facility, but the family immediately set out to reconstruct the business.

Leading the group into a gleaming new building, Nix outlined steps the company takes to ensure sanitation, pointing out how the apples are cleaned, dried, waxed, sorted, labeled and packaged for sale.

Next, the group traveled to the family’s nearby orchard. There, Nix, Nix-Edney and Kon outlined some of the tools, technologies and management practices they use to improve production of a range of apple varieties.

Considering the ‘Real Goal’: Helping Society

Kristin Thoney-Barletta, of NC State’s Wilson College of Textiles, came away from the Apple Wedge tour with ideas to use her experience addressing challenges in military logistics and the textiles industry to solve agricultural problems.

Thoney-Barletta’s is an expert in operations research and analytics, and she’s already proposed a collaborative project to develop user-friendly artificial intelligence-driven tools to help small- and medium-scale apple farmers and packers minimize apple spoilage, maximize post-harvest labor efficiency and fulfill orders on time.

“It’s one thing for people to imagine what the problems of growers are, and it’s quite another to hear specifically from them. These are the problems they live, day in and day out,” said Thoney-Barletta, a professor and interim head of NC State’s Department of Textile and Apparel Technology and Management.

“You’re not solving a problem just because somebody thinks it is a problem. It’s a real problem, and to have the opportunity to form collaborative teams with interdisciplinary skill sets to address real problems interests me a lot,” she said.

To have the opportunity to form collaborative teams with interdisciplinary skill sets to address real problems interests me a lot.

Like Thoney-Barletta, James Reynolds appreciated getting to hear firsthand from Nix and Lemkes.

“One of the strengths of this trip is that it gives us the chance not only to hear from the people whose lives depend on these crops, but also to be in the environment that they’re in and get a better idea of what might work in that setting, under the conditions they face,” said Reynolds, an assistant research professor in electrical and computer engineering working with the N.C. PSI, the Advanced Self-Powered Systems of Integrated Sensors and Technology and the Institute for Connected Sensor-Systems.

This kind of experience reminds us not to lose sight of the real goal, to help society.

“You get to see things you might not think of if you are just working in a lab and focused on papers. This kind of experience reminds us not to lose sight of the real goal, to help society.”

Learning More About Ag Research in WNC

The next morning, the group turned its attention to the role of agricultural research and extension in Western North Carolina. They visited the Mountain Horticultural Crops Research and Extension Center in Mills River, one of 18 statewide locations operated through a partnership of CALS and the NCDA&CS.

The stop emphasized research to strengthen the region’s key agricultural industries:

Apples: Kon followed up on the discussion in Nix’s orchard the day before by showing the group his research plots. He focused on a current project that could ultimately help apple farmers make better decisions about labor-intensive production practices such as pruning, thinning and harvesting.

Kon previously connected with diverse expertise through a N.C. PSI Connecting2Grow event, and with Chenhan Xu, an assistant professor of computer science, and Edgar Lobaton, a professor of electrical and computer engineering, he is studying ways to use portable, noninvasive imaging, near-infrared and visible spectroscopy to estimate key characteristics of buds, fruitlets and mature fruits. That insight could help growers lower production costs and raise yields.

Christmas trees: North Carolina is the second-leading state in U.S. Christmas tree production, harvesting 5 million to 6 million trees a year. NC State College of Natural Resources scientist and Extension specialist Justin Whitehill discussed his efforts to better understand the molecular interactions that occur when insects and diseases attack Christmas trees and use that knowledge to create trees that withstand shifting climate conditions and shifting pest pressures. Whitehill also described a partnership with the NCDA&CS to get genetically improved seeds to the industry.

Rusty Barr added insights from his perspective as owner of Barr Evergreens in Ashe County. A member of the N.C. PSI Grower Advisory Council, Barr produces seedlings and fully grown trees for wholesale and retail markets. Hurricane Helene wiped out a quarter-million seedlings on his farm last year, while damage from deer, drought and emerging diseases are ongoing threats.

Tomatoes: Reza Shekasteband of NC State’s Department of Horticultural Science outlined efforts that support the state’s fresh market tomato industry, valued at $34 million annually. While the tomato breeding program has traditionally focused on disease resistance and flavor, Shekasteband is also working to develop compact plants that would be suitable for low-cost mechanical harvesting. Automation could be a way for growers to manage rising labor costs and shortages.

Shekasteband’s work caught the attention of tour participant Kara Peters, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering and associate dean with NC State’s College of Engineering.

After the tour, Peters joined Shekasteband, horticultural scientist Emmanuel Torres Quezada and communications professor Roy Schwartzman in proposing interdisciplinary, stakeholder-informed research to evaluate plant yield at regular time points during the plant growth cycle.

Tapping into the Ag Analytics Platform, the project could speed the breeder’s efforts to evaluate breeding lines and identify the most promising parent plants.

Engaging with Extension

In addition to learning more about WNC agricultural research, tour participants also gained insight into another asset for the region’s farmers: N.C. Cooperative Extension. Extension has 101 centers across the state, with local agents working directly with growers to provide unbiased knowledge and leading-edge technology.

Horticulture agent Karen Blaedow, of Henderson County, and Sam Marshall, an area specialized agent for the ornamental nursery and greenhouse industry, discussed ways they are collaborating with N.C. PSI-affiliated researchers to finetune their cutting-edge technology and ensure its relevance to farmers they serve.

When it comes to feeding the world, we need discoveries that drive innovation, especially for small- and medium-scale farms. That can start with experiences like these.

Sarah Kirby, NC State Extension assistant director, said such partnerships between researchers and Extension agents are critical to the state’s agricultural future.

“When it comes to feeding the world, we need discoveries that drive innovation, especially for small- and medium-scale farms,” she said. “That can start with experiences like these that provide insight not only into what happens on farms but also into the relationships that researchers can have with our Extension agents and with our agricultural colleagues to bring about positive change.”

As the tour concluded, Vann said she was excited to see bonds forming among Extension agents, specialists and researchers who took part.

“One of the things that the N.C. PSI does is catalyze diverse expertise and get it connected to agriculture,” she said. “I saw people asking a lot of questions of our stakeholders and Extension representatives, so I think this has been a really good start, and I am excited to see what comes next.”

According to a Bloomberg report citing people familiar with the matter, the facility is slated for completion by March 2026 and is expected to be India’s largest battery storage installation and among the biggest globally.

The project will be located in Khavda, Gujarat, where the Adani Group is already developing an expansive renewable energy complex spanning thousands of acres. The group’s long-term goal, Bloomberg reported, is to expand storage capacity to as much as 50 gigawatt-hours (GWh) within the next five years, signaling a decisive shift toward large-scale energy storage to complement solar and wind generation.

Battery energy storage is emerging as a crucial component of modern electricity grids, helping to stabilize systems that increasingly rely on intermittent renewable sources. As India pushes toward its national target of reaching 500 gigawatts of clean energy capacity by 2030, such storage projects will be vital. BloombergNEF data indicates that India’s total power capacity is expected to reach about 800 megawatts this year, underscoring the urgency of scaling up energy storage to meet growing demand and ensure grid reliability.

While Adani Group representatives have not yet commented on the project, Bloomberg noted that the conglomerate is in active discussions with several international technology firms to support the development. The group’s growing interest in advanced battery technology is consistent with earlier reports from August, when Bloomberg News revealed that Adani was exploring a partnership with Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD Co. for battery manufacturing ventures.

The Khavda project marks another milestone in Adani’s aggressive renewable energy expansion, which includes massive investments in solar and wind power infrastructure. If completed as planned, the new facility will not only reinforce India’s renewable energy ambitions but also position the country as a global player in large-scale energy storage innovation.",https://slguardian.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/4018c49808f97a-lk.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 22:05:00.506721

Here are some takeaways (in speaker order):

G77 and China: Their core focus is scaling up climate finance for developing countries. The representative also called for a successful outcome on the Global Goal on Adaptation and the just transition work programme, as well as an outcome on loss and damage that would lead to better coordination between the Warsaw Mechanism, the Santiago Network, and the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage (the three major loss and damage entities under the UNFCCC).

EU: The EU emphasized the importance of science, the need for major economies to show leadership, and the urgency of the Action Agenda. They noted that the EU, along with EU development banks, are the largest providers of public climate finance globally. They also called out the importance of the gender action plan talks at this COP.

Environmental Integrity Group (Mexico, Liechtenstein, Monaco, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland, and Georgia): Represented by Switzerland, the group underscored their commitment to climate science, stating that “the next global stocktake has to be anchored in evidence, even if the evidence is uncomfortable.” They also discussed the imperative to protect natural ecosystems, and are looking for coherence on loss and damage, in agreement with the G77 and China.

Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America: This group of Latin American and Caribbean countries emphasized that all actions at COP30 need to allow for “people’s right to development.” They also called out what they see as a lack of political will in developed countries to adequately address climate change and distribute climate finance.

Like-Minded Developing Countries and BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China): India spoke on behalf of both of these groups, which account for more than half the world’s population. They reaffirmed their commitments to multilateralism and international cooperation on climate change. They also called back to a core tenet of the UNFCCC, common but differentiated responsibility, which puts the onus on countries with high historic greenhouse gas emissions to take the greatest share of responsibility for reducing emissions. They called for this to be the “COP of adaptation,” and said that commitments on adaptation, like the doubling of adaptation finance by 2025, should be met.

Africa Group: The Africa Group emphasized the intersection of the climate challenge and sustainable development, and pointed to Mission 300 as an example of action on the ground. They also spotlighted the climate finance gap, and highlighted the latest work of the Fund for responding to Loss and Damage. Like almost all other groups, they mentioned the just transition work programme and the Global Goal on Adaptation. They said that adaptation indicators should include means of implementation—that is, technical, financial, and capacity-building support for developing countries.

Least Developed Countries Group (LDCs): LDC Chair Evans Njewa of Malawi called this the COP for justice and action. He outlined the stark challenges people face—from crop loss to homes destroyed by floods—and emphasized that people “deserve to live and thrive.” The LDCs stated that trust in the process needs to be restored, and called for countries to meet the adaptation finance goal due at the end of this year.

Arab Group: The group called on countries “to focus on emissions, not their sources,” and suggested that countries promote technologies like carbon capture. The statement also underscored that commitments to action are, and must remain, nationally determined.

Technical Negotiations Begin: Today’s schedule included more than 30 negotiating sessions on different agenda items, covering almost all the topics countries highlighted in their opening remarks detailed above. For additional updates on the negotiations, see the Earth Negotiations Bulletin’s comprehensive daily reports and quick highlights posted every day.

EESI Briefing: What’s on the Table for the Negotiations

Presidency Consultations: The COP30 Presidency began taking up issues that countries had wanted to add to the agenda at the last minute through a set of dialogues instead. Topics in queue include the responsibility of developed countries to provide financial assistance to developing countries, progress on—and implementation gaps in—countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs), overall outcomes of developed countries’ biennial transparency report submissions, and trade measures.

What Do They Want? With nearly 200 countries in the Paris Agreement, it is impossible to keep track of all their positions on various issues. Where does the UK stand on the deployment of renewables and energy efficiency? Does Australia support reforming COP to cap the size of the summit? What is India’s stance on carbon markets? Carbon Brief has an interactive table to answer these questions and more. Users can filter through key topics to see if a country or negotiating bloc supports a specific proposal up for negotiation.",,N,,2025-11-11 19:59:33.774133

The African Development Bank Group and the Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA) are organising a side event at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, on November 14 2025, entitled ""Mobilising Commercial Capital for Renewable Energy and Energy Access in Africa"". This session is dedicated to accelerating private investment in Africa's renewable energy and energy access sector.

The event will explore strategies for increasing private investment in renewable energy and energy access markets across Africa. It will respond to the COP30 call for scaling up climate finance mobilisation, promoting technology transfer and capacity building, and ensuring equitable access to clean energy solutions for all developing regions.

High-level speakers from SEFA Donors, African governments, private sector leaders, and international partners will participate, offering insights into overcoming barriers and leveraging innovative financing and blended finance models to unlock Africa's immense renewable energy potential.

Key topics to be discussed include:

New Commitments: announcements of new commitments to SEFA from key partners, including Germany and Italy.

Mission 300 and SEFA's Impact: in-depth look at SEFA’s role in supporting the delivery of the flagship Mission 300 initiative by the African Development Bank Group, the World Bank Group, and other partners, which aims to provide electricity to 300 million people in Africa by 2030. The session will highlight SEFA's role as a catalytic financing platform in delivering on this mission.

Mobilising Commercial Capital: strategies to accelerate private finance flows and concrete pathways for mobilising commercial investment into Africa's diverse renewable energy and energy access markets.

Africa's Green Hydrogen Ambition: exploring the role and transformation potential of green hydrogen for Africa, including how SEFA’s newly established Green Hydrogen Programme can help Africa seize this potential.

Landmark Project Achievements: showcasing tangible successes in mobilising commercial capital, such as the recent financial close of the 'Obelisk' hybrid solar and battery storage project in Egypt. Cofinanced by the African Development Bank Group, including SEFA funding, this 1.1 GW solar and 100 MW/200 MWh battery storage facility exemplifies how innovative blended finance structures can de-risk large-scale projects and accelerate Africa's energy transition.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation's fuel pool each year.
But small refiners can seek exemptions if they show the obligations would cause them significant financial hardship.
The Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuel industry trade group, criticized the waivers as harmful to farmers.
""Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,"" RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper said.","The Environmental Protection Agency said it approved 14 requests from small refineries for full or partial exemptions to the nation's biofuel blending mandates, drawing criticism from a top U.S. biofuel trade group.

The decisions effectively clear the remainder of the agency's huge backlog of such requests that had built up under former President Joe Biden's administration. The EPA had approved 140 petitions in part or in full earlier this year, and denied just 28, leaving just a handful from previous years remaining under review.

Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation's fuel pool each year. But small refiners can seek exemptions if they show the obligations would cause them significant financial hardship.

The waivers have been a lightning rod of contention between oil refiners who want to avoid costly blending obligations and biofuel advocates concerned that they eat into their market.

Under this decision, two applications were granted 100% exemptions, and 12 were granted 50% exemptions.

The Renewable Fuels Association, a biofuel industry trade group, criticized the waivers as harmful to farmers.

“That’s the question here for Madison College,” said Mattsson, who also joined the Student Senate this spring.
Mattsson, Wong and a few other students started the Green Club in April.
Now, the Green Club and the Green Team have a plan for building a new momentum toward further action.
Dozens of students have joined Green Club, but more are needed to fill the gaps where part-time participation is the general reality.","Quinn Mattsson and Noah Wong stood beside the Capital City Bike Trail on one of the last warm mornings in the fall of 2024. Greasy fast-food bags waved halfheartedly in the breeze, and dented cans glinted in the weeds. The young men surveyed the morning’s work ahead of them while donning their gardening gloves, armed only with grocery bags and smiles.

Mattsson, a second year liberal arts transfer student, led weekly litter-gathering groups through the winter– sometimes changing tactics, picking off the seed heads of invasive species when snow was too thick – and into the spring. He then formed the idea of starting a new Green Club to build a renewed sustainability mindset into the school’s identity.

“That’s the question here for Madison College,” said Mattsson, who also joined the Student Senate this spring. “How can we support the environment and care for the planet and be good stewards all in support of our driving purpose of serving our students?”

Wong, a math instructor and a friend of Mattsson, became the club’s faculty advisor. He remembers becoming more aware of sustainability issues near the end of the COVID pandemic.

Invited by a friend to a Louisiana climate conference, Wong stayed with family where they lived by a Mississippi River refinery. “The whole town was depressing. Super loud and ugly, just kind of soul-crushing. Seeing the environmental abuse kind of radicalized me, I guess,” Wong said.

Mattsson, Wong and a few other students started the Green Club in April. They found strong support from both the student body and college staff.

Around the same time the Green Club was forming, the idea of creating a sustainability-focused subcommittee of the college’s Facilities Planning and Investment Council (FPIC) has been gaining momentum.

“I was noticing all of the opportunities for the college to be good stewards of the land that we sit on,” said David LeClair, manager of the college’s Career and Employment Services. “That’s why I applied to serve on the FPIC in the fall last year. And from there, we were able to start the Green Team this year.”

The Green Team, not to be confused with the Green Club, is the new subcommittee within FPIC, which itself composes one body within the College Assembly’s Shared Governance Councils (SGC).

“MATC has already done a lot to reduce our energy footprint,” said Sylvia Ramirez, Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration. Ramirez helped spearhead the creation of the Green Team with LeClair. “Geothermal. A green roof on the health building. And of course, the solar array. But there’s a lot more that we can do on that side of things.”

Ramirez was contacted by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE), which helps colleges and universities to equip and coordinate green efforts.

“We got a lot of good information and resources from AASHE,” said Ramirez. “They focus on integrating sustainability into the curriculum, and networking institutions that are in a position to help each other.”

Reaching out to the director of the more regionally focused organization, Upper Midwest Association for Campus Sustainability (UMACS), LeClair found additional support and an even tighter network of schools working within cultural and ecological contexts like Madison’s own.

Mattsson dove right in. He began attending a month’s-long AASHE session on decarbonization, and he joined UMACS’ annual conference. “The goal is to connect ideas of sustainability and conservation to who we are and what we do,” Mattsson said.

In this energized group of leaders and students, a thread emerges. Taking action changes, one’s self-perception, and changes to this self-concept empowers one to take further action. This kind of change-and-action becomes a constructive feedback loop.

“I always cared about green issues, but I didn’t know anything about ecology and how important it is,” said LeClair, recalling his general interest and good intentions before learning about the invasive species plaguing his own property. “Once you see it and learn it, you can’t unsee it and unlearn it.”

“That moment of saying these are the things I care about and that I have the capacity to make a change in. That’s when I started to see the opportunities where I could act,” said Ramirez.

Undoubtedly, there’s a temptation to simply convince oneself or others of an appealing narrative. In business, it’s called green washing. For individuals, we might call it green signaling.

“It’s more about what actions you take out in the world,” said Wong, acknowledging the temptation to simply appear invested. Yet, he also acknowledges that we don’t have to be perfect before making an effort. “Even though I don’t know everything perfectly, doing what I can do is making a difference.”

“You want to implement the actions and understand yourself as someone who’s doing those actions,” said Mattsson. “It’s been really rewarding to try and reshape my identity as a member of these communities. I have a context. It’s not just me. I’m a part of this neighborhood and this ecosystem.”

Madison College has made great strides toward sustainability and conservation in recent history. Now, the Green Club and the Green Team have a plan for building a new momentum toward further action.

“We’re trying to put a sustainability page on the school’s website,” said Mattsson. “That doesn’t help directly with sustainability exactly, but it will help change our image of ourselves as an organization.”

In highlighting past achievements and future priorities, the aim is to acknowledge environmental stewardship as an integral part of fulfilling the mission of equipping learners.

“The goal is to promote eco-literacy, to make a plan and move forward with it,” said LeClair.

Mattsson acknowledged the weight of implications as an organization hones its mission this way.

“If we change our identity, we kind of expand our brand, and then people will expect it of us,” he said.

Challenges abound, and foremost among them are consistency and persistence.

“The biggest problem trying to do sustainability work is that we don’t have enough people who have enough time to do it,” said Mattsson.

Dozens of students have joined Green Club, but more are needed to fill the gaps where part-time participation is the general reality.

“What we need is a lot more people who want to do this in their spare time,” he added.

Beyond the immediate needs, every club at a college focused on two-year programs faces the urgent pressure of turnover. “It’s important to plan for succession,” said LeClair. “How are you going to grow and build your leadership for next semester or next year?”

“The club’s longevity is my priority,” said Mattsson. “If the club outlasts me, I’ll call that a success.”",https://www.theonlineclarion.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SolarPanelsRGB.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 19:03:29.044681

The awards announced Nov. 5 by the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) will pay for overnight chargers at 31 multifamily properties where residents typically lack at-home EV charging options, the agency said.

The reimbursement grants are sourced from the state’s Clean Fuel and Charging Infrastructure (CFCI) Program launched in 2024 with a one-time $30 million appropriation. Forty percent of the money is reserved for disadvantaged communities.

The awards are concentrated in metro Detroit suburbs such as Taylor, Allen Park, Lincoln Park, Dearborn Heights and Southfield. Other sites include Kalamazoo, Flint and Lansing.

The grants range from roughly $20,000 to $98,000 per site for installing two to ten Level 2 chargers, which typically take about 4 to 8 hours to charge a standard EV battery.

Current Charging of Birmingham is installing most of the chargers.

Large property owners receiving multiple grants include the Huron River Apartments group of Southgate and Lansing -based Simtob Management & Investment.

A new request for proposals will make another $5 million available for multifamily charging projects with grants capped at $300,000 per site.

The awards are part of ambitious targets under Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s MI Healthy Climate Plan of getting two million EV registration and deploying roughly 100,000 EV chargers by 2030. The state is far short of those targets as of this summer.

Growth in the EV market has been decelerating this year as consumers pivot toward hybrids and federal tax credits for EV buyers face repeal under the Trump administration’s rollback of clean-energy incentives.

In Michigan, the cost of EV registration is expected to rise after the state overhauled how it taxes fuel as part of a road funding deal between Republicans and Gov. Whitmer.

President Donald Trump’s anti-wind energy agenda is harming Louisiana businesses that form the backbone of America’s offshore oil and gas industry, which stands to lose billions if the president fulfills his campaign promise to end construction of offshore wind turbines.

In recent years, offshore leases have opened in state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico for offshore wind farms to be built. Wind technology has advanced, allowing for taller turbines to capture more of the Gulf region’s wind power higher up in the air. A trained workforce, built off the back of oil and gas, provided a wide base of support for the industry to expand.

On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an executive order halting construction on all offshore wind projects. The president has long expressed a dislike of wind turbines, sometimes making dubious claims that they “destroy everything,” are the “most expensive energy there is” and that they produce noise that causes cancer.

These actions and statements have slowed supply chain investments and threatened the jobs of blue-collar workers in Louisiana and nationwide, all while electricity demand is growing, in large part because of increasing numbers of large, power-hungry data centers.

There are no offshore wind projects under construction off Louisiana’s coast, but the state is deeply entwined with developments in other parts of the country. Most of the businesses working on offshore wind farms on the East Coast come from the oil and gas sector in the Gulf of Mexico.

Even without a single industrial-scale wind turbine generating electricity in Louisiana, offshore wind has so far spurred over $500 million worth of supply chain investments in the state, according to Oceantic, an offshore energy trade association with about 400 members worldwide. Almost all of Oceantic’s members work in both the wind and fossil fuel sectors, spokeswoman Stephanie Fracoeur said.

It’s the same across the Gulf South. The offshore wind sector has spurred roughly $14 billion in investments into U.S. supply chain and manufacturing companies, with nearly two-thirds coming from businesses in Republican congressional districts, according to Oceantic.

But those investments have grown risky as many offshore wind projects that were planned have been paused or scrapped altogether.

“Oil and gas hasn’t been exceptionally busy over the last decade, so offshore wind was helping keep many of these companies in business,” Francoeur said. “Unfortunately, these policy changes have put a pause on things … The federal actions have been crippling for hundreds of American businesses that were planning on this work.”

State Rep. Joe Orgeron, R-Golden Meadow, represents an area of the state that has invested and made a lot of money in the wind industry. Lafourche Parish is home to shipbuilders, metal fabricators, ocean crane operators and many other companies in the offshore energy sector. Having once built and serviced the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, these businesses on the bayou were called on to do the same thing for offshore wind farms along the East Coast, Orgeron said.

Orgeron, a former Nicholls State University professor with a doctorate in experimental physics, once managed his family’s offshore vessel business and helped it expand into the wind sector. Like other companies, they didn’t abandon oil and gas; they expanded into wind energy because it offered a stable revenue stream to offset volatile fossil fuel commodity prices, he said. While an abundant oil supply and low fuel costs are good for consumers, Louisiana’s energy service sector hits the doldrums when profit margins lead exploration companies to press pause on their Gulf drilling plans.

“For 60 years, we went through economic booms and busts, and it’s just so nice to know there’s an alternative market where your identical expertise is required and appreciated,” Orgeron said. “I really don’t wanna see one of our down-the-bayou operators lose an alternative revenue stream that’s not tied to the price of oil.”

A handful of offshore wind projects are still in progress on the East Coast, where dozens of Louisiana oil-and-gas service companies are now working.

Jake Cheramie is the general manager of Encore Group, a company in Houma that provides cooks, cleaners, crane operators and other personnel to offshore work sites. Just a few years ago, all of Encore’s clientele were in the oil and gas sector, but Cheramie said Encore gravitated to East Coast wind energy development in 2021. It now encompasses roughly 20% of their business, he said.

“Most of the major vessels in lower Lafourche are up in the Northeast working now, and that’s cool to see,” Cheramie said. “It’s been good to us. I certainly don’t wanna see offshore wind go away.”

Oceantic categorizes Encore as one of many auxiliary services businesses that work for one of Louisiana’s 42 offshore energy companies that currently hold active wind contracts.

Much of the work has gone to shipyards that build vessels that specialize in offshore construction. For instance, Edison Chouest Offshore in Cut Off spearheaded construction of the $97 million Eco Edison vessel for Revolution Wind, a wind farm project off the Rhode Island coast, and other East Coast projects. That single contract, one among several others like it, employed nearly 600 Edison Chouest workers across multiple states.

About a year ago, Encore opened an office in Rhode Island to support its personnel working on the Revolution Wind project. That wind farm made headlines Aug. 22 when the Trump administration rescinded its federal permit and issued a stop-work order, citing vague national security concerns. Scheduled to come online in early 2026, the $5 billion project was about 80% complete at that time.

Revolution Wind sued the Trump administration, and a federal judge sided with the company a month later, ruling the government’s actions “arbitrary and capricious” and unsupported by any evidence of national security concerns.

The judge’s temporary injunction allowed the company to resume work for the time being, but the order is temporary and could change if the Trump administration succeeds on appeal. The setback has already cost Revolution Wind $77 million, according to company officials who also blamed Trump’s anti-wind policies and tariffs for increasing the cost of steel and other construction materials.

It’s a new reality that Encore and other businesses are having to grapple with. The part of their business model that was the most stable just a year ago has suddenly become shaky.

“Louisiana is going to be one of the hardest-hit areas,” Francoeur said. “Once the current projects are completed, some of those companies will have idle shipyards or idle vessels.”

Cheramie said Encore is working on other offshore wind projects in New Jersey and Virginia but worries about losing them if the Trump administration continues to target the industry. If things stay on track, Encore should have steady work for another two to three years, he said, admitting new contracts for future jobs are now hard to come by.

“There’s been quite a few projects that aren’t being permitted or may be canceled,” Cheramie said.

The pause is largely due to Trump’s executive orders, pausing all wind leases and permitting. He has followed those up with actions that have made business particularly difficult for wind and solar companies, including directing his Commerce Department to investigate the wind sector for any national security implications and directing his Interior Department to block the nation’s largest solar project, which was planned for federal land in Nevada.

“Things are likely not to move forward in the next couple of years because of the actions by the Trump administration to essentially put a pause on federal permitting for offshore projects,” said Madelyn Smith with the renewable energy industry group Southeastern Wind Coalition.

One example is RWE Wind, a German company that held the first federal wind lease off the coast of Louisiana in addition to leases on the East and West coasts. It scrapped all three projects this year and laid off 73 of its U.S. employees after Trump started his assault on the wind sector, according to a Reuters report. The company said it is focusing on onshore wind and solar for the time being while still holding onto its offshore leases.",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/eco_edison-2048x1365-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 19:03:33.320399

The court unanimously approved the resolution for establishing the PACE program Monday, Nov. 10 after hearing from Texas PACE Authority President Charlen Heydinger and Breckenridge Economic Development Corporation CEO Michael Paris.

Authorized by the Texas Legislature in 2013, the PACE program allows cities and counties to create voluntary financing mechanisms that allow commercial, multi-family and industrial property owners to fund upgrades to HVAC systems, lighting, roofing and plumbing–all without using taxpayer dollars or assuming financial risk.

“We see this as increasing the probability of local businesses taking advantage in order to develop their infrastructure–their cooling needs or heating needs. Any efficiency within their manufacturing process,” Paris said. “It’s also going to help us in attracting businesses here. So if we can articulate a way which a business that’s coming here or a business that’s currently here can take advantage of discounts on the interest rates for banks. And also reconsideration of terms…I think it’s going to help the business community be successful here in Breckenridge.”

“Stephens County–and all counties don’t have the expectations to operate these programs and the amazing thing about PACE is that we can contract them to administer the program,” County Judge Michael Roach said. “That really leaves us hands off for the most part.”

Heydinger signed the contract to officially begin the process of administering the program and get it off the ground. The Texas Pace Authority president had explained the inner workings of the program and its potential impact at a previous commissioners court meeting on Monday, Oct. 27.

“What you would be doing if you create your PACE program is you create a mechanism that eliminates the risk for lenders,” Heydinger explained last month. “So lenders will loan over a longer period of time, and if you stretch our financing long enough, the savings will exceed the cost.”",https://www.breckenridgeamerican.com/sites/breckenridgeamerican.com/files/field/image/WEB%20IMG_9948.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 22:06:13.228149

“Everyone is saying prices are going up,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. ""Nobody is saying prices are coming down.""

Wolfe said rising costs for electricity and natural gas will make home heating more expensive for most families this winter. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association projects average home heating costs will rise 7.6%, from $907 last winter to about $976 this season. Families using electric heat will see the biggest jump — up 10.2% to about $1,205 — while natural gas costs are expected to rise from $639 to $693.

The organization, which represents state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, said electricity and natural gas prices have been climbing at more than twice the rate of inflation, driven by higher gas prices, growing demand from data centers and grid maintenance.

“Electric utilities are rebuilding the grid, and that’s pushing up prices,” Wolfe said. “Data centers are also placing new demands on the grid, which is driving up costs even more.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2025–26 Winter Fuels Outlook, the majority of Americans heat their homes with natural gas or electric heat, with 46% using natural gas and 43% using electricity. The EIA’s outlook is less bullish, forecasting the average electricity bill will rise about 4% from November through March 2026, to a national average of about $1,130.

For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter. The EIA expects heating oil and propane costs to fall by just under 10%, while NEADA predicts savings closer to 5%.

“The United States of America is as dumb as we want to be on this topic, but the state of California is not,” Newsom declared to delegates. “And so we are going to assert ourselves, we’re going to lean in, and we are going to compete in this space.”

Newsom, one of Trump’s most outspoken political opponents and a potential 2028 presidential contender, highlighted California’s commitment to green technology and renewable energy. The state, with the world’s fourth-largest economy, has seven times more renewable energy jobs than fossil fuel positions and is home to electric vehicle pioneer Tesla.

At an investors’ summit in São Paulo earlier in the week, Newsom described the absence of federal climate leadership as “jaw-dropping,” noting that U.S. inaction risks ceding the booming clean energy market to China. “China is flooding the zone and will dominate in the next great global industry,” he said.

Despite the tropical heat, Newsom emphasized a nonpartisan approach, pointing to climate initiatives under Republican California presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. “We can’t do this without all of you,” he told COP30 attendees. “We’re here with an open hand, not a closed fist.”

The governor is expected to meet with officials from multiple nations, as well as subnational leaders, including the governor of Brazil’s Pará state, the summit’s host region.

Neighbors have warned that toxins and heavy metals like arsenic still remain at the site, though the state agency has said environmental remediation on the site is complete.
What they found was “what experts typically see on industrial properties like this one,” according to Related Midwest.
NietoGomez said the coalition is currently reviewing the entire environmental remediation plan, which spans more than 5,000 pages.
“This is why we need to have a community benefits agreement because that should have been done before they start construction,” she said.","Developers behind the forthcoming quantum computing campus at the former U.S. Steel South Works plant have submitted remediation plans to the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency. But neighborhood organizations are still pushing for more assurances that they’ll benefit from the site’s transformation into a technology hub.

Related Midwest and CRG voluntarily re-enrolled the 440-acre site in South Chicago last month into the environmental agency’s site remediation program. Their remediation plan is currently under review by the IEPA, according to a spokesperson for Related Midwest.

The former steel mill closed in 1992, and various redevelopment plans for the site withered over the years — in part, because of environmental concerns lingering at the site.

Neighbors have warned that toxins and heavy metals like arsenic still remain at the site, though the state agency has said environmental remediation on the site is complete. The agency issued “No Further Remediation” letters for the land in 1997 and 2010, after previous cleanup efforts.

A No Further Remediation letter verifies site investigation and remediation has been completed and meets state cleanup standards, according to the state agency.

Once the developers receive a new letter, construction will officially be able to start, though Related Midwest and CRG did hold a ceremonial groundbreaking in September on the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park.

The park is a 128-acre portion of the massive project dubbed Quantum Shore Chicago. Quantum Shore will also be home to housing and a 52-bed Advocate Health Care hospital.

Soil and water tests

Related Midwest worked with Little Village-based Pioneer Engineering and Environmental Services to complete soil and groundwater testing at Quantum Shore.

What they found was “what experts typically see on industrial properties like this one,” according to Related Midwest.

The developer also said the “vast majority” of results are consistent with previously completed tests, though five areas within 1,200 feet of nearby homes contain petroleum levels “that exceed today’s cleanup standards.”

The testing also found petroleum hydrocarbons, metals and other isolated substances in soil and groundwater.

Related Midwest said it will be installing an engineered barrier around the site to “protect air quality, minimize respiratory health risks, and improve safety on and around the site.” The developer will also excavate and dispose of contaminants in two areas that are closest to residential areas and install dust monitors.

The barrier around the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park is estimated to cost $25 million, according to the company, while the “remainder of the development area [will] cost more than $100 million over the life of the project.”

Community benefits agreement

Brian Gladstein, executive director of the nonprofit Friends of the Parks, was “not surprised” to hear the findings.

“What we have heard from community folks for a long time is the belief that the land is polluted and there needs to be remediation,” Gladstein said. “There needs to be a commitment by [Related Midwest] to remediate that land and to make it safe for the community.”

In the past, Friends of the Parks has taken the legal route to protect Chicago’s lakefront and conserve its open space. At the old South Works site, the nonprofit is calling for the developers and elected officials to commit to four key benefits for the Southeast Side community.

The nonprofit wants the establishment of a fund to benefit residents, along with a framework plan for the Southeast lakefront. Their Southeast Side Parks Benefits and Commitments plan also demands full remediation of the land and ongoing environmental monitoring, plus a guarantee that public spaces remain open, accessible and free of surveillance.

Friends of the Parks released its call for commitments on Oct. 28. Gladstein said it fits within the broader push for a legally-binding community benefits agreement and efforts to protect the area’s green space.

“For too long, there’s been a lack of equity on the Southeast Side, where other parks are getting resources,” he said. “This is the moment, with this massive development that is moving forward, for us to make sure that the community is not left behind.”

Since the quantum project was announced, the Coalition for a South Works CBA has been one of the leading community voices — presenting updated demands for community benefits in early September. The group includes residents and more than 40 organizations like the Alliance of the Southeast, as well as businesses and churches.

Amalia NietoGomez, executive director of the Alliance of the Southeast, said work for a community benefits agreement is ongoing. The coalition and Friends of the Parks are pushing for meetings with Related Midwest and elected officials to discuss their concerns — and hopes — for the site, even as work begins.

NietoGomez said the coalition is currently reviewing the entire environmental remediation plan, which spans more than 5,000 pages.

While NietoGomez said the coalition is happy the report has been submitted, she thinks it should’ve been filed sooner.

“This is why we need to have a community benefits agreement because that should have been done before they start construction,” she said. “That should have been in discussions with the community.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f7c9063/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3048x1740+0+138/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa9%2Fad%2Facbeab45ad2d666685bd0aebb48d%2Fsweet-cst-070614-south-works-aerialjpg.JPG,N,,2025-11-11 18:07:01.320600

Jones, www.facebook.com, WesleyMuller.news",,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/11/11/epa-suit-smittys/,"The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, filed their lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply on Nov. 5 with a federal court in New Orleans.
The infractions culminated with the Aug. 22 explosion at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland.
Attorneys for Smitty’s Supply have not responded to a request for comment.
Garside represents the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, an environmental advocacy group planning to sue Smitty’s Supply.
Companies are rarely made to pay the maximum penalties in these kinds of cases, Garside said, but even lesser fines can lead a company like Smitty’s Supply into bankruptcy.","Louisiana and federal officials are taking legal action against Smitty’s Supply Inc., seeking fines and penalties that could exceed a billion dollars for years of environmental violations and the recent industrial fire and mass spillage at its petroleum products plant in Tangipahoa Parish.

An attorney for private litigants worries that such a high amount, if awarded, could become an obstacle for neighbors and local businesses seeking their own reparations.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, filed their lawsuit against Smitty’s Supply on Nov. 5 with a federal court in New Orleans. They allege a long list of violations of the federal Clean Water Act and similar state laws and regulations for incidents going back nearly five years. The infractions culminated with the Aug. 22 explosion at the Smitty’s Supply facility in Roseland.

“Plaintiffs ask this Court to hold Defendant accountable for unlawfully polluting the Nation’s and the State’s waters, and to require Defendant to take all appropriate measures to prevent future spills or discharges,” the lawsuit states.

Attorneys for Smitty’s Supply have not responded to a request for comment.

Its Roseland plant, which bottles and manufactures a wide variety of oils, fluids and petrochemical products for distribution to automotive and industrial retailers, was almost completely destroyed in the August disaster. Storage tanks and drums holding as much as 11 million gallons of hazardous substances caught fire, with some exploding. The fire took two weeks to fully extinguish while millions of gallons of oil and chemicals stored at the plant contaminated public land and waterways, reaching as far as 47 miles downstream on the Tangipahoa River, according to the EPA.

Flowing through a series of ditches and channels, the hazardous substances entered the river through at least four separate points of entry, the lawsuit notes.

The EPA estimates cleanup crews have recovered oily waste and petroleum-based materials totaling 11 million gallons, which matches the facility’s storage capacity, from nearby ponds, rivers and drainage channels.

Clay Garside, an environmental litigator with the New Orleans-based Waltzer, Wiygul & Garside law firm, said he’s concerned the government’s lawsuit could leave little money for Tangipahoa residents and other private litigants with claims related to the disaster. Garside represents the Louisiana Environmental Action Network, an environmental advocacy group planning to sue Smitty’s Supply.

“To the extent they have to pay penalties, it takes away available funds to compensate folks,” Garside said.

Neither the U.S. Department of Justice nor Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill’s office would offer further comment on the case.

Shortly before the government filed its complaint, Garside said U.S. Department of Justice attorneys contacted him to ask about Louisiana Environmental Action Network claims and to confirm a filing deadline, adding that he expected its lawsuit to be filed before his.

Companies are rarely made to pay the maximum penalties in these kinds of cases, Garside said, but even lesser fines can lead a company like Smitty’s Supply into bankruptcy.

The state’s claims in the lawsuit carry significantly lighter penalties of up to $32,500 per violation per day.

Smitty’s has filed its own lawsuit, blaming the disaster on two other businesses — the New York-based Fulton Thermal Corp., whuch manufactures industrial boiler tanks, and Baton Rouge’s J&M Boiler Combustion Control Services, which installs and maintains the tanks. Smitty’s alleges the boiler malfunctioned, exploded and caused the fire but hasn’t said how or why it malfunctioned.

State and federal environmental officials have been unable to determine what started the fire but discovered numerous violations of laws and environmental regulations they allege could have prevented the disaster or mitigated its impacts.

They accuse Smitty’s of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations.

The agencies allege the company failed to implement EPA-required plans for oil spill prevention and emergency response and repeatedly failed to comply with other laws regulating pollutant discharges during the years leading up to the fire.

Lawsuit details prior violations

The state and EPA complaint cites hundreds of previous wastewater discharge, pollution reporting and permit exceedance violations going back three years, as well as seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that reached offsite and contaminated public areas.

One occurred July 21, 2024, involving 950 gallons of hydraulic oil that spilled from a burst railcar transfer line. While cleaning up the initial spill, the oil spilled a second time when the facility’s oil-water separator tank overflowed. It went into a ditch along U.S. Highway 51, flowed into a nearby creek and then to a private pond, creating 14,000 gallons of contaminated material that had to be removed, the complaint states.

Another spill the following month, on Aug. 30, 2024, involved a 55-gallon drum of Navilan Yellow 73, a dye added to other fluids for the purpose of detecting spills and leaks. The dye spilled into a drainage ditch along Highway 51 and migrated to a pond on private property. It’s unclear if it was the same pond that had been contaminated the month before.

The lawsuit discusses some of the impacts the most recent incident had on the Tangipahoa River, which flows into Lake Pontchartrain, though officials have said the contaminants were blocked before reaching the lake. The incident shut down a 47-mile-long section of the river, which only recently reopened after being closed to the public for over two months.

“Defendant’s unauthorized discharge … was toxic to human, plant, or animal life or significantly increased health risks due to exposure to the substances or consumption of contaminated fish or other aquatic life,” the filing states.

Recovery and cleanup efforts in the area are still ongoing more than two months after the incident, and the court filing points out that oil and other hazardous substances on the site still pose risk.

“As of the filing of this Complaint, the cleanup of the discharge is ongoing, but there is still a threat of another discharge if there is a significant rainfall event,” the lawsuit states. “Although a temporary storm water collection is in place at the Facility, it may not be able to withstand significant rainfall.”

One of the EPA’s claims carries a potential penalty of up to $7,093 per barrel of oil discharged. With 11 million gallons of waste recovered, that penalty could total as much as $1.8 billion if the court finds the company acted with “gross negligence or willful misconduct” and awards the maximum fine. Potential penalties for the other claims listed could reach hundreds of millions.

Is Tesla’s energy storage bet the right move, or should the company be doubling down on affordable EVs instead?","Tesla is ramping up hiring for its $200 million Megapack battery factory in Brookshire, Texas, just outside Houston, with 41 positions currently posted and a job fair scheduled for the week of November 10, 2025. The facility represents Tesla’s aggressive push into utility-scale energy storage at a time when its automotive division faces mounting challenges from expired tax credits and intensifying competition.

The Houston-area factory will mirror Tesla’s successful Lathrop, California facility, producing 10,000 utility-scale Megapack batteries annually—equivalent to 40 gigawatt hours (GWh) of energy storage capacity. This expansion comes as Tesla’s energy business has emerged as a bright spot in the company’s portfolio, with recent quarters showing the division outperforming the struggling automotive segment.

1,500 Advanced Manufacturing Jobs Coming to Waller County

Tesla has committed to employ at least 375 people at the new facility in Empire West Business Park by the end of 2026, according to tax abatement agreements approved by the Waller County Commissioners Court in March 2025. That figure increases to at least 750 by the end of 2027 and must reach 1,500 by the end of 2028, a level the company must maintain for a decade to qualify for its tax breaks.

Current job openings span the full manufacturing spectrum, from welders and technical writers to senior manufacturing engineers and various management roles. Ramiro Bautista, project manager for the city of Brookshire’s economic development department, told the Houston Business Journal that Tesla will hold a job fair the week of November 10 to accelerate hiring.

“We are building the future of energy right here in Waller County,” a Tesla representative stated at the March commissioners court meeting. “This facility will not only bring cutting-edge technology to the region but will also create long-term, high-quality jobs that support families and communities.”

Massive Investment in Automation and Robotics

Tesla is investing heavily in advanced manufacturing technology for the Brookshire facility. The company plans to spend $44 million on real estate improvements and $150 million on cutting-edge manufacturing equipment, including automated robotic welding cells and robotic assembly stations.

The facility will lease two massive buildings in Empire West Business Park, a thriving industrial development by Dallas-based Stream Realty Partners. Tesla has been leasing the 1.04 million-square-foot Building 9 since 2022, though a third-party logistics company previously occupied the space. The company is now taking full control to manufacture Megapacks for global distribution.

As part of the tax abatement agreement, Tesla must maintain a minimum of $75 million in taxable inventory by January 1, 2026, which will increase to $300 million after three years—ensuring long-term economic benefits for schools, public services, and infrastructure projects in Waller County.

Energy Business Emerges as Tesla’s Growth Engine

The Houston Megafactory expansion comes as Tesla’s energy storage business has become one of the company’s strongest performers. In the third quarter of 2025, Tesla deployed a record 12.5 GWh of energy storage products, with the energy division now representing approximately 25% of overall company revenue.

The contrast with Tesla’s automotive business is stark. While EV deliveries are down 6% year-to-date through September 2025, energy storage deployments have surged. The energy division achieved gross margins of 30% in recent quarters—significantly higher than the 17% margins in automotive—making it Tesla’s most profitable business segment on a percentage basis.

“The energy business is doing extremely well, and the opportunity ahead is gigantic,” CEO Elon Musk said during a recent earnings call, predicting the division will eventually surpass automotive in total gigawatt hours deployed.

Shanghai Megafactory Already Ramping Production

Tesla’s Houston facility will be the company’s third major Megapack manufacturing plant, following its original Lathrop, California facility and the recently operational Shanghai Megafactory. The Shanghai plant began production in February 2025 and produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter, with the company stating it’s on track to match the 40 GWh annual capacity of the Lathrop facility.

The rapid expansion of Megapack manufacturing capacity reflects surging global demand for utility-scale battery energy storage systems. These massive batteries help stabilize electrical grids by storing energy from intermittent renewable sources like solar and wind, then dispatching that power when needed. Each Megapack can store over 3 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy—enough to power approximately 3,600 homes for one hour.

Major customers for Tesla’s Megapacks include utility providers like Intersect Power and even Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI, which purchased $191 million in Megapack products in 2024 to power its data centers.

Texas Cements Position as Tesla’s Manufacturing Hub

The Houston-area Megafactory reinforces Texas’s status as Tesla’s primary U.S. manufacturing base. The company relocated its corporate headquarters from California to Texas in December 2021, and its Gigafactory Texas in Austin has become a critical production hub for the Model Y, Cybertruck, and the upcoming Cybercab robotaxi.

Justin Beckendorff, Waller County Precinct 4 Commissioner, expressed enthusiasm about the economic impact during the March commissioners court meeting.

“We are super excited about this opportunity—1,500 advanced manufacturing jobs in the county and in the city,” he said.

The facility is expected to generate significant spillover benefits for the region. Local suppliers, logistics companies, and retail businesses will benefit from Tesla’s workforce spending, while the Empire West Business Park could attract additional high-tech tenants, reinforcing Brookshire’s emergence as an innovation hub west of Houston.

EVXL’s Take

Here’s what the mainstream coverage is missing: this hiring push reveals where Tesla sees its actual future, and it’s not primarily in selling cars. While the automotive division struggles with collapsing European sales, executive departures, and post-tax-credit demand erosion, the energy storage business is absolutely printing money with those 30% gross margins.

The timing is particularly revealing. Tesla is launching a major manufacturing hiring initiative just as the September 30, 2025 federal EV tax credit expiration makes its vehicles instantly $7,500 more expensive. That’s not coincidence—that’s strategic allocation of capital toward the business line that doesn’t depend on government subsidies or consumer sentiment about Elon Musk’s political activities.

The Houston Megafactory also represents Tesla’s response to a genuine market need. As battery makers pivot to energy storage amid soft EV demand, Tesla is already years ahead with operational Megafactories and a proven product. The company’s Q2 2025 earnings showed energy storage revenue hit $3.04 billion, up 176% year-over-year, while automotive revenue declined.

But let’s be clear about the competitive landscape: Tesla faces intense pressure from Chinese manufacturers in energy storage just as it does in EVs. The Shanghai Megafactory is already dealing with Chinese competitors offering complete battery systems at prices 60-70% lower than Tesla’s. The company’s Megapack pricing has dropped 51% in China over the past year, from approximately $1.15/Wh to $0.56/Wh, while Chinese manufacturers quote as low as $0.15/Wh for some systems.

The Houston facility’s success will depend on whether Tesla can leverage automation and American manufacturing incentives to compete on cost while maintaining the quality and integration advantages that have made Megapacks the preferred choice for major utility-scale projects. With 1,500 high-paying manufacturing jobs on the line and Waller County’s economic future partly riding on this facility, the stakes extend well beyond Tesla’s corporate balance sheet.

For EV enthusiasts watching Tesla’s evolution, this Houston expansion crystallizes a truth we’ve been tracking: Tesla is transforming from an automotive company that sells batteries into an energy infrastructure company that also happens to make cars. The question is whether that transformation happens fast enough to offset the challenges mounting in the vehicle business.

In Madison Hall, flickering lights and dilapidated laundry rooms reflect neglect and unclear maintenance responsibility. Masur Hall faces its own problems, with broken thermostats, faulty locks and crumbling infrastructure, adding to students’ frustration. Madison and Masur Hall are exterior corridor residence halls designed for shared living. Each room houses two students and includes a shared bathroom with two suitemates, creating a small, close-knit living environment.

Sophomore computer science major Tanzif Avishek said persistent inconveniences have defined his time in Madison Hall.

“One of the issues I experienced in Madison was electrical problems. Sometimes, some of the power outlets would suddenly stop working, seemingly for no reason,” Avishek said.

Also, when students head to the laundry room, they face even more frustration.

Over in Masur Hall, Rajshree, a sophomore pre-nursing major, had similar complaints.

“The thermostat in our lobby was broken for weeks, and the bathroom locks are still a mess,” she said. “Housing should really check on dorms frequently instead of waiting for us to complain.”

When it comes to the gradual wear and tear of dormitories, the answer is clear: students already pay to live on campus, and maintaining livable conditions should never fall on them.

Greenidge’s legal battle began in 2022 when the DEC denied its air permit for CLCPA noncompliance.
At the time, local climate advocacy group Seneca Lake Guardian lauded her action and encouraged her to “finish the job” by shutting Greenidge Generation down completely.

Seneca Lake Guardian is upset with Hochul’s decision.","Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...

Bitcoin mining company Greenidge Generation has reached an agreement with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation for an air permit at its site on the western shore of Seneca Lake. The move ends active litigation between the two parties.

The agreement includes an emissions reduction of 44 percent for permitted greenhouse-gas emissions by 2030, along with a mandate for a 25 percent reduction from Greenidge’s actual emissions. It also requires the company to submit a permit modification application.

“The agreement holds Greenidge Generation accountable to new proposed permit conditions that are protective of the community and brings the Greenidge facility in line with greenhouse gas and co-pollutant emissions levels consistent with the (Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act),” a statement from DEC reads.

Greenidge noted that its status as a quick-dispatch power generator will aid the state’s power grid amid increased electricity demand. The facility is a retrofitted natural gas-powered plant with a capacity of 106 to 108 megawatts. Greenidge took over the location in 2017 and began proof-of-work cryptomining in 2019. The company also has cryptocurrency facilities in Mississippi, North Dakota and South Carolina.

“This new permit includes historic emissions reductions that go far beyond anything required by the CLCPA or ever implemented in New York and validates our national model cryptocurrency operation, which does not pull power from the grid, but rather sends power to it daily,” says Greenidge President Dale Irwin in a statement.

The local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers also spoke in support of the decision.

Greenidge’s legal battle began in 2022 when the DEC denied its air permit for CLCPA noncompliance. Over the following three years and legal fights, Gov. Kathy Hochul signed a temporary moratorium on cryptomining.

At the time, local climate advocacy group Seneca Lake Guardian lauded her action and encouraged her to “finish the job” by shutting Greenidge Generation down completely. However, Greenidge was exempted from the moratorium and Hochul declined to push any further legislation.

Greenidge also caught another break from the state last year when DEC’s permit denial was annulled, laying the groundwork for this agreement and permit renewal.

Now, both the state and Greenidge will withdraw their appeals and discontinue the pending administrative hearing.

“While this process has been lengthy, we thank the Hochul Administration and the current team at NYSDEC for allowing the law and the facts to drive policy. We’re pleased with this tough, fair new permit, and happy to put this process where it has belonged for years – in the rear-view mirror,” Irwin says.

Local climate advocates, however, slammed DEC’s decision. They claim that Greenidge’s facility has negatively impacted the region by increasing gas emissions, polluting water with thermal discharge, and contaminating groundwater used for the region’s agriculture, especially in its wineries.

“Originally, they said it was only going to be operated as a ‘peaker-plant.’ It was only going to operate about 6 percent of the year, and only do that to provide power to the public in times of high demand,” says Yvonne Taylor, president of Seneca Lake Guardian. “Then, once they got up and running, they installed these bitcoin mining machines and the power being produced was not going to the public, but to fuel these machines.”

“Along with that, they’re raining down things like formaldehyde, mercury, lead, benzine, on to our homes, our farms, and our vineyards. Those places are (the region’s) lifeblood,” Taylor continues. “Seneca Lake is also a drinking water source for over 100,000 people. Greenidge is allowed to withdraw up to 139 million gallons of water every single day and dump it in hot back into the lake, an area where we’re already experiencing increasing harmful algae blooms, a toxin to humans and animals.”

Seneca Lake Guardian filed a lawsuit in 2023 to shut the Greenidge Generating Station. The suit was dismissed in federal court later that same year.

Seneca Lake Guardian is upset with Hochul’s decision.

“She put out her own press release applauding the region for getting these accolades of being the best viticulture area in the country,” Taylor says of Hochul. “Yet at the same turn, she’s letting us down by capitulating to Greenidge.”

Eric Wood, senior environmental program coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group, says, “The Governor has been ordered by the State’s courts to follow the Climate Law, but her decision to approve permits for the Greenidge fracked gas power plant for a private cryptomining facility flouts that order. “

Taylor also levied criticism against Greenidge’s impact on the local economy. She says it overemphasizes its impact on jobs in the local economy. In the past, the company has said that it created around 40 to 50 full-time jobs with additional impact through electricians and other contracted work.

“Tourism in the Finger Lakes is our driving economy engine,” Taylor outlines instead. “It brings in $4 billion worth of revenue into New York State’s economy every year and supports 60,000 jobs.”

For his part, Irwin says that the data center has brought high–tech jobs and opportunity to a region of New York which “has been economically underserved for far too long.”

An evidentiary hearing for Greenidge’s air permit renewal application has been scheduled for next week.

However, genuine sustainability must start with each individual’s mindset and daily actions, from planting trees and flowers to embracing broader goals such as green transformation and green economy.","The draft documents of the 14th National Party Congress emphasise environmental protection, effective climate change adaptation, and the promotion of a green and circular economy as central tasks alongside socio-economic development, reflecting the Party’s deep commitment to sustainable growth built on the three interlinked pillars of economy, society, and environment.

A key highlight of the draft is the elevation of environmental protection to a central mission alongside economic and social progress, signalling a new and comprehensive understanding of sustainability in the current context.

Harmonising economic growth with environmental protection, or safeguarding the environment to ensure sustainable economic development, is considered the cornerstone of lasting prosperity. From this perspective, the Party affirms that environmental protection is a central and inseparable task closely tied to economic and social development.

Vietnam’s policies and international commitments make clear that the transition toward a green, circular, and low-carbon economy is the pathway to sustainable development. It is essential to abandon short-term, profit-driven approaches that neglect environmental responsibilities and to remain steadfast in the principle of not sacrificing the environment for economic gain.

Commenting on the draft, Dr. Truong Ba kien, Deputy Director of the Centre for Meteorology and Climatology under the Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change at Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, emphasised that the inclusion of environmental protection and climate adaptation is both timely and necessary, aligning with Vietnam’s real-world challenges. He noted that proactive and effective adaptation to climate change is a trend that Vietnam must continue to pursue in the years ahead.

To enhance resilience to extreme weather and climate-related disasters, relevant agencies need to comprehensively upgrade real-time forecasting and early warning systems, integrating meteorological, hydrological, radar, and reservoir data. The use of AI, Big Data, and ensemble modelling will help detect hazardous weather patterns early. Multi-channel public alerts, regular drills, and inter-regional coordination mechanisms should also be strengthened.

In parallel, Vietnam should standardise and expand inter-reservoir operations, improve dam safety monitoring, and promote reforestation. Developing flood and landslide risk maps using satellite data and LiDAR technology will support evidence-based planning. Building green infrastructure such as water-absorbent urban systems, maintaining natural floodways, and ensuring data sharing across regions are also crucial to balancing development with watershed safety.

Localities are urged to integrate climate adaptation into regional and provincial planning, establish AI- and IoT-based early warning systems, and enhance climate risk management capacity for local authorities. Promoting nature-based and green development models and nurturing a culture of preparedness will help build safer, more resilient communities.

According to Dr. Mai Van Khiem, Director of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, Vietnam must continue modernising its observation technologies, expanding monitoring networks, and applying artificial intelligence to improve forecasting accuracy, particularly for extreme weather events. He also underlined the need for clear, concise, and accessible communication to ensure early warnings reach vulnerable communities.

Strengthened coordination between meteorological agencies, local governments, disaster response units, and media outlets is vital to translating forecasts into effective action. Public education and training in disaster preparedness should be expanded, with climate and environmental awareness integrated into school curricula.

Le Thi Dinh, Secretary of Xuan Non hamlet Party Cell in Hanoi' Thu Lam commune, noted that recognising environmental protection as a core development pillar provides a new benchmark for all socio-economic policies. However, genuine sustainability must start with each individual’s mindset and daily actions, from planting trees and flowers to embracing broader goals such as green transformation and green economy. She also stressed the importance of environmental education at all levels to foster a “green living” consciousness among citizens, laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient future./.VNA",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2025/11/11/draft-party-document-highlights-climate-and-green-development-c897a331809943c7b2e1b47838c96a38-1831.webp?width=0&s=KXkoY5bHvBq8QnbmBe3g3w,N,,2025-11-11 16:07:53.445878

She adapted her analysis to calculate how much Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia customers were overpaying for OVEC power versus what power from the market cost.
Gary, of the Kentucky Resources Council, said replacement parts for coal plants are getting scarce.
“Those commissioners are walking a political very fine line if they ever move to undo ties to coal plants,” she said.","In October, Louisville Gas & Electric and Kentucky Utilities and other parties came to an agreement in a case before the Kentucky Public Service Commission.

Under it, KU customers would pay $9 more a month on average, and LG&E customers would pay $5. The Kentucky commission would have to approve the pact.

The Kentucky PSC has approved a plan by the utilities to spend $3.7 billion on electricity generation projects, including two natural gas power plants costing a combined $2.8 billion.

Behind the rates paid by the companies’ customers is a hidden cost that doesn’t show up on their bills. Customers receive electricity from two aging, out-of-state coal plants that lose a lot of money.

Together, the utilities own a share of the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation (OVEC).

OVEC has a plant in Madison, Indiana, across the Ohio River from Kentucky, and another in Cheshire, Ohio, across the river from West Virginia.

An analysis adapted from a case in Michigan shows that KU and LG&E customers have paid nearly $168 million in losses generated by the OVEC plants in the past seven years.

“That’s bad by any account, and definitely costing ratepayers as compared to what it would have cost them just to self produce their own energy,” said Byron Gary, program attorney for the Kentucky Resources Council.

A West Virginia Public Broadcasting story in September showed that Appalachian Power customers in West Virginia and Virginia paid for more than $328 million in losses at the two plants from 2018 to 2024. Mon Power customers in West Virginia have paid more than $10 million.

Indiana customers of two more utilities have paid a combined $167 million in losses. That breaks down to $136 million for Indiana-Michigan Power and $31 million for CenterPoint Energy.

Indiana-Michigan Power and Appalachian Power are subsidiaries of American Electric Power. AEP owns the biggest share of OVEC, at 39%.

Other states have walked away from the OVEC plants. Michigan regulators stopped Indiana-Michigan from charging Michigan customers for the OVEC losses. Ohio lawmakers repealed a scandal-tainted bailout of the plants.

“I think it is helpful to know that other states who are not embroiled in our historical ties to coal have already determined that they are not smart for the ratepayers in their states,” said Elisa Owen, Kentucky senior organizer for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign.

Indiana regulators decided over the summer that Indiana customers of Indiana-Michigan would pick up the losses no longer absorbed by Michigan customers.

Devi Glick, an energy analyst at Synapse Energy Economics, testified in the Michigan case.

She adapted her analysis to calculate how much Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia and Virginia customers were overpaying for OVEC power versus what power from the market cost.

She said the structure of OVEC’s ownership makes it hard to change anything about the way the plants operate.

“If all of them got together and were saying, ‘Yeah, this is a bad idea,’ they could make a change,” Glick said, “but it’s kind of an a nice, easy way out for them to say, ‘oh, we can’t make a unilateral decision.’”

Liz Pratt, senior communications director for LG&E and KU, said she wasn’t familiar with Glick’s analysis and couldn’t comment on it.

“We dispatch least-cost generation first, and this balanced generation approach gives us the flexibility to hedge against fuel price increases for our customers, while continuing to ensure safe, reliable and affordable service,” she said, adding, “Our residential electric rates remain well below the national average.”

Nationwide, electric utilities are scrambling to meet the demand for power from data centers and advanced manufacturing.

Meanwhile, federal policy has shifted from favoring renewables to supporting fossil fuels, including coal. The Trump administration wants to prevent the retirement of coal plants, and has used its executive power to keep at least one plant on the grid after it was scheduled to shut down.

The price of electricity has risen faster than inflation. Data centers may be driving some of that. The price of natural gas has also gone up, leading to an increase in coal generation.

The contract the region’s utilities have with OVEC runs until 2040, and utility analysts don’t expect the plants to become profitable. The Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants were built in 1955, making them older than the average coal plant.

Gary, of the Kentucky Resources Council, said replacement parts for coal plants are getting scarce. No new coal plant has been built nationwide since 2013.

“Nobody wants to continue making parts for Oldsmobiles anymore if they’re not going to keep making Oldsmobiles, so the parts just aren’t available,” he said. “And that’s probably only going to get worse and worse.”

Coal generates 68% of Kentucky’s electricity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While that’s far less than in the past, and lower than West Virginia’s 86%, the Republican legislative supermajority has made moves to prevent coal plants from retiring.

The Sierra Club’s Owen said that puts pressure on utility regulators, who are appointed by the governor but approved by the state Senate.

“Those commissioners are walking a political very fine line if they ever move to undo ties to coal plants,” she said. “Now, does it matter that they’re out of the state? I think it helps.”

""Our local utility company had a large rate increase almost simultaneously with the passing of the Big Beautiful Bill. We believe that's compounded the demand,"" Morton said.

The average CenterPoint Energy customer's bill is expected to go up by about $26 a month next March.

Several other electric utilities have seen big rate hikes recently. According to Citizens Action Coalition, Indiana residents paid an average of $28 a month more for electricity this summer than they did last year.

Morton said he expects solar sales to go down slightly next year, but he believes there will still be a high demand for home solar installations.

David Mann owns MPI Solar out of Bloomington. He said he's seeing more requests for quotes as people rush to take advantage of the credit.

Mann said many of them are from people who already have solar panels, but want to expand their system or add a battery for backup. He expects MPI will be booked solid until next year.

Mann is less certain about how the residential side of his business will fare when January comes around. He said they might shift their marketing strategy to businesses and nonprofits.

The commercial solar tax credit is also expiring, but projects don't have to be completed until the end of 2027.

""We'd be happy to help anybody with any project they have in mind. There's just — I have a feeling that it's going to dampen the enthusiasm for the residential sector,"" Mann said.

Mann advises anyone who wants to get the home solar tax credit to contact local solar installers in their area as soon as possible — both to ensure the installer will be available and that the project will be a practical addition to your home.",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_FmjSANXK.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 16:08:10.696733

Participants from around the world sweated through song, dance and prayers, improvising without microphones and cooling themselves with fans made of paper or leaves.

But the ill-timed blackout fed an undercurrent of skepticism that this year’s summit — dubbed “the Indigenous peoples COP” — will deliver on organizers’ promise to put them front and center at the event on the edge of the Amazon rainforest where many Indigenous groups live.

Indigenous peoples safeguard much of the world’s biodiversity and are among those who contribute the least to climate change, yet they’re disproportionately harmed by the devastation it causes.

“We’re working within a mechanism and we’re working within an institution that we know wasn’t built for us,” said Thalia Yarina Cachimuel, a Kichwa-Otavalo member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation, a global group of Indigenous people from around the world. ”We have to work 10 times harder to ensure that our voices are a part of the space.”

This year’s climate talks, which run through Nov. 21, aren’t expected to produce an ambitious new deal. Instead, organizers and analysts frame this year’s conference as the “implementation COP,” aimed at executing on past promises.

A conference that’s not easy to attend

The climate talks — known as Conference of the Parties, or COP30 for this year’s edition — have long left Indigenous people out or relegated them to the sidelines.

Many aren’t represented robustly in the governments that often violently colonized their people. Others encounter language barriers or travel difficulties that keep them from reaching conferences like COP30.

The Brazilian government said hosting this year’s summit in Belem was partly an homage to the Indigenous groups skilled at living sustainably in the Earth’s wild spaces.

But Indigenous groups, as with other activists, aren’t traditionally included in climate negotiations unless individual members are part of a country’s delegation. Brazil has included them and urges other nations to do the same. It was not immediately clear how many have done so in Belem.

But there’s a big difference between visible and being included in the heart of negotiations, Cachimuel said.

“Sometimes that’s where the gap is, right? Like who gets to go to the high-level climate, who gets to go to the high-level dialogues, you know, who are the people that are meeting with states and governments,” she said.

She worried that the inclusion effort won’t continue at future COPs.

Edson Krenak, of the Krenak people and Brazil manager for Indigenous rights group Cultural Survival, said he has seen less participation from Indigenous people than he expected. He attributed that partly to the difficulty of finding space to stay in Belem, a small city that struggled to quickly expand lodging options for COP30.

He said it’s frustrating when Indigenous people aren’t involved from the beginning in developing policies but are expected to comply with them.

“We want to design these policies, we want to be involved in really dreaming solutions,” Krenak said.

Still, the fact that this COP is in the Amazon “makes Indigenous peoples the host,” said Alana Manchineri, who works with COIAB, an organization of Indigenous people of the Amazon basin like herself.

Fighting to make voices heard

At the opening of the Indigenous People’s Pavilion, the lack of power wasn’t the only issue. Presenters made do without an official translator.

One presenter, Wis-waa-cha, of Coast Salish and Nuu-Chah-Nulth lands, said lack of attention to such details can make people feel “continually dismissed through very passive ways.”

The office of Brazil’s presidency didn’t immediately respond to a question about why no translator was available for the event. It said they worked to fix the power outage as quickly as possible.

World leaders should focus on directly financing the communities that need support, said Lucas Che Ical, who was representing Ak’Tenamit, an organization that supports education, climate change and health initiatives in Indigenous and rural villages in Guatemala.

He knows that often at past COPs, the agreements reached don’t directly have a positive impact on the lives of Indigenous peoples. He hopes it’s different this year.

“I’m an optimistic person,” he said, speaking in Spanish. “There is a perspective that yes, it could give good results and that the governments that are deciding could make a favorable decision.”

Above all, he said he hopes that decision makers at this COP “can listen to the voices of Indigenous villages, local communities and all the villages of the world, where they live in poverty and who are part of the impacts of climate change.”

Democrats’ letter follows previous congressional efforts targeting rising rural utility costs connected to AI data centers and warnings to the Department of Energy over how canceled projects will worsen data center demands.

This story was updated Nov. 11 with comments from a White House spokeswoman and a White House official.","Senate Democrats are ratcheting up pressure on the White House over artificial intelligence data centers and the surging utility costs that have accompanied their nationwide buildout.

In a letter sent Monday to Office of Science and Technology Policy Director Michael Kratsios and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, five senators blasted the Trump administration for the “sweetheart deals” it has made with Big Tech companies on data centers, and its “reckless abandonment” of consumers as their electricity bills soar.

“​​Since his second inauguration, President Trump has cozied up to Meta, Google, Oracle, OpenAI, and other Big Tech companies, fast-tracking and pushing for the buildout of power-hungry data centers across the country,” the letter stated, which was led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.

“While the Administration has gestured at eventually adding some more power sources and improving grid infrastructure,” the letter continued, “it has failed to keep up with increasing demand. As a result, everyday Americans are already being forced into bidding wars with trillion-dollar companies to keep the lights on at home.”

According to the letter — which was also signed by Democratic Sens. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Ed Markey of Massachusetts and independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont — national power consumption from data centers could jump from 5% to 12% within three years, and even the White House noted in its AI Action Plan that “technological advancements of AI are increasing pressures on the grid.”

At the same time, the second Trump administration has seemingly traded in the all-of-the-above approach to energy sources pursued during the president’s first term for a decidedly anti-renewables bent that the senators said has “supercharged this cost-of-living crisis by making it harder to increase and diversify sources of household electricity sources.”

“President Trump has hiked tariffs on critical energy infrastructure, expanded liquified natural gas exports that could push natural gas prices up by 30% by 2050, and undermined energy assistance programs that millions of families rely on,” the lawmakers wrote. “In addition, President Trump’s attacks on wind and solar — the cheapest and fastest-to-deploy energy sources — through imposing burdensome regulatory requirements and revoking tax credits are driving up costs and prolonging timelines for deployment.”

Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement that energy prices were driven up by former President “Joe Biden’s radical climate agenda and destructive energy policies.”

“On day one, [Trump] declared an energy emergency to reverse four years of Biden’s disastrous policies, accelerate large-scale grid infrastructure projects, and expedite the expansion of coal, natural gas, and nuclear power generation,” Rogers added.

In an email to FedScoop, a White House official credited Trump with expediting the expansion of those energy sources — “all industries the Biden administration sought to dismantle” — in addition to ending “massive government handouts for wind and solar.”

“The only viable way to meet the energy demand of data centers and to lower energy prices is to unlock the potential of US natural gas, coal, and establish robust nuclear power to grow our grid,” they said.

The Democrats were also highly critical of Big Tech firms whose executives “cozied up to” Trump. The administration, they wrote, has “already failed to prevent those new data centers from driving up electricity prices from a surge of new commercial demand.”

“Despite President Trump’s promises to lower Americans’ bills, since January, families have seen the average price of household energy climb by ten percent,” the letter stated. “Americans should not be expected to bankroll Big Tech’s infrastructure through excessive electricity bills and threats to their water supplies.”

The lawmakers asked Kratsios and Lutnick to respond to a series of questions by Nov. 21, including what steps OSTP and Commerce have taken to measure the cost of AI data centers on consumers via higher electricity bills and depleted water supplies, as well as details on legal arrangements made with tech companies to ensure rates don’t increase and water supplies aren’t environmentally compromised.

They also want information from OSTP and Commerce on which companies the Trump administration has coordinated with on the buildout of data centers, as well as where those facilities are located, plus what has been done to inform states of changes to electricity demand and water supplies. A final question asks if the administration and its AI and crypto partners will take any steps to “compensate American households for drastic increases in their utility bills.”

Commerce did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication.

Democrats’ letter follows previous congressional efforts targeting rising rural utility costs connected to AI data centers and warnings to the Department of Energy over how canceled projects will worsen data center demands. Meanwhile, the DOE’s national laboratories are full steam ahead on AI data centers, including at Oak Ridge, which is currently seeking proposals for long-term leases on its Tennessee campus.

A brownfield could also be an empty field or a house that people are dumping in, said Kathy Luther, the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission’s director of environmental programs.

“We need READI times 10 to do the amount of work to make these brownfields ready for redevelopment,” Luther said.

It would take hundreds of millions of dollars to eliminate all the brownfield sites in Northwest Indiana, along with a champion for redevelopment funding. That could be the new land development entity.

A brownfield is real estate that is abandoned or inactive or may not be operated at its appropriate use, she told NIRPC’s Environment Committee. Indiana further defines it as making expansion or redevelopment complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum or a petroleum product.

“There has to be a risk that the property is creating or helping to create that might be a problem,” Luther said.

“Most people might not think a strip mall could be a brownfield, but it could be,” she said. An underground storage tank could be nearby. A car repair facility, factory or empty field? “All of these are brownfields. Sometimes you can tell, and sometimes you can’t.”

Brownfields have been in the news lately because the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority decided to create a land development entity that would address the proliferation of brownfields in getting land ready for redevelopment.

Northwest Indiana has 12 Superfund sites – eight in Lake County, one in Porter County and three in LaPorte County – but that’s far from a comprehensive list of brownfields.

Luther zipped through a list of brownfields that have been addressed for redevelopment.

Lost Marsh Golf Course and Recreation Area in Hammond is one of the most well-known examples. That development, opened in 2003, sprawls across 322 acres. The total investment was $55 million.

Removing contaminated soil for Lost Marsh Estates in Hammond cost $80,000, clearing the way for 14 paired patio homes and five single-family homes. “That was one of the first new housing developments in Hammond in 20 years,” Luther said.

The Banc, which turned the former Bank Calumet building in downtown Hammond into a residential building, is another success story. “Yes, we found some contamination, but more on the alley side,” she said.

“I’m excited about this one, because it’s a housing project right near the new train station,” Luther said. “If we hadn’t done it, I’m not sure if the housing project would have gone on,” but the brownfield cleanup provides environmental certainty to residents.

A new subdivision is going in near the Wolf Lake pavilion, where the old Clark High School athletic field stood.

In East Chicago, a new dialysis clinic replaced a former auto parts store

At 4400 Homerlee in East Chicago, the property was purchased at a tax sale without due diligence, Luther said. “There were literally squatters doing business in their building that they weren’t aware of.”

“Mystery barrels” were found in the building. “There was actually solvent coming out of that facility and under the street,” she said. The city addressed that when it tore up the street for another project.

Lakeshore Manor in East Chicago hit the trifecta of previous troubled uses for a property. It was a former dry cleaner, gas station and lumber yard where they treated lumber as the site went through various iterations. It’s now a housing facility.

“There’s actually a limit to how many roll-off rental carts you can get,” Luther learned. A lot of money was spent on testing to reduce the amount of soil that had to be removed. “It was very expensive to do all that – $650,000. A lot of that was due to testing,” she said.

The former Sheraton Hotel in downtown Gary, right by City Hall, was a see-through building for years. It was finally razed, allowing the land under it to be tested for contaminants. “They put a green garden under there,” she pointed out.

Clearing the way for the South Shore Line’s new Miller station took considerable effort. There were 620 parcels screened, just by looking at the paperwork, for potential contamination. At $80 each, that added up. But compare it to $3,500 per parcel to test the soil at each, and it was a bargain.

Of the 620 parcels, 83 were identified as having potential environmental concerns. Only one came back clean.

“The state wanted this to be just the cost of doing business as part of due diligence,” Luther said.

For developers, it can be tempting to build without considering potential contamination of the site. That’s the “if I go to the doctor for this cold, they’re going to find eight other things that’s wrong with me, so I don’t want to go,” mentality, Luther explained. “The question is, what you don’t know can hurt you.”

When the RDA drafted its new strategic plan for the next 10 years – the final version is still being polished although its contents have already been explained – President and CEO Sherri Ziller said the RDA plans to create the local development entity as a nonprofit to work with communities across Lake and Porter counties to assemble parcels and deal with potential barriers to redevelopment, including environmental cleanup.

At the Northwest Indiana Business Roundtable’s economic outlook program Oct. 31 at Ivy Tech Community College in Valparaiso, Ziller said preparing “challenging” properties for productive use will help boost transit-oriented development in the areas surrounding South Shore Line stations, but the efforts won’t be limited to the transit development districts.

The RDA is providing $5 million in seed money for the new local development entity, along with $500,000 from the brownfields revolving loan fund the RDA oversees. Ziller expects the new nonprofit will seek a plethora of grants.

“A lot of the pre-work that has to be done to make these properties suitable for development comes from grants,” Luther said. As federal support for brownfield cleanups changes on a political whim at the federal level, the region needs to be more resilient in how to make this happen, she said.

Maybe there’s some other things that can be done that can help offset the detrimental effects of climate change on water,” said Mace.
We’re already doing some of that here in Texas but we’re not doing it enough.” The research on climate change in Austin, San Marcos, and Texas has already started.","New federal funds are on their way to Texas to pay for climate change research. On Monday, Congressman Lloyd Doggett announced a $2 million project to better protect Texas aquifers, rivers, and lakes and figure out how to deal with dwindling water supplies.

“I think we have some very serious challenges,” said Rep. Doggett, (D) 35th District of Texas. “This will provide tools that many local governments don’t have today to plan and adapt to the climate crisis.”

Congressman Doggett took a glass-bottom boat tour of Spring Lake to see the impact of climate change on Texas water. The tour at Texas State University provides a unique underwater view of how droughts and low water flows are changing the state.

“I think that we will see Texas become much more like the Sonoran Desert as the heat continues to go up,” said Rep. Doggett.

The Sonoran Desert covers more than half of Arizona and the southeastern tip of California.

In San Marcos, sizzling temperatures in June have pushed the water level at Spring Lake down about a foot. Underwater, Congressman Doggett was quick to notice how few bubbles he was seeing. San Marcos Springs normally puts on a show, bubbling up from the Edwards Aquifer to form Spring Lake.

“When we toured the lake today very few of those areas were bubbling. Then we saw almost like a scum on top of where normally there would be a field of sand and that’s due to the low flows,” said Robert Mace, Executive Director and Chief Water Policy Officer at The Meadows Center for Water and the Environment.

Mace thinks the $2 million project will provide much-needed local and state climate information that will help Texas figure out how to protect the state’s water.

“We’ll end up with climate information at a local level. Temperature, rainfall, evaporation, things like that,” said Mace. “That information then helps people access how much climate change might affect their water resources. They’ll know how much less water is there going to be in the river because of climate change than if we didn’t have climate change.”

The local climate change research could help Texas push back against the drought conditions that are impacting California, Arizona, and West Texas and threaten to do similar damage in Austin and San Marcos.

“Maybe it’s more aggressive water conservation. Maybe it’s more aggressive water reuse. Maybe there’s some other things that can be done that can help offset the detrimental effects of climate change on water,” said Mace.

“We know that conditions will continue to worsen, and we have to plan for protecting the invaluable water resources we have and beautiful areas like this from the rising heat,” said Rep. Doggett. “We have the potential, with the technology in our area, to develop good renewable energy resources. We’re already doing some of that here in Texas but we’re not doing it enough.”

The research on climate change in Austin, San Marcos, and Texas has already started. It's expected to take about a year to see the results and know how much climate change is impacting water flow across the state.",https://news3lv.com/resources/media/89ae5beb-10e1-43df-b671-c643ef951f61-bfa4a61aba4c4552b21cbdcd0028c1f9boatsm.jpeg,N,,2025-11-11 17:05:50.039313

Treaty Oak Clean Energy recently announced it entered into agreements with the technology company Meta for two utility-scale solar projects totaling 385 MW in Louisiana. The solar projects are backed by power purchase agreements with Meta.

Chris Elrod, the Co-Founder and CEO of Treaty Oak Clean Energy, answered some questions for CleanTechnica. (Treaty Oak is a developer and operator of utility-scale solar and battery storage projects.)

When will the two solar power farms be up and running?

Both projects — Beekman Solar in Morehouse Parish (185 MWac) and Hollis Creek Solar in Sabine Parish (200 MWac) — are expected to begin commercial operations before the end of H1 2027.

How many jobs will be created during installation and how many to operate them after installation?

Together, the two projects are expected to generate around 300 jobs at peak construction and up to 10 permanent positions over their 40-year lifespans.

How will the solar power farms be connected to the grid?

Energy generated from the projects will flow to the local grid within MISO’s Southern footprint, supporting reliable, clean power for Louisiana communities. Technical interconnection details are not provided in the release.

What will the clean electricity be used for?

Beekman Solar and Hollis Creek Solar will bring a combined 385 MWac of new, clean energy to the grid, while Meta will purchase the power and the environmental attributes from both projects to help meet its sustainability goals.

Will all the solar panels be ground-mounted?

Yes, combined 385 MWac of ground-mounted panels.

On what kind of land will the solar panels be installed?

The solar panels will be installed on low-productivity timberland that is not producing tax base for the community. We’ve intentionally avoided prime farmland to preserve agricultural value and ensure responsible land use.

The agenda is structured around six themes: decarbonization, nature, agriculture, cities, human and social development, and enabling factors like finance and technology. The work under this new plan kicks off at COP30, and progress on each theme will be measured annually.

Belém 4X: At the World Leaders Summit on Friday, Brazil, India, Italy, and Japan endorsed their commitments to a new biofuels agreement, the Belém 4X Pledge on Sustainable Fuels, which they first announced in October. The commitment to quadruple sustainable biofuel use globally by 2035 compared to 2024 levels is based on the findings of an International Energy Agency report. At a CAN-I press conference on the first day of COP30, however, panelists criticized the move as a “false solution” that creates new land use problems and “distracts us from phasing [out] fossil fuels.”

Declaration on Hunger: A total of 44 countries signed the Belém Declaration on Hunger, Poverty, and People-Centered Climate Action at last week’s World Leaders Summit. The document stresses that climate change and environmental degradation, and the resulting biodiversity loss, are accelerating and exacerbating food insecurity, diminishing access to water, and worsening public health around the world. Through eight specific, quantifiable recommendations, signatories urged other countries to ramp up climate adaptation efforts, particularly by supporting community-level resilience, and called for dedicated climate finance for projects that reinvigorate small-scale farmers and “traditional communities” that live off of the land.

Letters from Belém (Cont.): The COP30 Presidency released its final letter in the lead-up to COP30. The previous nine letters called on countries to embrace international cooperation, bolster the “climate change regime,” and accelerate implementation of the Paris Agreement. In the tenth, the COP30 president wrote that “we are privileged to have been destined the opportunity to make history as those who chose courage over omission to turn our climate fight around. We must embrace this privilege as a responsibility for the people we love, for the generations that came before us, and for those yet to come.”

Looking Back and Looking Ahead: Under the Paris Agreement, countries committed to submitting in-depth reviews of their own mitigation and adaptation results—or biennial transparency reports (BTRs). The UNFCCC has released a synthesis report of 101 of these BTRs. Collectively, countries reported about 3,404 different policies being implemented at the time of reporting, in alignment with their respective nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Over 60% of these policies are in the energy and transportation sectors. This interactive version of the report provides graphs to illustrate all the key findings. The UNFCCC has also released an update to the recently published synthesis report of the latest NDCs. The update includes all 86 NDC submissions to date, and finds that, if countries carry out their commitments, greenhouse emissions will be about 12% lower by 2035 (compared to 2019 levels). By comparison, without these commitments, emissions would increase 20 to 48% by 2035 (compared to 2019 levels).

Paris Progress Report: The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s International Programme for Action on Climate published its latest Climate Action Monitor, which tracks countries’ progress on meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. The 2025 report found that only 30 countries have set legally-binding commitments to achieve net-zero emissions and that global climate action grew by only 1% in 2024. Broadly, countries’ existing emissions targets are misaligned with the Paris Agreement, and getting back on track will require significantly more ambitious action at the national level.

Ecuador REDD-y for Equitable Distribution: The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) held a press conference spotlighting Ecuador’s benefit distribution plan for the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) framework, which guides global forestry policy. Ecuador’s plan is designed to make sure that all groups involved in conserving forested areas are compensated. Panelists representing Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian communities stated that the country’s distribution plan was co-built inclusively, and stressed the importance of equity for all organizations and territories in the process.

N-D-Seas: A Virtual Ocean Pavilion webinar hosted by the Global Ocean Forum and Plymouth Marine Laboratory focused on leveraging ocean-based action against climate change. The ocean is referenced in over 80% of the new NDCs so far, a 40% increase from the previous round of NDCs. Panelists celebrated the Agreement on Marine Biological Diversity of Areas beyond National Jurisdiction (also known as the BBNJ or the High Seas Treaty) attaining the ratifications required for entry into force, which is slated for January 2026.

For the solar industry, it's been anything but. The legislation gutted clean-energy tax credits and tightened rules that once made renewable projects viable.

Now, the first major casualty has occurred: Pine Gate Renewables LLC, a North Carolina-based solar developer with over 100 plants and 30 GW in the pipeline, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing the sudden collapse in project valuations after the policy change.

Pine Gate's collapse isn't isolated. Sunnova Energy filed for Chapter 11 in June with $10–50 billion in liabilities, a stark reflection of how rooftop solar players are being squeezed by higher rates and weaker incentives.

SunPower Inc (NASDAQ:SPWR) has issued a ""going concern"" warning after halting new customer acquisitions, while Canadian Solar Inc (NASDAQ:CSIQ) is leaning on fresh $415 million in debt financing, underscoring industry-wide funding strain. Given the lack of policy clarity or credit relief, more bankruptcies could follow.

""Schneider Electric's new manufacturing facility represents more than an investment in innovation — it's a testament to the strength of Tennessee's workforce and our role in shaping the future of energy in America,"" said Tennessee Governor Bill Lee. ""I'm grateful to Schneider Electric for their commitment to strengthening infrastructure and creating opportunity for Tennesseans by driving long-term economic growth. We're proud to stand alongside this leading global company as they continue to invest in our workforce.""

Expanding in Mt. Juliet, alongside one of the company's major R&D centers in Tennessee and facilities in Franklin and Smyrna, collectively helps to bolster Schneider Electric's ability to deliver advanced energy management technologies nationwide while strengthening U.S. job growth and supply chains. The company's Tennessee expansion also comes on the heels of Schneider Electric recently being named as the Official Energy Management Partner of the New Nissan Stadium, future home of the Tennessee Titans, and being recognized today as a Gold Military Friendly employer for 2026. This designation is awarded to organizations demonstrating strong support for Veterans through hiring, retention, advancement, and culture.

This would build up confidence in the sector and get early supply chain investment flowing so we can build floating wind farms faster, and at a lower cost.
Let's be clear, the power from these demonstration scale wind floating wind farms was never going to shift the dial on the Government's Clean Power 2030 targets.
What this CfD round represents for floating wind is early, strategic investment to accelerate cost reduction and build industrial capability.
Industry and Government are committed to maximising ambition and opportunity in the UK's floating wind sector.","The UK has a huge strategic opportunity in floating offshore wind, but the upcoming clean power auction risks under-delivering on the opportunity at precisely the time we need strategic investment to prime the supply chain and build confidence.

The low level of budget set for the auction is likely to mean less than half of the projects in the running will win contracts, adding only a dozen new floating turbines, compared to last year’s auction which secured double that. Early projects unlock supply chain investment, cut costs, and create jobs. The Government is right to keep bills in mind and push down energy costs, but going slow on floating wind risks decelerating the learning curve and delaying cost reductions.

The UK has built our global leadership in offshore wind in the shallower seas of the southern North Sea. But sites in deeper waters further away from shore offer stronger, more consistent winds, meaning more productive wind farms. The UK’s deepwater wind resource could theoretically meet the UK’s future electricity needs four times over. But we’re starting from a low base - of the nearly 3,000 turbines operating in UK waters, just 10 are floating.

The UK has a world-leading pipeline of sites earmarked for floating wind and the immediate priority has to be strategic investment to secure a steady stream of projects coming through. The key tool to unlock this is the Government’s annual clean power auction of Contracts for Difference (CfDs), which earmarks specific support for floating wind as an innovative technology, separate to support for mature renewables like solar and onshore wind. For this year’s Allocation Round (AR7), there are five eligible projects that total c.460MW of capacity – or around 30 turbines.

The budget set for AR7, however, falls short of maximum ambition. Our analysis shows that the budget could realistically support 2 projects (c. 200MW), perhaps stretching to 3 projects (c.300MW) if costs were to be significantly lower than expected – which at this early stage of technology development is not likely or reasonable to expect. AR7 is therefore expected to add about a dozen or so floating turbines to the ten currently operating in UK waters, in marked contrast to last year’s auction (AR6) which secured double that amount.

The £180 million budget for AR7 equates to about £2 a year on an average household energy bill. In the current context the Government is, quite rightly, focused on consumer bills and the need to bring down costs for households while also maintaining investment in secure, domestic energy production. But an overly cautious approach to early investment risks slowing the pace of cost reduction, and it is imperative that we take a longer-term view on a sector that could create tens of thousands of new jobs across the UK.

This would build up confidence in the sector and get early supply chain investment flowing so we can build floating wind farms faster, and at a lower cost. The greater number of early projects we can build, the quicker we can de-risk investment in floating wind for major financial institutions like banks and pension funds. Reducing that investment risk reduces the cost of borrowing, which in turn reduces the price that consumers pay for the power generated by floating wind farms.

The spread of the test and demonstration scale projects eligible to bid into AR7 illustrates key opportunities to develop new industry to manufacture, install and operate floating wind farms – with a focus on Scotland and the Celtic Sea. Key ports like Cromarty Firth, Port Talbot and Ardresier have lined up investment support, including from Government and investment agencies, to develop industrial clusters, and they now need customers – in the form of floating wind projects – to ensure those investment plans can translate to jobs and factories on the ground.

Let's be clear, the power from these demonstration scale wind floating wind farms was never going to shift the dial on the Government's Clean Power 2030 targets. What this CfD round represents for floating wind is early, strategic investment to accelerate cost reduction and build industrial capability. It’s about investing now to secure future growth and long-term energy security.

Industry and Government are committed to maximising ambition and opportunity in the UK's floating wind sector. But looking at the numbers, AR7 will not deliver maximum ambition.",https://www.renewableuk.com/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-11 16:07:29.276294

The push for more board members from Republican-leaning states meanwhile continues.
Through a separate FOIA request, E&E News has sought comments to EPA from other organizations on the board nominees.","A chemical company lobbyist, an advocacy group that soft-pedals the dangers of climate change and an organization seeking to end animal testing in research are among those pushing candidates for EPA’s premier scientific advisory panel, according to records obtained by POLITICO’s E&E News.

The records show who nominated each of the 165 contenders for seats on the Science Advisory Board, created by Congress to furnish independent expert advice on topics that have included hydraulic fracturing and standards for “forever chemicals” in drinking water.

With Administrator Lee Zeldin yet to announce his picks, former members of the panel are worried that expertise will take a back seat to special interest agendas.

The board “is not a stakeholder advisory group,” Thomas Burke, a former member who also served as the agency’s deputy research chief during the Obama administration, said in an interview. “It’s about the excellence of the science and the independence of the science and the depth of the science.”

The Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees opposed to Trump administration policies, voiced similar concerns this summer. “The SAB is a scientific expert committee, not a representative stakeholder committee,” they said, adding, ”Members should be recognized experts in relevant fields.”

The board’s work remains at a standstill more than nine months after appointees of President Donald Trump orchestrated the blanket ouster of all previous incumbents in January. When Zeldin in May opened the door to nominations to reconstitute the panel, he called the outcome “critical” to advancing the agency’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.

To date, he has named no new members. At least in recent years, there is no precedent for leaving all board seats vacant for so long.

Asked this month when Zeldin intends to fill them, EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said the review of the candidates is continuing and that more information will be released once the assessment is complete.

To Burke, now on the public health faculty at Johns Hopkins University, and other observers, the lag is indicative of a broader disregard for science at EPA. Besides gutting the Office of Research and Development as part of a reorganization, agency leaders have outright scrapped several other advisory committees.

“There’s been a lot of problematic removal of bodies that were providing outside advice to the government in decisionmaking,” said Kristie Ellickson, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

Because the board also has wide-ranging authority to review the scientific basis for EPA regulatory decisions, Zeldin’s eventual choices could be key to determining the level of scrutiny on his contested plans for revisiting — and potentially rolling back — an array of rules issued under prior administrations.

In one corner are university-based researchers who have traditionally formed the backbone of the board’s membership. Dozens are in the mix of nominees, according to the records, which EPA released in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Also up for appointments, however, are representatives of businesses and other organizations with a potential stake in the board’s work.

Among the latter group of candidates are four Chemours employees nominated by Mary Cordes, a registered federal lobbyist for the Delaware-based corporation entangled in litigation over the forever chemicals technically known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances.

Cordes did not reply to email and phone messages. A Chemours spokesperson declined to comment on the company’s rationale for seeking participation on the board, which several years ago carried out a closely watched assessment of EPA drinking water standards for the chemicals.

Another 15 candidates were nominated by the CO2 Coalition, which downplays the impact of heat-trapping carbon dioxide.

Although climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that rising levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are having increasingly harmful effects, “there should be a debate,” Gregory Wrightstone, the coalition’s executive director, said in an interview.

“We want to make sure we have representation with highly qualified advisers,” he said.

And an adviser to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals recommended two researchers with Dow Chemical and Corteva Agriscience, as well as an independent consultant who previously worked for both EPA and Syngenta Crop Protection, according to biographical summaries posted by EPA.

Asked for comment, Amy Clippinger, the managing director of PETA’s regulatory toxicology program, said in an email exchange that the group works with other scientists to advance reliable and relevant toxicity testing without the use of animals.

The three nominees “are subject matter experts in chemical toxicity testing, broadly — including expertise across animal and non-animal tests,” Clippinger said.

EPA is also seeking to reseed five panels affiliated with the SAB that work on drinking water, chemical assessments and other more specialized topics. In play on a parallel track are seats on the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, which aids in reviews of national air pollutant standards and has similarly been mothballed since January.

Reshaping advisory boards

Congress created the Science Advisory Board in 1978, accompanied by a provision that members “shall be qualified by education, training, and experience to evaluate scientific and technical information on matters referred to the Board under this section.”

In recent years, however, congressional Republicans and other critics have faulted the SAB’s bent toward academia as isolated from real-world consequences. During Trump’s first term, EPA barred agency grant recipients from joining its multitude of advisory panels, a step that critics said effectively sidelined many reputable experts from serving.

That policy was eventually struck down in court, but — along with other changes — it opened the door to more members from regulated industries as well as state, local and tribal agencies.

Even so, the SAB emerged as a tough critic of the scientific underpinnings of high-profile rollbacks during that period. In what some members saw as retaliation, then-EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler stripped rank-and-file board members of any role in deciding which proposed rules warranted attention.

Wheeler’s approach was discarded under President Joe Biden. But by leaving the board dormant, Zeldin has so far effectively leashed one potential watchdog. The push for more board members from Republican-leaning states meanwhile continues.

The current crop of SAB candidates includes five staffers from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, which is headed by Clint Woods, who served as EPA’s deputy air chief during Trump’s first term.

In an interview, Woods confirmed that their nominations were coordinated. “People from our agency, people from other state environmental agencies bring really important perspectives,” he said following his September testimony before a House panel on Clean Air Act permitting changes.

But in its comments on the nominees, the Environmental Protection Network noted that one of the Indiana candidates is a field inspector whose official biography does not indicate any publications or research grants.

The network also highlighted “the substantial number of candidates who are employed by, or serve as consultants to, companies and industries that are directly regulated by EPA.”

“While these individuals may possess valuable expertise,” the group wrote, “they may also lack impartiality and an inclination for protecting the interests of their employers.”

The group voluntarily posted the feedback on its website. Through a separate FOIA request, E&E News has sought comments to EPA from other organizations on the board nominees. In its most recent update, the agency indicated that those records would be released in late January at the earliest.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/6d/fa/d838de3e42bca754f33d0d078c47/washington-dc-40091.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 14:06:01.446052

Should EPA ultimately deny the 2020 petition, NRDC is likely to challenge the denial.
Any modification to the pesticide tolerances for neonicotinoids is likely to result in limiting their overall use.","The environmental organization Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) has filed a legal action with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to compel the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to respond to a pesticide petition the group filed in 2020. In that petition, NRDC requested that EPA revisit pesticide tolerances for a class of pesticides known as neonicotinoids, or simply neonics. A pesticide may not be used on crops unless it has an established pesticide tolerance. While this legal action is in its early stages, should NRDC be successful in its goal of reducing or eliminating pesticide tolerances for neonics, it could result in a significant reduction of legal uses for those pesticides.

Neonics & the FFDCA

Neonicotinoids are a class of synthetic insecticides developed in the 1980s that are chemically similar to nicotine. Neonicotinoids work by targeting the central nervous system and are significantly more toxic to insects than mammals. Additionally, neonics are water soluble, which means that they break down more slowly in the environment and can be absorbed into plant tissue to provide protection from insects while the plant grows. For that reason, neonics are commonly used as a coating to treat crop seeds prior to planting. Plants grown from seeds treated with neonics absorb the pesticide, rendering the entire plant immune to various pests throughout its lifecycle. The use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds is particularly common for corn, soybeans, and other row crops.

Efforts to restrict or eliminate the use of neonicotinoids have increased in recent years with several states banning or limiting their use. Environmental groups have also sought unsuccessfully to have EPA more strictly regulate neonic-treated seeds. In general, those arguing that use of neonics should be restricted point to evidence which suggests that neonicotinoids pose a threat to pollinating insects such as bees and butterflies, and concerns regarding human health and child development.

In the United States, pesticides are primarily regulated under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (“FIFRA”). Under FIFRA, EPA approves pesticides and registers them for use. While most pesticide regulation is done pursuant to FIFRA, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) governs one crucial aspect of pesticide registration. Specifically, section 346a of the FFDCA authorizes EPA to set limits known as “tolerances” on the amount of pesticides that can legally be in or on raw agricultural commodities or processed foods. Without an established tolerance, a pesticide may not be used on crops intended to enter the food system. 21 U.S.C. §§ 331(a), 346a(a)(1).

The FFDCA provides that EPA may “establish or leave in effect a tolerance for a pesticide chemical reside in or on a food if [EPA] determines that the tolerance is safe.” 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(2)(A)(i). The statute further elaborates that with respect to pesticide tolerances, “safe” means that EPA “has determined that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue.” 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(2)(A)(ii). In other words, a pesticide tolerance is safe if human health is not harmed by repeated exposure to the pesticide’s residue on food products. Additionally, the FFDCA requires EPA to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue,” 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(2)(C)(ii). When setting pesticide tolerances, the FFDCA instructs EPA to take care that the residue limit is not so high that repeated exposure will cause harm to infants and children.

EPA may decide to establish, modify, or revoke a pesticide tolerance at any time based either on the agency’s own initiative or in response to a petition filed by a third party. 21 U.S.C. § 346a(c)(1). While anyone may request that a pesticide tolerance be modified, if someone files a petition to revoke a tolerance, then they must include data supporting the request. 40 C.F.R. § 180.32(b). EPA must publish a copy of the petition in the Federal Register within 30 days of receiving it and provide at least 60 days of public comment before issuing a response. 40 C.F.R. §§ 180.7(f), 180.29(b).

Although it is up to EPA to make the final decision on whether or not to grant a petition to establish, revoke, or modify a pesticide tolerance, a 2021 decision from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that EPA should either revoke or modify an already established pesticide tolerance once the agency finds that the tolerance is unsafe. In League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Regan, No. 19-71979 (9th Cir. 2021), the court held that once EPA becomes aware of “genuine questions” as to the safety of a pesticide tolerance, then the agency has a duty to determine whether the tolerance is still safe. If EPA then finds that the tolerance is unsafe, it may no longer remain in effect. To reach this conclusion, the court relied on language from the FFDCA which provides that EPA may “establish or leave in effect” a pesticide tolerance “only if [EPA] determines that the tolerance is safe.” 21 U.S.C. § 346a(b)(2)(A)(i). That case arose out of a petition to revoke tolerances for the pesticide chlorpyrifos, a commonly used insecticide, that the plaintiffs had submitted to EPA along with scientific data suggesting that current tolerances were not safe for infants and children. The Ninth Circuit reasoned that the evidence submitted by the plaintiffs raised the type of “genuine questions” that should have triggered an EPA review. As a result of the ruling, all the tolerances for chlorpyrifos were revoked. More information on that decision is available here.

NRDC’s Legal Challenge

The lawsuit filed by NRDC focuses on EPA’s delay in responding to a petition the group submitted in 2020 asking the agency to make changes to the current tolerances for neonicotinoid pesticides. In its petition, NRDC claimed that evidence suggests that current tolerance levels lead to an unsafe rate of exposure to neonicotinoids, particularly for children. NRDC argues that the delay is unreasonable and asks that the court order EPA to make a response.

NRDC submitted its petition to EPA on May 4, 2020. In that petition, the group asked EPA to revoke all pesticide tolerances for five specific neonicotinoid pesticides – acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam – until the agency could fully assess their overall toxicity. As part of that request, NRDC cited recent studies purporting to show that exposure to neurotoxic chemicals such as those found in neonicotinoids can cause greater neurodevelopmental harm than previously realized, particularly in children. NRDC claimed that EPA had failed to fully evaluate the cumulative effects of exposure to neonics that are likely to occur based on current tolerances. Although NRDC requested a response to its petition “as soon as practicable,” EPA’s current schedule indicates that it is not planning to respond to the petition until after 2026.

In its complaint filed with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, NRDC argues that EPA has both a legal duty to respond to the 2020 petition, and that the agency’s “unreasonable delay” weighs in favor of the court compelling EPA to respond. According to NRDC, EPA’s duty to respond stems from the FFDCA itself which provides that EPA “shall” issue a final response to a petition to modify pesticide tolerances either by establishing, modifying, or revoking the tolerance or denying the petition. 21 U.S.C. § 346a(d)(4). NRDC also argues that EPA’s duty to respond is established under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), which requires federal agencies to issue final decisions within a “reasonable time[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 555. While the APA does not specify what constitutes a “reasonable time,” courts generally measure that period by months rather than years.

NRDC goes on to argue that EPA’s delay in responding to the 2020 petition should prompt the court to compel the agency to respond. First, NRDC argues that EPA’s five-year delay violates the general understanding that a reasonable time for response is measured by months rather than years, and that the text of the FFDCA requires EPA to make a response. Next, NRDC claims that the human health concerns raised in the 2020 petition make EPA’s failure to respond even more unreasonable. Once again, NRDC cites the FFDCA which provides that EPA may establish a pesticide tolerance only if it is “safe” for aggregate exposure, in particular for infants and children. NRDC argues that because the 2020 petition presented evidence suggesting that current pesticide tolerances for neonics are not safe for adults or children, that five years has been “too great” a wait. Finally, NRDC claims that EPA has presented no reason to justify the delay, and that for those reasons, the court should order EPA to make a final response to the 2020 petition.

The Road Ahead

NRDC’s request to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is likely the beginning of what could be a long legal battle. However this particular legal action is resolved – whether the court orders EPA to respond, sides with the agency, or approves a settlement agreement between the parties – whatever final action EPA does take on the 2020 petition is likely to result in further litigation. Should EPA ultimately deny the 2020 petition, NRDC is likely to challenge the denial. In such a challenge, it is likely that NRDC would cite the Ninth Circuit’s ruling in League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Regan that EPA’s duty to modify or revoke established pesticide tolerances is triggered once the agency receives evidence showing that the current tolerance is no longer safe. While courts are not bound by rulings from different circuits, they can be persuaded by such rulings. In that way, League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Regan could ultimately play a role in the matter at hand.

A pesticide may only be used on a food crop so long as it has a tolerance in place for that particular crop. Any modification to the pesticide tolerances for neonicotinoids is likely to result in limiting their overall use. While it is still early days, the outcome of this litigation could impact the future use of neonicotinoids across the country.

(NASDAQ: GEVO) delivered a major earnings surprise for the third quarter of 2025, posting results that exceeded Wall Street expectations and highlighted a sharp turnaround in its financial performance.

Record Revenue Growth and Strong Financial Recovery

For Q3 2025, Gevo reported revenues of $43.6 million, far above analyst forecasts of $37.03 million, and a dramatic increase from about $2 million during the same period last year. The company’s earnings per share (EPS) came in at a loss of $0.03, beating the expected loss of $0.04.

Most notably, Gevo achieved a positive adjusted EBITDA of $6.7 million, marking its second consecutive quarter of profitability. This was a major improvement compared to a loss of $16.7 million a year ago, reflecting improving operational efficiency and higher cash flow from its facilities.

The company ended the quarter with $108 million in cash, ensuring a strong liquidity position as it continues investing in growth projects.

North Dakota Facility Powers Carbon and Ethanol Gains

Gevo’s North Dakota operations were the cornerstone of its quarterly success, contributing $12.3 million in operational income. This performance was driven by efficient low-carbon ethanol production, carbon sequestration, and robust sales of clean fuel and voluntary carbon credits.

During the quarter, the site achieved several operational milestones:

Produced 17 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol

Generated 46,000 tons of protein and corn oil co-products

Sequestered 42,000 tons of carbon dioxide

Produced 92,000 MMBtu of renewable natural gas (RNG)

Gevo’s Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) system has now stored over 560,000 metric tons of CO₂ since its launch in June 2022, making it the world’s first ethanol dry mill to achieve commercial-scale carbon storage.

The company also capitalized on Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credits (CFPCs), selling all its remaining 2025 credits worth $30 million, bringing total CFPC sales for the year to $52 million. This reflects Gevo’s ability to monetize carbon-linked incentives effectively.

Carbon Credit Expansion Strengthens Revenue Mix

Gevo is rapidly scaling its carbon revenue streams. In Q3 2025, the company signed a multi-year offtake agreement expected to generate around $26 million in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) credit sales over five years, with the potential to increase volumes.

By the end of 2025, Gevo expects carbon co-product sales to grow to $3–5 million, up from $1 million in Q2. The company projects that long-term annual carbon revenues could exceed $30 million as it optimizes its carbon accounting and trading systems.

Gevo’s carbon credits are certified under the Puro.Earth standard, ensuring over 1,000 years of permanence, among the most durable forms of carbon removal on the market. Its customers include Nasdaq and Biorecro, signaling growing confidence from corporate buyers in Gevo’s durable carbon removal capabilities.

This dual-income approach, combining low-carbon fuel sales with carbon credit monetization, strengthens Gevo’s position in both the voluntary and compliance carbon markets.

Strategic Focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the main pillar of Gevo’s long-term strategy. Through its proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, the company converts renewable ethanol into low-carbon jet fuel, helping airlines decarbonize air travel.

Gevo plans a Final Investment Decision (FID) by mid-2026 for its upcoming ATJ-30 plant, a project designed to scale synthetic SAF production at its North Dakota site. Once completed, the plant could play a central role in meeting the aviation sector’s growing SAF demand.

SAF Market Forecast

The global SAF market is expanding rapidly. In 2025, the market was valued at about $2.25 billion but is forecasted to soar to $134.57 billion by 2034, growing at a CAGR of over 57 percent, according to industry estimates. This surge is driven by regulatory mandates, green aviation goals, and policies like the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Initiative.

Gevo’s integrated approach linking SAF production, ethanol output, and carbon monetization aligns perfectly with the industry’s transition toward net-zero aviation. As the company scales ethanol production to 75 million gallons annually, it expects a substantial boost in SAF output and carbon credit revenues.

Carbon Capture and Policy Incentives Drive Future Growth

The company capitalizes on the intersection of clean fuel policy, carbon markets, and technology innovation. By sequestering carbon at its ethanol facilities, the company captures and sells verified carbon credits while also producing renewable fuels that qualify for federal incentives.

With growing policy support and rising carbon prices, Gevo is positioned to benefit from both market-based carbon trading and tax credit monetization. The Section 45Z clean fuel credits, in particular, provide strong financial incentives that enhance the company’s margins and encourage further expansion.

As governments tighten emission standards and airlines commit to net-zero targets by 2050, the demand for SAF and durable carbon credits will continue to rise. Gevo’s technology and operations are built to meet this challenge while maintaining commercial viability.

Investor Confidence and Stock Performance

Following its strong Q3 2025 results, Gevo’s stock rose over 4 percent in after-hours trading, reflecting investor confidence in the company’s growth trajectory. The stock trades around $2.12 per share with a market capitalization of about $513 million.

Investors are increasingly viewing Gevo as a clean-energy growth stock, citing:

Consistent revenue growth and improving EBITDA margins

Clear strategic direction toward SAF and carbon capture

Effective monetization of clean fuel tax credits and carbon offsets

The company’s solid balance sheet, strong policy tailwinds, and successful operational execution position it favorably within the renewable hydrocarbon fuels market.

Gevo’s Role in the Green Aviation Future

The aviation sector targets a 65% reduction in emissions through SAF by 2050. And companies like Gevo will play a critical role in meeting that goal. Its ATJ technology, carbon sequestration systems, and integration with carbon markets make it one of the few clean fuel developers with a fully circular carbon strategy.

Significantly, its North Dakota operations serve as a blueprint for carbon-negative fuel production, proving that decarbonization and profitability can coexist. With expansion plans for 2026 and beyond, the company is well-positioned to scale both its fuel and carbon businesses.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2304894779.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 16:07:57.779000

As in past summits, the negotiations are starting on the back foot: countries already aren't meeting their goals to cut heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels.

The world has barely budged in its efforts to combat climate change compared to one year ago, according to a new report from the United Nations. If countries stay on that track, the planet will warm by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial temperatures of the mid-1800s. That's slightly better than projections made last year, which showed 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming – but much of that progress could soon be cancelled out by the U.S.

The Trump Administration is not sending any high-level officials to the COP30 talks, according to a statement from the White House. On President Trump's first day in office, he announced he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, the landmark deal made in 2015 among the world's nations to combat climate change. The U.S. had been instrumental in negotiating that agreement, which seeks to limit warming by 2100 to a key threshold: 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Beyond that level of warming, scientific research shows climate change impacts become dramatically more damaging. Storms will produce more extreme rainfall, causing more dangerous flooding. Hurricanes get more intense. Heat waves reach more dangerous temperatures. Vulnerable ecosystems, like coral reefs, stand little chance at surviving.

The world is very likely to hit 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next decade, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. To stop the planet from getting even hotter by the end of the century, emissions would need to fall 55% by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. If countries follow through on their current pledges to cut emissions, they'd only fall 12% by 2035.

In the U.S., emissions from burning fossil fuels have declined recently, as aging coal power plants have closed and more solar and wind power has been installed. Renewable power projects are now cheaper than new fossil fuel power plants.

President Trump has called climate change a hoax. His administration now seeks to boost fossil fuels, rolling back tax credits for solar energy and cancelling offshore wind power projects. One study found that such measures will slow U.S. emissions cuts, which were expected to fall 38-56% by 2035, but now may only decline by 26-35%.

""I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders at the United National General Assembly in September.

Worldwide, renewable energy is growing rapidly, with China leading on production and manufacturing of renewable energy technology. More than 90% of new energy projects installed globally in 2024 were renewable. Energy experts say those economic forces will continue the expansion of clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But without stronger moves by governments to reduce fossil fuel use, those declines may still not be fast enough.

End in Sight for Government Shutdown

Outlook for Tax Legislation

Treasury Report on Direct File

End in Sight for Government Shutdown

On the evening of Monday, November 10, the Senate voted 60-40 to pass a funding bill after a group of mostly moderate Democrats struck a deal with Republicans. Eight Democrats (including one Independent who caucuses with Democrats), none of whom is running for re-election in 2026, and all but one Republican, voted in favor. The shutdown is the longest in American history. The Senate bill amends the House-passed continuing resolution (CR) that would have funded the government through November 21 bill to fund three of the 12 appropriations categories for the remainder of the current fiscal year, ending on September 20, 2026, veterans affairs/military construction, agriculture and legislative. The Senate bill would also fund the rest of the government under a CR running through January 30, 2026. The bill would provide back pay for government workers, reverse reductions in force undertaken by the Executive Branch since the shutdown started and prohibit such reductions through the length of the CR. After prior shutdowns, government workers received back pay regardless of whether they had been furloughed, but the Trump administration had stated they were considering not doing so this time.

The Senate Democrats who voted in favor of the bill are: Catherine Cortez Masto (D – NV), Dick Durbin (D – IL), John Fetterman (D – PA), Maggie Hassan (D – NH), Tim Kaine (D – VA), Angus King (I – ME), Jacky Rosen (D – NV), and Jeanne Shaheen (D – NH). On Sunday November 9, the same Senators approved a procedural motion to take up the House bill, which enabled Monday’s vote.

The House appears very likely to pass the Senate-passed bill on Wednesday, but this is not guaranteed. Speaker Johnson will swear in Rep-elect Adelita Grijalva, which will bring the House to a 219-214 advantage. Although House Republicans will likely vote overwhelmingly for the bill, at least a handful of Democrat votes may be needed because of a few Republicans voting against the bill. House Democratic leadership criticized the deal and it appears House Democrats will vote overwhelmingly against the bill.

The Senate bill does not address the increased tax credit for health insurance premiums under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enacted in the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act that expire at the end of 2025. Democrats opposed the House-passed CR over the refusal of Republicans to extend or make permanent those credits or reverse health care policy enacted in the OBBBA. However, as part of the agreement reached on Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Thune (R-SD) promised Democrats a Senate vote on legislation addressing the tax credits. It remains to be seen how that legislation develops. One possibility is a bill making the increased tax credits permanent, which has little chance of being taken up by the House where Speaker Johnson (R-LA) has strongly opposed the tax credits. A bill temporarily extending the tax credits and including some changes, such as income limits, is more likely to be taken up by the House.

Assuming the funding bill is enacted, Congress will likely hold discussions on the ACA tax credits and health policy more generally. There are a wide variety of views in Congress and in the Trump administration on these issues, including various existing and proposed tax incentives for health care. For example, President Trump stated that the government should provide payments to Americans through tax-advantaged health care accounts, rather than provide subsidies through payments to insurance companies under current law.

Some Democrats have held open the possibility of refusing to agree to another funding bill after the new CR (assuming it is enacted) expires on January 30 unless agreement is reached regarding the ACA tax credits.

As in most appropriations bills, the bill contains a variety of very specific items, including increasing Treasury’s $350,000 allowance for “official reception and representation expenses” to $1,350,000.

Tax Legislation Outlook

The prolonged government shutdown has dampened prospects of a tax package coming together at the end of the year. But several possible avenues for tax legislation remain open.

A partisan reconciliation bill some Republicans have floated to address health policy issues might include tax provisions on health care, or also other tax provisions. Although Senate Budget Committee Chairman Graham (R-SC) has held several meetings to develop such legislation, such a bill now appears less than likely.

A partisan reconciliation bill some Republicans have floated to address health policy issues might include tax provisions on health care, or also other tax provisions.

If Congress chooses to address the ACA insurance premium tax credits, other tax provisions on health care or even other tax policies could be included.

There are a wide variety of tax policy items being considered by Congress, including digital assets, that are potential candidates for inclusion in a bipartisan tax bill.

On October 30, Sens. John Curtis (R-UT) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced the Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act, S. 3088. The legislation would expand eligibility for the Tax Code section 45X advanced manufacturing production credit, which incentivizes the production of clean energy components, to include fusion energy components. Under the bill, covered fusion energy components would include superconducting magnets, capacitors, fusion chambers, blanket systems, high-energy lasers, and other essential materials. The bill is identical to companion legislation H.R. 5441, which was introduced in the House on September 17 by Reps. Carol Miller (R-WV), Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Claudia Tenney (R-NY), and Don Beyer (D-VA).

The section 45X credit, which was created by the Inflation Reduction Act, encourages the domestic production of eligible clean energy components by providing per-unit tax incentives for U.S.-based manufacturers. The components covered by the credit include solar panels, wind turbines, battery modules, inverters, and critical minerals, but currently, not fusion components. Though the OBBBA terminated the section 45X credit for wind energy components produced and sold after 2027, the credit still applies to other categories of eligible components through at least 2029.

Notice 2025-62: Transition Penalty Relief for Reporting on Tips and Overtime under OBBBA

On November 5, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2025-62, providing penalty relief for the 2025 tax year in connection with new reporting obligations under the OBBBA for qualified tips and overtime compensation. Sections 70201 and 70202 of the OBBBA included new deductions for qualified tips (Tax Code Section 224) and qualified overtime compensation (Tax Code Section 225), and corresponding information reporting rules for employers, payors, and third-party settlement organizations under Tax Code Sections 6041, 6041A, 6050W, and 6051. These changes are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2025. Failure to meet such reporting requirements is generally subject to penalties under Tax Code Sections 6721 and 6722. However, because Forms W-2 and 1099 will not be updated to reflect these changes for 2025, the IRS is treating the year as a transition period for reporting purposes.

The notice provides relief from penalties under Sections 6721 and 6722 for failing to include the new required data (including separate reporting of cash tips, overtime, and occupation codes) on required information returns and payee statements for taxable-year 2025. Relief applies to filings under Tax Code Sections 6041, 6041A, 6050W, and 6051, provided the filer otherwise submits a complete and correct return.

While optional for 2025, the notice encourages employers and payors to provide employees and payees with occupation code, overtime, and cash tip data to help them determine whether they qualify for the deductions. The IRS suggested employers may furnish this information via online portals or supplemental statements.

The notice states that additional taxpayer guidance on claiming these new deductions will be forthcoming.

Treasury Files Report to Congress on Replacement of Direct File

In Section 70607 of the OBBBA, Congress directed the Department of the Treasury to submit a report on the Direct File program. Treasury sent the report to Congress on October 2. In the report, Treasury stated that it has instructed the IRS to suspend Direct File and strengthen its public-private partnerships with tax preparation companies.

Direct File was introduced in March 2024 as an option for eligible taxpayers to file their federal individual income tax returns online directly with the IRS at no cost to the taxpayer. However, according to the report, Direct File experienced low overall participation and imposed relatively high costs and administrative burdens on the federal government compared with other free filing options. For tax year 2024, returns submitted using Direct File accounted for less than 0.5% of the approximately 146 million returns filed. Direct File had a cost to the federal budget of at least $41 million for tax year 2024 returns—an average of $138 per return accepted through the system.

The report highlights and recommends other successful, longstanding programs, such as Free File, moving forward.

In the report, the Treasury and IRS announced they will: (1) conduct an updated taxpayer survey on preferences over different filing options that addresses methodological and other challenges present in earlier surveys; (2) convene a Free Filing Modernization Summit; (3) create a common understanding of a “free return” across all filing options available to taxpayers; (4) collect more robust usage data from software providers; and (5) provide a supplemental report to Congress, including updates based on these action items.",https://www.sullcrom.com/SullivanCromwell/_Assets/images/sc-logo-2D_1200x630.png,N,,2025-11-11 14:05:50.728896

Of the 620 parcels, 83 were identified as having potential environmental concerns.","With all of Northwest Indiana’s heavy industry, it’s no wonder that brownfields abound here. But even a strip mall can become a brownfield.

A brownfield could also be an empty field or a house that people are dumping in, said Kathy Luther, the Northwestern Indiana Regional Planning Commission’s director of environmental programs.

“We need READI times 10 to do the amount of work to make these brownfields ready for redevelopment,” Luther said.

It would take hundreds of millions of dollars to eliminate all the brownfield sites in Northwest Indiana, along with a champion for redevelopment funding. That could be the new land development entity.

A brownfield is real estate that is abandoned or inactive or may not be operated at its appropriate use, she told NIRPC’s Environment Committee. Indiana further defines it as making expansion or redevelopment complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, a contaminant, petroleum or a petroleum product.

“There has to be a risk that the property is creating or helping to create that might be a problem,” Luther said.

“Most people might not think a strip mall could be a brownfield, but it could be,” she said. An underground storage tank could be nearby. A car repair facility, factory or empty field? “All of these are brownfields. Sometimes you can tell, and sometimes you can’t.”

Brownfields have been in the news lately because the Northwest Indiana Regional Development Authority decided to create a land development entity that would address the proliferation of brownfields in getting land ready for redevelopment.

Northwest Indiana has 12 Superfund sites – eight in Lake County, one in Porter County and three in LaPorte County – but that’s far from a comprehensive list of brownfields.

Luther zipped through a list of brownfields that have been addressed for redevelopment.

Lost Marsh Golf Course and Recreation Area in Hammond is one of the most well-known examples. That development, opened in 2003, sprawls across 322 acres. The total investment was $55 million.

Removing contaminated soil for Lost Marsh Estates in Hammond cost $80,000, clearing the way for 14 paired patio homes and five single-family homes. “That was one of the first new housing developments in Hammond in 20 years,” Luther said.

The Banc, which turned the former Bank Calumet building in downtown Hammond into a residential building, is another success story. “Yes, we found some contamination, but more on the alley side,” she said.

“I’m excited about this one, because it’s a housing project right near the new train station,” Luther said. “If we hadn’t done it, I’m not sure if the housing project would have gone on,” but the brownfield cleanup provides environmental certainty to residents.

A new subdivision is going in near the Wolf Lake pavilion, where the old Clark High School athletic field stood.

In East Chicago, a new dialysis clinic replaced a former auto parts store

At 4400 Homerlee in East Chicago, the property was purchased at a tax sale without due diligence, Luther said. “There were literally squatters doing business in their building that they weren’t aware of.”

“Mystery barrels” were found in the building. “There was actually solvent coming out of that facility and under the street,” she said. The city addressed that when it tore up the street for another project.

Lakeshore Manor in East Chicago hit the trifecta of previous troubled uses for a property. It was a former dry cleaner, gas station and lumber yard where they treated lumber as the site went through various iterations. It’s now a housing facility.

“There’s actually a limit to how many roll-off rental carts you can get,” Luther learned. A lot of money was spent on testing to reduce the amount of soil that had to be removed. “It was very expensive to do all that – $650,000. A lot of that was due to testing,” she said.

The former Sheraton Hotel in downtown Gary, right by City Hall, was a see-through building for years. It was finally razed, allowing the land under it to be tested for contaminants. “They put a green garden under there,” she pointed out.

Clearing the way for the South Shore Line’s new Miller station took considerable effort. There were 620 parcels screened, just by looking at the paperwork, for potential contamination. At $80 each, that added up. But compare it to $3,500 per parcel to test the soil at each, and it was a bargain.

Of the 620 parcels, 83 were identified as having potential environmental concerns. Only one came back clean.

“The state wanted this to be just the cost of doing business as part of due diligence,” Luther said.

For developers, it can be tempting to build without considering potential contamination of the site. That’s the “if I go to the doctor for this cold, they’re going to find eight other things that’s wrong with me, so I don’t want to go,” mentality, Luther explained. “The question is, what you don’t know can hurt you.”

When the RDA drafted its new strategic plan for the next 10 years – the final version is still being polished although its contents have already been explained – President and CEO Sherri Ziller said the RDA plans to create the local development entity as a nonprofit to work with communities across Lake and Porter counties to assemble parcels and deal with potential barriers to redevelopment, including environmental cleanup.

At the Northwest Indiana Business Roundtable’s economic outlook program Oct. 31 at Ivy Tech Community College in Valparaiso, Ziller said preparing “challenging” properties for productive use will help boost transit-oriented development in the areas surrounding South Shore Line stations, but the efforts won’t be limited to the transit development districts.

The RDA is providing $5 million in seed money for the new local development entity, along with $500,000 from the brownfields revolving loan fund the RDA oversees. Ziller expects the new nonprofit will seek a plethora of grants.

“A lot of the pre-work that has to be done to make these properties suitable for development comes from grants,” Luther said. As federal support for brownfield cleanups changes on a political whim at the federal level, the region needs to be more resilient in how to make this happen, she said.

COP30 offers progressive leaders a chance to prove that climate action is a driver of growth and prosperity in democratic societies, not a drag on them.","After three consecutive years of climate negotiations hosted by authoritarian regimes, the return of the COP summit to a democracy could not come at a more decisive moment. When world leaders gather in Belém for COP30 this week, they will enter a country that has defied both authoritarianism and environmental collapse, a reminder that democracy delivers where despotism destroys.

Just a few years ago, Brazil was at the brink. Under far-right populist Jair Bolsonaro, the Amazon burned at record pace while democratic institutions buckled under relentless attacks. Bolsonaro gutted environmental agencies, defunded enforcement programs and mocked climate science. By 2021, deforestation in the Amazon had surged to the highest annual level in a decade, and the world feared the rainforest might cross an irreversible tipping point.

Then, Brazilians voted for a different future. President Lula da Silva returned to office, on a promise to restore both the environment and democracy. Within a year, deforestation in the Amazon dropped sharply as environmental programs and control regulations were restored. Brazil’s Supreme Federal Court later convicted Bolsonaro for plotting to cling to power after losing the 2022 election, a rare and powerful reminder that climate integrity and democratic integrity indeed rise and fall together.

Now, as Brazil hosts COP30, it is leading by example. Lula’s government is centering three priorities that embody progressive values: strengthening multilateral cooperation; linking climate goals to social and economic transitions; and accelerating implementation of the Paris Agreement. These are not just diplomatic talking points, but a reminder that democracies can still deliver and lead the green transition.

Progressive leaders arriving in Belém will do so under the shadow of a dangerous global backdrop. Around the world, autocrats and far-right populists are waging a coordinated attack on both climate ambition and democratic norms by exploiting legitimate economic anxieties and turning them against climate action. They cast climate policy as an elite project that kills jobs, raises prices, and weakens national sovereignty, while defending the fossil fuel status quo that profits the few and punishes the many. The goal isn’t just to block climate policy — it’s to corrode faith in democracy itself.

From Washington, D.C. to Buenos Aires to Budapest, this narrative has taken hold. In the United States, Trump has undone key climate initiatives while promising to “drill, baby, drill.” In Europe, far-right parties are rising on pledges to roll back green standards, claiming they protect ordinary people from climate regulations. Even leaders who know better are softening their climate agendas, afraid of losing working-class voters to populist backlash.

The result is a race to the bottom — one that risks undoing the fragile progress made since the Paris Agreement. The far right’s message is deceptively simple: climate policy costs too much.

But it’s false. Clean energy is now the cheapest energy in history. Renewables are insulating households from fossil fuel price shocks. Diversifying energy resources can improve grid reliability and help consumers save money during extreme periods of heat and cold. And every delay in the transition makes inflation and instability worse, not better.

The good news is that people still believe in progress. Polling from Global Progress Action and Datapraxis shows strong demand for bold, risk-taking leadership that can deliver real change in their daily lives. In addition, people continue to believe in democracy and are pushing back on strong-man politics without accountability. People want policies that lower their bills, secure their jobs, and strengthen their communities — and climate action can do those things plus guarantee a future for our children and their children. That’s a progressive mandate waiting to be seized.

COP30 offers progressive leaders a chance to prove that climate action is a driver of growth and prosperity in democratic societies, not a drag on them. The evidence is on their side. In Spain, electricity prices have dropped by 50% since 2018 thanks to solar and wind growth.

Globally, jobs in clean energy grew by 3.8% in 2023, far outpacing the rest of the economy. Renewable energy systems make communities more resilient in the face of extreme heat, storms, and geopolitical shocks.

Like Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said at the 2025 Global Progress Action Summit, progressives need to fight far-right narratives with facts, but also with the vision to show that the path to lower costs and greater security is through climate action, not away from it. At Belem, progressives must show that climate leadership is national strength — that it delivers cheaper energy, more jobs, and safer communities, while upholding the values autocrats fear most: transparency, accountability, and solidarity.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/74B7G5477BGF5EG5ZRWJVJ4FTA.jpg?auth=7288635c91bfc22b58f900d6a59536956b93c2abb80be95490e4ab651ffe599d&width=1200,N,,2025-11-11 17:05:35.070956

Since Donald Trump took office, electricity rates have risen 11% nationally – and he is making the affordability crisis worse by taking energy projects offline

Washington, DC – Today, the Charlotte Observer reported that Pine Gate Renewables is laying off more than 78% of its workforce, impacting 223 workers, with the closure of their Asheville facility. This news comes on the heels of the company filing for bankruptcy, directly citing the passage of the Republican budget bill as a contributing factor. Pine Gate has 107 clean energy projects nationwide, which could power over 2.3 million homes. Its subsidiary, Blue Ridge Power, closed in October, laying off 517 workers. This closure was the state’s second-largest layoff in 2025.

It’s not just North Carolina. Donald Trump’s war on clean energy continues to shutter facilities across the country – laying off workers and taking critical energy off the grid as electricity costs skyrocket. Climate Power’s October Energy Crisis Snapshot report shows over 158,000 jobs have already been lost or stalled in the clean energy sector, and gas and electric utilities have raised or sought to increase bills by at least $89.9 billion since Trump took office. Meanwhile, soaring energy costs dominated the political conversation in last Tuesday’s elections, offering Democrats a roadmap for the 2026 midterms.

Climate Power Senior Advisor Jesse Lee issued the following statement:

“Thom Tillis was right, Trump and his lackey Michael Whatley were wrong. Trump and Republican policies are shuttering energy projects across the country, leaving Americans out of work while their utility costs skyrocket. And as we saw last week, voters have had enough. Republicans running for office in North Carolina should see flashing warning signs – Americans are sick of the GOP energy crisis that is leaving them without work and with higher and higher utility costs each month.”

Trump’s reckless energy policies are leaving a trail of shuttered projects across the country, including in North Carolina:

Yesterday, QCells, a solar manufacturing plant in Georgia, announced that it would be furloughing 1,000 workers and permanently laying off an additional 300.

In just two months, six clean energy projects were closed in Michigan, including most recently, two electric vehicle battery plants that laid off 324 workers.

Last month, General Motors laid off 1,200 workers at its electric vehicle plant in Detroit, along with hundreds of additional permanent and temporary layoffs at battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

In October, Topsoe cited the repeal of clean energy tax credits as a reason for canceling 150 jobs and a $400 million investment in their Richmond, Virginia facility.

Earlier last month, Fox 2 Detroit reported that over 100 employees at Dana Incorporated, an electric vehicle battery component manufacturer in Auburn Hills, Michigan, had been laid off.

General Motors canceled a $55 million factory that would have created 300 jobs, citing “decisions of the DOE”.

Fortescue blamed U.S. “policy settings” and the elimination of “critical tax credits” in Trump and Republicans’ budget bill for the cancellation of their $210 million Detroit EV battery factory.

Trump is using the government shutdown as an opportunity to sow even more chaos and uncertainty for American workers by cancelling $8 billion in investments in states that did not vote for him. The Trump administration has put $24 billion for energy projects on the chopping block since May.

In the topsy-turvy world of US energy policy, solar power has been pushed aside while other renewables — namely hydropower, biomass, and geothermal — have earned the support of President Donald Trump’s “American Energy Dominance” program. That’s just plain weird. After all, electricity demand in the US is going through the roof and solar is the most abundant, accessible, and economical domestic energy resource available today. The US Energy Information Agency has the latest word on that topic, in a new report issued on November 10.

32 More Gigawatts Are Coming To The US

The new EIA report does not make much room for biomass, hydropower, geothermal, or any other domestic energy resource to compete against the US solar industry. “Solar power is the fastest-growing source of new electric generating capacity in the United States, driven by large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects built by electric utilities and independent power producers,” the agency reminds everyone.

“In our most recent monthly inventory of power plants, developers reported plans to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online in the next 12 months (October 2025 through September 2026),” EIA reported.

The new report also notes that 5 gigawatts out of the 32 are holdovers from projects that would have been included in earlier reports, had they not encountered delays of various sorts. In other words, delayed projects accounted for a fairly large proportion of the new 12-month total.

That seems to indicate that delays are a substantial problem in the solar industry. However, EIA noted that delays tend to be minimal. “Much of the reported delayed capacity occurs at projects that are in the late construction or testing phases just before they come online. These delays are typically only for a month or two,” EIA explained.

In addition, EIA reported that the proportion of delayed projects has declined in recent months, compared to a similar period last year. “In the third quarter of 2025, solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in the same period in 2024,” EIA stated.

That could be just a blip, or it could indicate a permanent trend as solar developers continue to adopt more efficient construction and testing systems.

Nothing Can Stop The Solar Revolution Now (Except The Usual Suspects)

The latest EIA report also emphasizes that last year’s large proportion of project delays did not prevent the US solar industry from breaking its own yearly record for installed capacity. “Despite the relatively high number of projects reporting delays in 2024, that year was a record year for U.S. solar capacity additions,” EIA reported. “Power plant developers added 31 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar PV generating capacity in 2024, which increased total U.S. utility-scale solar capacity by 34%.

EIA further noted that historically, less than 1% of planned solar capacity is cancelled outright on a month-to-month basis.

Of course, the 800-pound elephant in the room is the political weight of the fossil energy industry. In a new report, the Solar Energy Industries Association takes the gloves off, accusing the Trump administration in all but name of mounting politically motivated roadblocks that could bring more than 500 solar and energy storage projects spread among 44 states to a screeching halt through 2030.

The threatened projects identified by SEIA include 73 gigawatts of solar power and 43 gigawatts of storage that have federal, state and local permits pending. Combined, they total almost 116 gigawatts. “That is more than half of all new power planned to be built in the United States through 2030,” SEIA notes.

“At a time when electricity demand is skyrocketing to meet the needs of AI, data centers, and manufacturing, the Administration is using every tool at its disposal to slow down solar and storage projects,” SEIA emphasizes.

“This blockade is undermining American energy security, driving up costs for families and businesses, and exacerbating the ‘energy emergency’ that the Trump administration itself declared earlier this year,” the organization emphasizes again for good measure.

What Is Your Emergency?

Yes, what about that emergency? Going by US President Donald Trump’s rising habit of literally sleeping through public events, the emergency — such as it was — has come and gone. After all, once the Commander-in-Chief begins to sleep through an emergency of his own calling, perhaps it should be called something else.

Be that as it may, both wind and solar power drew the short end of the stick when Trump launched his “American Energy Dominance” plan upon taking office in January. After all, the plan was to enlist all hands on deck to meet the alleged emergency, but both wind and solar power are conspicuously absent.

Instead, the plan supports four other forms of renewable energy that have a limited capacity to expand in the US, at least over the near term: biomass, hydropower, geothermal, and marine energy.

Biomass power plants, for example, face siting limitations related to the economics of transporting biomass fuel, among other factors including land use and food systems concerns. As with any other new power plant proposal, community opposition and legal roadblocks can also spark long delays and outright cancellations.

Growth in the US hydropower industry is also location-strained, with water resources, geographical constraints, and transmission bottlenecks among the limiting factors in the way of new hydropower dams and new pumped hydropower projects, too. Accordingly, in recent years the industry has shifted focus from building expensive new Hoover-style hydropower dams to retrofitting non-powered dams with turbines. However, feasibility constraints will limit the total potential to just 12 gigawatts, according to a recent study by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. That can help some communities, but it’s not nearly enough to satisfy the demands of a national energy emergency, such as it is.

The US geothermal industry is an interesting case because it is beginning to overcome longstanding technology hurdles that have limited geothermal power plants to just a few scattered locations in the the western US. However, collectively the next generation of advanced geothermal systems has yet to gain a foothold in the nation’s power grid. Widespread adoption is a long term solution, not a response to an energy emergency.

As for marine energy, athough President Trump did not check that box when he declared his energy emergency, the US Department of Energy is continuing to support innovation in the nation’s emerging marine energy industry. Marine energy devices collect the kinetic energy of waves, tides, and currents, and convert it to an electrical current. As with advanced geothermal energy, though, the marine energy field has barely reached the beginning phases of commercial viability.

Solar Power & The Energy Storage Angle

As indicated by the new EIA report, the solar power outlook over the next 12 months is fairly reasonable. It’s also worth noting that the Energy Department is continuing to fund new innovation in the energy storage field. The agency’s previous energy storage funding programs are also beginning to bear fruit, helping to support solar industry growth at some future date when the national brain fart finally runs its course.

What happens after the next 12 months is up to the voting public, with the all-important mid-term elections coming up in November 2026.

I have spent nearly a decade working on energy issues at PPL Electric Utilities, right here in the Lehigh Valley. I have seen firsthand how smart investments in clean energy reduce costs for families and create reliable jobs across our community. I have also seen how politicians like Mackenzie say one thing in public, and then do the opposite when Washington Republicans come calling.

That’s why I’m running for Congress, because this district deserves a representative who is consistent, honest, and willing to fight for affordable energy. This district deserves better – not someone who caves to Trump’s agenda while hoping voters aren’t paying attention.

Let’s be clear: Ryan Mackenzie is one of 21 Republicans who publicly supported clean energy tax credits and then voted to rip them away. Now he’s trying to have it both ways by telling voters he supports lower utility bills while voting to eliminate the very programs that deliver them. Unfortunately, Ryan, you can’t advocate for something, then vote it down, and think we’re not going to see through your empty “letters.”

Pennsylvanians, you face a choice. You can continue with leaders who vote for cuts that hurt families, or you can vote for me, someone who spent over a decade fighting for affordable and sustainable energy. Someone who keeps the promises they make.

The report, which models energy trends through 2060, highlights a temporary setback for renewables but anticipates strong growth for wind and solar power from the mid-2030s onwards.

According to DNV, new policy changes have extended fossil fuel dominance in the North American energy mix. Fossil fuels, which currently make up around 80% of primary energy, are now expected to provide half of total energy demand by 2050—five percentage points higher than forecast in the previous edition. Natural gas will remain the most significant fossil fuel, supplying around one-third of electricity by 2035 and 40% of manufacturing energy by 2060.

Despite this prolonged reliance, renewables are set for a substantial rebound. DNV predicts that wind and solar will grow from 19% of electricity generation today to 55% by 2040. After an initial slowdown when the Inflation Reduction Act incentives expire, installations are expected to regain momentum as renewable generation increasingly replaces gas-fired power from 2034. The report also notes that both solar and onshore wind remain the cheapest sources of electricity, with their levelised cost of energy significantly below that of gas-fired turbines.

Battery storage capacity will play a key role in integrating renewables. By 2040, North America is forecast to have 1.8 TWh of grid-connected batteries—25 times more than in 2024—with almost 60% co-located with solar generation. Behind-the-meter systems in commercial buildings will also expand, encouraged by long interconnection delays, increasing the share of self-generated electricity to 10% by 2040.

However, the shift to low-carbon energy will take longer than previously expected. DNV now forecasts that near-complete decarbonisation of the power mix will not be reached until 2058, eight years later than in last year’s outlook. Cumulative energy-related emissions between 2024 and 2050 are projected to be 19 billion tonnes higher due to the delayed transition.

Electricity prices are expected to rise by around 22% over the next decade, driven mainly by grid investments and continued reliance on gas in tight power markets.",https://www.windtech-international.com/images/logo/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-11 14:05:57.046305

What appeared to be a software fault was, in fact, a warning about the material fragility of American power. Behind every “cloud” lies a mountain of hardware: transformers, copper cabling, rare earth magnets, and fiber optics. These materials anchor the digital infrastructure of the United States. When the supply chains for data centers and industry falter, compute slows, translating into degraded command-and-control capabilities for the US military.

In an era of strategic competition, digital reliability is deterrence. A single outage in a hyperscale facility can ripple across intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) networks, disrupting real-time operational efficiency. Data centers power the digital age and the associated server farms underpin everything from economic productivity to military decision-making and intelligence operations. Current data center infrastructure is composed of thousands of acres of servers, transformers, and cooling towers scattered across North America. However, these private-sector behemoths remain perilously exposed. In the digital era, failure to treat data and data centers as national defense assets is a strategic blind spot.

The dynamics of deterrence have evolved in the 21st century. Previously, power projection relied on fuel and steel; currently, it relies on megawatts and computational throughput. The physical foundations of the cloud, including transformers, rare earth elements, and copper, are as essential to national security capabilities as shipyards and automobile assembly lines previously were.

The same materials that make fighter jets, missiles, and satellites are what make artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, cyber warfare, and command and control possible. When supply chains for these materials falter, such as through Chinese export controls on certain minerals and rare earths, or when power grid bottlenecks delay new facilities, the US military’s ability to process and act on information stalls. A targeted mineral embargo against the United States could undermine the infrastructure that supports military networks for collection and dissemination of ISR information.

For policymakers, the issue is that data centers are dual use. The Pentagon’s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) and Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) networks utilize the same commercial power and server backbones that serve industry. A disruption in copper, transformer steel, or photonic components slows both sectors simultaneously. The boundary between civilian compute and military command has effectively vanished; resilience in one now requires resilience in the other.

Cloud outages have a major impact on the economy, critical infrastructure, and military operations, meaning the security and the functioning of these data centers are a major national security issue. This article traces the hidden linkage between data centers, component materials, and military readiness. It quantifies the physical footprint of compute infrastructure and examines the emerging vulnerabilities in supply chains and construction timelines before outlining concrete policy steps to harden the ability of US digital computing power.

The Mathematics of Data Centers: Power, Materials, and Build Cycles

Compute power may seem infinite, but its physical limits are constrained by materials and infrastructure. Building a single 100-megawatt AI-enabled data center—a power requirement on par with a mid-sized American city like Dayton, Ohio—has massive physical requirements. Each site needs about 2,700 tons of copper for cabling and busbars, 150 to 200 tons of transformer-grade steel, and more than 50,000 tons of concrete and structural steel for the shell. Even the smallest components carry strategic weight: rare-earth magnets inside hard-disk drives, gold in server connectors, and indium phosphide in optical transceivers. These materials form America’s compute base (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Material Intensity in a 100 MW AI Data Center (estimates)

The estimates for material tonnage are a synthesis of data from multiple sources, including the International Copper Association (2022) for copper requirements, the Department of Energy (2024) for transformer steel, and Arup (2022) for other embodied materials. Figures for rare earth elements and gold are based on component-level mineral data from the USGS (2024).

Every new data center build amplifies these demands. Their construction has already become one of the world’s fastest-growing industrial sectors for copper, aluminum, and specialized steels. Yet production of critical raw materials remains concentrated in a handful of unstable and/or authoritarian countries. The mathematics are unforgiving: Small shortages in transformer steel or copper can delay data center completion by years, with cascading effects on compute availability across both the civilian economy and defense networks.

This situation reflects the limitations that previously characterized naval logistics and fuel supply chains in the 20th century. In this context, computation has become a new form of logistics: Instead of moving oil to the front, it moves information to the decision-maker. And like oil, its flow depends on extraction, refining, and transport chains that are slow, exposed, and politically entangled.

Power requirements amplify the problem. Each megawatt of data center load also requires an investment in grid capacity through substations, high-voltage lines, and cooling systems, which depend on the same constrained material inputs.

Meanwhile, China’s 2024 National Computing Network Initiative plans over 300 new dual-use data centers that explicitly combine commercial and defense functions. Conversely, the expansion of computing in the United States is constrained by transformer shortages, permitting delays, and utility congestion. The inequality lies in hardware: Those who govern material throughput dictate digital speed. This disparity poses a sustained threat to information supremacy.

The American economy and military are racing to deploy AI, advanced analytics, and global sensor networks, yet current bottlenecks reside in the alloys. Each layer of digital acceleration adds an industrial burden that compounds over time. Rather than pursuing an endless build-up of capacity, the United States must also innovate its way out of material dependence. Advances in chip architecture, photonics integration, and compute efficiency, like domain-specific accelerators and co-packaged optics, can reduce the physical footprint of compute. Investing in efficiency at the transistor and algorithm level can stretch limited materials far further than adding another data hall.

Emerging Vulnerabilities: Grid, Transformers, and Mineral Bottlenecks

The most advanced command-and-control systems in the world still depend on transformers, specialized metals, and high-purity optics that each have globalized supply chains with slow replacement cycles. What once seemed like a commercial challenge is now a question of national security. A grid failure or material shortage that halts data center construction can lead to delays in the flow of intelligence and targeting data to combatant commands.

Transformer availability sits at the center of this risk. Rising demand, aging manufacturing equipment, and global concentration of electrical-steel supply have extended delivery schedules from under a year to more than four (see Figure 2). The same pattern holds for high-voltage substation components and electrical steel, where China, India, and Japan dominate supply. This creates an invisible drag on digital expansion. Even if America builds new compute clusters, the energy infrastructure that powers them cannot keep pace.

Figure 2. Lead-Time Ladder for Critical Compute Infrastructure

The estimates for lead times are derived from an aggregation of data from the US Department of Energy (DOE) reports in 2023 and 2024, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) in 2024, and private-sector analyses, including those from EPRI, the Uptime Institute, and McKinsey in 2023. The figures represent median durations and are subject to variation based on capacity and permitting jurisdiction.

These constraints spill directly into defense readiness. The recent US Department of Energy Grid Supply Chain Review cautions that the transformer backlog, extending for many years, is causing systemic delays in both commercial and defense programs. The 2021 Texas power crisis illustrated how grid instability can lead to widespread digital blackouts. Should such a disruption coincide with cyber or kinetic attacks, command-and-control systems dependent on commercial clouds may fail during crucial mobilization phases. In contrast, China’s State Grid Corporation manages dual-purpose “computing and command” corridors that ensure uninterrupted power supply for military intelligence fusion centers. The disparity is stark: US computing relies on market logistics, but China’s computing is regarded as national defense infrastructure.

Equally concerning is the geopolitical geography of these critical materials. China produces over 70 percent of the world’s transformer steel, refines most rare-earth elements, and dominates the wafer-level photonics used in optical transceivers. Any export restriction or embargo could throttle global build-out of hyperscale compute, giving Beijing a lever over both economic and military networks. Even friendly bottlenecks matter: The United States has only two domestic transformer plants capable of producing the large units needed for defense-critical data centers. The combination of long industrial lead times and concentrated supply creates a slow-burn crisis. Power, not processing speed, may determine who holds the advantage in digital-age warfare.

From Compute to Combat Power: Why the Cloud Is a Warfighting Enabler

Modern warfighting runs on compute. Every mission, from satellite intelligence and maritime surveillance to predictive maintenance and AI-enabled targeting, depends on data flowing through vast server farms and secure fiber links. These networks form to support military and intelligence actions across Joint All Domain Operations (JADO). When that data flow slows, the tempo of sensing, deciding, and acting slows with it. Compute latency means combat latency.

Decision cycles that previously depended on human analysis increasingly rely on distributed computing infrastructures. The more rapidly a nation can receive, communicate, and integrate sensor data, the more credible its deterrent stance becomes. Throughout the conflict in Ukraine, distributed cloud architectures were pivotal. When Russian missile strikes targeted Ukraine’s command infrastructure, Kyiv rapidly migrated intelligence and targeting data to cloud-based systems. That shift allowed operations to continue with minimal disruption, preserving pace and decision speed even under attack. Compute resilience enabled continuity of operations.

Compute is the new logistics for 21st-century warfare. It moves information instead of fuel, but its vulnerabilities are strikingly similar: limited surge capacity, globalized dependencies, and long resupply timelines. The United States once maintained strategic stockpiles of oil and munitions to ensure freedom of action in crisis. Today it must think the same way about the transformers, rare-earth magnets, and photonic wafers that are needed for a data server farm. Each is a “just-in-time” component that underwrites digital-age war.

Faster kill chains require the compute power hidden in the algorithms and AI at physical server farms, which depend on uninterrupted access to power, bandwidth, and data. An adversary that can choke these inputs, either through cyber-attack, export control, or sabotage, can slow US decision-making without firing a shot. Hence, protecting compute infrastructure is a strategic imperative that can hinder or enable US military operations in crisis or conflict.

Ultimately, superiority in warfighting increasingly depends on data that can be processed, transmitted, and acted upon faster than the enemy. Compute is combat power, and the materials that sustain it are the new munitions. Securing this edge means the United States must defend and sustain the factories, foundries, and substations that make data centers function.

Six Steps to Improve US Compute Power and Resilience

We highlight six steps needed to align industrial tools and defense planning approaches to preserve the US economy and military warfighting abilities.

First, Washington must designate and protect National Compute Nodes, data center clusters whose function is critical to both economic stability and military readiness. These facilities should receive priority access to transformers, fiber routes, and electrical power, along with hardened redundancy and physical defenses comparable to strategic ports and air bases. Compute should be viewed as a form of infrastructure sovereignty and defended accordingly. Regional diversification of data centers would ensure resilience, so that no single natural disaster, cyber-attack, or grid failure can paralyze national decision-making.

Second, the United States must accelerate grid and transformer capacity. Transformer lead times now exceed two years, delaying both commercial and defense projects. The Department of Energy should coordinate with industry to co-fund new electrical-steel and transformer manufacturing plants, establish a strategic reserve of key grid components, and expedite permitting for defense-critical substations. Every week of delay in electrical power delivery translates into slower compute growth, meaning slower economic growth and military command and control.

Third, policymakers must secure materials and photonics supply chains. Copper, transformer steel, rare-earth magnets, and indium-phosphide wafers underpin the entire data center ecosystem. Yet these midstream refining and finishing processes are concentrated in China. Extending Defense Production Act authorities, allied sourcing partnerships, and industrial incentives to these materials will reduce foreign dependency. Recycling and circular-economy programs can supplement domestic supply, but they cannot substitute for new refining and alloy capacity on US soil.

Fourth, Washington needs to deploy targeted industrial tools to rebuild the “missing middle” of manufacturing that connects raw materials to finished components. CHIPS Act styled incentives should expand to include magnet alloys, capacitor powders, optical connectors, and power electronics. These investments are modest compared to the strategic cost of supply-chain ruptures in wartime; plus, they yield long-term dividends in jobs, technology, and resilience across the defense industrial base.

Fifth, compute resilience must become an element of defense planning. Combatant commands should wargame scenarios in which data centers or regional grids are degraded or disrupted. Exercises should test backup compute, power rerouting, and data prioritization under contested conditions, just as logistics drills stress munitions and fuel. Deterrence depends on speed of response, and the assurance that speed can be sustained when data systems are strained or attacked.

Finally, the United States must align its electrical power grid with national security. Data center reliability depends on uninterrupted energy. This can mean small modular reactors, advanced geothermal plants, or contracted renewables backed by large-scale storage. The Pentagon should treat megawatts as munitions: finite, strategic, and vital to operations. Hardening that power base completes the loop between energy, compute, and combat power. It ensures the US military can sense, decide, and act faster than an adversary.

Emerging sensor technologies will amplify these compute demands. Quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and other precision sensors will generate unprecedented data volumes, collapsing the decision window in future conflicts. Quantum sensing may make the invisible visible, but only if backed by resilient compute infrastructure capable of processing those signals in real time. Without secure power and stable data centers, quantum advantages are lost to immense noise these systems will generate.

By locking power, materials, and manufacturing into a single resilience plan, the United States can preserve its edge economically and militarily. Securing transformers, materials, and megawatts is as vital as maintaining aircraft or missiles. Washington must invest in the industrial base of intelligence—the physical architecture of cognition that turns information into strategy and compute into combat power.

American competitiveness will be built from silicon and electricity. Future success depends on every algorithm, satellite, soldier, and weapon system operating with an uninterrupted cloud. The chemistry of modern war has changed: It now runs on materials, minerals, and megawatts.

Balcony Solar Power, Coming Soon To The US Circling back around to Enphase, the company has also been staking out a claim in the emerging global balcony solar power field.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

This year’s seismic shift in federal energy policy has spelled bad news for the US solar industry. However, it’s a big world out there, and domestic solar innovators can help push the renewable energy transition elsewhere around the world. One emerging example is the global gas station solar power trend, where the leading California-based tech firm Enphase aims to play a key role.

The Gas Station Solar Power Trend Is Coming For Your…Gas?

At first glance, solar power at gas stations is an oxymoron. However, with their large, sprawling roofs and parking lots that provide a buffer from shade obstructions, gas stations are among the low hanging fruits of the booming commercial rooftop solar industry.

Besides, gas stations have to pay their electricity bills just like any other ratepayer. Rooftop solar presents an economical alternative to the grid mix. Combined with on-site energy storage, solar panels can also keep the lights on in case of a grid outage, and they can help gas stations take advantage of low off-peak electricity rates.

The rising interest of the retail gas business in solar power is not a particularly new phenomenon, but there is still plenty of room for enterprising solar industry stakeholders to stake out more turf, and that’s where Enphase comes in.

Last week, the company reminded everyone that its IQ8™ microinverters are a perfect fit for solar arrays at gas stations. Microinverters convert the DC current from a solar array into a usable AC current on a panel-by-panel basis. Though generally more expensive than conventional inverters, microinverters can offset lifetime costs by optimizing the output from each panel.

Enphase also drew attention to the safety requirements of gas stations. “Enphase microinverters are uniquely suited to gas station installations thanks to their AC-based system architecture, which eliminates the risk of dangerous high-voltage DC wiring and potential arc-fault fires,” the company announced on November 6.

“Built-in Rapid Shutdown capabilities ensure automatic system shutdown in emergencies, while a NEMA 6 rating allows for reliable performance in harsh weather conditions,” Enphase added, referring to a standard scale established by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.

More Solar Power For Your Balcony

To date, much of Enphase-related gas station activity has been occurring overseas, particularly in Southeast Asia. “In Southeast Asia, Enphase microinverters are powering hundreds of gas stations. Super Central Gas has installed Enphase systems across 105 Shell stations, while multiple installers – Super Central Gas, TNS Network Solution, and MRO Engineering – have equipped PTT franchise sites,” Enphase notes.

Enphase is also seeking to ramp up its gas station footprint in the US. As the company points out, most of its microinverters are manufactured domestically, potentially qualifying US sites for commercial tax credits. The company draws attention to a Tri Gaz 5 gas station in Texas, where its microinverters are featured in a 49 kilowatt array installed by the firm Dynamic EcoHome (formerly Dynamic SLR). Though modest in size, the the project will enable solar power to offset 17% of the the facility’s electricity use while delivering a lifetime savings that tops $150,000.

As Enphase points out, safety is a key issue helping to push the pace of the gas station solar power trend. Wartime grid interruptions are also becoming a concern, for example in Ukraine, where a retail gas stationed owned by Galnaftogaz is getting retrofitted with a rooftop solar array and energy storage system as a pilot project. “This setup will ensure uninterrupted operation, even during power outages or emergencies,” notes the firm PVKnowHow. A conventional generator will also come into play if needed.

The system is designed to work autonomously for up to two days. If the pilot project works out, Galnaftogaz reportedly plans to expand it throughout Ukraine.

Yet another factor, of course, is the vehicle electrification movement. On-site solar power with energy storage slots neatly into the EV sustainability profile. For gas stations, the payoff is attracting more drivers among the zero emission set.

Balcony Solar Power, Coming Soon To The US

Circling back around to Enphase, the company has also been staking out a claim in the emerging global balcony solar power field. Balcony solar refers to plug-and-play solar panels designed for ease of use. In contrast to rooftop solar arrays, which are permanent fixtures installed by professionals, balcony solar systems are temporary. They can be hung from balconies or elsewhere around a building. Homeowners and tenants can simply remove them and bring them along whenever they move.

Germany has become known as a balcony solar hotspot, and Enphase has been quick to jump on the trend. In May, the company launched its new “Enphase® IQ® Balcony Solar System” in Germany. “Designed for plug-and-play installation, the new system empowers apartment dwellers and homeowners with limited roof space to generate their own clean energy from balconies, patios, and small outdoor areas,” Enphase enthused.

Enphase also took note of the role of government subsidies in pushing the balcony solar trend. “According to SolarPower Europe, Germany registered 435,000 new balcony systems in 2024, compared to 276,000 in 2023,” the company noted. “There are now 780,000 total balcony solar installations across the country, driven by significant regional subsidies.”

The balcony solar trend has yet to materialize in the US in force, but the floodgates began to burst open earlier this year when the state of Utah put new legislation in motion that permits ratepayers to use small, plug-in solar devices without having to go through their local utility.

The US balcony solar power movement still has a long way to go but momentum has been accelerating, with the San Francisco nonprofit Bright Saver among those pushing the envelope.

In a profile of the organization last week, The Sierra Club credits Utah with providing a model for other states to follow. Currently, balcony solar bills have been filed in New York and Pennsylvania. Legislators in Vermont and New Hampshire are also expected to introduce bills in January, and Bright Saver co-founder Kevin Chou expects two others to announce legislation before the end of this year.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dynamic-Eco-Home-gas-station-solar-power-.png,N,,2025-11-11 22:05:38.992866

For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter.
Wolfe encourages families to take small, consistent steps to manage heating costs before winter peaks.","ATLANTA — This week's cold blast is setting the stage for winter, and experts say heating your home could cost more this year.

“Everyone is saying prices are going up,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. ""Nobody is saying prices are coming down.""

Wolfe said rising costs for electricity and natural gas will make home heating more expensive for most families this winter. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association projects average home heating costs will rise 7.6%, from $907 last winter to about $976 this season. Families using electric heat will see the biggest jump — up 10.2% to about $1,205 — while natural gas costs are expected to rise from $639 to $693.

The organization, which represents state directors of the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, said electricity and natural gas prices have been climbing at more than twice the rate of inflation, driven by higher gas prices, growing demand from data centers and grid maintenance.

“Electric utilities are rebuilding the grid, and that’s pushing up prices,” Wolfe said. “Data centers are also placing new demands on the grid, which is driving up costs even more.”

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s 2025–26 Winter Fuels Outlook, the majority of Americans heat their homes with natural gas or electric heat, with 46% using natural gas and 43% using electricity. The EIA’s outlook is less bullish, forecasting the average electricity bill will rise about 4% from November through March 2026, to a national average of about $1,130.

For households not powered by electricity or natural gas, heating costs are expected to drop or remain steady this winter. The EIA expects heating oil and propane costs to fall by just under 10%, while NEADA predicts savings closer to 5%.

Wolfe encourages families to take small, consistent steps to manage heating costs before winter peaks.

“Every one degree you turn your thermostat down can save about 2% on your bill,” Wolfe said. “Turn it down gradually — one degree a week — so you stay comfortable.”",https://media.wwltv.com/assets/CCT/images/bc4a27be-180e-4669-acdf-523c3abcc992/20251111T161005/bc4a27be-180e-4669-acdf-523c3abcc992_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 12:09:18.952459

Referring to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), SEIA says 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects, spread across 44 states, are yet to receive the requisite permits. These are at risk of being ‘targeted’ by the administration. Their loss could mean 18 states could lose half of all their planned capacity, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada. Texas alone accounts for nearly 40% of the at-risk projects.

“They represent the heart of America’s energy future and are critical to meeting soaring demand and keeping prices affordable,” claims the solar trade body in a new report.

According to the association, developers that have already secured zoning approvals, completed environmental studies, and worked with local communities are now unable to move forward as they need to consult with federal agencies before beginning construction.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the Trump administration has tightened permitting and tax credits for wind and solar energy in the country. It has also increased scrutiny for such projects by the Department of the Interior, while terminating funding for clean energy (see Elevated US Federal Scrutiny For Wind & Solar Energy Projects).

Many projects are stuck in limbo under Washington’s new energy permitting system, including solar and storage projects on private land now caught up in multiple federal reviews, says the association.

It adds, “This federal overreach erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host.”

“If these projects can’t move forward, customers will be forced to compete for a shrinking supply of electricity. That means higher prices and a destabilized grid,” warns the association.

However, the EIA recently said that in Q3 2025, solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in Q3 2024, and that delays in bringing these projects into operation have been trending downward in recent months.

Calling solar and storage the quickest way to add new power at scale, accounting for 84% of new capacity in 2024 and 71% of planned capacity buildout, the SEIA argues that these technologies offer fast, affordable generation to meet the growing electricity demand from AI, data centers, and manufacturing.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-11-11%2Fntt3y7pt%2FSEIA.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-11-11 15:08:25.368502

Despite this, thieves are stealing charging cables, disrupting the lives of EV drivers, and hindering the electric movement.

Going electric, though, is a critical way for consumers to lower their carbon footprints. Polluting gases from gas-powered machines — be they cars, yard tools, or stoves — trap heat in the atmosphere.

It causes a whole slew of environmental issues, such as extreme weather events, according to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute.

Extreme weather events leave people and animals in disarray amid climate-driven wildfires, floods, and droughts.

Pollutants in the air also cause respiratory issues, including asthma attacks in children.

EVs, on the other hand, release no fumes, and the pollution from lithium battery mining does not compare to that from gas-operated appliances.

EVs also save consumers money. The cost to charge an electric vehicle is significantly lower than the cost to fuel a gas vehicle, and maintenance costs are also lower, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council.

A combination of an at-home charging station and solar panels can further reduce charging costs, bringing the price close to zero. EnergySage offers solar quotes to those interested.

Going electric is worth it, but something must be done about charging cable vandalism.

SMEs – which account for 90 per cent of UK manufacturers – often lack the financial headroom to try or scale laser technologies.
Many of the benefits of laser processing are unlocked through automation, so when barriers to automation exist, they can significantly hinder wider laser adoption.
Without in-house integration expertise or access to customised solutions, scaling laser technologies can be difficult, even when the commercial case is clear.","Laser processing has quietly become one of the most strategically important technologies in UK manufacturing. Once considered niche, it now sits at the heart of high-growth sectors, from batteries and semiconductors to hydrogen, and could contribute over £170bn to the UK economy by 2035.

But realising this potential depends on whether we treat laser manufacturing as a national priority or continue to let global competitors outpace us.

A technology already delivering impact

Laser-enabled manufacturing isn’t waiting in the wings, it’s already delivering impact, especially in clean energy. In battery production, laser welding is one of the few viable methods for joining internal connectors to external terminals, a process critical to the performance and reliability of electric vehicles and energy storage systems. In hydrogen technologies, lasers are used to manufacture fuel cells and pressure vessels with the precision needed for safe, efficient energy delivery.

MORE FROM OPINION

Beyond clean energy, lasers also make several strategic technologies viable. In semiconductor manufacturing, for example, they enable wafer cutting, micro-hole drilling, and advanced packaging-processes essential to the UK’s ambitions in AI, quantum computing, and next-generation electronics. These aren’t emerging technologies – they’re active, scaling, and central to the UK’s industrial strategy and net zero ambitions.

Unlocking the laser advantage

Laser processing combines precision, energy efficiency, and digital control – a rare mix making it ideally suited to modern manufacturing. It integrates seamlessly with automated systems and data-driven production environments, enabling manufacturers to scale output without compromising quality. Over the past decade, the cost of laser power has dropped significantly, while energy efficiency has improved, making the technology more accessible and commercially viable across sectors.

The UK has a strong laser manufacturing foundation: world-class research institutions, a vibrant SME ecosystem, and established strengths in aerospace, defence, and automotive. But despite these assets, adoption remains uneven, and the UK risks falling behind.

Barriers to laser adoption

Other countries are moving faster in turning laser research into real-world manufacturing. Germany, China, and the US have invested heavily in training, automation, and local supply chains, making it easier for their industries to adopt laser technologies at scale. In the UK, progress has been slower, and manufacturers continue to face persistent hurdles.

Skills shortages remain a significant challenge across the UK’s manufacturing landscape. Many firms struggle to recruit engineers and technicians with hands-on laser expertise – a gap that slows adoption and innovation. While some postgraduate programmes exist, there are currently no dedicated apprenticeship standards for laser processing. MTC Training offers a general laser processing course for industry, and institutions such as The Welding Institute, Warwick Manufacturing Group, and Cranfield University include laser-related modules within broader programmes like welding and advanced manufacturing. However, few courses focus specifically on lasers.

Cost is another significant hurdle. SMEs – which account for 90 per cent of UK manufacturers – often lack the financial headroom to try or scale laser technologies. Even as equipment costs decline, the necessary upfront investment can still be prohibitive.

Many of the benefits of laser processing are unlocked through automation, so when barriers to automation exist, they can significantly hinder wider laser adoption. Many manufacturers operate with complex production requirements that exceed the capabilities of standard, off-the-shelf integrated systems. Without in-house integration expertise or access to customised solutions, scaling laser technologies can be difficult, even when the commercial case is clear.

Supply chain limitations compound the challenge. The UK has relatively few domestic laser system integrators and service providers, resulting in higher costs, longer lead times, and increased dependence on international suppliers, a vulnerability exposed by recent geopolitical disruptions.

These barriers are not new, but they’re becoming more acute.

What the sector needs now

To unlock the full potential of laser processing, we need targeted action across four fronts:

· Skills investment: Grow the number of engineers and technicians with hands-on laser expertise. That means expanding vocational training, modular learning, and apprenticeships – building on existing programmes and making them more widely available.

· Support for SMEs: Help smaller manufacturers explore and adopt laser technologies by adapting funding schemes to cover early-stage trials, equipment investment, and process validation. Innovation grants should clearly include laser-based solutions.

· Industry-academic collaboration: Speed up the journey from research to real-world impact by investing in shared facilities, joint R&D projects, and regional innovation hubs.

· Awareness and confidence building: Showcase successful examples, especially from SMEs, to build trust in the technology and highlight the long-term return on investment.

A strategic enabler for UK manufacturing

Laser processing isn’t just a technical upgrade – it’s a key enabler for clean energy innovation, industrial resilience, and global competitiveness. From EV batteries to hydrogen systems and fuel cells, lasers deliver the precision, efficiency, and scalability these technologies demand. If realised, this capability can support net zero goals, strengthen domestic supply chains, and create high-value jobs.

The UK has the expertise. Now it needs the commitment. Let’s make laser manufacturing a cornerstone of our industrial future.",https://www.theengineer.co.uk/media/d5jldal5/mtc-laser-processing-image.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 13:02:32.466629
,IRA Tax Credits,2025-11-11 15:35:20+00:00,Unión Rayo EN,"Confirmed - US government offers up to $2,000 to those who replace their water heater ...",Laura M,,,,,https://unionrayo.com/en/water-heater-credit/,"It has now launched a $2,000 tax credit for those who replace their traditional water heater with a more modern one (the kind that comes with a heat pump because they are more sustainable).
Why change the water heater?
In other words, if you install a heat pump water heater that costs $4,700, you could get back $1,400 when you file your tax return.
Is it worth switching to a heat pump water heater?
Beyond the savings “We switched to a heat-pump water heater last year and honestly, it’s been amazing.","Renew or die, and the government prefers the first option. It has now launched a $2,000 tax credit for those who replace their traditional water heater with a more modern one (the kind that comes with a heat pump because they are more sustainable). So, if you still have an old water heater and have been thinking about changing it, you have until December 31 to receive $2,000 and make the replacement less expensive.

Why change the water heater?

First, because they offer you $2,000 just for changing it, and second, because old heaters account for almost 12% of the energy consumption of an average home. So, switching to a newer and more efficient one will help you save quite a bit of money each year.

How does the credit work?

Basically, the program refunds 30% of what it costs you to buy and install it, with a maximum amount of $2,000 per year.

In other words, if you install a heat pump water heater that costs $4,700, you could get back $1,400 when you file your tax return.

Lower-income households can qualify for an extra rebate of up to $1,750 through the Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate Program.

This will be available until September 2031, or until the funds run out (so it’s better not to wait too long).

Is it worth switching to a heat pump water heater?

Yes, in fact, they are much more efficient, cleaner, and cheaper to maintain. It is estimated that they use two to three times less energy.

According to Energy Star, a family of four can save up to $550 a year just by making this change, and you also help reduce pollution because you don’t need gas or fossil fuels.

A user on social media mentioned that their 270-liter LG model barely consumes 750 kWh per year compared to 4,000 kWh from a regular electric water heater. Not bad.

The credit expires soon

This was created under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) approved three years ago, in 2022, but it has an expiration date and ends this December 31, 2025. That means you have less than two months to buy and install it if you want to include it in your 2025 tax return.

How to apply

Claim the credit when filing your federal tax return using the corresponding IRS form.

If you also want to access the additional rebate, check your household’s eligibility through Energy Star.

Beyond the savings

“We switched to a heat-pump water heater last year and honestly, it’s been amazing. Our electric bill dropped by about 30%, and it’s so quiet you barely notice it running. The upfront cost was a bit scary, but the tax credit made it manageable. I wish we’d done it sooner” said an user

What the government wants is to reduce carbon emissions, and it is estimated that if 10% of Americans made the switch, more than 20 million tons of CO2 would be reduced per year.

Thus, the demand for clean technologies is growing, and users’ wallets are not feeling it as much (I emphasize “as much” because changing the water heater is quite expensive, hence the credit).

But this is an opportunity that will soon say goodbye, and anything that helps save a bit is always welcome. Especially if it’s something you will have to replace eventually, better to do it now while you still get a refund!",https://unionrayo.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Water-heater-installation-dos-and-donts.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 12:08:52.157353
,Clean Energy ,2025-11-11 15:28:31+00:00,Mexico Business,*Powershoring and Mexico: The Green Logistics Opportunity,Not Available,,,,,https://mexicobusiness.news/mobility/news/powershoring-and-mexico-green-logistics-opportunity,"But a new model is emerging: powershoring, or the relocation of industry to regions capable of powering manufacturing and logistics with clean, competitive energy.
Mexico has the same chance, perhaps an even bigger one given its geographic position and manufacturing scale.
If it succeeds, it could add up to 1.5% to annual GDP growth and generate thousands of highly skilled jobs, with positions in energy engineering, green logistics, supply chain analytics, and sustainable manufacturing.
The question is whether Mexico will move with enough vision and speed to lead — not follow — this shift.
It will belong to the countries that produce with the cleanest energy, the smartest logistics, and the courage to reinvent themselves.","There are moments when the global economy quietly shifts, long before most people notice what is happening. Today, we are experiencing one of those turning points. The next transformation of supply chains will not be fueled by efficiency or cost optimization, but by something far more decisive: access to clean, reliable energy. That shift is opening a door that countries are only beginning to see.

For years, the conversation revolved around offshoring, reshoring, and nearshoring. But a new model is emerging: powershoring, or the relocation of industry to regions capable of powering manufacturing and logistics with clean, competitive energy. It is not simply about producing closer to the market, but about producing cleaner, smarter, and with long-term resilience. Nearshoring put many regions back on the map. Powershoring will define who stays there.

Energy represents nearly 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. For multinational companies with net-zero commitments and ESG accountability, shifting production is no longer a business strategy, it’s a climate mandate. The race is no longer for the lowest labor cost, but for the most competitive carbon footprint.

This is where Mexico enters the picture, with both a unique advantage and a pressing challenge. A country with one of the strongest manufacturing ecosystems in the Western Hemisphere, positioned next to the US consumer market, now holds a strategic asset the world is beginning to value differently: the potential to power industrial corridors with renewable energy. More than 30% of Mexico’s electricity generation already comes from renewables, and its geography offers a rare combination: solar capacity in the north, wind corridors in the south, and access to hydropower and geothermal sources.

“If we limit ourselves to cost and geography, we will win a decade. If we lead on energy, we will win a century.” [1]

Countries like Portugal and South Korea are already moving in this direction. Portugal is transforming its ports and industrial zones into green-energy-based trade hubs, while South Korea integrates renewables into smart manufacturing clusters to maintain competitiveness against China. Both understood that the next industrial advantage would not be labor or land, it would be energy.

Mexico has the same chance, perhaps an even bigger one given its geographic position and manufacturing scale. But seizing it requires intent. The opportunity is not automatic. Industrial occupancy in regions like Bajío, Monterrey, and Tijuana is above 97%, proof of nearshoring’s momentum, but powering this growth sustainably is the next test. The country must decide if it wants to be seen as a low-cost assembly base, or as the clean-energy gateway of North America.

“Powershoring is not a theory, it’s the new competitive frontier where sustainability, logistics, and industrial strategy converge.”[2]

To unlock this future, Mexico will need to accelerate renewable investment and transmission capacity, create public-private alliances to build “green manufacturing belts,” and provide regulatory clarity that attracts long-term energy and logistics capital. If it succeeds, it could add up to 1.5% to annual GDP growth and generate thousands of highly skilled jobs, with positions in energy engineering, green logistics, supply chain analytics, and sustainable manufacturing.

This is a window of opportunity, but like all windows, it will not remain open forever. The world is already moving. The question is whether Mexico will move with enough vision and speed to lead — not follow — this shift.

The next era of global competitiveness will not belong to the countries that produce the most. It will belong to the countries that produce with the cleanest energy, the smartest logistics, and the courage to reinvent themselves.

As a Mexican supply chain leader, I believe this is our moment to redesign how we compete. Not by imitating global models, but by building one rooted in sustainability, talent, and regional strength.

Despite declaring an “energy emergency,” this administration is threatening to block half of the planned electricity destined for the grid.","Political attacks on the solar and energy storage industries are threatening more than 500 projects, representing nearly 116 gigawatts (GW) of capacity. This constitutes over half of all new electricity generation planned for construction in the United States through 2030.

This obstruction is occurring just as electricity demand is surging to power artificial intelligence, data centers, and manufacturing, and the administration is using every tool at its disposal to slow-walk solar and storage projects.

This blockade is undermining U.S. energy security, raising costs for families and businesses, and exacerbating the “energy emergency” declared by the Trump Administration earlier this year. Meanwhile, China installed more renewable capacity in the first half of 2025 than the United States and the rest of the world combined.

A new SEIA analysis of U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data shows that 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects, which have not yet received all necessary federal, state, and local permits, are at risk of being targeted. These projects, spread across 44 states, could provide enough electricity to power 16 million homes. They represent the core of America’s energy future and are essential for meeting soaring demand and keeping prices affordable.

Yet, under a new energy permitting bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., projects large and small are getting stuck. This extends far beyond projects on public lands. Many solar and storage projects sited partially or entirely on private property are now being entangled in countless federal reviews.

Developers who have already secured local zoning approval, completed environmental studies, and worked hand-in-hand with nearby communities are suddenly unable to move forward because their projects must still consult with federal agencies before construction can begin.

This federal overreach erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host. It sends a chilling message to landowners, farmers, ranchers, and private investors that even if you follow the rules, the federal government can still stop you. This federal red tape also undermines the energy security and policy certainty businesses need to plan for the future.

Delays are spreading nationwide. Over 50% of planned electric capacity in 18 states is at risk of being blocked. Many of these states, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada, are projected to lead the nation in energy-intensive data center growth. If these projects cannot advance, customers will be forced to compete for a shrinking supply of electricity. That means higher prices and an unstable grid.

Three of the top five states most affected by these threats voted for President Trump in the 2024 election, including Texas, which alone accounts for nearly 40% of the at-risk projects.

Despite declaring an “energy emergency,” this administration is threatening to block half of the planned electricity destined for the grid. America’s solar and storage industries are ready to build, save customers money, and strengthen the grid. We just need Washington to get out of the way.",https://www.solarbeglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/6.png,N,,2025-11-11 11:10:59.930755
,Detroit and Evs,2025-11-11 15:14:12+00:00,Charged EVs,Chargeway EV routing app now includes charge-station pricing,John Voelcker,,,,,https://chargedevs.com/newswire/chargeway-ev-routing-app-now-includes-charge-station-pricing/,"You can find local gas prices on your phone or in the dash for every station; now one EV app has added real-time charging prices.
EV charging prices?
The Chargeway EV charging and routing app—which we’ve called the best electric-car idea you’ve never heard of—has now added real-time prices for more than half the charging stations in the US.
EV drivers for whom charge pricing is a major consideration can simply tap one site after another to compare their cost-to-charge totals at that moment.
It’s also now the only independently owned EV charging/routing app.","You can find local gas prices on your phone or in the dash for every station; now one EV app has added real-time charging prices.

Some drivers go to absurd lengths, driving miles out of their way, to get the cheapest possible gasoline prices. They have access to that data online for most stations, wrapped into routing apps both in their phones and the onscreen navigation in some new vehicles.

EV charging prices? Not so much. At least, not until now. The Chargeway EV charging and routing app—which we’ve called the best electric-car idea you’ve never heard of—has now added real-time prices for more than half the charging stations in the US.

Available info includes not just the daily price per kilowatt-hour, but also variable pricing when it’s been implemented. Tesla was a pioneer in that practice, largely to alleviate congestion at its most popular charging sites, but the practice is becoming more frequent among charging networks, both to balance load from EV drivers who have the ability to decide when to charge and to offset electric-utility demand fees at times of highest usage.

Subscribers to the app’s Chargeway Plus tier see charge prices per kWh next to the station pin, along with an option to have the app calculate an estimated total cost to charge. That will vary, of course, with time of day, the charge limit they set in the app, and their car’s current state of battery charge, which they can enter before looking at pricing.

EV drivers for whom charge pricing is a major consideration can simply tap one site after another to compare their cost-to-charge totals at that moment. The app compensates for changes in time zones as users travel laterally across the US.

Massive data integration

Real-time pricing was a big project that took a long time to implement, said Teske, who spoke to Charged before the update’s official launch at the Electrify Expo event outside New York City in mid-October. And it’s the latest addition and next step for the Chargeway app, following the launch of its 2.0 version two years ago, which added real-time charging station status.

The company uses “multiple data sources,” Teske said, including “catalog research”—what a company says it charges in each state—and a certain amount of actual site testing.

The price shown is the price at the time the user clicks on it; the app doesn’t presently compensate for changes between “now” and when an EV may arrive. Chargeway found most test users looked at charging alternatives only within a 5- to 10-mile radius, meaning it would be the unlucky user who covered that distance only to find pricing had changed.

While the new feature is now available for more than half of US charging sites, Teske says it should hit 70 percent by the end of the year.

Not as well-known or as widely distributed as Plugshare or A Better Route Planner (ABRP), in our view, Chargeway is among the most graphically intuitive and best-attuned to EV drivers’ needs. It has more than 100,000 users, of whom a small percentage are presently Chargeway Plus subscribers. It’s also now the only independently owned EV charging/routing app. Rivian bought ABRP in June 2023, and charging network EVgo has owned Plugshare since July 2021.

Pricing; the next frontier

An increasing number of EV makers now offer some semblance of Tesla-style routing and charging software inside their dashboard navigation systems. More of them now differentiate among DC fast-charging and slower Level 2 sites, though the graphic presentation and resulting comprehensibility of that data varies considerably. A few have real-time availability data for some stations. The next frontier: What do I have to pay?

As Chargeway founder and CEO Matt Teske notes, “With one tap, drivers can easily see what we in the industry know the public must learn: Can I connect my car here? How long will charging take? How many chargers are available? And how much will my session cost?”

At least, that is, unless or until EV charging prices become truly dynamic, rising slightly with each new vehicle after a threshold is crossed, to ensure open slots for drivers willing to pay almost any rate to charge there. Whether that happens—it’s certainly not how gasoline prices work—remains to be seen. Will the model for EV charging become gas prices, or airline seats?

The latest version of the app, incorporating the new pricing features for Chargeway Plus users, is available for download in both the Google Play Store and iOS App Store.",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChargewayPlus_Station_Pricing_Screens.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 11:10:20.423380

Several analyses show that all-electric buildings are more affordable than those with both electricity and gas or other fossil fuels.","New York looks to be waffling on its commitment to ditch fossil fuels in new buildings.

In July, the state became the first in the nation to require all-electric appliances for most new construction. The rules, set to take effect on Dec. 31, would help New York reach its climate goals while slashing energy and health costs for its residents, according to several analyses. Modeling by the state’s grid operator shows that the grid can handle the added demand from electrifying new buildings.

But last week, 19 state assemblymembers — all Democrats — sent a letter to Gov. Kathy Hochul arguing that the all-electric building standard threatens affordability and the grid isn’t ready.

“While I share the long-term goal of decarbonizing our state, I believe the imminent requirement to mandate all-electric new buildings must be paused pending thorough reassessment of grid reliability, cost impacts, and risk mitigation,” wrote Assemblymember William Conrad, who led the petition.

Delaying implementation would buck a timeline set by the 2023 All-Electric Buildings Act, the law that required the state to put together rules for zero-emissions construction.

Cost of living takes center stage

Hochul, a Democrat, said at a recent press event that she would seriously consider the assemblymembers’ request. ​“I’m going to look at this with a very realistic approach and do what I can because my No. 1 focus is affordability right now, because New Yorkers are suffering too much.”

“This is purely a political maneuver,” said Michael Hernandez, New York policy director at electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America. ​“These Democrats” — many in districts considered flippable — ​“are working with fossil-fuel interests and building developers to try to delay the All-Electric Buildings Act, … a state law that was enacted through the democratic process.”

For instance, National Fuel, which supplies gas to about 500,000 households in western New York, has funded a lobbying campaign against bans on the fuel.

For her part, Hochul has a ​“troubling track record on climate,” said Elizabeth Moran, New York policy advocate at nonprofit Earthjustice. The governor has paused or indefinitely delayed initiatives she once championed, from congestion pricing and electric school buses to the signature policy to implement the state’s 2019 climate law: an emissions-pricing program known as cap-and-invest.

“We are seeing tremendous misinformation from the fossil-fuel industry,” Moran said. ​“The governor should not cave to the fearmongering of an industry that is only interested in its own profits.”

Last month, a judge found the state violated the law when it slammed the brakes on the cap-and-invest program — a case that could serve as a template should Hochul issue an executive order to delay implementing the All-Electric Buildings Act.

Hernandez pointed out that the all-electric law proceeds in a phased way, initially affecting new structures up to seven stories tall and, for commercial and industrial buildings, up to 100,000 square feet. Bigger buildings won’t be subject to the requirement until 2029.

Moreover, the law exempts projects if the grid can’t accommodate them within a reasonable window of time. The Department of Public Service has proposed that builders can use fossil-fuel systems if utility upgrades for all-electric construction would tack on 18 months or more to the development process, compared with a mixed-fuel project.

Several analyses show that all-electric buildings are more affordable than those with both electricity and gas or other fossil fuels. Building all-electric homes in New York may cost more up-front, but a 2024 state report shows the payback period is 10 years or less, thanks to the benefits of superefficient electric appliances, like heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters. Over 30 years, households will save on average about $5,000, the report finds.

A 2025 study by climate-policy think tank Switchbox that considers mortgage payments, gas hookup costs, and fuel costs, as well as the loss of federal electrification incentives, found even bigger savings: an average of $12,050 over 15 years for households living in newly built, all-electric single-family homes instead of ones heated with gas or propane.

“The Building Code Council, by law, can only update the building code if it’s cost-effective,” Hernandez said.

Can the grid support lots of new electric homes?

In their letter, the assemblymembers expressed concern about the grid’s ability to handle electrification of new buildings, citing reliability assessments from the state’s grid operator, the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO).

However, that fear is ​“based on a limited methodology that is not designed to identify blackout risks … and is based on a variety of extreme assumptions for which NYISO does not present factual support,” said Michael Lenoff, senior attorney at Earthjustice. NYISO’s projections ​“don’t justify delaying the All-Electric Buildings Act.”

NYISO uses two approaches to determine if it will be able to procure enough power for the grid in the coming years, Lenoff explained. One approach ignores common strategies to balance supply and demand, like utilizing backup systems called operating reserves, recruiting customers to voluntarily use less energy, and tapping emergency assistance from neighboring states. The method also assumes delays in major transmission projects, like the Champlain Hudson Power Express, even though NYISO reports that the transmission line ​“is nearing completion” and is scheduled to enter service in May of 2026.

As one might expect, this first approach paints a pessimistic picture, spurring NYISO to call for procuring more resources to supply power.

Under NYISO’s second approach — the industry standard to determine adequate power supply — the operator in fact finds that it will have plenty of planned generation resources to meet demand through 2034, even if the All-Electric Buildings Act is fully implemented. The blackout risk generally considered acceptable, striking a balance between greater security and higher costs to customers, is one event in 10 years. NYISO estimates that its risk in 2034 will be about one blackout in 20 years — twice as protective as the norm, Lenoff said. It’s even more protective in the years leading up to that.

“Procuring resources when industry-standard reliability metrics indicate the system is already overprotected risks gold-plating the system at consumers’ expense,” Lenoff said.

In its 2025 Power Trends report, which the letter directly references, NYISO also determined that building electrification is not a concern in the short term; rather, energy-hungry customers — namely hyperscalers and cryptocurrency miners — are.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Building-a-home-in-Niskayuna-NY.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=82e892ad3a47add1e86ad9e69d97bac1,N,,2025-11-11 12:08:23.848811

Three U.S. regions produce volumes comparable to many producing states and directly influence price formation. Appalachia stabilizes around 33 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d), a dry-gas profile supported by sustained productivity and evacuation links that are decisive for pricing. The Permian has lifted associated gas from about 21 Bcf/d in 2023 to nearly 25 Bcf/d in the first half of 2025, a mechanical effect of oil drilling. Haynesville remains in a 14–15 Bcf/d range, with operational proximity to Gulf terminals that shortens transit times and secures feed to liquefaction units.

Market parameters and flow hierarchy

Total U.S. production rose from about 104 Bcf/d in 2023 to 106 Bcf/d on average in the first half of 2025, consolidating the role of balancing supply. Regional differentials reflect infrastructure constraints, with recurring negative basis around the Waha hub when gathering, processing or transport saturates. Appalachia aligns its pricing with the availability of outbound capacity, which determines the spread to the Henry Hub reference point. Haynesville cushions shocks through proximity to terminals, securing feedgas for ramping trains.

Industrial schedules drive international spreads. The phased commissioning of liquefaction units increases absorption of domestic surpluses and narrows basis volatility. Any schedule slippage temporarily strengthens local pressure in associated-gas zones and widens geographic spreads. Maintenance planning and lifting windows determine the smoothness of nominations between producing basins and loading points.

LNG arbitrage and export corridors

Cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are arbitraged between the Title Transfer Facility (TTF, “Dutch hub”) and the Japan Korea Marker (JKM, “Northeast Asia index”), which guides shipping priorities. The ramp-up of Golden Pass around 18 million tonnes per year and the authorized expansion of Plaquemines reinforce near- and mid-term export capacity. TTF/JKM spreads steer marginal destination, while feedgas availability conditions loading rates. Operators adjust contractual alignments to preserve flexibility between the Atlantic and Asia.

The pipeline corridor to Mexico peaked near 7.5 Bcf/d in May 2025, serving as a structural relief valve when liquefaction demand slows. This pipe-based elasticity limits regional build-ups and eases pressure on Henry Hub. Interconnections and compression at border points become operational levers to arbitrate in real time between domestic and external markets. Balances readjust as liquefaction ramp-ups reshape the hierarchy of outlets.

Compliance and regulation across the chain

The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC, “Bureau de contrôle des avoirs étrangers”) expanded in January 2025 the determinations targeting activities linked to the energy sector of the Russian Federation, including production, liquefaction, services and transport. Traders, charterers, insurers and banks strengthen due diligence on counterparties, transport documents and technical services. Terminal operators harmonize traceability procedures and contractual clauses to secure acceptance and trade finance. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC, “Commission fédérale de régulation de l’énergie”) oversees authorizations for expansions of critical infrastructure.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA, “Agence américaine d’information sur l’énergie”) provides production, export and consumption trajectories used to calibrate drilling, nominations and maintenance policies. Midstream operators prioritize debottlenecking in gathering, processing and compression in faster-growing areas. Producers arbitrate between dry-gas wells and oil-driven campaigns based on regional basis signals and downstream access. Buyers integrate these constraints into lifting windows and seasonal procurement strategies.

Buyer exposure and contractual engineering

Portfolios with redirection options between the Atlantic and Asia preserve value amid weather and industrial demand variations. Henry Hub–indexed contracts with volume tolerances and ramp-up clauses reduce the impact of delays or planned outages. Loading windows align with feedgas availability and train maintenance sequences. Mexican counterparties consolidate a pipeline-based demand base, limiting exposure to international spot signals during tight episodes.

Operational parameters to track combine actual commissioning curves, interconnection fluidity and the evolution of compliance requirements. Basis around Waha serves as a leading indicator of Permian congestion. TTF/JKM spreads signal marginal flow direction and inter-basin arbitrage. The current hierarchy—dry-gas backbone in Appalachia, associated gas in the Permian, flexibility reservoir in Haynesville—continues to shape molecule allocation and price formation.

Referring to data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), SEIA says 73 GW of solar and 43 GW of storage projects, spread across 44 states, are yet to receive the requisite permits. These are at risk of being ‘targeted’ by the administration. Their loss could mean 18 states could lose half of all their planned capacity, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada. Texas alone accounts for nearly 40% of the at-risk projects.

“They represent the heart of America’s energy future and are critical to meeting soaring demand and keeping prices affordable,” claims the solar trade body in a new report.

According to the association, developers that have already secured zoning approvals, completed environmental studies, and worked with local communities are now unable to move forward as they need to consult with federal agencies before beginning construction.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), the Trump administration has tightened permitting and tax credits for wind and solar energy in the country. It has also increased scrutiny for such projects by the Department of the Interior, while terminating funding for clean energy (see Elevated US Federal Scrutiny For Wind & Solar Energy Projects).

Many projects are stuck in limbo under Washington’s new energy permitting system, including solar and storage projects on private land now caught up in multiple federal reviews, says the association.

It adds, “This federal overreach erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host.”

“If these projects can’t move forward, customers will be forced to compete for a shrinking supply of electricity. That means higher prices and a destabilized grid,” warns the association.

However, the EIA recently said that in Q3 2025, solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay, a decrease from 25% in Q3 2024, and that delays in bringing these projects into operation have been trending downward in recent months.

Calling solar and storage the quickest way to add new power at scale, accounting for 84% of new capacity in 2024 and 71% of planned capacity buildout, the SEIA argues that these technologies offer fast, affordable generation to meet the growing electricity demand from AI, data centers, and manufacturing.",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-11-11%2Fntt3y7pt%2FSEIA.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-11-11 16:08:07.541285

Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, for example, are considered more stable and less prone to thermal runaway than other lithium-ion types.
Thermal runaway occurs when a battery cell overheats and triggers a chain reaction, potentially leading to fire or explosion.","Matson has lifted its blanket ban on electric vehicle shipments to Guam, but only for certain new models with battery types deemed safer for ocean transport.

The shipping company announced the partial resumption of service on Oct. 28, more than three months after suspending all EV and plug-in hybrid shipments due to fire safety concerns tied to lithium-ion battery thermal runaway.

""There is wide variation in lithium-ion battery chemistry, and we recognize certain types of lithium-ion batteries present a significantly lower risk of thermal runaway, such as lithium-ion phosphate batteries, and others that have been engineered by individual manufacturers to specifically reduce risk of thermal runaway,"" Matson stated in its customer advisory.

The policy change comes as the broader U.S. auto market faces challenges. Motor vehicle sales dropped in October as federal EV tax credits expired, according to Reuters, adding pressure to an already uncertain market for electric vehicles.

Matson's updated policy applies only to newly manufactured vehicles. The company continues to ban used EVs and plug-in hybrids, citing increased thermal runaway risk from potential battery damage during everyday use.

Keoni Wagner, Matson's vice president of corporate communications, said the company is working directly with manufacturers to evaluate and approve specific models on a case-by-case basis.

""After we have received detailed information, engaged in dialogue with the manufacturers, and conducted an internal assessment, it is possible additional makes and models will be deemed acceptable (safe enough) for lengthy ocean transport,"" Wagner told The Guam Daily Post.

The approval process varies by manufacturer. Wagner said Matson requests specific safety information from automakers and expects them to notify their dealer networks once models are approved.

For some local dealers, Matson's policy shift won't change their operations.

""We actually don't use Matson to ship our EVs, so Matson's resumption doesn't change anything for us,"" said Arnel Bonto, Nissan Guam president and CEO. ""We continue to receive our EVs from Japan using a different carrier.""

James Rosenberg II, general manager of Triple J Technologies and FlowEV, said the approval process depends on manufacturers submitting required documentation to Matson.

""As for Matson, essentially it comes down to OEMs to update Matson case by case on what battery types are in the cars and only the most 'dangerous' ones as of now are not allowed,"" Rosenberg told The Post.

He noted that many brands, including several Triple J brands except Volvo, have not yet submitted required documents to Matson. The currently approved models are mostly due to work manufacturers completed in Hawaii.

""I do not see any supply issues expected from Triple J or others with the battery tech most of our cars use,"" Rosenberg said.

The July suspension forced local dealers to scramble for alternative shipping methods. In a previous interview with The Guam Daily Post in July, Bonto said Nissan Guam had already switched to a Japanese carrier for EV shipments before Matson's ban took effect.

Ernie Galito, business development and sustainability director at Atkins Kroll, told The Post in August that Toyota and Lexus would ship EV models from Japan using other shipping lines.

""Additionally, we understand that APL hasn't imposed any restrictions on the shipping of EV vehicles. However, they sail from the West Coast to Japan and then to Guam. It takes longer to sail from the Port of Los Angeles to Guam, but they will get here,"" Galito said at the time.

Matson's original suspension in July came after the company cited growing concerns about lithium-ion battery fires during ocean transport. The decision affected shipments across its Pacific routes, including Hawaii and Guam.

The company's new approach recognizes advances in battery technology and variations in safety profiles among different lithium-ion chemistries. Lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, for example, are considered more stable and less prone to thermal runaway than other lithium-ion types.

Thermal runaway occurs when a battery cell overheats and triggers a chain reaction, potentially leading to fire or explosion. The risk increases during long ocean voyages, where environmental conditions and vehicle movement can stress battery systems.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines hazardous air pollutants as “pollutants that are known or suspected to cause cancer or other serious health effects, such as reproductive effects or birth defects, or adverse environmental effects.” While hazardous air pollutants can come from many sources, most originate from human activity.

Seventy years ago, Congress passed the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, the first piece of federal legislation to address air pollution. Over the following decades, Congress greatly expanded federal regulation of air pollutants by passing landmark legislation. These efforts have played an important role in protecting public health, shaping environmental standards, and reducing emissions across the United States.

Background

The Industrial Revolution marked a period of rapid growth and innovation in the United States, beginning in the late 1800s and continuing into the early 1900s. The introduction of new machinery and tools, assembly lines, and mass production led to a surge in industrial output and, consequently, increases in emissions and pollution. Another cause of increased pollution was the rise of gasoline-powered automobiles, which further accelerated the deterioration of air quality by releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

From 1890 to 1920, annual carbon dioxide emissions in the United States more than quadrupled (from 426 million metric tons to 1,840 million metric tons). By 1945, the figure had risen to 2.49 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide, prompting growing concern among conservationists and the public.

A number of events brought national attention to air pollution. In 1948, a smog event in Donora, Pennsylvania, caused by sulfur dioxide emissions from a steel and wire plant, led to the deaths of 20 people and the illness of more than 5,900–43% of the town’s population. The incident prompted the first U.S. conference on air pollution, which occurred in Washington, D.C. in May 1950. In 1953, severe smog in New York City was linked to as many as 260 deaths in only a ten-day period. During his 1995 State of the Union Address, President Dwight D. Eisenhower highlighted air pollution as a national issue and called for new measures to combat the problem.

Early Congressional Measures

In July 1955, just six months after Eisenhower’s State of the Union Address, Congress passed the first federal law to address air pollution. The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 allocated funding for research into air pollution but left regulation and enforcement to individual states, with no direct federal control.

Despite this step, air pollution continued to rise. By 1963, carbon dioxide pollution reached 3.39 billion metric tons. That same year, Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1963, which allocated $95 million for pollution research and abatement efforts. Additionally, the act marked the first time that the federal government was given express authority to regulate air pollution in the United States, particularly in cases where state action was insufficient or pollution crossed state lines.

In 1970, under President Richard Nixon, Congress established the EPA to coordinate environmental efforts and enforce national pollution standards. The agency was founded as part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, which significantly expanded the federal government’s regulatory powers. Before the 1970 amendments, air quality was managed primarily by states, leading to inconsistent enforcement, but the legislation required states to develop plans that met national standards. This strengthened federal oversight while maintaining local implementation.

Further amendments to the Clean Air Act followed:

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, signed into law by President Jimmy Carter, required areas that met air quality standards to maintain them and introduced stricter controls for new pollution sources. Another key requirement was that new coal-fired power plants adopt advanced pollution control technologies to lower sulfur dioxide emissions, which are a major cause of acid rain.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, signed into law by President George H.W. Bush, aimed to tackle significant air quality issues — including toxic pollutants, smog, and acid rain — by setting forth a market-based system that allowed companies to trade sulfur dioxide emission allowances.

Congress’s Modern Role

Since 1990, growing scientific evidence has shown that air pollutants contribute not only to health problems but also to climate change. As a result, national attention has increasingly focused on regulating greenhouse gases. Partisan disagreements persist: a Pew Research Center survey of U.S. adults conducted in October 2024 revealed that Democrats generally support broad federal policies aimed at addressing climate change, while Republicans tend to prioritize economic and energy considerations.

Environmental policy bills awaiting a House floor vote in the current 119th Congress include:

H.R. 3898 — PERMIT Act:

Sponsored by Representative Mike Collins (R-GA-10), this bill would reduce the scope of governmental regulation under the Clean Water Act by redefining “navigable waters” to exclude certain bodies of water that were previously protected.

H.R. 4117 — Fuel Emissions Freedom Act:

Sponsored by Representative Roger Williams (R-TX-25), this bill would repeal the Clean Air Act’s vehicle emissions and fuel standards and delegate more regulatory powers to the states.

Both bills have drawn national attention but have not yet been voted on in the House of Representatives.

Both proposals have sparked national debate but have yet to reach a vote in the House of Representatives.

Conclusion

Over time, Congress’s role in regulating air pollutants expanded as scientific understanding of industrial pollution, greenhouse gases, and other threats to the natural environment and human health evolved. Today, the EPA administers federal pollution control programs under the direction of Congress, which sets the overall policy framework through legislation. Each year, lawmakers introduce major climate- and air-quality-related bills. While some draw bipartisan cooperation, others generate significant debate. Public engagement, including communicating with representatives about pending legislation, continues to shape how the United States tackles its most pressing environmental concerns.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1200/1*nPVuo-6zFow99HhostrMdg.png,N,,2025-11-11 13:02:48.507961

“It’s practical, it’s inclusive and it’s grounded in shared goals.”","Gov. Gavin Newsom still insists he hasn’t decided to run for president in 2028. But after persuading California’s voters to gerrymander the state’s congressional districts to grab more Democratic seats, he embarked on a flurry of appearances that had the distinct aroma of a political campaign.

He did an interview on CNN, jetted off to Texas to crow about California’s passage of the Proposition 50 gerrymander at a rally of Democrats — some chanted about a 2028 candidacy — and then headed to Brazil as the self-appointed U.S. delegate to a climate change conference boycotted by President Donald Trump.

Oh yes, and Penguin Random House announced that in February, it will release Newsom’s memoir of growing up in San Francisco, founding a business and segueing into politics, titled “Young Man in a Hurry: A Memoir of Discovery.” It will cost just $30.

No presidential campaign is complete without an autobiography describing how the candidate overcame barriers of birth and circumstance to become a dedicated public servant.

As Newsom surfaced in Brazil on Monday, Politico journalist Camille von Kaenel filed this analysis of the governor’s purpose:

“The California governor’s task at United Nations climate talks in Belém, Brazil, this week isn’t to negotiate sweeping policy changes or break into closed-door talks reserved for nations. It’s to put on a show: proving his state is still cutting emissions despite President Donald Trump’s rollbacks, nudging governments and businesses to do the same, and reminding the world that the U.S. might one day pick the climate agenda back up — perhaps under a President Newsom.”

There is, however, a subtext to Newsom’s claim to be a climate change warrior. In recent months, he’s tiptoed away from the aggressive decarbonization programs he had championed earlier, clearly trying to minimize impacts — particularly costs — on consumers. Living costs loomed large in last year’s presidential campaign.

One example is Newsom’s effort to stop the planned decommission of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant and several gas-fired generators in Southern California, when it became evident that taking them off-line could lead to shortages in electrical power and potential blackouts.

Another is this year’s 180-degree flip on the petroleum industry. Newsom had spent months demonizing refiners for price-gouging, but when two refineries announced plans to shut down, raising the possibility of sharp gasoline price hikes, Newsom shifted to maintaining fuel supplies and encouraging oil production to stave off imports.

“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”

Still another example is what happened just a few days ago in Southern California. After years of squabbling over carbon emissions from ships and equipment at the twin ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the logistics industry and the regional air quality board appointed by Newsom reached a compromise.

The ports are a major source of emissions in the smog-sensitive region and the South Coast Air Quality Management District had been pressing them to shift from gasoline- and diesel-powered equipment to electricity. Cargo handlers complained that expensive retrofits could make the ports uncompetitive in global trade, potentially threatening thousands of jobs.

The agreement requires a three-phase, multi-year transition to zero-emission machinery, which disturbs environmental advocates and even some board members. Opponents who wanted immediate action chanted their displeasure and were removed from the meeting before the vote.

“The give-and-take of ideas and compromises in this process — it mirrors exactly what a real-world transition to zero emissions looks like,” said William Bartelson, an executive at the Pacific Maritime Association. “It’s practical, it’s inclusive and it’s grounded in shared goals.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111025-Newsom-Houston-JF-Getty-01-CM.jpg?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-11 10:02:50.727783

Supernova PowerRing: Wallbox’s new modular fast-charging system, delivering up to 400 kW per outlet and scalable to 720 kW per site.

At its core, Supernova PowerRing is a connected system of multiple Supernova chargers, Wallbox’s family of fast DC chargers designed for public and semi-public use, that share energy intelligently between them. By pooling unused power across units, PowerRing aims to ensure that every outlet delivers optimal performance based on real-time demand. This architecture allows operators to make the most of their installed capacity while reducing idle energy and infrastructure costs.

Designed for real-world usage patterns, PowerRing dynamically distributes power across multiple charging points to optimize uptime, efficiency, and driver experience. Each setup can connect up to three Supernova units and six outlets, offering scalable installed capacities of 240, 480, or 720 kW to match the site’s specific needs.

“Operators need charging systems that make economic sense today while being ready for the future,” said Eduard Castañeda, Chief Product & Technology Officer at Wallbox. “Supernova PowerRing was designed to do exactly that, delivering flexibility, performance, and reliability, all within a remarkably compact footprint.”

The first phase of Supernova PowerRing introduces power sharing between units, allowing to dynamically allocate unused power where it’s needed most. This capability ensures greater uptime, reduces power limitations during peak demand, and maximizes the energy delivered across the site, all while simplifying infrastructure planning and installation.

In the following phases, PowerRing’s capabilities will continue to expand. The next evolution will allow power sharing even when one connector is already in use, offering greater flexibility for drivers and operators. At a later date, it will add intelligent power-sharing algorithms distributing energy across sites, optimizing performance, efficiency, and user experience.

Thanks to its compact design and scalable configuration, PowerRing can be installed in a wide range of environments, from urban retail centers and petrol stations to commercial parking sites. Its streamlined installation process also helps operators reduce deployment costs and accelerate time to market.

“Supernova PowerRing is designed to redefine how charging infrastructure can scale efficiently,” added Castañeda. “It allows operators to serve more drivers with less space, less cost, and less complexity, while maintaining a focus on charging speed and user experience.”

Supernova PowerRing is expected to begin rollout in phases as early as Q1 2026, beginning with Southern Europe, Benelux, and the UK/Ireland. Subsequent phases will expand into additional markets, including the United States, as Wallbox continues its global rollout of the platform.

In a joint appeal, energy industry group BDEW, offshore wind power association BWO, engineering association VDMA and grid operators proposed to move the next auction from June 2026 to the end of next year. The delay would give bidders time to optimise their projects and prepare legal changes regarding investment conditions and spatial planning in Germany’s territorial waters.

“Fast action is needed to successfully continue offshore wind power expansion,” BDEW head Kerstin Andreae said. Germany’s August 2025 auction was the first one in Germany to receive no bids, after interest had already waned in earlier rounds. Andreae pointed at “increased power market risks and project financing costs” as reasons for the bidders’ restraint, and warned that “the results from 2025 must not be repeated.”

Stefan Thimm, head of offshore wind power group BWO, said “clear rules and fair investment conditions” were necessary, which could be achieved through a reformed auction design that includes contracts for difference (CfDs) and power purchase agreements (PPAs). Moreover, the BWO called for extending the operating license for offshore wind farms to 35 years and a gradual application of fees for delayed operation launches rather than the current sweeping cancellation of awards in case of delays.

In Summer 2023, oil majors BP and TotalEnergies pledged to pay a combined 12.6 billion in a German auction for the right to build offshore wind farms in the North and Baltic seas. The auction marked the first time that investors paid for the right to build offshore wind parks in Germany. In contrast, the latest auction received no bids, with industry saying that plans would put wind turbines in too close proximity of each other, so that the output would be significantly reduced due to shadowing effects. Other reasons included increased costs due to geopolitical tensions and supply chain bottlenecks, as well as volatile electricity markets.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-11-11 12:08:30.315362

As is common with many raw material contracts concluded in advance, both sides had agreed on a pricing mechanism based on current market prices.
Novonix had signed a supply agreement with VW’s battery subsidiary PowerCo at virtually the same time as Stellantis.
“Collectively, our offtake agreements with Stellantis, SK On, and Hiller Carbon supported our ongoing debt syndication,” explained Terence Cryan, Executive Chairman of Westwater Resources.
This is primarily due to challenging nickel market conditions and associated project financing constraints,” the statement said.","These involve agreements with Novonix and Westwater Resources for anode graphite and Alliance Nickel for nickel and cobalt. In the case of Alliance Nickel (formerly GME Resources), the deal dates back to a non-binding agreement from 2022, before a binding supply deal for a total of 170,000 tonnes of nickel sulphate and 12,000 tonnes of cobalt sulphate was signed in April 2023. The agreement with Novonix for 86,250 to 115,000 tonnes from the beginning of 2026, on the other hand, was signed just over a year ago.

On 4 November, however, Novonix announced that the supply contract with FCA US LLC (the US subsidiary of Stellantis) had been terminated by the customer ‘with immediate effect’. ‘Novonix and Stellantis were unable to agree on the specific specifications of the battery cell product and the milestones for mass production qualification,’ Novonix continued. As is common with many raw material contracts concluded in advance, both sides had agreed on a pricing mechanism based on current market prices.

Novonix also confirms that deliveries from the plant in Riverside near Chattanooga, Tennessee, were scheduled to begin on 1 January 2026, so the cancellation comes at fairly short notice. “While NOVONIX is disappointed with this decision, it remains focused on its deliveries for Panasonic and PowerCo and continuing to provide samples to 15 current and potential customers for battery and industrial applications,” the statement said. Novonix had signed a supply agreement with VW’s battery subsidiary PowerCo at virtually the same time as Stellantis.

Westwater speaks of ‘unexpected’ termination

On 7 November, Westwater Resources announced that FCA US LLC had “unexpectedly terminated its Binding Offtake Agreement with the Company dated July 17, 2024” on 3 November. Stellantis was one of three major customers with existing contracts, alongside Hiller Carbon and SK On. “Collectively, our offtake agreements with Stellantis, SK On, and Hiller Carbon supported our ongoing debt syndication,” explained Terence Cryan, Executive Chairman of Westwater Resources. “However, due to Stellantis’s unexpected termination, the debt syndication is now paused, although our engagement with EXIM and other government agencies regarding financing opportunities is ongoing. In response to these developments, we are focused on optimizing the Kellyton Plant to meet our current offtake commitments, which should reduce the total capital needed to complete Phase I.”

Westwater wanted to supply Stellantis from the Kellyton plant. According to Cryan, the processing capacity in the first phase will now be adjusted to the existing purchase agreements and available financial resources. In other words, the plant will be slightly smaller and the investment requirements will be reduced. “The Company expects to complete this optimization evaluation by the end of the year and plans to provide an update to the market in early 2026,” Westwater wrote. The contracts with SK On and Hiller Carbon remain valid. FCA has also signalled “they are open to reconsidering a new arrangement with the Company, any future agreement would be based on current market conditions.”

Also on 7 November, Australia’s Alliance Nickel announced that its contract with Stellantis (this time not FCA US LLC) had been terminated with effect from 3 December 2025. Assuming a one-month notice period, the termination is likely to have been announced on 3 November. However, prices or demand are not cited as the reason here; rather, the Australian company is likely to have failed to meet agreed milestones. “The termination arises from certain contractual milestone dates not being met rendering the existing agreement inoperative. This is primarily due to challenging nickel market conditions and associated project financing constraints,” the statement said.

Although it also states that Stellantis remains interested in the raw materials from Alliance Nickel’s NiWest project, the terms are to be renegotiated to ‘better reflect the revised project development schedule and market conditions,’ according to the Australians. In other words, deliveries will start later, and volumes and prices are likely to be lower.

“We understand the rationale for the Stellantis decision, and at the same time we recognise that this presents a good opportunity for both sides to negotiate on a new agreement which is more reflective of the revised project development timeline and forward strategy,” said Paul Kopejtka, Managing Director of the Alliance. “I firmly believe that the long-term outlook for nickel and cobalt remains positive.”

The fact is that Stellantis is planning to produce fewer electric cars globally than it did a few years ago and therefore needs fewer battery raw materials in the short term. Much of the specific data for the switch to a pure electric car portfolio for Stellantis brands has been watered down or scrapped, with combustion engines and hybrids set to remain on offer for longer. In the US market in particular, the mood has changed significantly from the BEV-friendly course under President Joe Biden (with subsidies for products and the establishment of US battery supply chains), and many subsidy projects are currently being halted under his successor, Donald Trump.

Her report highlighted progress across key areas, including circular economy, biodiversity, climate change mitigation, and sustainable urban development.

A central achievement was the creation of the Integrated Waste Management Agency (AGIR), designed to coordinate waste separation, collection, and utilization across the city. Álvarez said the agency will implement a new waste collection system starting in January 2026, as part of a broader effort to transition toward a circular economy. Programs such as Reciclatron and Mercado del Trueque were also reinforced, with Reciclatron collecting more than 280t of electronic and battery waste through 31 citywide events involving 17,000 participants and 528 institutions.

The city invested in green infrastructure and biodiversity, allocating MX$35 million to rehabilitate urban forests. Through the Green Blocks strategy, 821 neighborhoods with limited access to green spaces will benefit from restoration projects. In coordination with the Ministry of Works and Services (SOBSE), the city replaced diseased palm trees and planted 64 new native trees across several boroughs, with an additional MX$20 million designated for tree care and replacement.

Álvarez reported that residents recorded over 655,000 biodiversity observations through iNaturalist, including the discovery of a new firefly species in Chapultepec Forest, named through a public vote honoring María Sabina. The finding resulted from collaboration between SEDEMA and UNAM under the “BioBlitz” initiative.

To address the climate crisis, the ministry launched the Environmental Information System, a geointelligence platform for environmental data management. The Rain Harvest Program equipped 7,000 households in Coyoacan and Tlalpan with rainwater collection systems, solar heaters, and urban gardens to promote water security and energy savings.

Mexico City’s air quality improved with a 20% reduction in carbon monoxide, 13% in PM10, and 8% in nitrogen dioxide, leading to 22% more clean-air days in the Metropolitan Area. The city also exceeded its emission reduction goals, cutting 2.3Mt of CO₂e. The Ravines and Rivers Recovery Plan restored 14 ravines, removing more than 3,000t of solid waste with the help of 1,165 volunteers known as Guardians of the Ravines.

In sustainable development, SEDEMA processed over 600 environmental impact statements and 4,700 performance reports through a more efficient digital platform. The city also strengthened environmental regulation and updated key standards.

Mexico City maintained its international environmental leadership, participating in 64 global events and forming partnerships with governments and organizations from the Americas, Europe, and Asia.

Efforts to protect the city’s conservation land included recovering 201ha, protecting 479, and halting 215 illegal activities. As part of the Forest of Water strategy, 10 million native plants were distributed to restore watersheds.

A key highlight of the draft is the elevation of environmental protection to a central mission alongside economic and social progress, signalling a new and comprehensive understanding of sustainability in the current context.

Harmonising economic growth with environmental protection, or safeguarding the environment to ensure sustainable economic development, is considered the cornerstone of lasting prosperity. From this perspective, the Party affirms that environmental protection is a central and inseparable task closely tied to economic and social development.

Vietnam’s policies and international commitments make clear that the transition toward a green, circular, and low-carbon economy is the pathway to sustainable development. It is essential to abandon short-term, profit-driven approaches that neglect environmental responsibilities and to remain steadfast in the principle of not sacrificing the environment for economic gain.

Commenting on the draft, Dr. Truong Ba kien, Deputy Director of the Centre for Meteorology and Climatology under the Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change at Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, emphasised that the inclusion of environmental protection and climate adaptation is both timely and necessary, aligning with Vietnam’s real-world challenges. He noted that proactive and effective adaptation to climate change is a trend that Vietnam must continue to pursue in the years ahead.

To enhance resilience to extreme weather and climate-related disasters, relevant agencies need to comprehensively upgrade real-time forecasting and early warning systems, integrating meteorological, hydrological, radar, and reservoir data. The use of AI, Big Data, and ensemble modelling will help detect hazardous weather patterns early. Multi-channel public alerts, regular drills, and inter-regional coordination mechanisms should also be strengthened.

In parallel, Vietnam should standardise and expand inter-reservoir operations, improve dam safety monitoring, and promote reforestation. Developing flood and landslide risk maps using satellite data and LiDAR technology will support evidence-based planning. Building green infrastructure such as water-absorbent urban systems, maintaining natural floodways, and ensuring data sharing across regions are also crucial to balancing development with watershed safety.

Localities are urged to integrate climate adaptation into regional and provincial planning, establish AI- and IoT-based early warning systems, and enhance climate risk management capacity for local authorities. Promoting nature-based and green development models and nurturing a culture of preparedness will help build safer, more resilient communities.

According to Dr. Mai Van Khiem, Director of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, Vietnam must continue modernising its observation technologies, expanding monitoring networks, and applying artificial intelligence to improve forecasting accuracy, particularly for extreme weather events. He also underlined the need for clear, concise, and accessible communication to ensure early warnings reach vulnerable communities.

Strengthened coordination between meteorological agencies, local governments, disaster response units, and media outlets is vital to translating forecasts into effective action. Public education and training in disaster preparedness should be expanded, with climate and environmental awareness integrated into school curricula.

Le Thi Dinh, Secretary of Xuan Non hamlet Party Cell in Hanoi' Thu Lam commune, noted that recognising environmental protection as a core development pillar provides a new benchmark for all socio-economic policies. However, genuine sustainability must start with each individual’s mindset and daily actions, from planting trees and flowers to embracing broader goals such as green transformation and green economy. She also stressed the importance of environmental education at all levels to foster a “green living” consciousness among citizens, laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient future./.

The latest investment, from the Scottish National Investment Bank, Centrica, Goldman Sachs, KIRKBI and Mosaic Capital, brings total funding for Highview’s long-duration energy storage rollout to more than £500m.

The Hunterston phase one asset will deliver grid inertia, short circuit and voltage support services independently of the site’s storage system, helping alleviate grid stability issues and reduce wind curtailment in Scotland.

The stability island marks the start of Highview’s Millennium Series, which includes further 3.2GWh hybrid storage facilities planned across the UK. The next project in the series, a 300MWh liquid air energy storage facility at Carrington in Manchester, is already under construction.

Highview chief executive Richard Butland said: “This capital raise is an important milestone for Highview, enabling us to build out the first phase of our long duration energy facility at Hunterston. By delivering much-needed grid services in this location, our stability island asset will prevent costly curtailment and maximise the renewable energy that we generate in the UK.”

He added that the project “supports future Highview projects, as well as the UK’s wider green economy, driving skills development, job creation, and economic growth across the country.”

The Hunterston facility, located on the Peel Ports site in North Ayrshire, is expected to support 1,000 onsite jobs during construction and 650 in the wider supply chain. The stability island is scheduled to be operational by January 2028, with the full facility expected by 2030.

Scottish National Investment Bank chief investment officer Mark Munro said: “As Scotland scales its renewable energy production, it’s critical that grid resilience is fortified so that more of it can be used. Working in partnership with Highview, our investment in the development of this exciting project will deliver vital infrastructure to help ensure a more stable, clean energy future.”

Centrica group chief executive Chris O’Shea said: “Low carbon storage is an essential part of the solution for how we manage the energy system of the future, and Highview’s LDES system is the kind of innovative facility that is needed as the UK transitions to a more intermittent energy mix from renewables.”",https://renews.biz/media/35481/image-2048x1316.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-11-11 10:02:01.626655

At two solar farms in Texas, veterans are suiting up – not in their military uniforms, but in protective gear for beekeeping.

They’re tending hives as part of a partnership between solar developer Enel North America and Hives for Heroes. The nonprofit, founded by Steve Jimenez, helps veterans find healing and new purpose.

Jimenez: “Getting out of the Marine Corps … I felt like I came home very incomplete.”

But when he opened a beehive for the first time, everything changed.

Jimenez: “I felt like the weight of the world come off because I was focused on just one thing, which was these incredible little bees.”

Since 2018, his group has helped thousands of veterans get into beekeeping as a way to connect with one another, cope with anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and learn new skills.

Some vets become hobbyists, while others manage hives at businesses and other locations.

At the Texas solar farms, they tend hives near rows of solar panels. The bees pollinate wildflowers and other plants that grow under and around the panels and produce honey that the beekeepers harvest.

So the veterans are helping transform these solar farms into thriving landscapes – and finding meaning and purpose beyond the battlefield.

The package of three fiscal 2026 bills, which cleared the Senate Monday, contains both Democratic and Republican priorities and rejects most of the steep funding cuts sought by the Trump administration and House GOP lawmakers.

The bills are the product of months of negotiations, and neither side got everything it wanted. There are wins for conservatives, such as cuts to Department of Agriculture climate hubs, and wins for Democrats, including full funding for the Government Accountability Office.

Passage could set the tone for the rest of the fiscal 2026 spending cycle and create a pathway for more bipartisan spending bills — especially with both sides appearing eager to avoid another costly shutdown.

A promising sign emerged Monday, when Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), one of the loudest voices calling for funding reductions, said he was leaning in favor of the package.

It will be paired with a bill to reopen the government through Jan. 30 and a promise of a Senate vote on a Democratic bill to extend expiring health care subsidies.

Harris, chair of both the House Freedom Caucus and the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, told Fox News that despite the absence of sweeping cuts, he “would probably be a ‘yes’ vote” on the package assuming that the Senate passes it as is.

Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray (D-Wash.) touted the Democratic wins in the spending bills, even as she voted against proceeding to the package because of the lack of guaranteed health care reforms.

The three bills in the package, known as a “minibus,” are Agriculture-FDA, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs.

House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he was encouraging members to return to Washington immediately in anticipation of Senate passage.

Here are five takeaways from the bipartisan minibus that could head to President Donald Trump’s desk as soon as Wednesday.

Climate hub cuts

The negotiated Agriculture-FDA bill would slash funding for the USDA’s 10 climate hubs, which produce regional research and data on extreme weather, natural disasters and droughts to help farmers make informed decisions.

The office of Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) announced the cuts, but the scope of the reduction is unclear. The climate hubs are funded through an array of federal grant programs.

The cuts, endorsed by House Republicans, could hit regional climate hubs in the home states or districts of key members of Congress focused on agricultural issues.

One of the 10 hubs, for example, is in New Hampshire, home to Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan — two of the lead negotiators of the deal to end the shutdown.

Shaheen is also the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, meaning she signed off on the cuts. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.

Another one of the USDA climate hubs is located in the district of Rep. Frank Lucas (R-Okla.), a former chair of the House Agriculture Committee.

Rep. Mike Collins (R-Ga.), chair of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, represents a district with another climate hub.

So does Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), who co-chairs caucuses focused on disaster recovery and wildfire management. The district of Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa) also hosts a climate hub.

Appropriations leaders likely kept the House’s proposed climate hub cuts in the compromise Agriculture-FDA bill as a sweetener to help maintain Republican support for the full package. They similarly kept the GOP’s proposed reductions to programs focused on urban agriculture.

Support for water, conservation

The Agriculture-FDA bill supports a range of federal water and conservation programs.

Republicans have previously pushed to reduce some USDA conservation assistance for farmers. The Trump administration proposed cutting conservation funds by hundreds of millions of dollars.

The legislation contains about $1.4 billion to support the “revitalization of aging water and wastewater infrastructure,” according to a summary.

USDA’s Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations budget would get $50 million under the negotiated proposal. An additional $3 million would be set aside “for the rehabilitation of aging dam infrastructure to ensure safety and water access to rural communities,” the summary states.

About $10 million would go toward irrigation modernization to “alleviate challenges faced primarily in Western states.” That could include drought, fish and wildlife projects, and certain renewable energy production efforts, according to the bill report.

Many of those projects are funded through congressionally directed spending, more commonly known as earmarks.

Murray’s office said in a bill summary that the legislation “rejects President Trump’s senseless proposal to eliminate all discretionary funding” for conservation technical assistance grants, which are “a vital tool for farmers and ranchers.”

Appropriators included language in the bill report directing the Natural Resources Conservation Service to brief lawmakers “on how producers can utilize NRCS programs to exclude wildlife from farmland.”

Win for energy resilience

The Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bill would provide $730 million to a Pentagon resilience program that supports investments often targeted by Republican lawmakers.

The funds would go to the Energy Resilience Conservation Investment Program, which funnels federal dollars toward projects on military installations that “improve energy resilience, contribute to mission assurance, save energy, and reduce [the Department of Defense’s] energy costs,” according to DOD.

The Pentagon’s fiscal 2026 guidance for the program lists microgrids, battery storage and “renewable and/or clean energy generation systems” as possible targets, as well as nuclear and geothermal energy.

However, it’s unclear whether the agency will continue to direct the funds toward those priorities. The program guidance references Biden-era executive orders directing emissions reductions across the federal government. Trump repealed those orders when he took office.

Environmental cleanups

The minibus contains hundreds of millions of dollars for environmental remediation to counteract pollution from harmful “forever chemicals” and a major fuel spill.

Negotiators included House-passed language providing $50 million for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, cleanups above the level the Trump administration requested for fiscal 2026. In all, PFAS remediation efforts would get more than $100 million.

Appropriators are also providing $53.7 billion in fiscal 2026 funding for the Toxic Exposures Fund, which supports veterans sickened by exposure to burn pits. That is more than double the amount provided in fiscal 2025, according to a bill summary.

In a statement, Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the House’s top Democratic appropriator, lamented that the bill does not include advance funding for the exposure fund for fiscal 2027. She objected to the release of the spending legislation Sunday absent a broader funding deal with Republicans.

CR details

The continuing resolution attached to the minibus would fund the rest of the government until the end of January, reopening federal agencies and jumpstarting programs that have been partially shuttered for more than a month.

Appropriators included language that would reverse the layoffs the Trump administration implemented during the ongoing shutdown, requiring agencies to rehire affected employees and pay them for the time they would have worked. It would bar the administration from dismissing more workers through the duration of the CR.

The stopgap contains extensions for a host of programs that lapsed Sept. 30, including the Defense Production Act and the National Flood Insurance Program. A bipartisan duo in the House introduced a bill, H.R. 5848, that would backdate the authorization for the NFIP to Sept. 30 and extend its authorization through the end of 2026.

The CR also has a number of funding provisions requested by the White House to ensure certain federal programs do not lapse or run out of funds for the duration of the funding patch.

That includes an extension of funding for wildfire management and an extension of up to $54 million in funding under EPA’s state and tribal assistance grants to maintain certain infrastructure projects.

This expands the company’s activities beyond its existing campus in Nevada. According to Redwood, the facility will initially process approximately 20,000 tons of materials, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper, from used lithium-ion batteries each year. The goal is to reduce dependency on imports and utilize secondary raw materials from domestic waste, equipment, and electric vehicles.

The new facility is an initial step in the development of the planned “Battery Materials Campus” in South Carolina. Redwood plans to build one of the world’s largest centers for the recovery, refinement, and manufacture of battery materials there. Over the next ten years, Redwood aims to further expand in South Carolina and create over 1,500 new jobs.

Redwood already operates one of the largest lithium-ion battery recycling facilities in North America, located in Nevada. According to the company’s figures, it processed over 60,000 tons of materials at the Nevada facility last year. This means that approximately 90 percent of the batteries processed in North America pass through Redwood’s facilities.

The project is in response to the United States’ heavy dependence on imports of critical raw materials. These materials often come from geopolitically unstable regions or countries with tense relations with the United States. The company aims to build a national reserve of raw materials and secure the domestic supply by recovering materials from existing products, such as electric vehicles. It is estimated that U.S. electric vehicles currently contain approximately 2.25 million tons of these metals.",https://battery-news.de/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2000x0.webp,N,,2025-11-11 10:03:07.145469

One reason that electricity bills were going up, they said, was because President Donald Trump was squelching efforts to expand renewable energy in the Garden State.

A little farther south, Jared Littmann won his race by taking a very different tack on climate and energy politics. The next mayor of Annapolis, Maryland, leaned into the existential crisis of global warming and highlighted its immediate dangers — such as how sea-level rise is contributing to frequent floods of his waterfront city.

“What I had been told is to de-emphasize it a little bit or not come out as my top priority,” Littmann said of climate change. “But it’s hard in Annapolis to not be focused on those issues.”

That approach sets Littmann apart from much of his party as Democrats look to build on their electoral successes of last week.

Increasingly, Democratic lawmakers and consultants are urging either a retreat from climate politics or a recasting of its message — even if that means risking a rift with the party faithful.

Caution about climate messaging appears to have informed the winning campaigns of Tuesday’s disparate field of Democratic victors, which included a democratic socialist in New York, a former CIA officer in Virginia and a Navy helicopter pilot in New Jersey.

Gone was former President Joe Biden’s talk of climate change as an “existential crisis.” One thing that united New York’s Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, Virginia’s Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger and New Jersey’s Sherrill was a reluctance to mention climate change. Instead, they largely spoke of clean energy as a pocketbook issue.

These Democrats and others won their elections Tuesday “with a message of affordability — and I think that’s a pathway for us,” said Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, one of Congress’ fiercest climate hawks. “Regular people don’t like that crisis message.”

Sen. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) took a similar view. It’s a winning strategy, he said, to talk about how clean energy investments can lower utility bills.

“I’m not sure having an overall conversation on climate change gets us there,” he added. “But if you could align the investments with the outcomes, I think you’d have a very good argument.”

That perspective is echoed by reports released recently by two centrist Democratic groups.

The reports argue that Democrats have lost elections in recent years because of the party’s hyperfocus on climate change. A voter who is struggling to pay bills, they say, doesn’t have the luxury to care about climate change.

The party’s focus on climate change has helped create a wedge between rich Democrats and working class voters who have drifted away from the party in recent elections, argues one report released last month by the centrist Democratic group WelcomePAC.

“Highly educated Democratic voters and affluent Democratic voters care more than the average American about issues like climate change, democracy, abortion, and identity and cultural issues—and less than the average American about issues like the cost of living, gas prices, border security, and crime,” the group concludes.

That echoes the claims of another centrist group, Searchlight Institute, which released a report in September that showed that even though almost 9 in 10 Democrats view climate change as a very serious problem, the vast majority of voters rank it way below affordability as their primary concern.

Climate messaging contributed to the notion that the party was disconnected from many voters, the report said.

“If the Democratic Party is going to shake the perception that they are focused on issues perceived as out-of-touch to most Americans,” the group concluded, “they’ll need a significant reset beyond just adding talk about lowering costs to climate messaging.”

Challenge for Democrats: Trump’s rhetoric

Not everyone on the left agrees, however, that a retreat from climate politics is the right approach. Some progressives maintain it’s still a potent issue and that last week’s election results proved the electorate was ready for more clean energy.

Among those making that case is Climate Power, an advocacy group co-founded by longtime Democratic insider John Podesta. It backed the idea that Trump’s attacks on renewable energy creates an opening for Democrats going into the 2026 midterm elections.

“To win in the midterms, Democratic candidates can proactively and relentlessly make the strong case that Trump and Republicans are raising electricity bills by gutting cheaper, reliable clean energy options,” the memo notes. “Democrats are fighting for more, less expensive electricity, while Republicans are taking power off the grid and raising costs on American families.”

While moderate Democrats have pointed to climate policy as one cause of past electoral losses, others say the real reason is because Trump and other Republicans frequently attack Democrats with misleading claims.

“Our opponents (Trump and the GOP) talk about climate change all the time—always using relentless disinformation to make Democrats look bad. You HAVE to have a plan for that or else you’re going to lose,” Genevieve Guenther, author of “The Language of Climate Politics,” wrote last week on BlueSky.

While in the White House, Biden signed into law one of the biggest climate laws in U.S. history — the Inflation Reduction Act with its $370 billion in clean energy spending. But he barely mentioned it in the final stretch of his 2024 campaign before he dropped out of the race. And he wasn’t alone; former Vice President Kamala Harris all but ignored climate and clean energy in her 107-day campaign.

But politics abhors a vacuum. As top Democrats backed away from speaking about climate policy, Republicans leaned into it.

During the 2024 campaign, Trump attacked Harris and Biden’s plans to increase clean energy at virtually every rally, frequently calling it the “Green New Scam” and falsely claiming they slowed oil and gas production, when it in fact reached record levels of production in the administration.

As Harris and Biden dialed back discussion of climate policy, Trump framed it as a cost driver, a key piece of the price spikes that occurred throughout the economy during the Biden administration as the world recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic.

“To further defeat inflation, my plan will terminate the Green New Deal, which I call the Green New Scam,” Trump said last September in the closing weeks of the presidential race.

“It actually sets us back, as opposed to moves us forward,” he added.

Trump’s efforts to paint climate policy as a burden were backed by conservative media. Fox News, whose commenters routinely distort climate science and typically align with Trump on the issue, ran more news segments on climate change than any other network except CNN in 2024, according to researchers at the University of Colorado, Boulder.

CNN ran 1,078 segments on climate change, while Fox — the nation’s top-watched news station — ran 332. In fact, Fox covered climate more than all of the other stations, including CBS, ABC, NBC, PBS and MSNBC combined, which altogether ran a total of 326 segments on climate in 2024, the researchers found.

Several Democrats said they don’t want to cede the issue to Republican misinformation and argued that ignoring climate change won’t win back voters.

Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old Democratic House candidate in Illinois, said she’s not backing away from climate policy. Abughazaleh is running in a crowded race in the 9th District, which includes Chicago’s northern suburbs, though some polling shows her near the top of the pack.

Her campaign strategy has centered around issues that motivate young voters, particularly those with concerns around the Trump’s administration’s immigration crackdown.

She said voters of her generation want to hear candidates address climate change and argued that politicians who avoid the topic are “doing a disservice to the people they want to represent.”

“Climate change is an existential issue,” she said. “I’m part of the generation where, when we’re asked what we want to do when we grow up, we have to think about climate change, where we’re going to live, what we want to do, how it’s going to impact us.”

For other Democrats, such as Rep. Sean Casten of Illinois, climate change has already helped them win multiple elections. Other blue-state Democrats, including Schatz and Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, have won victories by centering their message on climate.

Casten said Democrats should continue talking about the consequences of fossil fuel consumption and that the new focus on affordability creates a political opportunity. He said it can help voters understand that it is possible to reduce utility costs by building a stronger and more resilient grid with clean energy that’s not subject to the volatility of oil and gas prices.

At the same time, he said lawmakers have a duty to lead on climate policy — and not just follow the polls.

“If something is hugely important and it doesn’t poll well, and so you don’t talk about it, you’re implicitly saying that you’re not really cut out for leadership,” Casten said. “How this polls is the least important question.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/50/cb/f372a0e04b5cbc7899c64189f556/election-2025-governor-new-jersey-66441.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 08:59:32.563219

States building renewable energy plus storage today are positioning themselves for lower electricity costs tomorrow.","By Mark McNees

Recently, I received an email from Linda, who read one of my recent energy op-eds. “Dr. McNees,” she wrote, “my electric bill jumped 30% this year. Can you explain what’s happening? I’m on a fixed income and genuinely scared about next winter.” Her question captures what millions of Americans are asking as they open their utility bills.

The answer isn’t simple, but it’s not a mystery either. Your electricity bill is caught in a perfect storm of surging demand, rising fuel costs and infrastructure failures that utilities pass directly to consumers. The good news? There are real solutions, some you can implement today, others that require smarter policy choices.

The AI revolution needs your electricity

Let’s start with demand. Data centers powering artificial intelligence are devouring electricity at unprecedented rates. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates data centers could consume up to 9% of US electricity by 2030, double today’s consumption.

When ChatGPT answers your question, it’s using electricity. When your company adopts AI tools, they’re competing with your home for the same power grid.

Electric vehicles and heat pumps add to the squeeze. Every EV charging in a garage, every home swapping gas furnaces for electric heat pumps, they’re all pulling from the same strained system.

This isn’t bad, it’s progress. But progress without adequate planning means higher bills.

Natural gas isn’t cheap anymore

Your bill’s biggest killer might be what you can’t see: the fuel that generates your electricity. Natural gas prices are expected to rise significantly between 2024 and 2026 as American producers ship more overseas.

When Europe needed alternatives to Russian gas, U.S. liquefied natural gas exports surged. Great for geopolitics and American producers, brutal for your monthly budget.

Natural gas generates roughly 40% of America’s electricity. When fuel costs spike, utilities don’t absorb the difference; they forward the invoice to you.

Your grid Is falling apart

Infrastructure costs are the silent tax on your electric bill. Seventy percent of transmission lines are over 25 years old and approaching the end of their typical 50 to 80 year lifecycle, reports the Department of Energy. The average age of all installed infrastructure is about 40 years old.

Wildfires, hurricanes and ice storms each reveal infrastructure vulnerabilities that cost money to repair and more money to prevent next time. Every dollar eventually appears on customer bills, whether you live in disaster zones or not.

The renewable solution nobody talks about loud enough

Here’s what the energy industry doesn’t want you to understand: renewable energy plus storage is now dramatically cheaper than fossil fuels. In 2024, solar photovoltaics were on average 41% cheaper than the lowest cost fossil fuel alternatives, while onshore wind projects were 53% cheaper, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency.

But renewable energy alone won’t cut your bill. You need storage. Solar panels generate power during the day when demand is lower. Batteries store cheap daytime electricity for evening peaks when prices spike.

States building renewable energy plus storage today are positioning themselves for lower electricity costs tomorrow.

What you can do right now

You can’t control fuel prices or utility decisions, but you’re not helpless. Here’s your practical winter survival guide.

Seal the leaks. Air leaks waste 20% to 30% of energy used for heating, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.

Weatherstripping costs under $20 and takes minutes to install.

Program your thermostat. Every degree you lower heating saves 1% on bills. A programmable thermostat automatically reduces temperature when you’re sleeping or away, potentially saving up to 10% annually, according to the Department of Energy.

LED bulbs everywhere. If you haven’t switched every bulb to LED, you’re donating money to your utility. LEDs use 75% less energy than incandescent bulbs and last 25 times longer. The upfront cost pays back in months.

Chargers, cable boxes, printers and devices draw power even when “off.” Smart power strips cut phantom load automatically. The average home wastes 5% to 10% annually powering devices nobody’s using.

Check time of use rates. Many utilities offer lower rates during off-peak hours. Running dishwashers, washing machines and EV chargers overnight could cut costs by 5% to 10%.

Insulation pays back. Attics lose the most heat in winter. Adding insulation typically costs one to four dollars per square foot and cuts heating costs 15 to 20%. Some utilities may offer rebates that cover part of the expense.

Community solar programs. Can’t install rooftop panels? Community solar lets you buy into larger installations and receive credits on your bill. No installation costs, no roof required, just lower monthly payments.

The policy fight that actually matters

Individual action helps, but real relief requires policy changes. Congress eliminated renewable energy tax credits while electricity demand explodes; it’s like canceling road construction during a traffic jam.

Smart policy would restore tax credits for renewable energy and storage projects; streamline permits for all energy infrastructure, including solar, wind, nuclear and natural gas; upgrade transmission lines to move cheap power from where it’s generated to where it’s needed and support utilities shifting to fixed infrastructure charges instead of volatile fuel-based pricing.

Your next winter bill depends on choices made today

Electricity bills are rising because we’re asking a 40-year-old system to handle 21st-century demand using fuel with rollercoaster pricing. The solution isn’t returning to the past; it’s building the infrastructure that makes energy abundant and affordable.

Renewable energy plus storage delivers cheaper electricity. It’s not ideology, it’s math. States embracing this transition will see lower bills. States clinging to fossil fuel dependence will watch costs climb as global markets set prices.

This winter, weatherstrip your doors, program your thermostat and check time-of-use rates. But don’t stop there. Tell your representatives that energy policy should prioritize what lowers bills, not what sounds good in a campaign ad.

Your neighbor’s 40% increase isn’t the new normal unless we accept it. The technology exists to generate abundant, affordable electricity. The only question is whether we’ll deploy it fast enough to prevent next winter’s bill from being even worse.

Highlights

Independent APC analysis confirms Anaphite’s dry coating process reduces emissions by 3.57kg CO₂-eq per kWh of cell capacity versus wet coating methods

Technology could save 7 million tonnes of CO₂ annually if applied across global battery production, with EV demand forecast to exceed 1.9 TWh by 2025

Dry coating eliminates energy-intensive drying stage and uses minimal chemicals, addressing a critical bottleneck in sustainable battery manufacturing

EU Battery Regulation mandates carbon footprint quantification from 2027, creating regulatory pressure for low-emission manufacturing technologies

Technology Overview and Environmental Impact

The assessment, conducted in November 2025, evaluated Anaphite’s dry coating platform against conventional wet coating processes used in battery electrode manufacturing. Traditional wet coating requires substantial energy for drying electrodes and relies on chemical-intensive processes that contribute significantly to the carbon footprint of lithium-ion cell production.

Anaphite’s patented technology platform combines all key ingredients of a battery electrode into a single, engineered dry powder that eliminates wet processing lines. This approach removes the energy-intensive drying stage entirely while reducing chemical usage throughout the manufacturing process.

Market Context and Scaling Requirements

Global battery demand is projected to double by 2030, driven primarily by electric vehicle adoption. With EV market growth accelerating, manufacturers face mounting pressure to decarbonize production processes while scaling capacity rapidly.

Key market drivers include:

Regulatory compliance: EU Battery Regulation requires mandatory carbon footprint disclosure from 2027 via ISO-compliant Life Cycle Assessment

Production efficiency: Wet coating creates bottlenecks due to enormous ovens required for drying electrodes at scale

Market access: Battery makers producing cells exceeding CO₂ thresholds may face market restrictions and fines in key regions

Manufacturing Process Advantages

The dry coating process delivers carbon savings by eliminating the most energy-intensive stage of electrode production. When wet coating is completely replaced by Anaphite’s technology for every cell made in 2025, the analysis indicates potential savings exceeding 7 million tonnes of CO₂-eq.

This approach directly addresses the infrastructure limitations of traditional wet coating, which requires massive industrial drying equipment that constrains production scalability and drives operational costs.

Strategic Implications for Battery Manufacturers

As regulatory frameworks tighten and market demands for sustainable production intensify, dry coating technologies represent a critical pathway for OEMs to meet environmental targets while maintaining production efficiency.

Last week’s elections were a setback, but not a devastating one:

New Jersey is still a blue state, and while Virginia went red four years ago, it’s been trending Democratic for more than a decade.

Republicans also fared poorly in Pennsylvania, however, an all-important presidential battleground. Democrats even made inroads deep into the South, taking two state senate seats in Mississippi—ending a GOP supermajority—and picking up city council spots in South Carolina and Florida.

With results like these, the Republicans’ razor-thin majority in Congress won’t survive the midterm elections a year from now.

And that means the Trump administration, which came roaring back to power in January, will face implacable legislative opposition in its final two years. Decisions the president makes now will determine not only the Republican Congress’s fate and how his own last years in office play out, but also whether the GOP goes into 2028 prepared to hold onto the White House.

With the stakes the highest they will ever be, Trump has to focus on voters’ most basic measure of happiness: the state of the economy. Is 3 percent annual inflation satisfactory, or does that make Americans feel like Joe Biden never left?

Beef prices are well above the inflation rate, and while home prices are rising more slowly than inflation, the elevated interest rates needed to keep inflation under control make taking on the debt to buy a house more burdensome. To address the latter, the administration has floated the idea of creating 50-year mortgages, as if what Americans really want is to spend an extra two decades paying off a home with lower payments month by month.

A half-century mortgage would turn homebuyers into something closer to renters, with their banks as their landlords—only maintenance and home repairs won’t be the landlord’s responsibility, they’ll be the mortgagor’s.

That’s not the American dream. That’s 21st-century serfdom: laboring for a lifetime without owning property of your own free and clear.

The president wants the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates even at the risk of sparking more inflation, in the hopes a growth boom fueled by easy credit will generate real prosperity that outstrips the rise in prices.

He’s even promising to send Americans $2,000 stimulus checks as “dividends” from tariff revenue. That, too, would give an impetus to inflation.

Yet the administration is making some wise moves, including opening parts of the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for resource development. With China aggressively using its rare-earth metals as leverage in trade negotiations, the need for America to develop its own natural resources is urgent.

Even the Barack Obama administration reaped the benefits of expanding domestic energy production during the fracking boom. Escalating electricity bills, which voters associate with the rush to build new AI data centers, are one source of Americans’ present discontents, and that’s all the more reason for the administration to prioritize energy and natural resources.

Paring back regulation is one step in that direction—but extracting and refining rare-earth metals and other valuable commodities is a messy business. The answer is to make research and development of cleaner processing methods a priority alongside cutting red tape.

Can the artificial intelligence industry that contributes to the problem of higher energy costs also bring about breakthroughs that provide a solution? That’s a question the administration should be asking Big Tech.

America supplies the conditions that AI needs to flourish—and AI has to start reciprocating, providing the nation with new means to prosper, sooner rather than later.

Trump’s tariffs have given American companies powerful incentives for developing industry at home—and they’ve given foreign nations reason to invest here to secure better trade terms with the administration.

The next step is to build up advanced industrial capacity in the sectors we need most, starting with energy and environmental protection to be achieved through technology that aids development, rather than regulatory bureaucracy that holds it back. Not only will well-paid new jobs spring up quickly, as they did when fracking techniques first matured, but more energy will make possible more economic activity of all kinds, a virtuous cycle of growth and technological improvement.

That approach promises to generate real-world returns that will not only overcome the ill effects of inflation but also lower prices for everything, as production methods become more efficient and are made cheaper by abundant energy.

“Drill, baby, drill” were some of Trump’s favorite words on the campaign trail last year.

But they also imply “learn, baby, learn” and “build, baby, build,” with science supporting energy, energy supporting industry, and industry turning science into applications.

Financial finagling, whether in the form of 50-year mortgages or tariff stimulus checks, isn’t the answer—a rebirth of industry, enabled by American energy, is what the nation needs.

This commercial achievement has yet to translate into soft power for China.
America has historically served as the crucible for automotive brands.
Consumer reviews of BYD vehicles are mixed: praise for features and price, criticism for quality issues and service.
Germany and Japan built automotive soft power without negative national reputations weighing them down.","In the first few decades of automotive history, the motor car was arguably the most visible, most visceral expression of national character a country could export. A car conferred more soft power on its country of origin than any other consumer product.

In the early 20th century, the ability to mass-produce cars was shorthand for national modernity and industrial prowess. Henry Ford’s assembly line didn’t just democratize transportation — it announced America’s arrival as an economic superpower. When Model Ts rolled off production lines in Detroit, they carried with them a narrative of American ingenuity, efficiency, and the promise of mobility for the masses. Chevrolet, Cadillac, and Chrysler reinforced this message. To drive an American car was to participate in the American century.

As the industry matured, soft power shifted from the mere capacity to build cars to the ability to build exceptional ones. German manufacturers transformed automotive engineering into a form of national expression. Mercedes-Benz didn’t just make reliable vehicles; it made vehicles that embodied precision, quality, and meticulous attention to detail — qualities that became synonymous with German manufacturing. BMW promised driving pleasure engineered to exacting standards. Even the advertising was instructive: Audi’s “Vorsprung durch Technik” tagline worked because it tapped into established perceptions.

Italy contributed its own narrative through Ferrari and Lamborghini — cars that weren’t merely fast but beautiful — transforming automotive design into an art form.

More recently, Japan and South Korea have demonstrated that relative newcomers can still leverage automobiles for soft power. Toyota and Honda overcame initial skepticism about Japanese quality to become global standards for reliability, before Lexus and Acura showed the country could create genuine luxury, too. Hyundai and Kia followed a similar trajectory, moving from budget alternatives to credible competitors. These brands didn’t just succeed commercially — they reshaped perceptions of their countries’ capabilities, showcasing prowess in both mass production and quality engineering.

Going by these historical patterns, China should be harvesting enormous soft power from the success of BYDiBYDBYD Auto is a Chinese carmaker that became the world’s leading EV manufacturer in 2023, competing with Tesla for market share and global attention.READ MORE.

Early this year, BYD overtook Tesla to become the world’s leading manufacturer of electric vehicles. Its cars now populate streets from Bangkok to São Paulo. Their popularity isn’t confined to the global south: In September, BYD sold 11,271 vehicles in the U.K. — an astonishing 880% surge over the previous year, making the country its largest market outside China. These are the numbers of a genuine automotive giant.

This commercial achievement has yet to translate into soft power for China.

BYD’s vehicles may be everywhere, but the brand lacks Tesla’s cultural cachet — even though Elon Musk’s political adventures have been eroding it. The overall impression is that people buy BYD because it offers compelling value, not because the brand is cool and aspirational.

Can BYD eventually attain that status? Will it do for China what Ford did for the U.S., Mercedes for Germany, and Ferrari for Italy?

Color me skeptical, and for several reasons.

Start with the most fundamental: the ability to manufacture automobiles is no longer a rare or impressive feat. In Henry Ford’s day, mass-producing cars signaled membership to an elite club of industrialized nations. Today, that club includes dozens of countries across multiple continents. Turkey makes cars. India makes cars. Morocco makes cars. The achievement that once conferred prestige has become commonplace. Simply building vehicles — even building them well and building them cheaply — carries little reputational advantage.

Electrification does not provide the differentiating factor it might have a decade ago. As EVs have moved from novelty to ubiquity, they’ve shed their mystique. They’re becoming just cars — with different power trains, yes, but cars nonetheless. The technology has been demystified. BYD has demonstrated genuine innovation in battery technology, particularly with its Blade batteries, which deserve recognition. But battery chemistry, however sophisticated, doesn’t capture imaginations the way a beautifully designed vehicle would.

Then there’s the problem of being untested in the automobile’s ultimate proving ground: BYD is effectively barred from the American market by Trump’s 100% tariffs. This matters far beyond the lost sales volume. America has historically served as the crucible for automotive brands. Japanese manufacturers earned their reputations by competing directly with Ford and Chevrolet in Detroit’s backyard.

Honda and Toyota proved they could satisfy America’s demanding consumers; that validation conferred global legitimacy. Korean brands followed the same path. Success in America signals that a brand can succeed anywhere. BYD has no access to this test. While it can point to impressive sales from Mexico City to Munich, it cannot claim validation in the market that still defines automotive prestige. There’s very little the company can do to change this situation, but the absence creates a permanent asterisk next to its achievements.

Perhaps most importantly, BYD carries the considerable baggage of China’s negative reputation. This manifests in two distinct ways. First, there’s the quality perception. Despite China’s evolution into a sophisticated manufacturing hub, “Made in China” still suggests affordability rather than excellence. The 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer found that global trust in Chinese brands stands at just 30%, down from 33% a decade earlier. Compare that with 62% for German brands or 64% for Canadian ones.

Consumer reviews of BYD vehicles are mixed: praise for features and price, criticism for quality issues and service. The slow app upgrade in January — which left thousands of Chinese drivers stranded during the morning rush hour — didn’t help. The company announced the recall of 115,000 cars last month, citing design and battery-safety issues.

Second, there are the political associations. Germany and Japan built automotive soft power without negative national reputations weighing them down. When Japanese cars arrived in America in the 1970s, consumers didn’t associate Japan with aggressive territorial expansion or geopolitical menace. China faces a fundamentally different environment. Concerns about human rights in Xinjiang, the crackdown in Hong Kong, and bellicose diplomatic posturing create powerful headwinds that BYD must navigate. Fair or not, these associations affect consumer perceptions.

Other Chinese brands demonstrate the challenge. Huawei dominates telecommunications. Lenovo controls the PC market, after purchasing IBM’s share. Alibaba and Tencent are technology giants. TikTok has captured a generation of users. Yet with the possible exception of TikTok among teenagers, none of these brands have achieved aspirational status. They’re ubiquitous without being cool. Notably, TikTok systematically underplays its Chinese origins — a telling strategy that suggests even its creators understand the reputational challenge.

Clearly, product success alone cannot generate soft power for China. Japanese and Korean automakers overcame initial quality skepticism through decades of consistent excellence, transforming perceptions in the process. But they operated in a more favorable environment, without the political complications that shadow Chinese brands today. The trust deficit isn’t primarily about product quality — it’s about the country behind the product.

BYD has genuine technological achievements and formidable scale. With revenue surpassing $107 billion in 2024, it has demonstrated impressive capabilities. But achievement doesn’t automatically confer soft power. That requires making people want what you represent, not merely what you sell. It requires brands people aspire to own, not just ones they can afford to buy. It requires proving excellence in markets that matter most. And it requires that the country behind the brand doesn’t repel the consumers it hopes to attract.

The road from commercial success to cultural influence runs longer than sales charts suggest. BYD is driving fast. But until it transforms from a practical choice to a desirable one, from affordable to aspirational, from successful to admired, its impressive figures won’t translate into the soft power that shapes global perceptions of China.",https://restofworld.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2154481266-scaled-e1762522886342-1600x900.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 11:10:29.447887

President Trump has called climate change a hoax.
Worldwide, renewable energy is growing rapidly, with China leading on production and manufacturing of renewable energy technology.","Countries are gathering in Brazil at the COP30 summit to take stock of climate change. As in past summits, the negotiations are starting on the back foot: countries already aren't meeting their goals to cut heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels.

The world has barely budged in its efforts to combat climate change compared to one year ago, according to a new report from the United Nations. If countries stay on that track, the planet will warm by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial temperatures of the mid-1800s. That's slightly better than projections made last year, which showed 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming – but much of that progress could soon be cancelled out by the U.S.

The Trump Administration is not sending any high-level officials to the COP30 talks, according to a statement from the White House. On President Trump's first day in office, he announced he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, the landmark deal made in 2015 among the world's nations to combat climate change. The U.S. had been instrumental in negotiating that agreement, which seeks to limit warming by 2100 to a key threshold: 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Beyond that level of warming, scientific research shows climate change impacts become dramatically more damaging. Storms will produce more extreme rainfall, causing more dangerous flooding. Hurricanes get more intense. Heat waves reach more dangerous temperatures. Vulnerable ecosystems, like coral reefs, stand little chance at surviving.

The world is very likely to hit 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next decade, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. To stop the planet from getting even hotter by the end of the century, emissions would need to fall 55% by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. If countries follow through on their current pledges to cut emissions, they'd only fall 12% by 2035.

In the U.S., emissions from burning fossil fuels have declined recently, as aging coal power plants have closed and more solar and wind power has been installed. Renewable power projects are now cheaper than new fossil fuel power plants.

President Trump has called climate change a hoax. His administration now seeks to boost fossil fuels, rolling back tax credits for solar energy and cancelling offshore wind power projects. One study found that such measures will slow U.S. emissions cuts, which were expected to fall 38-56% by 2035, but now may only decline by 26-35%.

""I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders at the United National General Assembly in September.

Worldwide, renewable energy is growing rapidly, with China leading on production and manufacturing of renewable energy technology. More than 90% of new energy projects installed globally in 2024 were renewable. Energy experts say those economic forces will continue the expansion of clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But without stronger moves by governments to reduce fossil fuel use, those declines may still not be fast enough.

Thanks to the agreement with Glenfarne, Baker Hughes will supply the main refrigerant compressors for the Alaska LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. The tech company has also committed to a strategic investment to support the LNG project.

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman & CEO of Baker Hughes. “Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

The agreements were announced at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan in attendance.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said that Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in American history. He sees the investment announcement as an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the country’s energy security.

“American LNG is not just an energy source, it’s a strategic asset that powers our economy, strengthens our alliances, and secures our nation’s future,” stated Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By forging this strategic alliance and investment in the Alaska LNG Project, we’re strengthening our nation’s energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence and global competitiveness.“

The Alaska LNG project is being developed in two phases to accelerate project execution. Phase One comprises an 807-mile pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis for the pipeline in December, leading to a final investment decision (FID) on this phase of the project.

After that, Phase Two of the project will see the addition of the LNG terminal and related infrastructure to enable 20 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG export capability. FID for this stage is expected in late 2026.

Since becoming the lead developer of Alaska LNG in March, Glenfarne has secured offtake agreements with JERA, POSCO, CPC, PTT, and most recently, Tokyo Gas.

As for Baker Hughes, the firm was picked for work on another U.S. LNG project – the Rio Grande LNG expansion project earlier this month.

Rollins now serves on Trump’s cabinet as the agriculture secretary, despite having no substantial professional experience with agricultural policy.
Before founding AFPI, Rollins led the Texas Public Policy Foundation, another powerful political organization group that, among other conservative initiatives, has funded efforts to block wind and solar development.
Even McPherson-Smith, who provided opening remarks at the summit, briefly served as executive director of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council and deputy assistant to the president.","Dozens of people packed into a ballroom at the glitzy Waldorf Astoria in Washington in mid-October for a “who’s who” of the conservative energy world.

For those in attendance, the America First Policy Institute’s (AFPI) Global Energy Summit simultaneously served as a victory rally for the group’s successes, a homecoming for some of its main stars and a warning cry of the threat it believes environmentalists pose to basic liberties.

That dual sense of triumphalism and foreboding danger was on display from the onset of the event.

“Around the world, governments are abusing an increasingly thin patina of environmentalism to push policies that further and further encroach on the freedoms of everyday citizens,” said Oliver McPherson-Smith, AFPI’s vice chair of energy and environment, in opening remarks.

McPherson-Smith’s dire language is nothing new for the conservative think tank, founded in 2021 in the wake of President Donald Trump’s election loss to Joe Biden.

AFPI has previously derided what it describes as “apocalyptic rhetoric” about the climate, which it says the Biden administration used as “justification for its sweeping radical agenda and massive government expansion.”

But to attendees at last month’s gathering, Trump’s return to office has brought nothing short of salvation.

“AFPI is proud of the many America-First policies advanced by the administration and cabinet officials,” Ellis said, “including policies to reverse the prior administration’s reliability-destroying subsidies for solar and wind energy and the America-last ban on U.S. LNG exports.”

Examples of that agenda were on full display as a star-studded roster of speakers, including Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, detailed the administration’s fight against what it sees as anti-energy, anti-prosperity policies.

The two officials highlighted a mid-October effort to tank what would have been the first global carbon tax. A United Nations body, the International Maritime Organization, was on the precipice of approving rules that would have created a net-zero framework and a cap on greenhouse gas emissions from shipping vessels. Ships exceeding those limits would need to purchase carbon credits or be subjected to additional fees.

“‘It’s a foregone conclusion,’” Wright recalled hearing from one foreign energy minister whose country planned to vote for the measure.

A draft of the framework was overwhelmingly approved in April, with 63 countries voting in favor and only 16 voting against, alongside 24 abstentions—despite the U.S. abandoning negotiations.

But months of pressure from Trump led to a drastic swing in countries’ support for the measure. According to reporting by climate newsroom Grist, the administration threatened countries with tariffs, visa restrictions, sanctions and additional port fees unless they opted to abandon the deal.

Those efforts paid off in October. With the support of the U.S. and other nations, Saudi Arabia successfully introduced a proposal to postpone adoption of the net-zero framework until October 2026—this time with 57 countries voting in favor of postponement and 49 countries voting against it, with 21 abstentions.

“I will tell you that the ‘it’s going to happen’ crowd were very disappointed,” Wright said at AFPI’s summit. “That’s because of your support, your belief, your commitment to this stuff … and helping to elect President Trump and the cabinet he picked.”

For AFPI’s supporters, the Trump administration’s aggressive action on energy and the environment is no accident, but rather the culmination of meticulous preparation for the president’s second term.

In its 2022 policy book, dubbed “The America First Agenda,” AFPI rejected the “false premise that environmental progress and prosperity are antithetical goals.”

Yet it also argued that many bedrock environmental laws may need “modernization” to spur greater economic growth—including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act.

AFPI has also called for an end to “outsized subsidies” of renewable energies, suggested that the Inflation Reduction Act is a threat to national security and pushed for increased fossil fuel production.

Just 10 months into his second term in office, Trump is already delivering on many of those goals.

Trump secured what critics describe as a giveaway for the fossil fuel industry in his signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act, mandating lease sales for oil and gas drilling while slashing incentives for wind and solar development.

The administration is also aiming to reverse the EPA’s key finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health, which serves as the basis for its ability to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.

And companies have merely needed to email the EPA to request exemptions from Clean Air Act regulations that limit toxic emissions from facilities like coal-fired power plants.

In May, AFPI said that the Trump administration had enacted or advanced over 86 percent of the organization’s agenda in its first 100 days.

A spokesperson for AFPI declined to answer questions asking what the group attributes its success to in achieving so many of its goals. But the answer appears to stem, in part, from AFPI’s deep ties within Trump’s inner circle.

The group was known last year as Trump’s administration-in-waiting, with the New York Times writing shortly before the election that the group was poised to be even more influential than the Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025.

A year later, those predictions appear to have come true.

Rollins, who appeared at last month’s summit alongside Wright, is the co-founder and former president and CEO of AFPI. Rollins now serves on Trump’s cabinet as the agriculture secretary, despite having no substantial professional experience with agricultural policy.

Before founding AFPI, Rollins led the Texas Public Policy Foundation, another powerful political organization group that, among other conservative initiatives, has funded efforts to block wind and solar development.

Scores of other key administration officials have ties to AFPI, ranging from EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, who chaired the group’s China Policy Initiative and led its “Pathway to 2025” voter drive, to Kevin Hassett, a former AFPI board member now serving as National Economic Council Director.

Even McPherson-Smith, who provided opening remarks at the summit, briefly served as executive director of Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council and deputy assistant to the president. He previously worked as a senior fellow at AFPI, and then as the director of its Center for Energy & Environment, according to his LinkedIn profile.

According to reporting by the New York Times, AFPI’s ties to the fossil fuel industry stretch back to its inception. Rollins, along with Linda McMahon—who would go on to chair Trump’s transition team and serve as education secretary—sought the help of Tim Dunn, a billionaire and Texas oil tycoon, to found the organization in preparation for a second Trump term.

Now, five years later, they—and the fossil fuel industry—are reaping the fruits of their labor.

“We’re living in a moment in history that will be written about, remembered, and talked about for 500, maybe a thousand more years,” Wright said. “There is no doubt in my mind. And we are all part of that moment.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2243832560-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 07:01:40.636953

As in past summits, the negotiations are starting on the back foot: countries already aren't meeting their goals to cut heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels.

The world has barely budged in its efforts to combat climate change compared to one year ago, according to a new report from the United Nations. If countries stay on that track, the planet will warm by about 5 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century, compared to the pre-industrial temperatures of the mid-1800s. That's slightly better than projections made last year, which showed 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit of warming – but much of that progress could soon be cancelled out by the U.S.

The Trump Administration is not sending any high-level officials to the COP30 talks, according to a statement from the White House. On President Trump's first day in office, he announced he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement, the landmark deal made in 2015 among the world's nations to combat climate change. The U.S. had been instrumental in negotiating that agreement, which seeks to limit warming by 2100 to a key threshold: 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).

Beyond that level of warming, scientific research shows climate change impacts become dramatically more damaging. Storms will produce more extreme rainfall, causing more dangerous flooding. Hurricanes get more intense. Heat waves reach more dangerous temperatures. Vulnerable ecosystems, like coral reefs, stand little chance at surviving.

The world is very likely to hit 1.5 degrees Celsius within the next decade, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. To stop the planet from getting even hotter by the end of the century, emissions would need to fall 55% by 2035, compared to 2019 levels. If countries follow through on their current pledges to cut emissions, they'd only fall 12% by 2035.

In the U.S., emissions from burning fossil fuels have declined recently, as aging coal power plants have closed and more solar and wind power has been installed. Renewable power projects are now cheaper than new fossil fuel power plants.

President Trump has called climate change a hoax. His administration now seeks to boost fossil fuels, rolling back tax credits for solar energy and cancelling offshore wind power projects. One study found that such measures will slow U.S. emissions cuts, which were expected to fall 38-56% by 2035, but now may only decline by 26-35%.

""I'm telling you that if you don't get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders at the United National General Assembly in September.

Worldwide, renewable energy is growing rapidly, with China leading on production and manufacturing of renewable energy technology. More than 90% of new energy projects installed globally in 2024 were renewable. Energy experts say those economic forces will continue the expansion of clean energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. But without stronger moves by governments to reduce fossil fuel use, those declines may still not be fast enough.

Most of the group’s reefs, Lightbody said, are about 400 feet long and contain 200 tons of oyster shells.

“Too often, you see a lot of these coastal projects that happen totally off somewhere in the distance,” Parfait said.
Small-scale coastal restoration projects, such as the oyster reef, are one piece of a statewide effort that has led to the investment of billions of dollars into safeguarding Louisiana’s coastline.","Along a stretch of marsh at the edge of the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana, Cajun boatmen ferried 200 tons of oyster shells to where the wetlands meet the gulf. Members of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana and volunteers stood on hills of oyster shells, loading the shells into buckets before packing them into wirework containers called gabions. They then lowered the gabions into the water to form an artificial reef.

The shells had quite a journey before returning to the salty ocean from which they came: They were recycled from restaurants in Louisiana’s two largest cities, New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Today, that oyster reef sits in the waters off Cocodrie, a 300-person fishing community whose name comes from the Cajun French word for alligator.

CRCL’s reef is just one example of Louisiana’s extensive coastal restoration efforts, which are necessary acts of stewardship in a landscape disappearing faster than almost anywhere in the world. On some parts of the coastline, land is receding so rapidly that the equivalent of a football field is lost every 100 minutes. With the recent cancellation of two extensive restoration projects that were funded mostly with Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlement money, small-scale efforts are perhaps more important than ever.

Fiona Lightbody, who coordinates the oyster recycling program at CRCL, stood on a dock overlooking Terrebonne Bay as she explained the twofold benefit of the oyster reef: It will replenish the marsh’s ecosystem while also slowing down land loss.

“The reef is there to grow oysters, but also to prevent the wave energy from hitting the marsh edge and eating away at the soil, which would then disrupt the roots and cause the plants to float away,” she said. “By slowing that wave energy, the reef creates a nice little safe zone for invertebrates and other creatures to thrive, and it slows the erosion.”

In addition to planting cypress forests and other native plants to revitalize coastal ecosystems, CRCL has built eight oyster reefs since the shell recycling program was founded in 2014. Most of the group’s reefs, Lightbody said, are about 400 feet long and contain 200 tons of oyster shells.

The organization built this particular reef at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium, or LUMCON, a research facility at one of the southernmost points in the state. The site attracts student tour groups and other visitors, making it an ideal place to educate the public about coastal restoration.

To build the oyster reef, CRCL collaborated with the Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, a conglomerate of Native American tribes who have dwelled along the Gulf Coast for millennia. The idea behind the oyster reef came from an age-old process: Putting oyster shells back into the environment from which they came is something that Indigenous Americans and oystermen have practiced throughout history.

“If you're an oysterman, you probably do this automatically. You know if you put your shell back into the water, baby oysters are going to grow on it,” James Karst, the communications director of CRCL, said.

For Devon Parfait, chief of the Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, fighting land loss is tied to the survival of his community. That is part of why his tribe worked with CRCL to build the oyster reef.

“Historically, when colonization was happening, these Native communities were pushed as far down south as they could possibly go,” he said. “They used to be able to ride a horse and buggy out to the barrier islands. These days, they’re just sparse little islands that people are arguing about protecting.”

Parfait, who is trained as a geological scientist, emphasized the importance of combining Indigenous knowledge of the land with data-based approaches. He used both types of understanding to determine if the build site could support oysters.

“I did my own testing for salinity, which is basically sticking your finger in the water and seeing how salty it is,” he said. “To me, it’s about combining these two different wealths of knowledge—the on-the-ground, lived, generational experience and the institutional expertise—because you need both. If you look at the world with just one, you’re really viewing the world with one eye closed.”

The salinity testing ruled out the original location for the oyster reef—a less salty marsh that lies over an ancient Indigenous burial mound. But the LUMCON site offers advantages of its own. “Too often, you see a lot of these coastal projects that happen totally off somewhere in the distance,” Parfait said. “Our idea was to have a living shoreline that people can come and see and interact with.”

The manmade oyster reef is just one example of nature-based solutions to land loss, which have become more common over the past 20 years.

“In the past, when it came to trying to protect land, everything was about putting in a solid structure or building a wall that keeps things intact, but then you’ve disconnected those wetlands from the estuary next to it, and you don't have the natural processes taking place,” said Brian Roberts, the chief scientist at LUMCON. “With these projects, we’re trying to figure out, ‘What is nature doing well on its own, and how do we take advantage of that?’”

What’s novel about CRCL’s approach to erosion control is its source. Recycling shells from restaurants is “a way of connecting with the culture of South Louisiana, connecting with our restaurants,” Karst said. “Everybody eats food, everybody loves our food and our seafood, and so we're bringing people who like to eat oysters into coastal restoration.” The shell recycling program shows no signs of slowing down: Not only did CRCL join forces with the National Football League to build a reef earlier this year, it also plans to build its next oyster reef in April 2026 in collaboration with the Chitimacha Tribe of Louisiana. This one will include 300 tons of oyster shells.

Small-scale coastal restoration projects, such as the oyster reef, are one piece of a statewide effort that has led to the investment of billions of dollars into safeguarding Louisiana’s coastline. For nearly two decades, coastal rebuilding in Louisiana has been guided by a comprehensive Coastal Master Plan. The plan, now in its fifth iteration, was initially spurred on by the immensely destructive Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.

“After Katrina and Rita, we said, ‘Here in Louisiana, we have to change the way we do business,’” said Simone Maloz, the campaign director for the Restore the Mississippi River Delta coalition. “What we want for Louisiana’s future has to be rooted in science, and it has to involve and engage all the communities that we're trying to restore and protect.”

The Coastal Master Plan made Louisiana a leader not just in coastal restoration but also in disaster relief. What sets it apart, Maloz said, is the fact that the projects detailed in the plan often originate from Louisiana residents, not state or federal administrators. “We ask community members to submit projects, and we have meetings with them all along the way,” she said. “It's nice to be a leader in that area, and now other states are also trying to use that same kind of method so that they can leverage their own resources.”

In addition to community-level projects, the Coastal Master Plan includes large-scale projects, such as the diversion of sediment from the Mississippi River to restore degrading wetlands, which the river once helped create. Two such projects, the Mid-Barataria and Mid-Breton sediment diversions, started in 2023 after a yearslong process of planning and permitting.

However, a change in state administration shook things up: Louisiana elected Jeff Landry, a Republican, as governor in 2024. He paused the sediment diversions shortly after he assumed office and fully canceled them in the summer of 2025. “To spend over $700 million on two projects in over 10 years, and to stop them in their tracks, is definitely something that we are going to have to deal with the consequences of,” Maloz said.

The cancellations have raised concerns about whether Louisiana can maintain its restoration momentum, and what scale of intervention is possible without the sediment diversions.

“We're always trying to plug into the Coastal Master Plan,” Franziska Trautmann said. She operates Glass Half Full, a nonprofit that restores the coastline using recycled glass turned to sand. “Our projects are smaller—we’re not diverting a river. We plug in the holes where the bigger master plan can’t really focus. But now that big projects like this are being canceled, who’s gonna fill that gap? Because it can’t be us.”

For now, volunteers are stepping up to try to fill that gap and are involved in every step of the process. The people helping to build the CRCL reef pick restaurant refuse from oyster-shell piles six feet high. They shovel shells into buckets, load the buckets onto boats, and ride the boats to the build site, dumping shells by the bucketful into the gabions.

To Parfait, community is the strongest force left against coastal erosion. “Fear doesn’t bring action in people as much as love and community does,” he said. “When something happens, everybody shows up and helps each other out, no matter who you are, what you identify as. That’s how Native Americans were able to survive down here in Louisiana—we created a sense of community that extended far beyond any of our own personal identities.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootzine/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-11 07:03:25.391170

A clean energy nonprofit based in Kansas City has received a $250,000 grant to support planning efforts for potential energy-saving projects in Douglas County.

Metropolitan Energy Center was awarded the grant by the Coalition for Green Capital, according to a news release from Douglas County. The grant is called a “Market Building Grant,” and it will be used to explore “financial strategies that attract both private and public investors” for energy-saving projects in the county, the release said.

As for what types of projects these strategies would be used to attract, the release said they could include upgrades to community centers, nonprofit buildings and multifamily rental housing.

“Our goal is to design a plan that brings clean energy and energy-efficiency upgrades to community facilities and housing where it’s most needed,” Douglas County sustainability impact analyst Jamie Hofling said in the release. “This is about lowering utility bills, creating healthier spaces and making our county more resilient in the future.”

Douglas County is one of 49 communities in the U.S. chosen to participate in this round of grants, the release said, based on the potential impact of local projects and their attractiveness to future funders and investors. The grant period runs through April 1, 2026.

“Metropolitan Energy Center is proud to partner with Douglas County on this planning effort,” Kelly Gilbert, executive director of Metropolitan Energy Center, said in the release. “We know that the cost of energy is rising, and efficiency and renewable energy solutions are more important than ever.

“Now without the EPA’s watching, this increased possibility [of being cited for violating environmental laws] is no longer there,” he said.
In part, these employees supervise the many environmental enforcement activities delegated to individual states.
As a result, the Justice Department’s environmental enforcement arm has shrunk by about half.
Once the EPA identifies environmental violations, the Justice Department pursues cases against polluters and enters into legal settlements with them.","It’s day 42 of the U.S. government shutdown, but an end is finally in sight. On Sunday night, the Senate voted to move forward with funding for the federal government through January 30. That vote, in which eight Democrats joined the vast majority of Senate Republicans, is expected to be followed by approval from the Republican majority in the House of Representatives and President Donald Trump. With many Democratic officials condemning the capitulation of their Senate colleagues, a revival of the shutdown is a distinct possibility after funding expires again next year.

One of the many adverse effects of the current shutdown is that, for weeks now, the nation’s top environmental cop has been off duty. While it’s too early to know the exact consequences of the dysfunction, analogous situations in the recent past indicate that polluters often increase their emissions during periods of relaxed enforcement. With such periods becoming regular features of the U.S. political process, the cumulative environmental fallout could be significant.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s enforcement division is responsible for making sure the country’s cornerstone environmental laws — the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, and hazardous waste laws among them — are followed. From Washington, D.C., and 10 regional offices across the country, these staffers police some of the nation’s biggest polluters. They conduct surprise inspections at refineries, power plants, and factories. They review data and reports to check compliance. And, when they find violations, they issue fines and work with the Justice Department to take offenders to court until they course correct.

But since the shutdown began on October 1, the EPA has gradually furloughed most of its civil enforcement staff. At first, only a handful of employees were sent home at the start of the month, and the agency kept most workers on using unspent funds from previous budget years. As that funding ran out, however, the agency furloughed most of its workforce. Since only essential staff that protect the public from imminent threats are retained during furloughs, the vast majority of enforcement staffers had been ordered to stay home by the end of the month.

“The inspection and enforcement arm of the agency has largely been shuttered,” said Justin Chen, president of AFGE Council 238, the union that represents agency employees. “The large majority of inspectors and enforcement officers, along with attorneys who work with them to conduct the settlements and other legal actions against regulated entities, are all furloughed right now.” Chen himself was furloughed on October 20.

Previous pauses in enforcement indicate that a lack of federal oversight can embolden polluters. Researchers at Pennsylvania State University examined emissions data from 204 coal-fired power plants from across the country during the last major federal shutdown at the end of 2018. They found that the coal plants released 15 to 20 percent more particulate matter during the 35 days when the government was shut down and EPA enforcement officers were furloughed. When the shutdown ended and the inspectors returned to their jobs, emissions returned to pre-shutdown levels. The findings were robust even though the researchers controlled for changes in weather, use of more polluting coal varieties, and other factors. That suggests that the plants were less likely to operate their pollution controls when they knew they were unlikely to get caught.

“The only possibility is a temporary change of the end-of-pipe pollution abatement device,” said Ruohao Zhang, a professor at Penn State and lead author of the study, which was published last month. Zhang and his colleagues relied on data reported by the coal plant operators to the EPA as well as satellite data from NASA. They examined particulate matter levels in a 1.8-mile radius around the coal plants.

While Zhang was not able to comment on the legality of such moves on the operators’ part, he said that it indicated there was a higher possibility of a violation. The current shutdown creates similar incentives as the last time around, he said. “Now without the EPA’s watching, this increased possibility [of being cited for violating environmental laws] is no longer there,” he said.

Researchers found a similar trend in the spring and summer of 2020 during the COVID-19 shutdown. At the time, the EPA announced that facilities that weren’t able to monitor and report their emissions would be excused from compliance. Companies took the EPA up on the offer. Self-reported data from polluting facilities showed that companies conducted 40 percent fewer emission tests at smokestacks in March and April of 2020 compared to the same time period in 2019. American University researchers also found that counties with six or more polluting facilities reporting to the EPA saw a 14 percent increase in particulate matter pollution after the EPA announced its enforcement policy in 2020.

Shutdowns ultimately send the message that nobody is watching, said Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, a nonprofit founded by former EPA enforcement staffers.

“It means that communities may be more exposed to pollution,” she said, “if companies do break the laws, and there’s no one from EPA working to be able to respond.”

The EPA’s regional offices each have about 18 staffers dedicated to handling each of the three main enforcement areas: air, water, and hazardous waste and toxics. Chen estimated that roughly 600 EPA employees were responsible for enforcement at the regional level. In part, these employees supervise the many environmental enforcement activities delegated to individual states. Additionally, the EPA has also assigned staff to enforce environmental laws in consultation with tribes, since many federally recognized tribes haven’t been granted authority to implement environmental laws.

The near-complete halt of inspections and case processing activities is likely to have significant implications for the EPA’s enforcement work. For one, any administrative settlements the agency might want to enter into with a polluter are contingent on utilizing evidence not more than a year old, unless the agency secures a waiver from the Justice Department. As a result, staff tend to front-load the work at the beginning of the fiscal year, which starts October 1, Chen said. But given that they’ve been furloughed for the past several weeks, it “makes it very difficult timing-wise to do some sort of administrative settlements to get a quick resolution on certain things,” Chen said.

The furloughs are the latest setback to hit EPA staff. The Trump administration has conducted multiple rounds of layoffs and offered buyouts to workers this year. While it’s unclear exactly how many EPA enforcement staffers were let go or resigned, the EPA is in the process of reducing its headcount by nearly 25 percent. The Department of Justice, or DOJ, has also lost at least 4,500 workers to layoffs and buyouts. As a result, the Justice Department’s environmental enforcement arm has shrunk by about half.

Once the EPA identifies environmental violations, the Justice Department pursues cases against polluters and enters into legal settlements with them. According to an analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project first reported by the Washington Post, the DOJ has brought just nine major civil cases against polluters in the first eight months of the Trump administration. That’s a major decrease compared to Trump’s first term, when the DOJ brought 53 cases during the same time period.

An EPA spokesperson told the Post that the number of civil cases did not reflect relaxed enforcement on the Trump administration’s part, citing other metrics in which she claimed Trump had outperformed the Biden administration, but Duggan, the Environmental Integrity Project’s executive director, disagreed.

“That’s a significant slowdown of the enforcement process,” she said. “If you are cutting the staff that are doing that job, you know that’s going to have an impact.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2245219147-e1762813265453.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-11 10:02:47.039778

COP30 is taking place from November 6-21 in Brazil as leaders debate how to prevent runaway global warming, protect communities from climate impacts, and leverage creative solutions to the climate crisis.

Do Lago added that both countries have embraced climate action ""in a very clear way"" and are driving down the cost of clean technologies worldwide; and have ""embraced this agenda in an extraordinary way"" by combining scale, technology, and affordability, the three crucial ingredients that have accelerated the world's progress towards cleaner energy systems.

“China has very advanced technology and scale that can only be compared to India. India, too, has brilliant engineers and companies moving in the same direction,” he said.

Do Lago credited China’s leadership in electric vehicles (EVs), solar panels, wind energy, and battery manufacturing for sharply lowering the global cost of clean technologies.

“If solar panels now cost 90% less than a few years ago, it’s thanks to this scale. It allows developing nations to access clean power more easily,” he said.

The COP30 summit, marking 10 years since the Paris Agreement, is being held amid geopolitical tensions, wars, and economic uncertainties, including trade measures by the US. Many developed nations are reconsidering their climate commitments, making this year’s talks crucial to rebuilding trust in global cooperation.

Countries are also expected to present their new climate action targets (NDCs) for 2031–2035, underlining how they plan to cut emissions and adapt to climate change.

With global temperatures already up 1.3°C since pre-industrial times, the latest UN Emissions Gap Report warns that current policies could lead to 2.8°C of warming by 2100.

At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, Dinesh Bhatia, Indian Ambassador to Brazil, reaffirmed India’s commitment to the Paris Agreement and multilateralism.

In Framingham, Massachusetts, that unlikely team has created something pretty cool: a neighborhood heating and cooling system powered by the Earth itself.

As PBS NewsHour reported, it's a first-in-the-nation project that delivers cleaner comfort and even saves folks money.

The magic is networked geothermal. Forget drilling a pricey well for every single house. This setup uses a one-mile loop of underground pipes connecting about three dozen homes and town buildings to shared boreholes, according to PBS NewsHour.

These pipes tap into the ground's super-stable temperature — always around 55 degrees Fahrenheit, year-round, at the depths used.

So, how does that heat your house in winter? The International Renewable Energy Agency explained that geothermal simply extracts heat from below ground. Fluid circulates in those shared pipes, soaking up the Earth's warmth when it's cold out or dumping excess heat when it's hot.

This fluid then feeds into electric heat pumps in each building. Heat pumps are already smart movers of heat. Tying them into that steady 55-degree network means they work way less hard than battling freezing or scorching outside air, saving a bunch of electricity.

Just ask Carol Canova, a retired teacher in the pilot program.

""I'd never been in a house that every place in the house was the same temperature,"" she told PBS NewsHour.

She worried about electric bills but found ""it's overall cheaper"" than gas. Getting the system installed for free felt incredible.

""When Eversource offered it, I thought, you know what, this is like winning the lottery,"" Canova said.

This whole idea actually bubbled up from the activists. PBS NewsHour detailed how the nonprofit Home Energy Efficiency Team was initially focused on fixing ancient, leaky gas pipes. Then came the light bulb moment: Why not swap leaky gas lines for pipes filled with Earth-warmed water?

HEET director Zeybeb Magavi pitched the concept of gas companies becoming ""thermal utilities"" to the local provider, Eversource. Facing state climate goals, the utility agreed to the pilot.

It's a smart way to use a reliable, clean energy source. IRENA noted geothermal's low cost and 24/7 reliability — a big plus compared to sun or wind power. Because nothing's burning, it avoids air pollution that harms our health. This networked idea isn't the only geothermal innovation happening.

Companies like Sage Geosystems are cleverly using old oil wells and drilling tech for clean power, even exploring energy storage for the Pentagon at Fort Bliss in Texas.

Another company, Rodatherm, is testing a closed-loop system in Utah that skips fracking and groundwater use altogether.

In Framingham, the project is working so well that PBS NewsHour reported plans are set to double its size next year.

""The Rondo Heat Battery is now proven at industrial scale,"" said CEO Eric Trusiewicz, per Electrek.","A California oil facility just hit a major clean-energy milestone, and it could reshape how factories, refineries, and other heavy industries stay powered.

Rondo Energy has switched on what it says is the world's largest industrial heat battery, proving that solar power can now deliver the extremely high heat required to run industrial operations around the clock.

According to Electrek, it is located at a Holmes Western Oil facility in California, and the 100-megawatt-hour system is charged entirely by an onsite solar array.

During the day, the Rondo Heat Battery stores energy in ultra-durable bricks; at night, it releases that heat to produce constant, high-pressure steam.

After 10 weeks of daily operation, the system has already surpassed expectations, hitting over 97% efficiency and delivering temperatures above 1,000°C (1,832°F). That's the heat equivalent of about 10,000 home heating systems.

Because the heat battery plugs into the facility's existing infrastructure, it can supply steam through the same pipes used by gas-fired boilers, meaning no costly retrofits.

By replacing natural gas with solar energy, the technology could help facilities avoid volatile fuel prices and slash climate-warming pollution.

Industrial heat drives more than 25% of global energy use, so this breakthrough has enormous potential. Methane, a byproduct of dirty fuel extraction and burning, is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide at heating the planet, so reducing its release can slow the rate of rising global temperatures.

""The Rondo Heat Battery is now proven at industrial scale,"" said CEO Eric Trusiewicz, per Electrek. ""Our customers are improving their competitiveness and slashing their carbon emissions at the same time.""

Together, they signal a trend: cleaner tech isn't just for homes and EVs anymore — it's rapidly transforming big industry, too.

For everyday people, smaller-scale solutions offer similar benefits, from community solar savings to energy-efficient upgrades at home.

Installing solar panels is one of the ultimate home energy hacks — in many cases, it can bring your energy bill down to near $0.

EnergySage provides a free service that lets you compare quotes from vetted local installers and save up to $10,000 on solar.

Going solar also makes running other energy-efficient appliances, like heat pumps, even cheaper.

New data centers capable of delivering AI compute services use large amounts of electricity.

Existing infrastructure is struggling to keep pace with accelerating data center demand.

Microgrids can ease demand on the grid and provide new data centers with a reliable source of electricity.

Data center developers can use microgrids and partnerships with experts to address the demand for power and related challenges.

For the first time in decades, electricity demand is set to increase (Figure 1). Data centers play a big role in this new demand and bring some novel strains to power providers and transmission businesses.

New power demand is cropping up in unexpected places — exurban areas with good telecom fiber and affordable land in the US mid-Atlantic states and sparsely populated West Texas, where crypto miners have set up to take advantage of remote, abundant renewable power from wind turbines — where utilities and administrators have not planned to add infrastructure. Traditional power generation, transmission and delivery models are not well-suited to respond to power demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

The impact of this mismatch goes beyond delayed projects and server shortages. Electricity bills for customers in the regional grid known as the PJM Interconnection territory were projected to climb 20% as utilities grapple with data centers getting built faster than power plants. PJM covers 13 US states from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland to Illinois and Tennessee. It is the largest US power grid and home to a huge and growing concentration of data centers.

Figure 1. Demand for power forecast to increase

Whether it’s AI or other uses such as cryptocurrency mining, demand from future data centers will be spiky and sporadic. Aligning the long planning cycle for building new conventional power generation and transmission with the quick hype cycle of technology is challenging. Utilities have reasons to be skeptical that today’s forecasted AI demand will actually develop into tomorrow’s steady ratepayers.

Data centers demand high reliability and uninterrupted power. Their developers should find ways to bring their own energy sources. Intelligent microgrids, developed in concert with new data centers, offer localized generation, backup power, and energy optimization. According to Bloom Energy, about 30% of new data center sites are expected to incorporate microgrids or similar onsite power solutions into their designs by 2030. This marks a greater than twofold increase from just seven months prior. What’s more, microgrid systems also support peak shaving — reducing electricity usage in periods of high demand to lower costs — and load management, which will curb demand and manage prices downward, they argue. Further, AI tools can be used to forecast demand and even accelerate planning for new generation sources and interconnections.

The shape and benefits of microgrids

A microgrid is a localized energy system capable of operating independently or in coordination with the main utility grid. It typically includes a combination of distributed energy resources such as solar photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, energy storage systems (such as batteries), and conventional energy resources. These components are integrated with control systems that manage energy generation, storage, and distribution.

Developers can design microgrids to enhance power stability, energy resilience, and sustainability. One of their key advantages is the ability to “island”— that is, to disconnect from the main grid and continue operating autonomously during grid outages or disturbances. This makes them particularly valuable in areas prone to natural disasters or where grid reliability is a concern.

Progress to mainstream

Microgrids have advanced from pilot projects and niche solutions into a mainstream solution for energy resilience, sustainability and decentralization.

By integrating renewable energy generation sources, microgrids reduce dependency on centralized fossil-fuel-based power generation. They also support energy independence, allowing communities or facilities to manage their own energy needs more efficiently. Initiatives are operating in the New England state of Vermont and on an island in American Samoa.

Because microgrids are designed to operate connected to and independently from the main grid, they require more advanced control systems. Advanced control systems enable real-time monitoring, load balancing, and predictive maintenance. These systems often use AI or ML for predictive control, digital twins for simulation, and edge computing for fast local decisions. The dual operating structure of microgrids requires these capabilities, but they also deliver optimized performance and cost savings.

Traditional grids are evolving to incorporate advanced control systems, especially as they become smarter and more decentralized. But the deployment is less uniform and often slower due to legacy infrastructure and regulatory constraints.

In contrast, modern microgrids are gaining momentum thanks to the development of high-grade controllers. These controllers go beyond basic automation and enable real-time decision-making based on live data, optimization around multiple variables, predictive analytics, adaptive control and the capability to integrate a mix of assets, including traditional power sources, renewable energy and long-term power storage batteries (Figure 2).

Microgrids offer benefits in both urban and rural settings. In urban areas, they support grid modernization and decarbonization goals. In remote or underserved regions such as islands in the South Pacific, they provide access to reliable electricity where traditional grid infrastructure is lacking or economically unfeasible. With the rise of smart grid technologies and digital energy management software platforms such as Advanced Distribution Management Systems (ADMS) and Distributed Energy Resources Management System (DERMS), microgrids are becoming more intelligent and adaptive.

In Northern California, the Blue Lake Rancheria Native American tribe partnered with the Schatz Energy Research Center and engineering group Siemens to develop a microgrid using solar photovoltaic panels and battery backups. The system helps the Blue Lake Rancheria reduce energy costs and serves as an emergency source of power for the remote community, some 300 miles north of San Francisco Bay.

Regional drivers

On a regional basis, a variety of triggers have compelled further microgrid development around the globe (Figure 3).

In Asia, microgrid development is driven by electrification needs in remote villages as well as in new industrial parks and newly developing cities. India, China, Indonesia and the Philippines lead the way.

In North America, energy resilience is a primary driver and has been implemented at hospitals, military bases, college campuses, and data centers. The case for resilience has been particularly compelling in California and Texas. Even with rollbacks of government incentives, locations rich in distributed renewable energy generation continue to pursue microgrid development.

Europe’s decarbonization goals and national interests in energy independence are driving renewable-powered microgrid development. European microgrids are frequently used for urban energy sharing and electric vehicle charging hubs. Germany, the Netherlands and the Nordic nations are leaders in microgrids.

In Africa, energy access and rural electrification drive microgrid development. This is often backed by non-governmental organizations, development agencies and national governments to put solar-powered microgrids to work in previously off-grid communities.

In Latin America, microgrid demand is driven by the need to increase resilience and recovery and to supply electricity in remote regions. Hybrid microgrids that use solar and diesel have been deployed in islands and mountainous areas. Brazil, Chile and Caribbean nations lead the way.

What microgrids deliver for data centers

A microgrid tailored for a data center can enhance reliability, uptime, and resilience, by switching into island mode when the main power source endures an outage.. It also can address demand and sustainability challenges that are growing in response to rapid data center expansion.

Microgrids can help data center operators manage their power profile, or what and where they source energy for the data center. This requires smart integration with distributed energy resources and coordination with the regional grid. Then, microgrid operators can engage in use-specific monitoring, management, and automation of grid and data center activities.

Infosys and partners have developed a microgrid on Singapore’s Jurong Island that uses a cloud-based energy management system to monitor and manage electricity usage there. The system monitors power demand and helps manage electric load for the island with the support of long-term energy storage batteries.

This is particularly relevant when one considers the nature of compute demands in the data centers of tomorrow. AI-driven demand in future data centers will come in sudden spikes, often driven by automated digital processes.

An integrated microgrid like the one on Jurong Island can profile power loads and forecast future demand. This is one way a microgrid can optimize energy costs and reduce grid strain. Further, an integrated microgrid with monitoring and management can itself be automated to keep pace with the dynamic power demands of data centers. In markets with competitive power pricing, energy management systems can be deployed to automatically switch between grid, solar, and battery.

Integration and coordination will be a site-to-site consideration, depending on the variety of distributed energy resources, (solar, wind, battery storage, and even electric vehicles) and adjacent regional grid or demand.

In developing microgrids with major utilities, Infosys has developed a method to integrate electric vehicles as occasional or last-resort power sources for grid and data center. To be sure, this sort of vehicle-to-grid technology is not yet widely deployed and is dependent on policy development and standards. But once those factors mature, the reference architecture is ready to go, with cybersecurity and governance requirements already in place.

In our experience, the best approach to optimizing energy costs in a microgrid involves economic modeling, robust digital integration, and smart operational practices. By coordinating energy resources with the grid, a configurable cloud-based energy monitoring platform optimizes the cost of energy.

Infosys and BP have in partnership developed an energy-as-a-service (EaaS) solution that is being used by a leading German airport to support energy efficiency. The platform has the potential to implement use cases like demand response in microgrids.

Microgrids at macro scale

In the future, imagine a collection of digitally integrated and configurable microgrids, operating adjacent to each other and linked via an interoperable infrastructure. This is reflected in the digital energy grid concept articulated by Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani. In India, this concept could soon earn governmental support, driven by a desire to reduce power costs and increase reliability.

Taken to its full extent, a digital energy grid composed of multiple microgrids, along with other generation, transmission, and distribution assets, could turn every home with solar panels or another distributed power generation source into an energy market participant. In theory, this would reduce costs and increase reliability.

Digital interoperability and automation, driven by AI, can then manage and optimize microgrid energy resources by forecasting demand, scheduling distribution, and balancing supply and demand dynamically in real time. Here, microgrids at a macro scale would improve resilience and efficiency.

As articulated by Nilekani and the Foundation for Interoperability in a Digital Economy, digitizing and decentralizing the grid aims to reduce energy generation, transmission, and distribution costs significantly (up to 25%), encouraging more microgrid deployments and local energy entrepreneurship.

Development resilience, consider cost options

Data center developers can use renewables and battery storage in a microgrid to address demand for power and related challenges. This enhances resilience, improves quality and load balancing, reduces costs, and lowers the carbon footprint.

Cost considerations for the development of a data center microgrid should be viewed through a pair of familiar spending lenses: capital expenditures versus operational expenditures. The CapEx front includes installation, interconnection with grid, permitting and financing. The OpEx side focuses on ongoing costs including operations, monitoring, maintenance and repairs, and software and technology costs.

With that view established, data center developers can consider different ownership or partnership models. An EaaS model would shift some critical upfront CapEx to the OpEx side.

They can also consider a middle path for development: Own the microgrid, but cede operational control to expert partners. Such partnerships make it easier to participate in power markets and potentially save further on costs.

For example, the government of Montgomery County, Maryland, partnered with utility provider Duke Energy to build a microgrid system designed to enhance resilience and reduce carbon footprint. The project uses an EaaS model and was built with no upfront cost to the county.

Microgrids coupled with renewable energy generation sources enable data center developers to reduce dependence on centralized fossil fuel-based power generation, increase resilience, and head off emerging community concerns of data centers’ thirst for power.

Inslee was speaking to DW from Rio de Janeiro, where he was taking part in pre-COP events last week ahead of the main climate talks.
""The United States have not pulled out of Paris.
""[Trump] often talks and makes a lot of noise, but he cannot stop us moving forward,"" said Inslee.
Through their participation at COP, McCarthy told attendees in Rio that local leaders were looking to build partnerships and inform negotiations in Belem.","Washington will not be sending a top-level team to this year's COP climate summit in Belem, Brazil.

The global community expected as much from a president who has pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement for the second time, slashed funding for renewable energy, championed fossil fuel projects and told world leaders at the UN in September that climate change is the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

But delegates from Washington state, along with governors, mayors and other representatives from states and cities across the US, are determined to pick up the slack. Together, they represent about two-thirds of the US population and produce nearly three-quarters of the country's economic output.

""It's a long way to come from Seattle to Rio, but I made the trip, and others made the trip, because it's important for the rest of the world not to give up on the United States,"" said Jay Inslee, the former Democratic governor of Washington. Inslee was speaking to DW from Rio de Janeiro, where he was taking part in pre-COP events last week ahead of the main climate talks.

""The United States have not pulled out of Paris. One part of the United States has, and that's the federal government,"" said Inslee, a founding member of the US Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of governors that includes 23 states and one territory. The group was spurred into action during the first Trump presidency in 2017.

""It's very important that we not allow a misperception to exist that somehow progress has stopped because we have a bloviating, anti-wind turbine, climate-denying narcissist in the White House. That's a very important message, I think, for the world to give them confidence to move forward.""

Will Trump's tariff diplomacy derail COP?

While Trump's team is not expected in Belem, some observers are concerned the president could disrupt the negotiations from afar.

""The Trump administration is exerting pressure on the talks through the impact of its tariff policy,"" said Maha Rafi Atal, an associate professor in political economy at the University of Glasgow. She told DW in an email how the president has tried to encourage the European Union to exempt US companies from the EU's carbon border tax, in exchange for concessions on tariffs.

""The signal sent to countries around the world is that the US may penalize in trade terms countries that take stronger climate action,"" said Atal. She added that Trump's hostility to climate action could see other countries ""less willing to prioritize emissions reductions over economic growth"" and funding the energy transition.

""Yes, the [US] federal government may continue to be disruptive,"" said Gina McCarthy, co-chair of America Is All In (AIAI), a climate action coalition, in an email. ""Our delegation is focused on what we know for sure: local leaders and businesses across the United States are pressing forward on clean energy and are eager to collaborate with international partners to strengthen the Paris Agreement.""

Local efforts add up

More than 100 subnational leaders from the US Climate Alliance, Climate Mayors and AIAI — representing state and city officials as well as tribal nations, businesses, schools and other institutions — are taking part in the high-stakes negotiations in the Amazon, which run from November 10 to 21.

While many of the decisions at COP shape how nations tackle climate change at the federal level, the local leaders believe the US, the world's second-biggest polluter after China, can still meet the goals of the 2015 Paris accord and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. Even with Trump boosting oil and gas projects, which contribute significantly to global warming.

""[Trump] often talks and makes a lot of noise, but he cannot stop us moving forward,"" said Inslee. ""Yes, he has reduced some of our federal efforts, but we retain the ability to control our own destiny in these states and cities.""

In fact, an analysis released by AIAI last month shows that expanded climate action on the local level, along with renewed support from Washington after 2028 — when Trump is due to leave office — could see the US reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 56% below 2005 levels by 2035. Under the Biden administration, the US 2035 pledge was to cut net emissions by up to 66%.

Many of those reductions in the coming years would come from local policy changes in three key areas: electricity, transportation and reducing methane emissions from leaky gas infrastructure and organic waste.

""Our findings show that innovative local policies and market-driven clean technology investments can keep the US on a path toward significant emissions reductions, even in challenging times,"" said Nate Hultman, director at the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, which led the study.

'Change happens from the bottom up'

Speaking at the COP30 Local Leaders Forum last week, McCarthy — a climate adviser for the Biden administration and former head of the Environmental Protection Agency — told attendees that ""change happens from the bottom up.""

She said local efforts were ""leading the charge on clean energy,"" pointing out that the 24 states in the US Climate Alliance had already managed to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emission by 24% below 2005 levels, while increasing their GDP by 34%.

""They're supported by the majority of Americans that want their leaders to lower energy costs, protect public health and create jobs,"" McCarthy told DW.

Inslee, whose policies on clean energy, energy-efficient building and low-emission transportation as governor of Washington from 2013 to 2025 helped shape Joe Biden's approach to climate change, said job creation and economic growth could go hand-in-hand with reducing emissions.

Even in states like Texas, which is not a part of the US Climate Alliance, renewable energy is taking off because, as Inslee put it, Americans ""want cheaper sources of energy."" Texas, where voters backed Trump in the last three elections, leads the US when it comes to the development of renewable energy generation and battery capacity. Average electricity prices in the southern state are among the lowest in the country, according to August data from the US Energy Information Administration, a government agency.

Through their participation at COP, McCarthy told attendees in Rio that local leaders were looking to build partnerships and inform negotiations in Belem.

""We have power, we have agency, we have authority, and damn it, we are going to use it!"" she said to applause.

The United States has stepped back from global climate commitments, Europe is tied down by slow growth and political hesitation, and yet many fast-growing economies are accelerating their shift to clean energy. The momentum is coming from countries that once argued they were too poor to transition quickly. They are now adopting renewable energy at a pace that few expected, the New York Times reported.

How cheap Chinese technology is driving the shift

China has rapidly expanded production of solar panels, wind turbines and electric-vehicle batteries, to the point where its domestic market no longer absorbs everything it makes. The result is a flood of low-cost equipment flowing to countries hungry for energy security. From Vietnam and Brazil to Nigeria and Nepal, Chinese factories and exports are enabling governments to add clean power at prices they could not match before. This is turning China into the key industrial force behind the world’s renewable rollout.

Why emerging economies are seizing the moment

Many developing countries now see renewables as the fastest way to cut their dependence on imported fossil fuels. Nations like Ethiopia and Nepal are leapfrogging straight into electric mobility by slashing taxes on battery-powered vehicles and restricting petrol-car imports. Brazil is using tariffs to force Chinese carmakers to build electric-vehicle plants locally. Morocco has carved out a role as a battery-manufacturing hub for Europe. These shifts reflect both economic urgency and a new confidence in cleaner technologies.

India’s role in this changing landscape

India arrived at COP30 pointing to major progress. Half of its electricity demand can now be met by wind, solar and hydropower, and it reached its Paris Agreement targets years ahead of schedule. Even though India is cautious about relying on Chinese imports, it is adopting elements of China’s industrial strategy by offering incentives for domestic solar manufacturing and large-scale renewable expansion. This combination of economic self-interest and climate ambition has strengthened India’s influence at the summit.

Why this is not the full solution

Despite the rapid rise in clean energy, these countries still depend heavily on coal, oil and gas. India and China continue to build coal plants, Indonesia remains a major coal exporter and Brazil plans to expand offshore oil production. The new renewable capacity does not erase these realities. Instead, it shows how complex the transition will be: a blend of fossil fuels that still anchor many economies and renewables that are now growing too fast to ignore.

How China’s dominance is unsettling the West

With Chinese exports of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries hitting record levels, the United States and Europe worry about being outcompeted in industries they hoped to lead. Yet at COP30, many emerging nations show little interest in this geopolitical rivalry. For them,

cheaper green technology means faster development and lower energy bills. They see China less as a threat and more as the supplier that finally made renewables affordable.

Why the world’s climate strategy now looks different

A decade ago, rich nations urged developing countries to curb emissions, promising financial help that never fully arrived. Today, the economics have flipped. Clean energy is no longer held back by high prices or limited supply. For many governments, it is now the cheapest growth path available. That shift is changing who drives progress, who sets the pace and where climate leadership might emerge next.

The bottom line

China’s industrial surge has unexpectedly empowered emerging economies to expand renewable energy faster than ever before. While it has not solved the climate crisis, it has altered the global map of influence. At COP30, the countries once seen as obstacles to climate action are increasingly shaping the world’s transition, on their own terms and with their own priorities.",https://images.moneycontrol.com/static-mcnews/2022/07/industrial-investment.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 12:08:10.470416

A key highlight of the draft is the elevation of environmental protection to a central mission alongside economic and social progress, signalling a new and comprehensive understanding of sustainability in the current context.

Harmonising economic growth with environmental protection, or safeguarding the environment to ensure sustainable economic development, is considered the cornerstone of lasting prosperity. From this perspective, the Party affirms that environmental protection is a central and inseparable task closely tied to economic and social development.

Vietnam’s policies and international commitments make clear that the transition toward a green, circular, and low-carbon economy is the pathway to sustainable development. It is essential to abandon short-term, profit-driven approaches that neglect environmental responsibilities and to remain steadfast in the principle of not sacrificing the environment for economic gain.

Commenting on the draft, Dr. Truong Ba kien, Deputy Director of the Centre for Meteorology and Climatology under the Institute of Meteorology, Hydrology and Climate Change at Ministry of Agriculture and Environment, emphasised that the inclusion of environmental protection and climate adaptation is both timely and necessary, aligning with Vietnam’s real-world challenges. He noted that proactive and effective adaptation to climate change is a trend that Vietnam must continue to pursue in the years ahead.

To enhance resilience to extreme weather and climate-related disasters, relevant agencies need to comprehensively upgrade real-time forecasting and early warning systems, integrating meteorological, hydrological, radar, and reservoir data. The use of AI, Big Data, and ensemble modelling will help detect hazardous weather patterns early. Multi-channel public alerts, regular drills, and inter-regional coordination mechanisms should also be strengthened.

In parallel, Vietnam should standardise and expand inter-reservoir operations, improve dam safety monitoring, and promote reforestation. Developing flood and landslide risk maps using satellite data and LiDAR technology will support evidence-based planning. Building green infrastructure such as water-absorbent urban systems, maintaining natural floodways, and ensuring data sharing across regions are also crucial to balancing development with watershed safety.

Localities are urged to integrate climate adaptation into regional and provincial planning, establish AI- and IoT-based early warning systems, and enhance climate risk management capacity for local authorities. Promoting nature-based and green development models and nurturing a culture of preparedness will help build safer, more resilient communities.

According to Dr. Mai Van Khiem, Director of the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, Vietnam must continue modernising its observation technologies, expanding monitoring networks, and applying artificial intelligence to improve forecasting accuracy, particularly for extreme weather events. He also underlined the need for clear, concise, and accessible communication to ensure early warnings reach vulnerable communities.

Strengthened coordination between meteorological agencies, local governments, disaster response units, and media outlets is vital to translating forecasts into effective action. Public education and training in disaster preparedness should be expanded, with climate and environmental awareness integrated into school curricula.

Le Thi Dinh, Secretary of Xuan Non hamlet Party Cell in Hanoi' Thu Lam commune, noted that recognising environmental protection as a core development pillar provides a new benchmark for all socio-economic policies. However, genuine sustainability must start with each individual’s mindset and daily actions, from planting trees and flowers to embracing broader goals such as green transformation and green economy. She also stressed the importance of environmental education at all levels to foster a “green living” consciousness among citizens, laying the groundwork for a sustainable and resilient future./.",https://mediaen.vietnamplus.vn/images/f579a678cf9e90879541752073c26005bbdf424920f6f51bdadd19a62ab9b8e6ba30af0c1e85f530b954163111f7924330116700e000fe3ddc5f5058dbf64d4c/0603-khi-hau.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-11 03:59:46.246248

A singular narrative of the energy transition fails to capture its real complexity. What we are witnessing is not one transition, but many – each shaped by local context, political priorities, industrial base, and societal expectations.

Some countries are doubling down on electrification and renewables, while others are charting different but equally valid paths. For instance, Brazil has made significant progress by leveraging its long-standing investment in biofuels and hydropower, which now account for a large share of its energy mix, with renewables meeting almost 45% of primary energy demand. In just four years, initiatives in India, such as bulb exchange programs and large-scale procurement tenders, helped increase its LED lighting market share from 10-15% to 75%. China is investing heavily in innovation and industrial scale. In recent years, the country has allocated between $4bn and $6bn annually to clean energy research and development, helping build a solar industry that not only leads the world in installed capacity but sets the pace in technological advancement.

These examples highlight that clean energy strategies should align with each country’s natural resource endowment, development stage, and economic priorities. In some cases, distributed solutions are more appropriate than centralized systems. In others, decarbonizing heavy industry or transport may take precedence over power generation. The paths are diverse, but the ambition is shared: to build energy systems that are cleaner, fairer, more secure, and aligned with long-term economic growth. Recognizing and supporting this diversity is key to achieving meaningful global progress.

As the above examples indicate, energy has become a strategic variable that influences everything from investor confidence to supply chain viability. The companies and countries that act rapidly on it will define the next generation of economic leadership. They will turn volatility into resilience, fragmentation into collaboration, and policy uncertainty into strategic clarity. For emerging economies, this is a moment of opportunity – one that, if seized, can redefine their role in the global economy for decades to come.

Emerging markets: catalysts for the future of energy

Despite capital constraints, several emerging markets are establishing themselves as leaders in energy innovation and showcasing unique energy transition pathways. They are not only expanding renewable capacity but investing in next-generation infrastructure, clean industrial solutions, and competitive technology ecosystems.

Brazil: Innovating with biofuels and green digital infrastructure

Brazil has long been a pioneer in bioenergy, and it’s aiming to take the lead in next-generation biofuels. It has launched the world’s largest cellulosic ethanol facility and is advancing biofuel technologies that can fully substitute fossil diesel. Rio de Janeiro recently launched “AI City”, a 1.5GW data hub that employs waterless cooling and offsets its power use with Brazil’s robust hydropower supply – offering a new model for sustainable digital infrastructure.

China: Scaling with speed and resilience

Clean energy accounted for over 10% of China’s gross domestic product in 2024, surpassing real estate and agriculture. Despite rising trade barriers in Europe and North America, China’s EV manufacturers pivoted quickly to markets like Mexico, Brazil, and the UAE. Government subsidies, intense domestic competition, and surging internal demand enabled EV production to grow by a third last year, with EVs making up 41% of new vehicle sales. Innovation remains relentless. For example, BYD’s new battery offers a 400km range on a five-minute charge.

India: Advancing an inclusive and resilient transition

India is growing its renewable capacity faster than several other major economies. Wind and solar installations have nearly doubled in five years. To meet its 2070 net-zero target, the country is accelerating battery energy storage, building industrial green hydrogen clusters, and upgrading transmission infrastructure. It’s also focusing on inclusive growth by extending grid access, improving energy efficiency, and stabilizing its coal-dominated electricity mix as demand rises by an expected 35% by 2030.

Southeast Asia: Turning resources into regional strength

The region is home to vast renewable potential and key mineral reserves like nickel, copper, and rare earth elements. With supportive regulation and investment, Southeast Asia could meet two-thirds of its electricity needs from renewables by 2050. Regional energy integration is advancing: ASEAN has revived the ASEAN Power Grid project, with Malaysia and Indonesia restarting a long-stalled cross-border interconnection initiative.

Nigeria: Powering up with renewables and reform

Nigeria is making tangible strides toward becoming a clean-energy hub, rising from 109th place in 2016 to 61st in this year’s ETI. Driven by major advances in investment capacity, infrastructure development, and regulatory reform, the country is gaining increasing attention on the global stage. In 2024, it added between 63.5 MW and 73 MW of new solar capacity – bringing its cumulative installed solar power to around 385.7 MW – and ranking it among Africa’s top installers.

Four ways to unlock strategic business advantage

Companies and investors must bear in mind that the energy transition goes beyond procurement or compliance – it is a source of long-term strategic advantage. Unlocking that advantage depends on recognizing the scale of transformation underway and aligning business action with the emerging realities of varied transitions, evolving technologies, and complex market dynamics. Here are four actions business leaders can take:

1. Reframe growth markets

Emerging economies are driving innovation in energy, pioneering policy reforms, and shaping industrial strategies. Markets like China, India, Brazil, and parts of Southeast Asia are leading in clean energy deployment, digital grid reform, and sector-specific solutions such as green hydrogen and biofuels.

These economies are shaping the technology pathways of the future and will increasingly influence global standards, supply chains, and capital flows. This presents an opportunity for businesses to update their models of risk and value: growth markets are not just where demand will come from – they are where a significant part of the future is being built.

2. Close the capital gap

There is a $2.2tn annual investment shortfall in clean energy standing between emerging economies and a viable energy transition. This is more than just a funding need – it’s a significant commercial opportunity.

Southeast Asia alone could generate $300bn in green revenue over the next five years, with the potential for 5.8 million new jobs by 2050. Findings from the Energy Transition Index 2025 highlight other regions that are showing encouraging signs of momentum and emerging investment potential. For example, Mozambique’s resurgence as an emerging energy player underscores what is possible when regulatory reform, infrastructure development, and strategic capital allocation align effectively. China leads in innovation and investment, having made substantial progress. It remains the world’s largest clean energy investor, contributing over $818bn to global investment in 2024. With the highest renewable capacity additions and the majority of new nuclear projects, China is also scaling energy infrastructure at an unmatched pace.

De-risking tools, blended finance, sovereign green bonds, and public-private investment platforms should become standard parts of corporate and investor toolkits. Companies that step into this space early can shape markets, secure strategic footholds, and unlock new value pools.

3. Build local capacity and leadership

The energy transition hinges on people, institutions, and localized solutions. Advancing this transition could benefit from prioritizing investments in workforce development and institutional partnerships. Partnerships – whether between companies and universities, public agencies, or local governments – play a critical role in piloting new models, advancing R&D, and building trust with communities. Forward-looking businesses are also collaborating with government stakeholders to modernize permitting processes, standardize clean energy procurement, and de-risk low-carbon investments. These partnerships help ensure that solutions are scalable, socially grounded, and locally relevant.

Additionally, workforce development is critical to bridging the skills gap in clean energy industries. The Energy Transition Index report finds that top-performing countries like Finland, Germany, and China are expanding vocational training and technical education aligned with cleantech industries. India has a program that is preparing a new generation of grid technicians and energy entrepreneurs, building capacity and inclusive access to clean energy jobs. These examples highlight a vital point: human capital is transition capital.

4. Navigate risk with flexibility

Emerging markets are complex and not uniform, but they are where the greatest upside lies. From permitting challenges to policy shifts, the risk landscape is real. But businesses that bring agility and a long-term mindset can draw lasting advantage.

The lesson from leaders across regions is that success depends on adaptive strategies anchored in local reality. This includes understanding sub-national opportunities, responding to regional industrial strengths, and working across public-private lines.

For example, India demonstrates how regional alignment with industrial and labor strengths can accelerate the transition. It has prioritized vocational training and regional workforce development programs that support clean energy deployment. Initiatives such as the Suryamitra Skill Development Program, implemented across solar-rich states, help build local talent pipelines that align with solar manufacturing and deployment clusters.

Likewise, the UAE has adopted a multi-level engagement approach, working across federal and emirate levels to align long-term clean energy goals with regional development. Initiatives such as Masdar City and the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 reflect how targeted local planning and public-private collaboration are central to the country’s energy ambitions. The goal is not to avoid risk, but to manage it deliberately, recognizing not only that different players have different risk tolerances, but that opportunities vary accordingly.

Unlocking the next phase of global competitiveness

The 2025 Energy Transition Index confirms what many forward-looking companies already sense. The momentum of the energy transition is shifting, geographically and strategically. Countries like China, India, Brazil, and Latvia are shaping the frameworks of innovation, equity, and infrastructure that will define global competitiveness in the years ahead.

Emerging economies are establishing their own approaches, not adapting to models set elsewhere, while learning from the successes and challenges faced by others. They are proving that energy transition is not a single path, but many – each shaped by national strengths, industrial priorities, and context. These local models are sources of strategic insight and practical direction for how progress can be achieved across different contexts.

The companies and investors best positioned for the future will align with this momentum by moving capital, talent, and technology into the systems that are already transforming. Building for this future calls for humility, collaboration, and a willingness to learn from the diversity of global experience.

The most successful transitions – whether in emerging or advanced economies – share certain features: clear national targets, stable and supportive policy frameworks, deep public-private collaboration, and innovative financing that de-risks investment and accelerates delivery. These competitive assets enable countries to attract capital, retain talent, and anchor industrial value chains for the long term.

For global companies, this presents a strategic opportunity. Where operating across multiple geographies used to be about scale, it’s now a chance to create synergy between diverse energy systems, to drive cross-border investment, and to help shape the new energy economy from the ground up.

The future of energy is decentralized, digitalized, and deeply strategic. We are witnessing a profound transformation of economic and industrial systems. In this rapidly evolving landscape, resilience will come not from holding on to legacy systems, but from having the agility to navigate complex transitions and the vision to lead them. This transformation is no longer optional – it is the foundation of future growth, industrial leadership, and national relevance.",https://www.imd.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/New-China-darmau-b3e_3ZBgz68-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 10:02:24.540261

As digitalization accelerates exponentially, the ICT sector, particularly telecommunication networks and data centers, is expected to consume even more electricity.
However, while the energy demand from AI is significant, concerns surrounding exponential increases in usage are mitigated by AI’s advancements toward energy efficiency.
Regarding energy consumption, there is a considerable difference between generative AI—large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini—and dedicated AI services.
Only through connectivity and digitalization can we achieve a decarbonized energy system powered by efficient data centers, responsible electricity consumption of AI, and large-scale renewable deployment.","Digitalization is one of the most powerful enablers of the global shift toward cleaner, smarter, and more resilient energy systems. Yet today’s electricity grids were not built for renewable energy. They were built for fewer, centralized sources such as coal-fired plants. Renewable energy is also often distributed across regions, and the power output fluctuates over time, making predictability a challenge.

To decarbonize and phase out fossil fuels, we must electrify heavy industries and the transport sector. We also need more electricity generated from clean sources such as renewables and to eliminate power produced from fossil fuels.

This is why digitalizing electrical grids and the whole electricity sector is vital to create control mechanisms and to optimize grid management that will support these greener energy goals. If we also digitalize all end users and increase data sharing between users, distributors and electricity producers, we can create a true digital energy ecosystem.

In many ways, this is what we already do within the telecommunications sector when we predict network traffic to optimize network management. The same digitalization principles are needed for electrical grids, for which data is key. And collecting the right and necessary amount of data from electrical grids will require advanced connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI).

In recent years, however, many have feared that the information and communications technology (ICT) sector will require large amounts of electricity from the total consumption due to the rapid adoption of AI and the related expansion of data centers. It is important to show fact-based numbers on energy consumption, which is why Ericsson has done extensive research on the electricity consumption of the ICT sector, AI, and data centers.

As global leaders meet in Brazil for the latest COP U.N. climate talks, the transition and decarbonization of energy, manufacturing and transport sectors – as well as the role of renewable energy deployment – will be key priorities. Countries will present their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), which are climate action plans reaching from 2025 until 2035 to achieve the Paris agenda. These will set the pace for the climate transition for the coming years.

Will digitalization further increase energy consumption?

Understanding the true energy impact of digitalization is essential for informed policymaking and investment. As digitalization accelerates exponentially, the ICT sector, particularly telecommunication networks and data centers, is expected to consume even more electricity. Yet this rise will likely be far smaller than many reports suggest. What remains uncertain is how fast AI services and technologies will evolve.

Looking back, most ICT studies have greatly overestimated future electricity usage because they assumed that larger data volumes would proportionally require more electricity to transmit and process the data. However, Ericsson’s own research reveals that while total data traffic has increased by about 80 times between 2007 and 2023, the ICT sector used only 1.4 times more electricity. This means that data transmission and electricity usage are clearly not directly proportionate.

Ericsson has also calculated the estimated electricity usage and potential carbon footprint for the ICT sector, up until 2030. It is expected that overall electricity consumption will continue to increase to approximately 1,245 terawatt-hours (TWh), from about 1,070 TWh in 2024. In recent years, data centers have been identified as the major contributors to the ICT sector’s growing energy consumption, whereas networks have contributed to this growth less.

How much electricity does AI consume?

AI’s overall energy demand is a frequent concern. Current systems use substantial electricity for training purposes and require increasingly powerful hardware. It remains difficult to predict how AI services and technologies will evolve or how energy efficient they will become.

However, while the energy demand from AI is significant, concerns surrounding exponential increases in usage are mitigated by AI’s advancements toward energy efficiency. Ericsson estimates that up to 12 million AI graphics processing units (GPUs) have been in operation at the end of 2023, consuming approximately 21 TWh. This corresponded to approximately 8 percent of the total energy needed for all data centers, and less than 1 percent of the whole ICT sector. By 2028, it is estimated that AI alone will account for approximately 25 percent of the total data center electricity usage. This highlights the urgent need to prioritize energy efficiency in data centers.

Despite the ongoing and predicted rise, AI hardware supply limitations will prevent an exponential increase in energy usage. Additionally, AI chips and other energy-related equipment are becoming more efficient, while new-generation network system standards are gradually incorporating measures related to AI and energy efficiency. Furthermore, deploying new generations of more energy-efficient networks and server systems will allow companies to phase out older and wasteful technologies.

Finally, we need to assess how reliable AI electricity forecasts are. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), AI-related chips have doubled their efficiency every three years, and recent models use 99 percent less power to perform the same calculations as a similar chip from 2008. In addition, the IEA predicts that both servers and AI GPUs will advance with more efficient processors entering the market before 2030.

Regarding energy consumption, there is a considerable difference between generative AI—large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini—and dedicated AI services. Generative AI is trained on large data sets, requiring huge amounts of energy, while more dedicated models with a specific purpose only need smaller data sets for training, meaning a smaller energy footprint and, consequently, a more energy-efficient version of AI.

Let’s look at the European energy sector as an example. Utilities need dedicated and energy-lean AI solutions for grid management and control that could run either through edge computing or in local data centers without relying on the large computing power required for generative AI. Similar solutions and machine learning algorithms are used for network control in telecommunication systems, consuming much less electricity than LLMs.

Why 5G Standalone matters

Decisions on digitalization-related investments and future regulatory policies depend on accurate information and assumptions. The ICT sector’s electricity consumption is an aspect that needs to be considered by utility companies and governments alike, which is why reliable predictions are an important basis for decision-making. These choices are crucial to the successful digital transformation of the energy sector.

As mentioned above, data is key to obtaining the information needed to optimize energy systems and provide functionalities such as AI for grid control and management. Energy-related data needs to flow between end users, distributors, and producers to provide, for example, forecasting, grid management, and flexibility solutions.

Connectivity is critical to obtain this data—and this is where 5G Standalone (SA) becomes so important. In non-standalone 5G, the radio components, such as the base stations, use 5G, while the core relies on legacy 4G technologies. Although this leads to higher speeds and larger bandwidth than 4G, the main advantages of 5G cannot be fully realized

In contrast, 5G SA utilizes 5G base stations and a full 5G core to increase speed and bandwidth. This way, it can support advanced services crucial for the energy sector’s digital transformation and the creation of a future-proof digital ecosystem, including but not limited to network slicing, edge computing, 5G voice, RedCap devices, time-critical communication (TCC), network exposure, and enhanced fixed wireless access (FWA).

In this sense, 5G SA is not just a connectivity upgrade but a foundational technology for the global energy transition.

Conclusion

With COP30, many people now realize that energy and AI should be top of mind. In fact, the host country of COP30, Brazil, decided to present its largely renewable-based energy sector as an opportunity for tech giants looking to establish data centers in the country. This underscores the critical role of connectivity and digital solutions in supporting the green transition of utilities, power grids, transport systems, buildings, and industries. Digital infrastructure needs to be prioritized to help phase out fossil-fuel-based energy sources and decarbonize our societies.

Stable and long-term policy frameworks are crucial for enabling these technologies to reach their full potential, providing the certainty necessary for large-scale investment and innovation. Additionally, the technology sector must continue to develop increasingly energy-efficient data centers, AI solutions, and network architectures, as well as uphold their Net Zero commitments across the entire value chain to keep emissions down.

Digital and connectivity solutions must be seen as equal pillars alongside clean technologies, grids, and renewables. Only through connectivity and digitalization can we achieve a decarbonized energy system powered by efficient data centers, responsible electricity consumption of AI, and large-scale renewable deployment. In short, digitalization is not a byproduct of the energy transition but its backbone.

The original poster explained that while their electric company doesn't offer full one-to-one credit for energy buyback, the panels have still made a massive difference.
""I love being able to crank the heat in our home office during a sunny winter day without any guilt.""
With solar tax credits set to begin expiring at the end of the year, homeowners could save thousands by locking in their installation soon.
I just got solar installed and I'm excited for the savings,"" shared one person.","Going solar can bring you some serious savings, and one homeowner recently took to Reddit to share their first-year results on just how much solar has changed the way they use energy.

The post, shared to the r/solar community, described a 7.3-kilowatt system installed on a home in North Carolina. The original poster explained that while their electric company doesn't offer full one-to-one credit for energy buyback, the panels have still made a massive difference.

""We spent about $12,578 after the federal tax rebate and saved $750 this year,"" they wrote. ""I love being able to crank the heat in our home office during a sunny winter day without any guilt.""

The OP also noted that replacing their old gas-powered furnace and water heater with efficient electric appliances has maximized their savings, with their electricity use dropping by over 600 kilowatt-hours compared to the year prior.

For anyone considering making the switch, going solar is definitely one of the best ways to cut your monthly energy bills and help the planet in the process. Sites like EnergySage can help with free tools that make it a cinch to compare quotes from local installers and see estimated costs in just minutes.

With solar tax credits set to begin expiring at the end of the year, homeowners could save thousands by locking in their installation soon.

And those savings can really add up — with EnergySage's help, the average person can save up to $10,000 on solar panel purchases and installations. Its free mapping tool even breaks down the average costs and available incentives by state, helping you secure the best deal possible.

Buying panels outright may not be in everyone's budget, but leasing them can also help you lock in low, predictable energy rates. Palmetto's LightReach program installs panels on your home for no money down, and pairing your panels with efficient electric appliances like the OP really amplifies the savings. Companies like Mitsubishi make it easy to find the right heat pump and installer for your needs.

Speaking of the OP, commenters on the thread were quick to celebrate their savings.

""Awesome. I just got solar installed and I'm excited for the savings,"" shared one person.

DeMarco notes that those two projects could double-dip by accessing the Canada Growth Fund while also earning investment tax credits without reducing the amount of emissions they claimed.","As Prime Minister Mark Carney’s government moves to spend billions more on tax credits to support clean energy incentives and carbon capture and storage projects, Canada’s environment commissioner says the money already earmarked has not been spent effectively.

A new audit report released last Thursday by Jerry DeMarco said government investments in projects to reduce emissions have been implemented slowly, with far less uptake than predicted.

The report looked at nine measures from Canada’s 2030 Emissions Reductions Plan. Five were investment tax credits and one was a corporate tax break for zero-emission technology manufacturers. The others include the Canada Growth Fund and green bonds.

Collectively, they account for $123 billion in projected costs to taxpayers. The federal budget released Tuesday proposes expanding the availability and extending the lifespan of the carbon capture investment tax credit, projected to cost another $3 billion between 2031 and 2035.

DeMarco said there’s no data to show the impact those investments have had on lowering Canada’s emissions.

“It’s disappointing to see that there isn’t a strong emphasis by the government on estimating the expecting emissions from each tax credit, and as well estimating the value for money for Canadians in these large-scale subsidies,” DeMarco told The Canadian Press.

“We don’t have adequate information from the departments as to the actual expected emissions from each measure. And that’s a theme, not only today, but also our previous audits on the net-zero accelerator (fund) and the emissions reduction plan—two other significant subsidies.”

DeMarco’s report says there was low initial uptake of the tax measures, compared to Finance Canada’s projections.

“For example, fewer than 30 corporations had claimed the corporate tax cut for manufacturers and producers of zero emission technologies since 2022, which was 25% of the projected uptake of $61 million,” the report says.

“For the five Clean Economy investment tax credits that we assessed, the Department of Finance Canada had initially projected that $5.2 billion would be claimed by the end of March 2025. The department’s most recent projections, published in March 2025, forecasted that $9.2 billion is expected to be claimed by the end of 2025.

“However, we found that, as of July 2025, only the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit had claims to be paid out, and those claims totalled only $22 million.”

The report did say taxpayers can still submit claims until the end of the year for the previous three years—so the uptake numbers could change.

“They’re not even pretending to want to meet the 2030 climate target in Ottawa anymore,” said Patrick Bonin, the Bloc Québécois’s climate critic.

“The Liberals prefer wilful blindness, shining the spotlight on 2050 to sweep the dust under the rug. The government must pull itself together and realize that the climate emergency remains.”

DeMarco’s report also says government investment incentives for the oil and gas sector were risky, given the uncertain future of Ottawa’s industrial carbon pricing plan.

“To be effective, investment incentives in both carbon capture, utilization, and storage and low-carbon hydrogen depend on other important climate change policies, such as the industrial carbon pricing system and the Clean Fuel Regulations,” the report says.

“As such, uncertainty in the future of the industrial carbon pricing systems and federal regulations creates risk to the financial viability of private investment in those technologies.”

The federal budget promised to strengthen Ottawa’s industrial carbon pricing system but offered no details on how the government plans to do that.

DeMarco’s report also says that of the $2.7 billion already committed from the Canada Growth Fund—which is meant to support technologies like carbon capture and storage and low-carbon hydrogen—$1.7 billion was allocated to two projects in the oil and gas sector.

DeMarco notes that those two projects could double-dip by accessing the Canada Growth Fund while also earning investment tax credits without reducing the amount of emissions they claimed. DeMarco said it was impossible to say whether that was actually happening.

“This is the only Clean Economy investment tax credit where applicants are not required to reduce their amount claimed when combining with other federal assistance,” the report says.

“We found that the two projects funded by the Canada Growth Fund planned to also claim the investment tax credit, resulting in the federal government covering most of the capital cost of these projects.”

DeMarco also called out the government for not publishing a complete list of its fossil fuel subsidies, which had been expected by December 2024, and for not completing the peer review study it announced in 2018.

As The Canadian Press reported in June, Canada’s progress on the study stalled in 2023 after its partner country Argentina ceased participation, following the election of a right wing populist leader who has referred to climate change as “a socialist lie.”

“A peer review would increase the transparency of the government’s assessment of financial measures directed at the oil and gas sector,” DeMarco’s report said.

Coal-fired power plants have closed across the country as power companies shift to cheaper renewables and natural gas.

Meanwhile, environmental groups blasted the push to keep the power plant open.","Gov. Jared Polis has spent most of his time in office pushing to accelerate Colorado’s transition away from fossil fuels in favor of more climate-friendly ways of generating electricity.

His administration, however, is now intervening to keep a coal-fired power plant running in Pueblo.

On Monday, Xcel Energy joined the Colorado Energy Office and Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate to file a petition asking state utility regulators to extend the lifespan of Comanche 2, a 50-year-old power plant currently scheduled to cease operations by Dec. 31. The coalition instead wants the facility to shutter by the end of 2026.

The request comes as the newer, larger Comanche 3 plant next door remains offline. Xcel Energy has acknowledged the troubled unit hasn’t supplied power since mid-August and isn’t expected to return to service until next June.

“We came to the conclusion that it would be prudent to make Comanche 2 available during that time period,” said Will Toor, the executive director of the Colorado Energy Office.

Coal-fired power plants have closed across the country as power companies shift to cheaper renewables and natural gas. President Trump is now attempting to reverse the decline. Since he returned to office, the U.S. Department of Energy has offered $625 million in investments to reinvigorate the industry and intervened to stop utilities from closing coal plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

Some have called for a similar action to save Pueblo's coal-fired power plants. On Oct. 31, Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd, who represents the city, asked the Trump administration to use emergency powers to keep Comanche 2 open indefinitely, saying Colorado might face an “energy emergency” if the plant was shuttered.

Toor insists Colorado doesn’t face an energy emergency, justifying federal action. He also added the state found no reason for Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association to delay its plans to close a coal-fired generating unit in Craig, Colo., at the end of the year.

At the same time, Toor said losing both Comanche 2 and 3 simultaneously could force Xcel to purchase high-cost natural gas over the winter, which could result in a sudden spike in energy bills.

Unlike Hurd’s request to the Department of Energy, the joint petition to regulators would delay Comanche 2’s closing date rather than potentially eliminating it altogether.

Hurd, who’s reviewing the filing, said it’s “consistent” with his request to “protect good jobs, keep energy affordable for families and businesses, and ensure Colorado's grid remains reliable.”

“We must keep this plant operating until dependable power is truly in place in Pueblo,” he added.

In a statement, a spokesperson for Xcel Energy said it joined the petition due to a spike in electricity demand, the outage at Comanche 3 and “supply chain challenges.” The company added that they remain committed to the state’s clean energy goals.

Meanwhile, environmental groups blasted the push to keep the power plant open. In a written statement, Erin Overturf, the clean energy director at Western Resource Advocates, said ratepayers shouldn’t be forced to pay for the poor economics and maintenance issues at aging coal-fired power plants.

“Comanche 3 has been an albatross around the neck of Xcel ratepayers for more than a decade. This request to delay the long-planned retirement of Comanche 2 will lead to increased costs for utility customers at a time when people are already economically struggling,” Overturf said.

It’s not immediately clear who will shoulder the costs of keeping the plant open past its closing date. Joseph Pereira, deputy director of the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, which advocates on behalf of utility customers, said in a statement that Comanche 2 is smaller and less expensive to operate than Comanche 3.

But he added that any costs incurred from Comanche’s 3 outages would still need to be approved by state utility regulators at Colorado’s Public Utilities Commission (PUC).

“It is the responsibility of [Xcel] to ensure their plants are reliable and cost-effective,” he said. “Any deviation from that responsibility should be shouldered by shareholders and not ratepayers.”

Rebecca White, director of the PUC, said that commissioners may issue a decision to keep the plant open in around three to four weeks. The process will also allow regulators to weigh in on longer-term solutions on replacing the electricity generation from the station.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/11/200107-PUEBLO-EXCEL-COMMANCHE-PO.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 03:59:29.792491

Solar power is the fastest-growing source of new electric generating capacity in the United States, driven by large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) projects built by electric utilities and independent power producers. Delays in bringing these solar projects into operation have been trending down in recent months.

Despite the relatively high number of projects reporting delays in 2024, that year was a record year for U.S. solar capacity additions. Power plant developers added 31 gigawatts (GW) of utility-scale solar PV generating capacity in 2024, which increased total U.S. utility-scale solar capacity by 34 per cent. Delays in solar project schedules tend to be relatively short in duration, and reports of delays are more common than cancellations: less than 1 per cent of planned solar capacity is entirely cancelled in a typical month.

Developers of new power-generating capacity report their project’s initial planned operational date on our Annual Electric Generator Report (EIA-860) survey. Beginning 12 months before a project’s planned online date, we ask developers to provide updates on the status and schedule of the project in our monthly update to that annual survey, the Preliminary Monthly Electric Generator Inventory.

Because survey respondents may not anticipate the occurrence or duration of delays, ultimate capacity additions tend to be less than the expected amount that developers report to us at the beginning of the year. In January 2024, developers reported plans to bring more than 36 GW of solar capacity online through December 2024, or 5 GW more than the ultimate 31 GW installed.

Along with updates to timelines, we request that developers also categorize the stage of development: planning, permitting, construction, and testing. Much of the reported delayed capacity occurs at projects that are in the late construction or testing phases just before they come online. These delays are typically only for a month or two.

In our most recent monthly inventory of power plants, developers reported plans to bring 32 GW of solar capacity online in the next 12 months (October 2025 through September 2026). About 5 GW of that capacity is from solar projects that delayed their expected online date compared with what they had previously reported.

Under the agreement, Baker Hughes will supply main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the gas treatment plant. The energy technology firm has also committed to make a strategic investment in support of the project.

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two financially independent phases. Phase One covers an 807-mile (1,299 km), 42-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from the North Slope to meet Alaska’s domestic energy needs. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis in December, ahead of a final investment decision (FID) on this phase.

Phase Two will include the LNG terminal and export infrastructure, enabling 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG capacity, with an FID expected in late 2026.

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions. Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman and CEO of Baker Hughes.

Since taking over as lead developer in March, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments with buyers in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand for about 11 MTPA of LNG, representing over 60% of the volume required to reach FID. These include recent deals with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co., and POSCO International Corporation.

In a press release, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey announced that her administration is teaming up with the University of Massachusetts Lowell to develop ""Advanced Nuclear and Fusion Energy Roadmaps.""

The four-month program aims to map out concise actions within the state by supporting further research, manufacturing, and deployment of advanced nuclear and fusion energy. The end goal of the program will be to ""help affordably, reliably, and sustainably meet increasing electricity demand in New England.""

According to Governor Healey, this roadmap could impact energy production well beyond the state. ""Massachusetts has the ingredients to be a world-class leader in advanced nuclear and fusion energy – technologies that provide affordable power, good jobs, and significant economic development,"" said Healey, per the press release. ""There is nationwide interest in the potential of advanced nuclear and fusion energy technologies. Our partnership with UMass Lowell will help us leverage our strengths to lower costs and grow these industries in Massachusetts.""

This advancement includes backing the research efforts of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In a recent study published in Nature Communications, MIT researchers developed a new prediction model that combines physics and machine learning to forecast and avoid damaging disruptions in tokamak fusion reactors. This development could be a crucial step toward improving the reliability of fusion power plants.

Allen Wang, lead author of the study and a member of the Disruption Group at MIT's Plasma Science and Fusion Center, noted the importance of the research. ""For fusion to be a useful energy source it's going to have to be reliable,"" Wang told MIT News. ""To be reliable, we need to get good at managing our plasmas.""

According to a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the average price of electricity for New England customers was 27.91 cents per kilowatt hour in July 2025. That was more than 10 cents higher than the national average.

Once built, nuclear plants often have low fuel and operating costs. This allows them to produce power at a lower price, especially compared to energy plants powered by fossil fuels. Not only can nuclear power make energy bills more affordable for residents, but it can also help reduce our reliance on planet-heating fossil fuels.

First, the data. On current trends, US coal demand will rise this year to about 465 million short tons, driven by higher electricity generation. From one perspective, that’s still down 60% from 2007’s record high and the third-lowest annual consumption in half a century. From another, the year-on-year increase of roughly 55 million tons would be the largest annual jump in 40 years.

Regular readers know I’m a glass half-empty kind of person, so that’s where my pessimistic focus lies. Whichever lens one looks through, US coal consumption has interrupted its decline. In part, that’s due to Trump’s policies, including using emergency laws to keep some coal-fired power stations open.

BURNEY, CA, UNITED STATES, November 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- On October 15, 2025, West Biofuels, a leader in renewable bioenergy solutions, celebrated the official ribbon cutting for Hat Creek Bioenergy, a biomass-to-energy facility which the company constructed and is operating. This flagship facility represents years of collaboration with local, regional and statewide partners and converts forest biomass into renewable power, supporting forest stewardship and providing clean energy directly to the local electrical grid.

The plant is a landmark achievement in sustainable forest management, providing a critical destination for forest biomass, which aids in wildfire mitigation efforts in the community. The project is also a significant driver of local economic opportunity, supporting a team of 15 skilled plant operators, most of whom are from the Burney community. The plant’s construction phase also provided over 60 short-term jobs to the region.

The facility supports the sustainable management of about five square miles a year of forested area by local licensed timber operators and their staff. The residuals from this forest management are delivered to the facility and converted into renewable electricity and carbon sequestering biochar. During the life of the facility, over a hundred square miles of forest area around the Burney community can be made and kept fire-safe, dramatically reducing the risk of a local catastrophic fire.

""This is a proud and exciting moment for our team, our partners, and this community,"" said Matt Summers, Chief Operating Officer of West Biofuels. ""This facility represents years of hard work and a shared vision where clean energy, forest stewardship, and economic opportunity go hand-in-hand. This is an ideal local solution for fire risk reduction"".

The project was made possible through a coalition of dedicated partners and investors. The company extended its deep gratitude to primary investors, Peter Paul and Mieko Willoughby, for their unwavering commitment.

Key grant support was instrumental in the plant's development. The California Energy Commission (CEC), in partnership with the Fall River Resource Conservation District, provided the foundational grant for the facility. Early support also came from the US Forest Service and the USDA Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). Continued support from CalFire, including a Biomass Transportation Subsidy, will be vital for managing local feedstock transportation.

The ceremony featured a lineup of distinguished speakers, including:

• Justin Britton, Wood Products & Bioenergy, CalFire

• Angie Gould, Deputy Director in R&D, California Energy Commission (CEC)

• Gabrielle Stevenson, Assistant Deputy Director, Energy & Climate, GO-Biz

• Bruce Ross, Press Secretary, Office of Senator Megan Dahle

Assemblywoman Heather Hadwick was also in attendance to support the launch.

The West Biofuels team is incredibly proud of this achievement and thanks the local Burney community and state officials for their contributions in making Hat Creek Bioenergy a reality. Future projects will rely on continued support from key stakeholders in order to bring clean energy and healthy forest management practices to rural communities throughout California and the West. The Hat Creek Bioenergy facility is a model that can be replicated in other forest communities with the same vision and effort.

Here are six major shifts in U.S. climate policy initiated by the Trump administration.
Cutting climate-preparedness grants nationwide The Trump administration has also cancelled grants for climate and environmental initiatives around the country.
Slashing federal support for climate science and removing climate data The Trump administration has systematically removed climate science and climate scientists from the federal government.","Most of the world's nations are gathering in Brazil's northern city of Belém to negotiate the ongoing response to climate change. The United Nations annual climate summit, called COP30, begins Monday and is expected to last about two weeks.

This year, the U.S. will not play an active role in the talks. According to a White House statement to NPR, no high-level officials will attend COP30 — breaking a long-standing tradition.

During the previous Trump administration, U.S. delegates participated in the talks. Now, the administration has taken a stronger anti-climate stance, calling efforts to limit global warming a ""hoax.""

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

President Trump began to de-prioritize climate in January, when he withdrew the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. In that accord, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally less than 1.5 C (2.7 F). The planet is currently on track to warm roughly 2.8 C (5 F) over preindustrial levels by 2100, according to a recent U.N. climate report.

Since the Paris Agreement, the U.S. developed policies to cut climate pollution in ways that would lower future warming. But the Trump administration's sweeping rollbacks to climate policy are affecting those efforts, as well as communities' ability to cope with climate risks, like lengthening extreme heat seasons and increasingly destructive wildfires or floods. Climate experts worry that because the U.S. is setting an example, other countries might pull back on climate goals, too.

If all U.S. climate efforts were discontinued, the U.N. report estimates, the planet could warm by an extra 0.1 C — a small fraction of the total change to the planet, but a chunk that could still have significant real-life impacts.

""Each fraction of a degree matters for communities facing floods, drought, and heat extremes,"" says Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.

Here are six major shifts in U.S. climate policy initiated by the Trump administration.

Rolling back longstanding policies to target climate pollution

In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the ""most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.""

One key component of the administration's efforts focuses on attempting to reverse the ""endangerment finding,"" a legal basis for many of the country's climate policies.

In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. But legal challenges from fossil fuel interests and their allies delayed the finalization of rules to rein in greenhouse gas pollution. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that 2009 endangerment finding, which could make it easier to roll back other climate regulations.

In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated in the way courts and previous administrations have chosen to do it.

Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants

In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from the nation's fossil fuel-fired power plants. If the proposal survives expected legal challenges and is finalized, it would eliminate controls on the second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S., behind transportation.

The administration argues U.S. coal and gas-fired power plants are responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. It says that number is declining — it was 5.5% in 2005. So, the administration argues, reducing it further would provide little benefit to public health. That ignores that the U.S. is responsible for nearly a quarter of the climate pollution in the atmosphere today–more than any other nation, historically.

Withdrawing support for renewable energy technologies

The Trump administration is taking steps to open up more areas of U.S. land and ocean to increased oil and gas exploration. At the same time, it has been dismantling federal support for wind and solar industries, which it falsely labels as risky and unreliable.

The new GOP spending law ends federal tax incentives for wind and solar, throwing into limbo thousands of projects. The Trump administration has also canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects and tried to halt offshore wind projects already under construction. Energy experts say it's too early to know the full impact of these policies, but in the first half of 2025, U.S. renewable investment fell by 36%, according to data from BloombergNEF.

The Trump administration is also targeting subsidies for consumers to buy climate solutions like rooftop solar, efficient heat pumps, and electric vehicles. And it ended a $7 billion grant program for local solar projects. Federal incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation go away Dec. 31. Tax credits for electric vehicles ended Sept. 30.

Cutting climate-preparedness grants nationwide

The Trump administration has also cancelled grants for climate and environmental initiatives around the country. Grant recipients, contractors and activists say the moves have thrown into doubt the government's standing as a reliable partner.

Funding cuts have targeted a range of energy projects, as well, from transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the moves would set back American innovation and competitiveness.

Democratic lawmakers warn that cancelling Energy Department funding risks driving up utility bills and slowing economic growth at a time when new data centers and factories are expected to increase electricity demand for the first time in decades.

Slashing federal support for climate science and removing climate data

The Trump administration has systematically removed climate science and climate scientists from the federal government. One of the administration's targets was the National Climate Assessment, which is the most influential and widely-used source of information about how climate change affects the United States. In April, the Trump administration dismissed those who were working on the next edition of the report. In July, the federal website that hosted the most recent edition went dark.

The administration also slashed funding for climate science research at agencies like NOAA, NASA, and even USDA. The cuts have affected long-standing data collection efforts and datasets, like NOAA's Billion Dollar Disaster analysis, which keeps track of the ballooning costs of climate-worsened disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms, and floods. The database was discontinued in May.

Lowering federal support for disaster relief and preparedness

As wildfires, hurricanes and storms get more intense, disasters that exceed more than a billion dollars in damage are on the rise. Many communities rely on federal support to prepare, including building flood protection projects, improving evacuation planning and fortifying hospitals and other vital infrastructure. The Trump administration has cancelled more than $4 billion in grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, leaving many communities scrambling to replace that funding and prevent damage from worsening hazards. The Trump administration has said it wants states to take over disaster preparation.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/d37cc13e06039c5dc718ca5d60afe7e1?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-11-11 11:10:11.976983

While lithium dominates headlines, every EV battery contains far more graphite by weight, up to 70 kilograms per vehicle. With China controlling over 90% of the processed graphite supply, Western nations are urgently seeking secure alternatives. That shift is creating a strategic opening for Australian graphite producers, many of which remain undervalued despite strong long-term demand. For investors looking beyond the lithium hype, graphite may offer a more grounded, geopolitically aligned battery play.

What are the Best Graphite stocks to invest in right now?

Why Graphite Matters More Than Investors Think

Graphite plays a key role in lithium-ion batteries. It makes up 10–28% of the battery’s weight and acts as the main anode material, helping lithium ions move during charging and discharging. Without high-quality graphite, batteries can’t work properly.

What’s important for investors is the growing gap between supply and demand. Battery-grade graphite demand is forecast to grow 8–10x by 2030, driven by EV and energy storage adoption. Natural graphite mine output has grown modestly since 2018, but not fast enough to meet projected battery demand. That means producers may struggle to keep up.

For growth investors, this supply crunch could drive prices higher. For value investors, many graphite stocks are still trading well below lithium peers, despite strong long-term demand.

ASX Graphite Stocks Positioned to Benefit

As demand for electric vehicles grows, graphite is emerging as a key material, and these ASX-listed companies offer different ways to invest in the trend.

Syrah Resources (ASX: SYR) – Vertically Integrated with US Support

Syrah is one of the few companies outside China actively producing natural graphite. It produced 26,000 tonnes of natural graphite at Balama in Q3 2025, according to company reports.

– What sets Syrah apart is its vertical integration; it processes graphite at its Vidalia plant in Louisiana, supplying battery-grade anode material directly to US customers.

– Recent US tariffs on Chinese graphite (totalling ~105%) have boosted Syrah’s competitiveness.

– The company’s cash position improved from US$43M to US$87M in Q3 2025, although US$60M remains restricted.

– Key risk: Balama faced a full production halt earlier in 2025 due to civil unrest. Political instability in Mozambique remains a concern for future supply.

Renascor Resources (ASX: RNU) – Australia’s Largest Reserve

– Renascor owns the Siviour project in South Australia, which holds the largest reported graphite reserve outside Africa.

– Strong project economics and low operating costs support long-term growth.

– Renascor is also building a downstream plant to produce purified spherical graphite, a higher-value battery material.

– A key milestone is the Q4 2025 commissioning of its demonstration plant, which will test its HF-free purification process and could unlock better margins.

International Graphite (ASX: IG6) – Modular, Low-Cost Strategy

– International Graphite is taking a staged approach to production, starting with a micronising plant in Collie, WA.

– Stage 1 will produce 4,000 tonnes per year, aiming for early cash flow from industrial-grade graphite.

– The company has already made initial sales from its ISO-certified R&D facility, showing market acceptance.

– International Graphite estimates AU$14.1M–AU$28M in annual revenue potential across its staged Collie operations.

– While smaller in scale than its peers, its capital-light model reduces risk and speeds up time to market.

Novonix (ASX: NVX) – Tech-Driven Synthetic Graphite

– Novonix focuses on synthetic graphite, using proprietary technology to cut costs and emissions.

– Its induction furnaces use 30% less energy and eliminate chemical reagents, making the process cleaner and more efficient.

– The company’s dry, zero-waste method reduces capital costs by ~30% and operating costs by ~50%.

– With US tariffs making Chinese graphite less competitive, Novonix’s domestic production is well-positioned to gain market share.

– Challenge: Synthetic graphite production can cost up to 10x more than natural graphite, though Novonix’s innovations aim to reduce this gap.

The Investor’s Takeaway

Graphite offers a quieter but promising alternative to lithium, with several ASX-listed companies well placed to benefit from rising demand and supply chain shifts.

– Syrah delivers near-term production and US market access, though Mozambique risks remain.

– Renascor holds Australia’s largest resource with government backing, but execution will be key.

– International Graphite offers a lower-risk, early-stage entry with modest scale.

– Novonix brings a tech-driven approach to synthetic graphite with cost and emissions advantages.

For investors looking at battery materials, graphite deserves serious consideration. Its higher usage per battery, supply constraints, and Western support for non-Chinese sources create strong long-term potential. Conservative investors may prefer to wait for production milestones and offtake deals before committing.",https://stocksdownunder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Graphite-Stocks.png,N,,2025-11-11 00:58:27.783428

The TCEQ Watchdog campaign launched in April 2025 with three primary goals: holding the TCEQ accountable, building the capacity of communities and cultivating local power. The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality is the state’s environmental regulatory agency, charged with protecting public health and the environment by issuing permits and enforcing compliance. For years, polluters in Texas have enjoyed lax regulatory oversight and enforcement from the TCEQ, along with minuscule fines that do little to deter repeat offenders.

In 2021, the TCEQ entered Sunset Review, the state of Texas’ process for evaluating an agency’s performance and recommending reforms. Public Citizen convened four state-wide People’s Hearings, drawing 92 comments from witnesses. Significant wins for communities in the resulting Sunset legislation considered by lawmakers include an increase in the maximum daily fine for repeat violators from $20k to 40k; an extension of the public comment period to 36 hours after the public meeting for a permit with consolidated notice; in-person meetings preserved with virtual participation option included; and new community outreach and education on participating in permitting.",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 01:58:15.922887

“This legislation is about making Illinois stronger,” said Vella.
“By investing in clean energy and modern infrastructure, we’re not only reducing bills, we’re creating thousands of new jobs.”","ROCKFORD, Ill. – Working to provide more relief to Illinoisans facing rising energy costs, state Rep. Dave Vella, D-Rockford, passed comprehensive legislation Wednesday evening that seeks to bring down home energy bills both immediately and in the long term for residents, while holding large utility corporations accountable.

“Every Illinoisan deserves affordable, reliable energy,” said Vella. “Families for too long have been paying the price for decisions made by big utility companies. This bill finally lowers the costs of utility bills while increasing accountability.”

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket. Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further—resulting in $9.5 billion in increased state energy costs. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) puts Illinois on better footing to counteract rising energy prices by tapping into:

● Capturing clean energy: By capturing and redistributing energy already being produced, including from home solar panels, Ameren and ComEd customers can see immediate relief on monthly costs.

● Increasing battery storage: By building out our grid to increase the state’s battery storage, power systems will become more reliable and affordable to power millions of Illinois homes.

● Investing in energy efficiency programs: Senate Bill 25 directly expands energy efficiency programs for residents, lowering electricity prices by reducing overall demand, and improves equity in programs by allocating a minimum amount of funds to support

low-income customers.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill— including over 50,000 lost manufacturing jobs in Illinois. As utility demands increase during the fall and winter months, Senate Bill 25 will play a significant role in meeting the state’s energy needs, strengthening reliability and helping manage untenable costs for customers for both short- and long-term relief.

“This legislation is about making Illinois stronger,” said Vella. “By investing in clean energy and modern infrastructure, we’re not only reducing bills, we’re creating thousands of new jobs.”",,N,,2025-11-10 23:57:51.375888

The vast majority-71.74%-traveled by car last year. While owning and driving cars will continue to be a fundamental mode of transport for the foreseeable future, Thanksgiving traffic might look much more sustainable in the not-too-distant future, CANOPY reports.

Train travel in North America will soon get a lot faster

Choosing electric rail travel over a direct flight can cut emissions by around 86% (though, as The New York Times reported, much of the rail network in America still runs on highly polluting diesel). But while Japan's Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" debuted high-speed rail in 1964 and France's TGV marked a global high-speed train revolution once it began rolling in the early 1980s, North American rail travel has languished on the wrong side of the tracks.

But railfans, rejoice! Amtrak partnered with Alstom to deliver its next-generation premium Acela trainsets along 457 miles of track in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor (NEC) in August 2025. Amtrak's trains can operate at top speeds of 160 mph versus today's fleet, which operates at top speeds of 150 mph, and connect Boston, New Jersey, and Washington, DC as part of a $2.45 billion investment in the NEC. Twenty-eight new trains will enter service through 2027. Elsewhere, high-speed train links operated by various bodies will soon follow between Portland and Vancouver, Las Vegas and Southern California, Miami and Tampa, Houston and Dallas, and, hopefully, San Francisco and Los Angeles-making future journeys faster and more relaxing.

By 2040, rush hour won't exist-thanks to self-driving electric vehicles

EVs and hybrid vehicles are mainstays of freeways, and mobility experts agree that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will transform travel. McKinsey's 2025 The Next Normal report ""The future of self-driving cars: Safer, smarter, and everywhere"" declares that by 2040, autonomous vehicles could be as commonplace as any household appliance-shaping how families organize their days, how cities are designed, and creating a driving experience that is smarter, safer, and all-around better. Hours spent watching the road could be used for video calling a friend, watching a movie, napping, or even working-all of which would make traveling during the daily commute and holiday period a little less painful.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are looking to a future approaching net zero

Long-haul trips account for 60% of aviation emissions and 69.3% of CO2 emissions from passenger travel. Rather than reinventing the wheel, airlines targeting IATA's ""net zero carbon by 2050"" goal are developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to power existing aircraft engines.

In 2022, Swedish airline BRA made history as the first to operate a regional commercial aircraft with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Supplier Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Used neat, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

Fifty airlines are investing in SAF, and over half a million flights have used SAF to some degree, but the industry is not without its critics. Some SAFs contain biofuels derived from crops, which can put pressure on global food supplies and contribute to deforestation. But the promise of ""synthetic"" or ""e-fuels"" created by artificially combining hydrogen with ambient pollutant carbon dioxide is looking to a future where the SAF lifecycle approaches net-zero.

Air Company's AIRMADE® SAF, which it markets under the dramatic tagline ""Extinction ends here,"" is a fully formulated drop-in jet fuel that can be produced at scale with access to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and clean hydrogen (H₂). AIRCO has commercial partnerships with airlines, including JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic, and has been awarded multiple government contracts, including with NASA and the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit. If the technology holds up, it will change the conversation around fuel-based CO2 emissions for good.

Electric, hydrogen-powered, and supersonic aircraft promise to decarbonize and democratize air travel

Various technologies show promise for navigating the skies on short-, mid-, and long-haul trips. LA-based start-up Heart Aerospace's mission is to use sustainable, electrified regional aircraft to reduce emissions and make flying more accessible to more people around the world. Hydrogen-powered engines are a staple in space rockets, but challenging to apply in aviation, yet Airbus has bet big on hybrid hydrogen aircraft-its ZEROe aircraft concept is slated to launch by 2035.

And after the demise of Concorde, supersonic aviation is staging a comeback. Boom's sleek supersonic aircraft, Overture, has an aerodynamic, lightweight carbon-fiber design and new-generation supersonic engines that run entirely on SAF. In ""boomless cruise,"" the aircraft ensures there's no audible sonic boom using Mach cutoff physics, opening up overland routes. Boom has commitments from American Airlines and United Airlines, with the first aircraft due to be delivered in 2029, when passengers can fly from New York to San Francisco in four hours. In a few years, air travel time on some routes around the holidays and year-round could be halved.

Inspired by Star Trek, shuttles powered by ionic wind could enable us to boldly-and silently-go places we've gone before

Down the line, people might even take to the skies in a Star Trek-inspired, ionic wind-powered aircraft. In 2018, MIT engineers built and flew the first-ever plane with no moving parts-instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an ""ionic wind,"" a silent flow of ions that generates enough thrust to sustain steady flight.

In MIT News, Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, explained how the aircraft was inspired in part by the futuristic shuttlecrafts in the Star Trek TV shows and movies he watched avidly as a child. The physical principle of electroaerodynamic thrust was first identified in the 1920s, but remained the realm of hobbyists until a jetlagged Barrett did some back-of-the-napkin calculations after an uncomfortable flight. In the near term, he believes ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly silent drones. Long-term, he says, they might be paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid large aircraft, including passenger planes.

According to Reuters, registrations for the automaker fell steeply in October, signaling that Tesla may be losing ground in regions where it once dominated.

What's happening?

After a brief rebound in September, when Model Y topped Europe's sales charts, Tesla's ride has turned bumpy again.

In Spain, where overall electric vehicle and plug-in hybrid sales jumped 119%, Tesla's numbers dropped 31%. Beyond slowing demand tied to consumer fatigue and rising competition, the company is also falling behind traditional automakers in expanding its EV offerings, and Chinese brands are gaining market share.

""Tesla no longer has the market to itself and that seems to be showing in its sales figures in Europe,"" Ginny Buckley, CEO of Electrifying.com, told Reuters.

Why is this issue important?

This isn't just about Tesla's balance sheet. If the brand that sparked the EV revolution loses traction, new buyers may be discouraged from making the switch — slowing EV adoption at a time the world needs it most.

Road transportation still accounts for roughly 12.2% of global heat-trapping gases produced by human activity, based on data from Climate Watch. To bring this figure down, EV adoption must be accelerated, not slowed.

Yet, some regions seem to be stuck in neutral. Europe, in particular, saw its electric car market flat-line at about 20% of total car sales in 2024 as subsidy cuts cooled demand, according to the Global EV Outlook 2025.

Cost also remains a crucial factor. Analysis from Atlas Public Policy showed that most EVs, including the Model Y, still cost less to own over time, saving EV owners about $8,000 over seven years compared to gasoline models.

But affordability and accessibility depend heavily on steady pricing and continued policy support — both of which are becoming less certain in Europe.

What's being done about it?

Inside Tesla, tensions are growing as sales continue to slide, and the company faces scrutiny over leadership decisions. While the board has proposed a $1 trillion pay package to keep Elon Musk as CEO, Norges Bank Investment Management — Tesla's seventh-largest shareholder — voted to reject it — a sign of investor unease.

Tesla may be navigating through a rough patch now, but its setbacks clear the lane for other EV players. Automakers, both new and established, now share the responsibility of pushing EV innovation forward.

For consumers, Tesla's latest challenges serve as a reminder that EV progress depends on broad industry innovation — every new electric model on the road helps move transportation toward a cleaner future.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Teslas-European-salesimage-recbbFUVakxeJ4UN7-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-11 01:58:29.485483

Deadline approaches for comments on proposed changes to Chemical Risk Evaluation Process under the TSCA. Today, November 7, is the deadline to submit comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on a proposed rule that would change the way the agency evaluates the risks of chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). EPA states that the proposed rule, pursuant to Executive Order 14219, “Ensuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President's ‘Department Of Government Efficiency’ Deregulatory Initiative,” and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s Powering the Great American Comeback initiative, would streamline such evaluations while increasing transparency and providing a more predictable regulatory process for chemical manufacturers. The current procedural framework for evaluating the risk of chemicals is set out in a 2017 rule that was revised in 2024 to require a single, comprehensive risk determination for each chemical across all conditions of use (COUs). The proposed rule would revert to separate evaluations for each COU. Among other key changes in the proposed rule: EPA would be allowed to take into account occupational exposure controls, such as personal protective equipment, in risk determinations and chemical risk evaluations; would use the definition of “weight of scientific evidence” set out in Executive Order 14303, “Restoring Gold Standard Science”; would eliminate “overburdened communities” from the list of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” that must be considered in evaluations; and would require less information from manufacturers submitting requests for risk evaluations. See the proposed rule here.

Troutman nomination advances. On October 29, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee advanced the nomination of Douglas Troutman to head the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, which regulates the use of pesticides and chemicals. During his confirmation hearings on October 8, Troutman stated that under his leadership the agency would seek to “provide a clean, safe environment, with an eye toward strong economic growth.” Replying to questions about reviews of new chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), he said that he would seek to expedite such reviews in keeping with President Donald Trump’s support for United States energy dominance. His intent, he stated, is for “nothing to change” regarding EPA’s “robust reviews of new and existing chemicals based on the risk-based process under TSCA.” Troutman most recently served as interim co-CEO of the American Cleaning Institute. Next, the Senate will vote on whether to confirm his nomination.

CSB to investigate Tennessee munitions plant explosion. The US Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) will investigate an October 10 explosion at a Tennessee explosives factory in which 16 workers died and the factory was destroyed. The Accurate Energetic System facility in Humphreys County, Tennessee manufactures explosive products for the commercial and defense markets. Since the explosion, the site has been under the control of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF), as ATF investigators study the debris field and dispose of hazardous materials, such as damaged, unexploded munitions. As it prepares for its investigation, CSB has been coordinating with ATF and requesting information from the company about the facility and its operations. CSB is the nonregulatory federal agency that investigates incidents that result, or may result, in the catastrophic release of extremely hazardous substances. It does not issue citations or fines but makes safety recommendations to companies, industry organizations, labor groups, and regulatory agencies.

$1.5 billion federal loan for development of low-carbon fertilizer plant in Indiana. On October 29, the US Department of Energy (DOE) finalized a $1.5 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources, LLC to repurpose an idled coal gasification plant into a new low-carbon ammonia fertilizer factory – the first fertilizer plant in Indiana. This is the second loan guaranteed by the DOE under its Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) Program, created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The plant is scheduled to start production by the end of 2028. Of note: carbon emissions from the plant will be captured and injected into mile-deep underground storage wells; EPA issued permits for the wells in early 2024. The federal government has been working to expand US fertilizer production for some time. The loan process for this Indiana project, for instance, began in 2019. In 2022 and 2023, the USDA awarded grants to numerous industrial projects across the country to develop and expand fertilizer manufacturing capabilities via the $900 million Fertilizer Production Expansion Program. In early January this year, the DOE announced a loan guarantee of up to $1.26 billion to Michigan Potash Company, LLC to help finance construction of a potash solution mine and processing plant.

BIS to suspend the 50-percent ownership rule for certain entities. The White House has confirmed that, for certain entities, the Bureau of Industry and Security’s 50-percent ownership rule (known as the BIS Affiliate Rule) will be suspended for one year – a development arising from negotiations between the US and China in South Korea last week. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the BIS Affiliate Rule is being suspended “in return for the suspension on the rare earth licensing regime” by China’s Ministry of Commerce, which has agreed to issue general licenses to export rare earths until November 27, 2026.

EPA reverses course on coke emissions standards. In a reversal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has signed a final rule that reinstates the original compliance deadline for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Coke Ovens. Coke is a key component in steelmaking. The tighter standards governing emissions from coke plants were originally slated to go into effect in July 2025, but, that month, the agency extended their compliance deadline by two years, stating that the industry could not feasibly implement them. The final rule signed by Zeldin last month reinstates the original effective date. The rule establishes stricter emissions limits for emissions of such substances as mercury and requires plants that manufacture coke to install fenceline monitoring systems for releases of benzene. Also in July, EPA extended the compliance deadline for a separate rule, Integrated Iron and Steel Manufacturing: National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, by two years. At this writing, it is unclear whether that postponement too will be reversed.

Another PFAS added to Toxics Release Inventory. EPA has added sodium perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS-Na), a per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS), to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) list. The agency advises facilities subject to reporting requirements for PFHxS-Na to begin tracking their activities involving that chemical starting January 1, 2026. Reporting forms are due to EPA by July 1, 2027. The addition of PFHxS-Na to the TRI arises from the agency’s finalization earlier this year of a toxicity value, “IRIS Toxicological Review of Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid (PFHxS, CASRN 335-46-4) and Related Salts.”

ACEA urges European Commission to revise emissions targets for carmakers. The European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), which represents 16 major Europe-based vehicle manufacturers, has asked the European Commission to recalibrate its fleet average emissions targets for manufacturers of motor vehicles, arguing the 2035 zero-emission target is unrealistic given weak electric vehicle demand and gaps in the charging network. ACEA supported various proposals put forward by the Commission, including allowing manufacturers to meet their 2025–2027 emissions targets based on a three-year average (rather than annually), providing incentives such as super credits for small EVs, and recognition of plug in hybrids, range extenders, and carbon neutral fuels. The group also seeks credit from the Commission for using decarbonized materials like green steel.",https://edge.sitecorecloud.io/dlapiperukl0cbf-dlapiperba5d-devd44d-3fa6/media/project/dlapiper-tenant/dlapiper/brand-images/dla-piper-og-image-default-logo.jpg?h=1302&iar=0&w=2500,N,,2025-11-11 01:58:33.502287

Significantly, EPA’s proposal would exempt imported articles from reporting. Once the proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, it will be subject to a 45-day comment period.

Proposed Exemptions to PFAS Reporting Rule

The TSCA PFAS reporting rule, originally finalized in October 2023, requires that manufacturers of PFAS and importers of PFAS and PFAS-containing products report extensive information to EPA about the products they manufacture and import going back to January 1, 2011 (See Hunton’s prior blog post about this rule). The rule does not include any of the exemptions that are traditionally part of TSCA reporting rules, which has caused widespread concern from regulated entities about the massive regulatory burdens created by the rule, particularly for importers of finished products containing any amount of PFAS.

EPA now proposes to add key exemptions to the reporting requirements, including for:

1) PFAS imported as part of an article;

2) PFAS manufactured or imported in a mixture or article below a 0.1% de minimis concentration;

3) PFAS that are impurities;

4) PFAS that are byproducts not used for a commercial purpose or PFAS that are manufactured upon incidental exposure or end use of another substance (referring to the exemptions in EPA’s premanufacture notice (PMN) regulations at 40 C.F.R. § 720.30(h));

5) PFAS that are non-isolated intermediates; and

6) PFAS that are manufactured or imported in small quantities for research and development (R&D) purposes.

Other than the de minimis exemption, these exemptions are typical of TSCA reporting rules, including the chemical data reporting rule (CDR). EPA is also requesting feedback on whether it should consider adding a production volume threshold by which reporting on a given PFAS would not be required, similar to the exemption in the CDR for chemicals manufactured or imported under 25,000 lbs. (or 2,500 lbs. for chemicals subject to certain TSCA actions).

Proposed Extension of Submission Period

EPA is also proposing to delay the reporting submission window, which is currently from April 13, 2026 – October 13, 2026. The new reporting window will start 60 days after the effective dates of the final rule and will last for three months rather than six months. EPA did not provide an update in the proposed rule regarding the status of the development of its electronic reporting application within EPA’s Central Data Exchange (CDX). EPA has experienced numerous delays in developing this reporting tool for the PFAS reporting rule, resulting in multiple delays of the submission period.

What Aspects of the Reporting Rule Are Staying the Same?

Based on the language in the preamble, EPA intends to retain the original reporting lookback period of January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2022.

EPA is also maintaining its current definition for PFAS as including at least one of these three structures:

R-(CF2)-CF(R’)R”, where both the CF2 and CF moieties are saturated carbons;

R-CF2OCF2-R’, where R and R’ can either be F, O, or saturated carbons; and

CF3C(CF3)R’-R”, where R’ and R” can either be F or saturated carbons.

While EPA is not proposing any changes to the definition of PFAS, it is taking comment on whether it should limit reporting to only PFAS with a Chemical Abstracts Service Registry Number (CASRN), TSCA Accession Number, or LVE number.

The specific data required to be reported to EPA, as well as the “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” due diligence standard, remain the same.

Purpose of Proposed Revisions

According to EPA, this proposed rule is intended to make the TSCA PFAS reporting requirements more practical and implementable and to reduce unnecessary, or potentially duplicative, reporting requirements for businesses while maintaining the ability to obtain important use and safety information on PFAS. EPA’s press release includes a statement from Administrator Lee Zeldin that the current TSCA PFAS reporting rule imposes “crushing regulatory burdens and nearly $1 billion in implementation costs on American businesses,” whereas “today’s proposal is grounded in commonsense and the law, allowing [EPA] to collect the information [it needs] to help combat PFAS contamination without placing ridiculous requirements on manufacturers, especially the small businesses that drive our country’s economy.”

EPA is reassessing whether the volume of potential data collected justifies the total burden of implementing the rule and what Congress had intended when it added this requirement to TSCA Section 8. It is intended to maintain meaningful reporting on PFAS while exempting entities that are “least likely to have relevant information.”

Assessment of the environmental footprints of AI servers This study employs a state-level allocation method to evaluate the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers.","The accelerating deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) servers is being fuelled by the growing demand for generative AI applications, ignited by milestones such as the release of ChatGPT in 20221. Projections signal even greater impact, exemplified by the recent Blackwell platform, which analysts herald as a new Moore’s Law era2. Pronouncements from influential AI industry figures3 on both demand and supply sides are seen as transformative shifts for the entire data-centre industry. Whereas AI has been employed in various fields to advance sustainability4,5, the remarkable energy requirements of AI itself raise concerns regarding not only energy provisioning challenges6 but also water scarcity and climate change issues stemming from the energy–water–climate nexus of AI data centres1,7,8. However, the holistic energy–water–climate implications of AI computing are largely unknown, constrained by untransparent industry reports and limited data.

The climate impact of AI servers will stem primarily from their operations (Scopes 1 and 2)9 and supply-chain activities (Scope 3), including manufacturing and end-of-life treatment10,11. The Scope 2 emissions from indirect energy purchases are expected to constitute a substantial portion and indicate a high dependency on the increase of AI server energy consumption. According to the International Energy Agency12, 0.6% of global total carbon emissions comes from the data centres and data transmission networks due to their electricity consumption. The industry energy consumption could double by 2026, motivated by AI and other sectors13, threatening decarbonization targets under the Paris Agreement14,15, which include a 53% reduction in data-centre emissions by 2030 and net-zero goals for the AI sector. Further, growing AI server energy consumption implies an increasing water footprint through Scope 1 (direct cooling) and Scope 2 (indirect procurement) water use8,16. Centralized installation in water-stressed regions may perturb local water balance and threaten supply for millions17,18.

Previous research has developed bottom-up and top-down methods to assess energy–water–carbon outcomes of servers19,20,21, but these approaches face challenges with the rise of AI servers. Top-down approaches based on activity indices, such as data traffic and computing instances, fail to accurately represent AI-driven workloads22,23. Detailed bottom-up approaches suffer from limited data availability and lack of industry insight7. Assumptions valid for traditional collocation centres often fail for AI data centres, which differ in installation and operation24. Recent studies have explored computing task-based analyses to better quantify AI-related energy and resource consumption, providing insights but lacking systematic policy guidance25,26. Two notable contributions are the 2024 data-centre report by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory27 and the 2025 Energy and AI Report by the International Energy Agency28, which present scenarios estimating US and global data-centre energy use under highly uncertain AI growth. Although use of confidential commercial data may limit reproducibility, they offer important benchmarks. Our study extends this foundation by (1) developing an open-source, bottleneck-based modelling approach with comprehensive uncertainty analysis; (2) systematically assessing energy, water and carbon impacts, incorporating dynamic interactions with local energy systems; and (3) proposing actionable mitigation strategies for potential net-zero trajectories across different AI server deployment scenarios.

Here we analyse the combined energy–water–climate impact of operational AI servers in the United States between 2024 and 2030, balancing importance and future uncertainties and addressing a series of fundamental questions. (1) What are the magnitude and spatiotemporal distributions of energy consumption, water footprint and climate impact from AI server deployment? We address this using temporal projection models and regional frameworks, assuming deployment mirrors current large-scale AI data-centre patterns. (2) What are the prospects for near-term net-zero pathways? We evaluate this by analysing best- and worst-case scenarios of key drivers, including industry efficiency improvements, server location distribution and grid decarbonization. The results of these analyses are presented in the following sections.

Investment in AI servers is accelerating, as seen in projects such as the $500 billion Stargate3. While AI advancement is a key priority, our study highlights its environmental impact. To mitigate these risks, we identify that concentrating AI server deployment in Midwestern states—Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota—is optimal, given their abundant renewables, low water scarcity and favourable projected unit water and carbon intensities. These states possess substantial untapped wind and solar resources, enabling robust green power portfolios and reducing competition with other sectors. Their lower water stress also helps ease public concerns and reduces the need for costly water-saving measures. However, several implementation challenges must be acknowledged. Texas, crucial to the optimal strategy, may need to support an additional 74–178 TWh of AI server demand, possibly exceeding its current total renewable generation of 139 TWh (ref. 38). This scale-up would require substantial investment in new renewable capacity and transmission infrastructure, which is already constrained by existing congestion39. Meanwhile, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota currently host minimal data-centre capacity, indicating that most of their existing internet infrastructure may support only residential or standard industrial applications. This raises potential connectivity and security concerns for high-performance AI services. Enabling AI-grade infrastructure in these regions will require broadband and security upgrades, with associated emissions and capital costs increasing the expense of the optimal strategy. These challenges underscore the complexity of sustainable siting decisions and highlight the need for strategic coordination to ensure that AI investments support both technological leadership and long-term sustainability goals.

Expanding AI servers in the suggested regions may be further obstructed by public health concerns and other impacts on local sustainable development. Operational demands and construction of supporting facilities could generate air and water pollution through fossil fuel use, substantial water consumption and large-scale construction and transportation. To address these issues while managing economic costs, we recommend that AI companies engage in public–private partnerships with local governments. Such partnerships could alleviate governmental budget pressures, create local jobs and mitigate health concerns by funding green power upgrades and monitoring systems, such as tracking PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less) levels, through combined AI investment and regulation. For the governments, implementing tax exemptions on a related facility could incentivize a win–win development process, and it is essential to ensure transparent accountability within public–private partnerships to prevent privatized gains at public cost. Beyond environmental benefits, these measures could stimulate local economic growth, as evidenced in Virginia40. This discussion outlines policy recommendations for both industry and legislative stakeholders that balance economic and environmental impacts. They also emphasize energy market adaptations as AI-driven hyperscale loads challenge utilities‘ ‘duty to serve’. Requirements to connect large data centres could lead to server collocation with energy generation, but as shown in this study, these choices should not crowd out renewable investments to decarbonize the economy. Finally, the effectiveness of the recommended policy may be influenced by broader political and economic factors beyond the scope of this study.

The challenges associated with the optimal spatial distribution of AI servers introduce substantial uncertainties to the projected reductions of 73% and 86% in carbon and water footprints, respectively, under best-practice scenarios. These challenges are unlikely to be offset by improvements in efficiency or decarbonization efforts beyond what has already been considered. Our best-case scenario for industry efficiency approaches the physical limits of AI data centres. Moreover, projections from the US Energy Information Administration offer limited support for additional grid decarbonization compared with the considered best case41. These constraints suggest that, without additional interventions, AI data centres are likely to generate substantial environmental impacts in the coming years. Consequently, AI companies are expected to continue investing in the offset mechanisms, including power purchase agreement, carbon removal and water restoration, reaching an unprecedented level of reliance on them to accomplish their net-zero aspirations by 2030. Nevertheless, severe concerns could be raised regarding the complexity of securing long-term contracts and providing convincing reduction credits9,42, especially bearing in mind the considerable capacity that would be needed. We argue that AI companies should shift to a more transparent approach by closely cooperating with third-party verification groups, service providers and governmental agencies. Such collaboration could reduce uncertainties through better integration of social resources and serve as a model for other electrified sectors.

Emerging high-efficiency technologies in hardware and software, exemplified by DeepSeek43, may fundamentally transform AI server supply and demand. As reflected in the study’s five scenarios, these innovations may cause deviations of up to 393 million m3 in water footprints and 20 MtCO2-equivalent in emissions between minimum and maximum impact cases, underscoring the need for tailored managements. While efficiency gains may reduce cost per computing task, they risk a rebound effect, where lower costs increase total application volume. This dynamic, as reflected by the high-application scenario, may amplify total demand and complicate AI’s environmental trajectory. To address these uncertainties, we recommend government agencies work with industry to establish real-time monitoring systems, enabling timely alerts and proactive measures before considerable environmental impacts occur. Moreover, the potential increase in total computing jobs poses both challenges and opportunities, calling for ongoing enhancements in energy and water efficiency through system optimization and adoption of strategies such as SUO and ALC to manage the added workload complexity and flexibility. Therefore, we also suggest the data-centre industry establish AI-specific benchmarks for energy, water and carbon performance, which is crucial for continuous operational efficiency gains.

The methodology framework of this study aims to achieve two goals: (1) draft the energy–water–climate impacts of AI servers in the United States from 2024 to 2030 to handle the massive concerns about AI developments, and (2) identify the best and worst practices of each influencing factor to scheme the net-zero pathways for realizing water and climate targets set for 2030. Compared with many previous climate pathway studies, which often extend predictions to 2050 for better integrating climate goals, this study focuses on the period from 2024 to 2030 due to the great uncertainties surrounding the future of AI applications and hardware development. For assessing these uncertainties, scenario-based projections are first constructed to obtain potential capacity-increasing patterns of AI servers. Technology dynamics, such as SUO and ALC adoption, are defined with best, base and worst scenarios, and a similar method is employed to capture the impact of grid decarbonization and spatial distribution. The utilized models and data required during the calculation process are illustrated in the following sections. More details on model assumptions and data generation are provided in sections 1–4 of Supplementary Information.

Data description and discussion

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the data used in this study. Historical DGX (Nvidia’s high-performance AI server line) parameters were sourced from official documentation, and future scenarios were projected on the basis of historical configurations and current industry forecasts. To attain the units of AI servers, we collected the most updated industrial report data for projecting the future manufacturing capacity of CoWoS technology, which is the bottleneck for top-tier AI server production. The data resources of the preceding process have been introduced and validated in section 1 of Supplementary Information. AI server electricity usage was assessed using recent experimental data on maximum power44,45, idle power44,46 and utilization rate46,47,48,49, derived from existing AI server systems. PUE and WUE values for AI data centres across different locations were calculated using operational data from previous studies30,50 and industrial resources51, combined with the collected average climate data for each state52. The allocation ratios of AI servers to each state were determined on the basis of configurations of existing and planned AI data centres, which are collected from reports of major AI companies in the United States, as data resources detailed in section 2 of Supplementary Information. In addition, projections for grid carbon and water factors were derived from the ReEDS model31, using its default scenario data33. All datasets employed in this study are publicly available, with most originating from well-established sources. A key uncertainty lies in estimating the number of manufactured AI server units, as official supply-chain reports remain largely opaque. To maintain transparency and ensure reproducibility, we rely on the best available industry reports rather than commercial sources such as International Data Cooperation data53, which are not granted for open access and would limit future validation despite their potential to provide better estimates. The validations of applied data are further detailed in sections 1 and 4 of Supplementary Information.

AI server power capacity projections

The energy consumption of AI servers is projected to be driven predominantly by top-tier models designed for large-scale generative AI computing6,7. This trend is attributed to their substantial power requirements and the increasing number of units being deployed. In this study, we estimate the power capacity of these high-performance AI servers by examining a critical manufacturing bottleneck: the CoWoS process54. This process, which is controlled nearly exclusively by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, serves as a key determinant of the manufacturing capacity for AI servers in recent years55. Our analysis uses forecast data and projection assumptions of the CoWoS process to estimate total production capacity. Other factors are integral to translating this capacity into the power capacity of AI servers: the CoWoS size of AI chips, which determines how many chips can be produced by each wafer; the rated power of future AI servers, which reflects the power demand per unit; and the adoption patterns of AI servers, which dictate the mix of various server types over time. The values of these factors are derived mainly from the DGX systems produced by Nvidia, which is the dominant product for the top-tier AI server markets56.

Considering the influencing factors for the total AI server capacity shipments and existing uncertainties, we generate distinct scenarios as follows:

Mid-case scenario: the CoWoS capacity is projected to slightly increase after 2026, consistent with the growth rate in 2023. Under this scenario, AI servers’ rated power is expected to have a linear relationship with the anticipated die size increase while adoption patterns remain aligned with current trajectory.

Low-demand scenario: characterized by lower CoWoS capacity growth and lower AI server rated power compared with the mid-case scenario, this reflects a scenario of lower overall demand for AI servers.

Low-power scenario: maintains the same assumptions as the mid-case scenario but with lower AI server rated power, representing efficiency gains in AI hardware and software development.

High-application scenario: assumes lower AI server rated power alongside high CoWoS capacity, capturing the potential rebound effect where efficiency gains drive increased AI workload deployment.

High-demand scenario: features higher CoWoS capacity expansion, higher AI server rated power and higher adoption of new servers compared with the mid-case scenario, reflecting a scenario of strong AI server demand.

Based on the assumptions and scenarios outlined, the annual projections for top-tier AI server shipments and their average rated power are calculated as follows:

$$\begin{array}{l}{N}_{\mathrm{AI}}=\frac{{C}_{\mathrm{CoWoS}}\times {R}_{\mathrm{Nvidia}}\times {\sum }_{i}{R}_{i}{n}_{i}}{{N}_{\mathrm{GPU}}}\\ {\bar{P}}_{\mathrm{AI}}=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i}{R}_{i}{P}_{i}\end{array}$$

(1)

where \({N}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) and \({\bar{P}}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) represent the annually projected shipments and average rated power of the top-tier AI servers. \({R}_{\mathrm{AI}}\) is the ratio of CoWoS capacity allocated to top-tier AI servers and is set as 40% for 2022, 40.7% for 2023, 48.5% for 2024 and 54.3% for 2025, according to industry reports57,58. For years beyond 2025, this ratio is assumed to remain constant at the 2025 value due to a lack of further data. The sensitivity analysis regarding this value is provided in Fig. 6. \({C}_{\mathrm{CoWoS}}\) is the projected CoWoS capacity within each scenario. \({N}_{\mathrm{GPU}}\) is the number of graphic processor units (GPUs) per server and is set as 8, reflecting the configuration of most commonly used AI server systems59. In addition, \({R}_{i}\), \({n}_{i}\) and \({P}_{i}\) represent the projected adoption ratio, units yield per CoWoS wafer and rated power of the ith type of chip at each year, respectively. The details of the projections and related data resources are provided in section 1 of Supplementary Information, Supplementary Figs. 1–4 and Supplementary Table 1.

AI server electricity usage calculation

The applied AI server electricity usage model is a utilization-based approach initially derived from CPU (central processing unit)-dominant servers60 and can be written as the following:

$${P}_{\mathrm{server}}=({P}_{\max }-{P}_{\mathrm{idle}})u+{P}_{\mathrm{idle}}$$

(2)

The preceding model assumes the total server power has a linear relationship with the processor utilization rate u. While this relationship has been well validated for CPU machines, its application to GPU utilization is less established except for a few cases61. However, several recent studies have shown a strong correlation between GPU utilization and overall server power consumption when dealing with AI workloads44,46, indicating that GPUs are the dominant contributors to energy use in AI servers45. Although systematic experimental validation specific to GPUs is still limited, the consistency of findings across various case studies supports the assumption that the linear relationship applies here as well. The maximum power \({P}_{\max }\) and idle power \({P}_{\mathrm{idle}}\) are generated on the basis of the recent DGX system experimental results, and their values are set as 23% and 88% of the server rated power, respectively44,46. The sensitivity analysis was conducted to quantify the uncertainty, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. Moreover, the GPU processor utilization \(u\) is calculated as the following:

$$u={u}_{\mathrm{active}}\times {r}_{\mathrm{active}}$$

(3)

where \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) and \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) represent the average processor utilization of active GPUs and the ratio of active GPUs to total GPUs, respectively. Note that the \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) and \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) commonly have higher values during training compared with inference62. Specifically, we use currently available AI traces, including Philly trace47, Helios trace46, PAI trace48 and Acme trace49, to determine the \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) for training and inference tasks. These traces provide comprehensive analyses on the relationship between GPU utilization rate and job characteristics. Based on the data provided in these works, the \({r}_{\mathrm{active}}\) is set as 50% and 90% for inference and training, respectively. Moreover, the \({u}_{\mathrm{active}}\) values are further determined on the basis of recent experimental studies44. The values are set as 50% and 80% for inference and training, respectively. Therefore, the processor utilization rates for inference and training in this work are set as 25% and 72%, respectively. Following the previous works63,64, our base estimations assume 30% of computing capacity for training and 70% for inference. A detailed sensitivity analysis on the impact of these utilization rate settings is provided in Fig. 6.

Assessment of the environmental footprints of AI servers

This study employs a state-level allocation method to evaluate the energy, water and carbon footprints of AI servers. To capture the current and future distributions of AI server capacity, we compiled data of current and in-construction large-scale data centres belonging to major purchasers of top-tier AI servers, including Google, Meta, Microsoft, AWS, XAI and Tesla. The analysis incorporates the location, building area and construction year of each data centre to calculate the state-level distribution of server capacity by annually aggregating the total building area for each state. On the basis of our calculations, no major changes in spatial distribution are projected between 2024 and 2030, even with the anticipated addition of new data centres. Therefore, we assume the current spatial distribution will remain constant from 2024 to 2030 to account for uncertainties in directly integrating the projected contributions of in-construction data centres. Further details on the methodology and spatial distribution results are provided in section 2 of Supplementary Information.

For each state, the actual energy consumption can be derived from the server electricity usage and the PUE value of AI data centres. Meanwhile, the water footprint and carbon emissions should be analysed across three scopes. Scope 1 encompasses the on-site water footprint, calculated on the basis of on-site WUE (shortened as WUE in this work) and on-site carbon emissions (typically negligible for data centres18). Scope 2 includes off-site water footprint and carbon emissions, which are contingent on the local grid power supply portfolio. Scope 3, representing embodied water footprint and carbon emissions during facility manufacturing, lies beyond the spatial scope of this study. A regional PUE and WUE model, following the idea in previous research30,50, is applied to estimate the PUE and WUE values of AI data centres in different states. This hybrid model integrates thermodynamics and statistical data to generate estimations on the basis of local climate data. Specifically, we collected the average climate data of each state between 2024 and 2030 from an existing climate model52, which is then employed in calculating the PUE and WUE values of each state. Considering that the specific cooling settings for AI data centres are unknown, the base values are calculated by averaging the worst and best cases. The model parameters are detailed in Supplementary Table 2. Subsequently, the Scope 2 water footprint and carbon emissions are calculated on the basis of the grid water and carbon factors derived from the ReEDS model31. This approach also allows us to incorporate the projected data-centre load data, which can further interact with the grid system through services such as demand response. The validation of the ReEDS model results by using current high-resolution data is presented in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8, and the related discussion is presented in section 4 of Supplementary Information. Optimization and analytical techniques are employed to determine optimal parameters during the simulation to generate the best and worst practices concerning industrial efficiency efforts, spatial distributions and grid decarbonization. Moreover, the water scarcity and remaining renewable energy potential data of each state are computed on the basis of the calculated environmental cost and standard data from previous literature18,65. The preceding calculation process depends mainly on previously established approaches, and its integration into our framework is further discussed in sections 3 and 4 of Supplementary Information.

Uncertainties and limitations

There are substantial uncertainties inherent in projecting the evolution of AI servers. Our analysis presents a range of scenarios based on current data to evaluate the impacts of data-centre operational efficiency, spatial distribution and grid development. However, several key uncertainties remain an unmodelled field for this work. For a better understanding of our study and to outline future research directions, these uncertainties are categorized as follows:

Model and algorithm innovations: the model and algorithm breakthroughs in the AI industry could fundamentally alter computing requirements.

Supply-chain uncertainties: the complex production process of AI servers may reveal new bottlenecks beyond the current CoWoS technology, leading to varying expansion patterns.

Hardware and facility evolutions: continued improvements in AI computing hardware and data-centre efficiency may substantially affect the environmental impact of these servers.

Out-of-scope factors: there are other major contributors that are out of the scope of this study and would be critical to the process, such as market forces and geopolitical influences.

The impacts of these factors are multifaceted and challenging to model with existing data. For example, while the recent release of DeepSeek has been interpreted as reducing the energy demands of AI servers, it may also trigger a rebound effect by spurring increased AI computing activity, ultimately resulting in higher overall energy, water and carbon footprints43. However, no fresh data have become available to simulate this complex process, based on our best knowledge when drafting. To further assess the influence of unpredictable uncertainties, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on key factors, including manufacturing capacities for AI servers, US allocation ratios, server lifetimes, idle and maximum power ratios and training/inference distributions. As shown in Fig. 6, our findings suggest that the key conclusions of this study are expected to remain robust as long as the impact of future uncertainties does not notable exceed the ranges considered. Given the highly dynamic nature of AI evolution, our modelling approach allows for future revisions as more data become available on potential shifts in industry trends.

She didn’t know until 2022 that all three of her homes were right above the plume, a Superfund Site that is a remnant of the neighborhood’s historical dry cleaning and metalworking industry.
The Meeker Avenue Plume was first discovered in 2007 and was declared a national Superfund Site in 2022, meaning it gets prioritized for cleanup with federal funding.
“It makes me feel like the institutions that are supposed to watch over this are totally failing us,” Ray said.
The office of Kristen Gonzalez, a state senator representing New York’s District 59, confirmed that discussions are ongoing regarding such legislation.","Upon entering Heidi Vanderlee’s railroad apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, a visitor will hear her two cats purr from opposite ends—but will not see or smell anything unusual apart from that. The threat from pollutants wafting out of the Meeker Avenue Plume, a contaminated Superfund Site under the four-story building, is invisible.

“I’ve lived within the plume without knowing it the whole time,” said the 40-year-old entertainment publicist.

It’s Vanderlee’s third apartment in the neighborhood since moving to Greenpoint in 2008. She didn’t know until 2022 that all three of her homes were right above the plume, a Superfund Site that is a remnant of the neighborhood’s historical dry cleaning and metalworking industry. While she lives on the third floor and the vapors primarily affect the lower levels, she feels that every tenant in the building should know if they are at risk of breathing in hazardous chemical vapors seeping through foundation cracks and dirt floors. Long-term exposure to these vapors is known to cause cancer, reproductive health problems, and nervous system damage. The landlord never told Vanderlee and tenants of the other seven units because he was never required to — and that is what she and others are trying to change by pushing a new state-level right-to-know legislation that would make Superfund Site disclosure mandatory.

“My landlord wants our rent and not to be bothered,” said Vanderlee about her landlord, who owns four buildings in the plume and lives in one of them. “He won’t do stuff if he’s not legally required to do it. He doesn’t even get his own building tested.” (NYCity News Service could not independently verify this claim.)

The Meeker Avenue Plume was first discovered in 2007 and was declared a national Superfund Site in 2022, meaning it gets prioritized for cleanup with federal funding. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been in charge of investigating the full extent of the contamination from this site in the area of Brooklyn that potentially affects 1,000 buildings — and developing a cleanup plan. To determine whether a building is affected by vapor intrusion and needs mitigation vents, the EPA must take air samples inside. While this testing is free, landlords must give permission.

“That is absolutely the hardest thing,” said John Brennan, EPA’s remedial project manager. Landlords deny access for many reasons. However, most often “people don’t want to know,” or are afraid that it might negatively affect their property values, said Brennan.

Tenants have been frustrated with that tendency to ignore what could be a serious problem. The issue has come up at many community meetings—usually attended by 15 to 25 people, and sometimes as many as 50—as well as in individual conversations, said Brennan. In September 2024, the EPA estimated that 25 landlords had outright denied the agency access for testing. “The number has probably gone up slightly since that time,” Brennan added. Vanderlee, who is a member of the Meeker Community Advisory Group, which is the point of contact between the EPA and the local community, attributes the reticence of landlords in the area to “greed” that is “pretty gross,” she said.

The EPA can enforce testing in some cases, but only for very compelling reasons and on a case-by-case basis, Brennan says, for example, if the tenant is pregnant and much more at-risk for the health issues arising from the plume. The last time the EPA enforced testing was in early 2024.

Even after a building is tested, surrounding residents have a hard time getting a hold of the results because of privacy laws. Instead of releasing the individual results of the 240 tested buildings, the EPA published cluster maps, which only give a rough idea of where contamination hotspots are. Residents are pushing back against this opacity.

“If there is a contamination problem of this scale, I think the tenants should have a right to know,” said Anne Ray, 46, a fiction writer who has lived within the plume-affecter area since 2017.

She discovered the plume from an EPA flyer on her door. Worried about harming her good relationship with her landlord, Ray didn’t want to bring up testing again. She said that her landlord had previously denied her request in 2023. However, an official rule that would enforce testing would go a long way towards convincing a “law-abiding” person like him, she said, but no such rule currently exists.

“It makes me feel like the institutions that are supposed to watch over this are totally failing us,” Ray said. “And it makes me feel angry.”

The Meeker Community Advisory Group has been trying to push legislation that would require landlords to disclose potential Superfund exposure at the state level for about a year, and things seem to be moving. The office of Kristen Gonzalez, a state senator representing New York’s District 59, confirmed that discussions are ongoing regarding such legislation. Assembly Member Emily Gallagher, who represents District 50, including Greenpoint and parts of Williamsburg, said in a statement that she “would absolutely support legislation that provides tenants with more transparency and agency, and I look forward to its introduction.”

Natalie Vichnevsky, 49, a member of the advisory group, noted that such a legislation would be “something to build on.”",https://cdn.nycitynewsservice.com/blogs.dir/9/files/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-10-at-8.03.18-PM-1152x759.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:19.014125

The funding deal also allows the company to call on an additional $6M of equity funding should the need arise, for a total investment of up to $16M.

The funds will be used to scale production of the Company’s proprietary organic flow battery electrolyte beyond the United States and demonstrate its efficacy in real-world field pilot demonstrations by pairing it with commercially available flow battery hardware.

“The close of our Series A funding round represents a key milestone for Quino Energy on our mission to establish our safe, low-cost flow batteries as the leading solution for mid- to long-duration energy storage, as well as for multi-cycle per day applications,” said Eugene Beh, Co-Founder and CEO at Quino Energy. “Because our organic electrolyte can be used in vanadium flow battery hardware with minimal modification, we will be able to scale rapidly in partnership with our friends and allies in the flow battery industry. The new electrolyte factory we are planning will enable production at a cost lower than vanadium, the incumbent flow battery electrolyte. Ultimately, we expect to come in at just one-quarter the cost of vanadium at GWh scale and bring big cost reductions to the entire flow battery industry.”

Quino Energy’s flow battery technology and electrolyte production process present numerous strategic advantages in today’s energy storage and utility markets, including a lower cost floor compared to lithium-ion systems and far below that of vanadium flow batteries. The company’s organic flow battery electrolyte is created through an innovative, zero-waste continuous-flow production process, using inexpensive and abundant feedstocks derived from coal tar. Besides being backward-compatible with mature, established vanadium flow battery hardware, Quino Energy’s mildly alkaline, chloride-free electrolyte is also broadly compatible with carbon steel tanks ubiquitous in oil storage infrastructure that could be repurposed as battery storage facilities.

""Atri, a company headquartered out of Hyderabad, India, focuses on providing 'Socially Relevant & Economically Viable' Energy Transition solutions to users at large – all driven by access to cutting-edge technologies. At Atri, we believe that the world needs reliable, sustainable yet commercially viable alternatives for LDES needs, quickly,” said S Kishore, Founder of Atri Energy Transition. “Quino Energy’s organic electrolyte can revolutionize the energy storage sector by enabling large scale deployment of commercially-viable LDES solutions. We are excited to partner with Quino and believe that this partnership will lead to penetration of flow battery technology across the world.""

Earlier this year, Quino Energy received a $10M grant from the California Energy Commission and $5M in funding from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Critical Facility Energy Resilience (CiFER) program to support a 5 MWh flow battery deployment in Southern California. Quino Energy also secured a strategic agreement with TerraFlow Energy to advance organic electrolyte chemistries for use in large-format flow battery solutions in June 2025. The company has also previously received funding through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)’s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office (AMMTO) to support the development of its pilot electrolyte production line in Buffalo, New York.

The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality issued Ozone Action Day alerts for 41 of those days.

In October, the state environmental commission issued eight alerts. That was a drop from September, which saw 14 ozone alerts issued, the most of any month this year, according to data from the North Central Texas Council of Governments, the agency tasked with monitoring Fort Worth-Dallas air quality.

Such alerts are issued when smog is forecasted to exceed the federal limit of 70 parts per billion.

Ozone measured between 71 and 85 parts per billion is considered unhealthy for sensitive groups including young children, older adults, people with respiratory conditions and those active outdoors, according to the council of governments.

The alerts inform the public when weather conditions are favorable for ozone so they can adjust daily routines to minimize health risks and exposure to unhealthy air conditions. The alerts also serve businesses and industries, urging them to mitigate emissions, such as those generated by cars and power plants.

By Nov. 10 last year, 43 alerts were issued for Fort Worth-Dallas. While alerts have yet to be issued this month, the public could see additional days of high levels of air pollution as ozone season begins in March and runs through November, according to the state environmental commission.

Exposure to ozone can cause health issues such as chest pain, trouble breathing, coughing, irritation and congestion. The gas can also exacerbate respiratory conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and cancer.

Major polluters in North Texas could face annual fines of $45 million if ozone is not brought down to or below 70 parts per billion by 2027 under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Air Act.

Whether companies in violation will see those fines is uncertain as EPA officials propose changes to deregulate energy companies.

Within days of his presidency, Donald Trump vowed to roll back federal regulations. That includes revoking the scientific finding from 2009 that allows the EPA to enforce climate change-focused regulations on cars, power plants and other major sources of greenhouse gases.

In June, the EPA announced the closing of its Office of Research and Development, which analyzes health dangers stemming from toxic chemicals, climate change, smog, wildfires, indoor air contaminants and water pollutants, according to a report from National Public Radio.

The proposal to revoke the 2009 scientific finding requires a lengthy review process, including public comment, before it can be finalized next year, according to the Public Broadcasting Service.

Environmental advocacy groups are expected to challenge the ruling in court if implemented.

Meanwhile, the council of governments is developing the Dallas-Fort Worth Air Quality Improvement Plan, a several hundred page document consisting of strategies to improve North Texas air quality.

The council of governments has until Dec. 1 to submit the plan in order to be considered for federal grant funding.

With utilities rushing to build new gas-fired power plants in order to support the power demands of AI projects, environmental experts have warned that data centers could upend progress toward reigning in emissions.","When Cornell University systems engineer Fengqi You started modeling the environmental footprint of data centers three years ago, the AI boom was just beginning. Even then, You and his colleagues noticed something missing from the conversation.

“When we started this, we saw that AI was growing very fast,” You said. “It was clear it would have to be aligned with power-grid planning, with water and other resource planning. There were no discussions about these topics—but we wanted to bring real numbers, rigorous analysis on AI’s physical footprints.”

You and his team’s new paper, published Monday in the journal Nature Sustainability, delivers those numbers—and they’re enormous. Depending on how fast the AI industry expands, the authors predict U.S. data centers could annually consume as much water as 10 million Americans and emit as much carbon dioxide as 10 million cars. Those estimates put the annual resource consumption of the AI industry in the range of the entire state of New York.

Despite the sobering forecast, You and his fellow researchers are optimistic about the possibility of addressing the issue of data centers through sound policy. The report highlights the necessity of decarbonizing the electrical grid, improving energy and water usage efficiency inside data centers and moving the AI industry to areas of the country better suited to its sustainable development.

“We’re still early in this growth, it’s in our hands now,” You said. “It’s not too late yet to do the planning and accounting for resource constraints that could let AI continue to grow.”

Where to Build—and Where Not To

The study highlights that from one state to the next, the environmental cost of AI looks radically different. It breaks down grid mixes and water resources state by state to show how the data center boom will affect various parts of the country differently, and outlines policy suggestions that can mitigate its impact.

The world’s densest data center hub remains Northern Virginia’s “data center alley” outside of Washington, D.C., where the industry clustered itself over decades because of tax breaks, fiber infrastructure and proximity to federal agencies. Now that the demand for data center construction is exploding, You warns that Northern Virginia “won’t have enough resources to support the growth of the AI industry in a sustainable way, there are too many constraints in terms of energy and water.”

The report projects that through 2030, Northern Virginia will continue to be the dominant location for data center construction, despite the area’s resource constraints. That’s why, You argues, policymakers need to be pushing companies now to start looking away from Northern Virginia and toward states with more sustainable prospects for the AI boom.

“The key point we’re trying to make is that for the new projects, we have a chance to decide right now,” You said. “And we need to think about somewhere else.”

The study points to Midwestern states in particular, where water availability and the potential for renewable energy infrastructure could help mitigate the strain that data center construction exerts on resources and emissions.

“States like Texas, Montana, Nebraska, for instance, they have enough water supply and have good targets for getting clean energy and sufficient power supply,” You said.

By redirecting AI infrastructure to these regions, the researchers argue, the U.S. could sharply reduce the environmental impact of the industry without a major slowdown in its growth.

A Fork in the Road for Climate

The paper’s findings arrive amid escalating alarm over AI’s growing appetite for electricity and resources. With utilities rushing to build new gas-fired power plants in order to support the power demands of AI projects, environmental experts have warned that data centers could upend progress toward reigning in emissions.

A report released last month by the Center for Biological Diversity estimated that, if current trends continue, data centers in the United States could account for nearly half of all emissions from the power sector that current national climate targets would allow.

The report warned that “because of expected fossil fuel–reliant AI data center growth, all other electricity-consuming sectors would need to increase their carbon-emissions cuts by 60%” in order to still meet the United States’ 2035 climate target.

Jean Su, one of the report’s authors, told ICN that despite the current obsession with AI, “unfettered data center growth is not an inevitability.”

“Technology optimists are saying AI is going to solve the climate emergency and cure cancer,” Su said. “But the way to actually resolve the climate emergency is to phase out fossil fuels. Scientists have already told us how to do it, we don’t need AI, we just need political will.”

But political headwinds in the U.S. are blowing in the opposite direction, with President Donald Trump gutting renewable energy projects and vocally championing the use of coal and gas. “Projections show that data centers are going to be powered by fracked gas through 2035,” Su said, “and that’s in the political interest of the president and in the interest of the fracked gas industry.”

Su stressed that the public interest needs to become part of the conversation around data center construction, with residents given the opportunity to weigh in on whether new projects in their home states will actually benefit them.

You’s study shows that the Biden administration’s 2035 climate goals—slashing greenhouse gas emissions across the economy and transitioning the U.S. power sector away from carbon pollution entirely—remain technically achievable, but only if AI infrastructure aligns with major policy changes. The authors point to the need for tighter regulation, greater transparency and AI-specific benchmarks for energy and water usage, not unlike fuel efficiency standards for vehicles.

The study adds to a growing body of reports which emphasize how the next few years will be crucial in determining how the AI boom affects climate issues in the United States. According to Su, the country must decide who this new technology will truly serve.

“We can’t let billionaire corporations dictate policy while the rest of us pay the price,” she said. “We have to ask what’s actually in the public interest.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2217198248-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:01.647787

By the same token, the region could be well-positioned to capitalize on robust reshoring incentives.

Thanks largely to Michiganders, the U.S. exports $79 billion in motor vehicles (fourth after pharmaceuticals, fossil fuels and aerospace technology). The U.S., however, imports $146 billion in motor vehicle parts, each one affecting sticker prices and, in a sense, the fortunes of businesses of every size.

Deloitte, realizing the myriad questions that changes to trade policy raise for U.S. manufacturers, recently analyzed the current landscape and offered guidance to industry leaders. The bottom line: Companies must remain agile while balancing resilience and cost.

New policies, new impacts

According to Deloitte’s report, “Enhancing Supply Chain Resilience in a New Era of Policy,” U.S. manufacturing growth has been trending positively for more than a decade. Manufacturing establishments increased from roughly 334K to 410K from 2013 to 2024, and construction spending rose by $181 billion over the same span.

However, also on the rise is supply chain volatility. U.S. manufacturers, impacted by the pandemic, geopolitical dynamics, trade tensions, rising costs and labor shortages, have reshored or nearshored their supply chains in recent years. Supply chain strategy is likely to continue to evolve as the current administration seeks to prioritize and incentivize domestic manufacturing. In fact, a recent survey by The Conference Board of over 1,700 global C-Suite executives found 71% of CEOs plan to alter their supply chains over the next three to five years.

Tax, regulatory and energy policies are also affecting supply chain decision-making. Despite this, 78.2% of respondents to a Q3 2025 National Association of Manufacturers survey cited trade uncertainties as their top business challenge.

Canada and Mexico are critical factors in supply chain decision making. Motor vehicles are the top imports from these neighbors, who along with China are the U.S.’s top three trading partners. And motor vehicle parts are the U.S.’s number-three imported manufactured product category, $82 billion of which comes from Canada and Mexico. New surcharges on imported steel and aluminum could further affect domestic auto manufacturing decisions.

Looking ahead to further manufacturing growth

Deloitte’s report offers several considerations that could help manufacturers bolster growth in this uncertain environment.

Conduct scenario planning. Assess a range of potential trade-policy effects on manufacturing costs. Map exposure based on the country of origin for parts and materials, and factor in potential for trade deals or reactions from trading partners.

Implement near-term strategies. Consider front-loading imports to secure inventory. Seek to renegotiate supplier contracts based on new trade costs. Apply for any available exemptions or exclusions. Evaluate transfer pricing strategies and assess first sale for export customs valuation structures.

Evaluate overall supply chain strategies. In addition to near-term tactics, manufacturers may need to consider reconfiguring the supply chain for long-term advantage. Key decision factors include availability of skilled labor; tax, regulatory and energy policy; proximity to key plants and customers; and geopolitical risk.

Improve the worker experience. Use digital tools to attract and retain talent and take an ecosystem approach to hiring and developing the workforce.

Monitor the landscape. Manufacturers can continuously watch for potential changes in trade policy and key economic indicators (e.g., inflation, interest rates and consumer confidence).

These actions can help companies prepare for whatever comes next, even though predicting exactly what that is can be challenging. In any case, U.S. trade policy could affect Michiganders.",https://s3-rd-prod.crainsdetroit.com/styles/1200x630/s3/ind_man_glb_ho_2158_lo.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:29.904203

Glenfarne has selected Baker Hughes as its supplier for main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. Baker Hughes has also committed to a strategic investment to support Alaska LNG. The agreements were announced today in a ceremony in Washington, D.C. with Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.

“Baker Hughes is a welcome partner for Alaska LNG because of their leadership in LNG compression technology,” said Brendan Duval, CEO and founder of Glenfarne. “Their participation reflects Alaska LNG’s momentum and its ability to attract global partners to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman & CEO of Baker Hughes. “Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

“American LNG is not just an energy source, it’s a strategic asset that powers our economy, strengthens our alliances, and secures our nation’s future,” said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “By forging this strategic alliance and investment in the Alaska LNG Project, we’re strengthening our nation’s energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence and global competitiveness. Together, through partnerships with industry leaders like Glenfarne and Baker Hughes, we’re building the infrastructure and partnerships that ensure U.S. leadership in reliable, responsible, and affordable energy for decades to come – starting in Alaska.”

“Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history,” said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “Today’s investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska’s energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.”

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two financially independent phases to accelerate project execution. Phase One consists of an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet Alaska’s domestic energy needs. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis for the pipeline in December leading into a final investment decision on this phase of the project.

Phase Two of the project will add the LNG terminal and related infrastructure to enable 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG export capability and is expected to declare FID in late 2026.

Glenfarne became lead developer of Alaska LNG in March. Since then, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments with leading LNG buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand for 11 MPTA of LNG, more than 60% of the volume needed to reach FID, including recent agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc. and POSCO International Corporation.

Glenfarne’s permitted North American LNG portfolio totals 32.8 MTPA of capacity across projects in Alaska, Texas, and Louisiana. The companies previously announced that Baker Hughes will supply compression equipment for Glenfarne’s Texas LNG project.

Investments in wind and solar fell 18% year-over-year (YOY) for the first half of 2025. Nonetheless, energy capacity growth in the United States remains highly focused in the renewables corner, representing more than 30 gigawatts year-to-date (YTD) as of September.

Some experts predict renewables deployment could continue to grow into 2026, in spite of supply chain pressures, uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and a shifting policy landscape. Some sections of the alternative energy market—specifically, nuclear energy and clean hydrogen—may be particularly attractive to investors, thanks to surging demand from data centers and a more supportive position from both sides of the political aisle. With that in mind, the three exchange-traded funds (ETFs) below are worth keeping an eye on heading into the new year.

URA Is a High-Flying Uranium Equities ETF

The Global X Uranium ETF NYSEARCA: URA provides a targeted play on the expected long-term resurgence in uranium demand. With estimates suggesting reactor demand could double by 2040, URA offers investors exposure to a portfolio with 50 uranium-focused equities.

The ETF is highly concentrated in two of the biggest names—Cameco Corp. NYSE: CCJ and Oklo Inc. NYSE: OKLO, representing 22% and 14% of the portfolio, respectively—but is otherwise fairly diversified.

URA also has a position in the Sprott Physical Uranium Trust Fund OTCMKTS: SRUUF, providing some exposure to physical uranium.

About two-thirds of the portfolio represents companies based in Canada or the United States, two key centers for the uranium industry.

URA has shone brightly this year, climbing by about 87% YTD. Though it is fairly expensive with an expense ratio of 0.69%, investors expecting this rally to continue may find the cost to be well worth it.

NLR Offers Broader Nuclear Exposure With Lower Fees

Investors seeking a slightly cheaper alternative to URA might turn to the VanEck Uranium+Nuclear Energy ETF NYSEARCA: NLR. NLR is also a globally-focused ETF with a broader mandate that covers companies related to all aspects of the nuclear energy industry. This means that NLR's basket includes mining firms, companies that build nuclear reactors, those that produce energy from nuclear sources, and more.

While the strategy is broad, NLR's portfolio itself is narrower than URA's.

NLR has only 27 holdings, and it is highly concentrated—more than half of its assets are invested in just 10 companies.

Nonetheless, NLR is a popular option among investors seeking wide exposure to the nuclear industry as a whole, while those favoring a uranium-focused strategy might opt for URA instead.

NLR has also posted impressive results this year, climbing by about 74% YTD. Its annual fee is 0.56%, still expensive compared with passively managed ETFs, but more competitive within the niche space of nuclear energy funds.

HYDR Bets on Hydrogen's Explosive Growth Potential

Clean hydrogen has massive growth potential, with production estimated to increase by 28 times in the next five years. The Global X Hydrogen ETF NASDAQ: HYDR is currently the only pure-play hydrogen fund available and could benefit significantly if this growth materializes.

Still, investors should keep in mind that this fund is small (it has just $81 million in managed assets and has a low one-month average trading volume of around 71,000) and therefore higher risk than some other options in the alternative energy space.

HYDR's portfolio is narrow, aligning with the relatively small corner of the market dedicated to clean hydrogen technology and production.

The fund holds just 26 positions, with the largest two representing a combined half of the invested funds. Still, investors willing to take the risk might find that HYDR's sizable returns of about 104% YTD make it quite compelling. Additionally, the fund's expense ratio is 0.50%, which is lower than the other two ETFs on this list.

Although many drivers question this practice, automakers provide information on charging times up to 80% because this area concentrates the maximum charging powerin addition to protecting the battery lifeTherefore, this disclosure presents more efficient figures that are consistent with real-world use.

From the start, the batteries achieve better performance between 20% and 80%Since they receive energy with less resistance. However, when this value is exceeded, the vehicles automatically reduce power to preserve the internal cells. In this way, the final stage becomes slower and more sensitive.

How does the reduced charging speed work?

As the industry explains, the loading process involves exothermic electrochemical reactions...which release heat throughout the charging process. Therefore, in the last 20%, the temperature naturally increases. And, for this reason, the charging rate decreases, preventing... internal damage to the lithium-ion complex.

The technical explanation from the SAE Brazil expert.

Second Maria de Fátima RosolemAccording to , a member of the SAE Brazil Electric Vehicle Technical Committee, the final stage of recharging is the most critical phase. She states that Excess energy can generate additional heat., which causes irreversible damage to the structures of the cells. In this way, frequently completing the 100% This increases system stress, reducing autonomy over time.

Why recharging to 80% preserves the battery.

Consequently, when recharging up to 80%By reducing the natural mechanisms of degradation, the driver can mitigate the effects of the electrical system. Even if this limits some of the range, the practice prolongs the lifespan and improves the stability of the electrical system. ""By recharging to 80% of the SOC, degradation mechanisms are reduced, which prolongs battery life.""""That's why the limit functions as a..."" Rosolem reinforces. protection strategy widely used in the industry.

Calibration is required for some models.

Although not all vehicles prominently display this information, some models occasionally require a full recharge to calibrate the battery's internal reading. Despite this, the ideal daily charging level is up to 80%.

Key points about the procedure:

• Maximum power occurs between 20% and 80%.

• Above 80%, the car reduces the charging speed.

• Charging to 100% frequently accelerates degradation.

• Recharging up to 80% protects the lithium-ion battery pack.

• Some models require occasional full load to calibrate the system.

What does this practice mean for the future of electric mobility?

Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.
“There’s no stopping it,” said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement.
Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.
“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England.","BELEM, Brazil — The world has changed dramatically in the decade since leaders celebrated a historic climate agreement in Paris a decade ago, but not quite in ways they expected or wanted.

Earth’s warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.

There’s been progress — more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 — but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.

“I think it’s important that we’re honest with the world and we declare failure,” said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming’s harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.

But diplomats aren’t giving up.

“We’re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.

But the speed of humanity’s climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate’s harms, she said, adding that means that “the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.”

U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is “obviously falling behind.”

“We’re sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,” she said.

Danger signs

The planet’s annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.

Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia’s Siberia.

Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.

Wildfires have consumed parts of Hawaii, California, Europe and Australia. Floods have devastated parts of Pakistan, China and the American South. And many of those, but not all, have had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change, scientists have calculated.

Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world’s glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That’s the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.

Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world’s seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it’s enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.

Even the Amazon, where the climate negotiations will convene, has gone from a planet-saving region that sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air to a region that, because of deforestation, at times is spewing them.

Success in bending the curve

But there’s also a lot that officials celebrate in the past 10 years.

Renewable energy is now cheaper in most places than polluting coal, oil and natural gas. Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green choices, according to two July U.N. reports. In 2015, a half-million electric vehicles were sold globally, and last year it was 17 million, the report said.

“There’s no stopping it,” said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. “You cannot hold back the tides.”

In 2015, U.N. projections figured that Earth was on path for almost 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s. Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.

But that’s nowhere near the goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a level that scientific reports say is more or less the danger line and which became the Paris Agreement’s overarching goal.

“Ten years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 degrees C entirely,” Rockstrom said. “Now we are 10 years later. We have failed.”

A report examining dozens of indicators of progress — such as solar and wind power installations — in transitioning from a fossil fuel economy found that none were on pace for keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degree goal.

The report by the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Analytics, the Climate High-Level Champions, ClimateWorks Foundation and World Resources Institute found that 35 of them are at least going in the right direction, although far too slowly.

“Technologies, once hypothetical, are now becoming a reality. And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,” said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. “But it’s not nearly fast enough for what’s needed.”

Pollution keeps growing

Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.

Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China’s going up 15.5% and India’s soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.

Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.

“The Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,” said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. “Unfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can’t say it’s failed. But then nor can you say it’s dramatically succeeded.”",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/11/Climate-summit-2015-AP.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 20:00:33.866691

Virtual power plants gaining momentum

In its third-quarter investor presentation Thursday, Sunrun said it had more than 106,000 customers enrolled in home-to-grid virtual power plant programs. That figure is up over 400% from a year ago. Sunrun expects enrollments to continue rising in the years ahead, and estimates $2,000 in value per participating subscriber.

Sunrun already has 3.7 GWh of dispatchable battery capacity online and aims to have 10 GWh active by the end of 2028, it said. The company operates one of the United States’ largest virtual power plants, with 416 MW dispatched last year across 17 active VPP programs, CEO Mary Powell said Thursday.

As a leading U.S. installer of residential solar and energy storage systems, Sunrun is well-suited to grid flexibility programs, it says. It has more than 1 million customers, more than 217,000 of whom have solar with attached battery storage. In the second quarter, the most recent period for which it provided data, Sunrun said it accounted for 21% of residential solar installations in the U.S. and 42% of energy storage installations.

Though Sunrun also sells solar and storage systems directly to customers, it says leasing subscriptions account for more than 95% of its sales.

The subscription model — also known as leasing or third-party ownership — allows it to retain ownership of and monetize the equipment it installs through federal clean energy investment tax credits, tax equity financing and participation in VPP programs. Sunrun has 36% of the U.S. market for solar subscriptions, according to its third-quarter investor presentation.

Sunrun said Thursday its emphasis on subscriptions will also help it avoid a widely expected sales cliff when the federal tax credit for customer-owned solar systems expires at the end of next month. While analysts foresee the U.S. solar market contracting as much as 30% in 2026 and 2027, Sunrun said it expects “positive volume growth and margin expansion” next year.

Steady battery attachment growth

Powell and other Sunrun executives have repeatedly touted Sunrun’s shift to a “storage-first” posture following unfavorable changes to net metering policy for solar-only customers in key markets like California.

The strategy appears to be paying off with steady growth in Sunrun’s battery attachment rate for new customers, which rose from 60% in Q3 2024 to reach 70% in the second and third quarter of 2025.

Powell said Sunrun’s attachment rate is growing quickly in markets beyond the sunny southwestern United States. In Massachusetts, for example, attachments surged from 10% at the start of 2025 to more than 50% in the third quarter, she said. And Sunrun has circled back to attach storage for more than 2,000 solar-only customers, a market Powell said would be key for long-term value creation.

“We believe this will … produce strong expected upfront margins for Sunrun and serve as an accelerant to growth in our distributed power plant capacity,” she said.

Focus on subscriber value from solar leases

Sunrun’s subscriber value reached $52,446 in the third quarter, up 11% from a year ago. After accounting for customer acquisition costs, net subscriber value was $13,205, up 38% year over year.

Aggregate subscriber value, or the total value of all Sunrun subscribers, rose 10% year over year to reach $1.6 billion. Creation costs rose just 3% year over year to land at $1.2 billion. Sunrun attributed the increased margin to operational efficiencies, cost controls, growth in higher-value offerings like its Flex product and support from the federal clean energy investment tax credit, which extends through 2027 for third-party owned solar and battery systems. Those improvements that outpaced the added costs of attaching storage at more customer sites, Sunrun said.

At the same time, subscriber additions declined 1% year over year to just over 30,000 in the third quarter.

Powell declined an analyst’s request for guidance on installation volumes in 2026, saying Sunrun is focused on subscriber quality over quantity.

There are specific challenges that have driven overcapacity in specific markets: heavy incentive spending in China, the U.S.'s own EV incentives and the European Union's aggressive regulations.
We've seen some companies try to divert EV battery production plans to make energy storage systems instead, for instance.
One silver lining: While EV battery demand wavers, the AI frenzy is driving up demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS).
If battery companies have too many EV batteries, they could repurpose them to help balance the grid.","Capacity to build EV batteries far outstrips demand globally, a new report says.

It's worst in China, but the overcapacity issue exists in every major market and poses financial risks for battery makers.

Material and production costs are still high, which means EVs often aren't cheaper than gas cars, reducing demand.

The electric vehicle world has a new problem: too many batteries.

Capacity for building EV batteries outpaces demand for those batteries in every major market, a new report from consulting group AlixPartners claims. In North America, there is 1.9 times as much capacity as demand. In Europe, the capacity-to-demand ratio is 2.2.

And China, there is an absolutely stunning flood of capacity: 5.6 times as much battery-building capacity as there is demand for batteries. With tariffs restricting the country's EVs and components from major markets, too, it's a tenuous time to be a Chinese battery supplier. But, frankly, it's not like things are going better in the rest of the world, as AlixPartners Senior Vice President Rohit Gujarathi explained to me.

EV battery manufacturing capacity far outstrips demand for EV batteries, putting the industry under pressure.

""At the industry scale, globally, really five times the demand versus three times the demand is not really very different. No matter where you go at this moment, the capacity is still way beyond what the demand is,"" Gujarathi said in an interview. Because even if North American capacity looks better on paper, it is under-supplied in some ways. There's very little local production of lithium-iron-phosphate batteries, for instance, which offer lower costs and better durability at the expense of density.

But there's little incentive to build new capacity right now, as existing plants are already overbuilt for current demand, the report says. There are specific challenges that have driven overcapacity in specific markets: heavy incentive spending in China, the U.S.'s own EV incentives and the European Union's aggressive regulations. Overall, though, a key factor has been that consumers just have not responded to surging electric options the way automakers, experts and regulators anticipated.

The main reason they haven't, Gujarathi says, is cost.

""What consumers care about is: 'What's the price of the vehicle?'"" he said.

""Does it make economic sense to me? The point of view right now is, in most cases, no, especially as a lot of government support has been taken away,"" he added. Despite abundant supply pushing down prices, EV battery production and material costs remain high, and companies cannot sell them for less than they cost to build in the long term. Already, this instability is putting financial pressure on battery firms.

This comes as the U.S. has now removed its federal tax credit and rolled back emissions standards that pushed automakers to offer zero-emissions vehicles. The result will likely be a contraction in the EV market, but no one can quite say how big of a drop we'll see. The numbers weren't great last month, but they also reflect that many consumers pulled forward purchases to take advantage of the tax credit before it expired on September 30.

Regardless, a shrinking market won't help the capacity-to-demand ratio. AlixPartners expects it to grow to 2.4 by 2028 and stay around that level through 2030. This reflects the firm's earlier revision of North American EV penetration in 2030. Last year, it predicted that 36% of new vehicle shoppers in the U.S. would buy EVs in 2030. This year, it revised that figure down to 18%—a 50% drop in predicted demand.

The result will likely be further consolidation of existing battery plants and efforts, including deals like the one in which General Motors sold off its stake in a battery plant it once shared with LG Energy Solution. Gujarathi said he also expects to see companies launch LFP battery factories in the U.S. to address the cost problem.

This tracks, as we already know GM is putting North American LFP batteries in the new Chevy Bolt. But overall demand for these low-cost EVs remains unproven, so expect companies to stay agile. We've seen some companies try to divert EV battery production plans to make energy storage systems instead, for instance. But regardless of how exactly companies manage the excess supply, the uncertainty of today's market is certain to impact the future of affordable EVs.

One silver lining: While EV battery demand wavers, the AI frenzy is driving up demand for battery energy storage systems (BESS). If battery companies have too many EV batteries, they could repurpose them to help balance the grid.

""What this mean is holding back on some of the investments that may happen in the future,"" Gujarathi said. Companies have to prepare to swap out technologies, battery chemistries and model plans as the situation develops.

""Everybody right now is in a holding pattern, because the ground is shifting underneath them,"" he said. It may be like that for quite a while.

On Nov. 9, 2025, the Senate agreed to vote on the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2026, to end the current government shutdown and fund portions of the federal government through a continuing resolution (CR) that would expire Jan. 30, 2026. The CR keeps current federal funding levels and applies to agencies such as CDC, HRSA, SAMHSA, and EPA. The rest of the federal government, including programs within the Department of Agriculture, FDA, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the operations of Congress would be funded through full fiscal year appropriations bills expiring on Sept. 30, 2026. The bill also specifies a number of requirements related to federal workforce, state reimbursement, and spending which are detailed in the sections that follow.

Outlook

Considering the bipartisan support for this deal to end the government shutdown, the ASTHO Government Affairs team is tentatively optimistic that the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2026, will eventually become law. However, the current political environment is volatile and if anything changes, we will issue another legislative alert. After the Senate votes on the bill, which may be delayed due to negotiations on some agriculture provisions, the House will need to approve it by a simple majority vote. If the House fails to garner enough support, then the government shutdown will continue.

Here is the full text of the bill open_in_new, the text of various extenders open_in_new, and a section-by-section summary of all sections open_in_new by the Senate majority.

Federal Workforce and State Finances

Requires the return of all federal workforce levels prior to the current lapse of appropriations on Oct. 1, 2025.

Requires that funds be apportioned to agencies at a rate that would prevent the furlough of any employee during the duration of the CR.

Prevents agencies from overspending funds for grant programs during the CR period, unless funds are required to be spent for the programs during such period. It preserves the funding level for most grant programs, subject to Congress’s decision in the full-year appropriations acts.

Explicitly states that agencies should spend money in the most limited way possible during the duration of the CR.

Directs that funds provided by the CR are available to pay federal employees who were furloughed or excepted during the lapse.

Requires reimbursement to states that carried out federal programs, to prevent a reduction in service, during the lapse.

Prevents statutory PAYGO sequestration cuts to Medicare, agriculture, and other programs.

Agriculture and FDA

Specifically, Senators agreed to advance a three-bill package that includes FY26 funding for the Department of Agriculture and the Food and Drug Administration (Ag-FDA) open_in_new, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Legislative Branch. The Ag-FDA bill open_in_new provides:

A hemp products ban, which prevents the unregulated sale of intoxicating hemp-based or hemp-derived products, including Delta-8, from being sold online, in gas stations, and corner stores, while preserving non-intoxicating CBD and industrial hemp products.

$8.2 billion for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for WIC.

$460 million for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program to assist low-income seniors.

$37.8 billion in mandatory funding for child nutrition programs, as requested by the Administration.

$107 billion in mandatory funding for SNAP, as requested by the Administration.

Reimbursement for both the SNAP and WIC contingency reserves to account for expenditures during the government shutdown.

$7 billion (budget authority and user fees), a decrease of $70 million below FY25 enacted levels, for FDA.

$1.2 billion for the Food Safety and Inspection Service.

$4.1 billion to support rural development across the country including $1.4 billion to prioritize aging water and wastewater infrastructure.

This paper examines whether information about the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)'s clean energy provisions affects public support for renewable energy policies. In a pilot survey experiment I conducted, respondents were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: (1) a general description of the clean energy provisions of the IRA, (2) a jobs-focused framing, or (3) a message about the IRA's potential repeal. A control group received no information. Preliminary results suggest that respondents exposed to any treatment express lower support for expanding the IRA, particularly Republicans. Although most acknowledge that the IRA creates jobs, this does not lead them to view the policy as beneficial for their communities and decreases support for green energy policies. On the other hand, unemployed respondents and respondents who did not know about the IRA have higher preferences for expanding the IRA. I also examine a quasi-natural experiment embedded in the survey experiment comparing ""Energy Communities""-areas receiving IRA funding-with similar areas that do not. Support for the IRA, especially among Republicans, suggesting that direct material exposure may increase support.

Over 500 new projects have yet to receive all the federal, state, and local permits necessary for deployment, and are at risk of getting “trapped in limbo,” according to a new analysis by the Solar Energy Industry Association. That’s 73 gigawatts of solar and 43 GW of storage, for a total of nearly 116 GW in new capacity that could be lost or delayed at a time when the U.S. energy system is in desperate need of new generation to meet the rising demand for electricity.

This risk is the result of a U.S. Department of the Interior’s order for increased federal oversight of solar and wind projects issued in July. The order requires any project involving federal land, permits, or rights-of-way (including those on private land) to go through a lengthy review process, culminating in the direct approval of Interior Secretary Burgum himself. It has been widely perceived as an effort to hinder the buildout of renewable energy.

The threatened projects span 44 states; in 18 of those, over 50% of planned electricity capacity is at risk, according to SEIA.

Roughly 40% of the at-risk projects are in Texas. Nearly 45 GW of the solar and storage capacity planned between 2026 and 2030 in the state hasn’t emerged from the oversight process yet, which means that the federal government could still delay or condition approvals.

Other states with a large amount of at-risk capacity include Oregon, with over 7 GW, California, with nearly 6 GW, and Nevada, with 4.7 GW.

The new risk of unpredictable opposition from the federal government adds to the existing list of threats to solar projects across the country. For the past few years, renewable developers have seen a surge in opposition to local projects, and community resistance and local ordinances have been identified as the “leading causes of project delays and cancellations,” on par with grid interconnection issues.

Delays are particularly widespread, with a recent EIA analysis finding that “solar projects representing about 20% of planned capacity reported a delay” in the third quarter of 2025. Those delays are especially common in the late construction or testing phases, right before they come online.

However, at least when it comes to delays, things are moving in the right direction; EIA found that fewer projects reported delays in 2025 compared to the same period in 2024, at 25% of planned capacity.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-11-10T180237.461.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 19:02:16.788305

“Low risk does not mean no risk,” explains Cotality’s Chief Data and Analytics Officer John Rogers.
Still, low risk does not mean no risk.
Riskiest large counties (50K+ Homes) In these counties, environmental risk is already reshaping the housing market.
In high-risk counties, insurance premiums can double or triple in just a few years.","Homeownership has long gone hand in hand with stability. But that relationship is shifting. Insurance premiums are rising. Property taxes are climbing. In some parts of the country, escrow payments, which are made up of property taxes and homeowners insurance, now exceed the cost of principal and interest.

Much of this cost increase is due to environmental risk. Although it's not always visible on a closing contract, variations in property risk profiles are redefining the market. Choice is increasingly driven by exposure.

Proximity to wildfires, floods, and hurricanes is pushing buyers to reconsider not just what they can afford — but where. And this divide is growing, according to Cotality data*. Concerns about safety and stability are reshuffling housing markets, and in the long-term, geography will define affordability.

Hundreds of counties across the U.S. are sheltered from severe natural catastrophe risk. But sheltered does not mean immune. So, when homes in these areas aren’t built for the unexpected, the consequences can be catastrophic.

“Low risk does not mean no risk,” explains Cotality’s Chief Data and Analytics Officer John Rogers. “We need to make sure that people understand what a risk score means since it’s only valuable if it can be translated into future resilience. That means tilting the conversation on physical property risk toward cooperation between homeowners, policymakers, and developers for long-term living solutions.”

Zoning laws, building codes, and home construction influence the resilience of properties and can tip a county from simply sheltered to future resilience. The opposite is also true. Without careful consideration for the resilience of individual homes, already vulnerable communities can slide into a very risky future.

Where is it safe to live in the U.S.?

Safest large counties (50K+ Homes)

These five counties benefit from low exposure to natural perils as well as a high number of homes that are built with low-risk profiles. They’re not immune—but they’re better positioned to weather the storm.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties have the advantage of a combination of elevation, inland location, and moderate weather patterns. That means fewer insurance claims, more stable premiums, and less disruption from natural disasters. In places like Skagit and Whatcom, wildfire risk is low, and flood exposure is limited. In El Paso, hurricane risk is virtually nonexistent. Still, low risk does not mean no risk. Homes across counties face varying degrees of exposure, which is why it is crucial to understand the individual risk profiles of every property.

Safest counties overall (all sizes)

Smaller counties are also showing strong climate resilience—especially in parts of Colorado and Georgia.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties are far from coastlines, sit at higher relative elevations, are surrounded by attenuating open land, or have historically low exposure to extreme weather. That translates to fewer disruptions from weather events and more predictable housing costs. In Summit County, for example, snow is common—but wildfire, flood, and storm risk remain low.

Riskiest large counties (50K+ Homes)

In these counties, environmental risk is already reshaping the housing market. Insurance costs are rising, and rebuilding after disasters is becoming both a financial and a logistical challenge.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties face the triple threat of hurricane storm surge, flooding, and wind damage. In New Orleans and Galveston, storm surge and sea-level rise are persistent threats. In Biloxi and Pascagoula, repeated hurricane landfalls have made insurance harder to access and more expensive to maintain.

Riskiest counties overall (all sizes)

Smaller coastal counties are also under pressure. Many residents are losing homes, insurance coverage, and land—literally.

Data source: Cotality, 2025

‍

Why it matters:

These counties are on the front lines, seeing the consequences of a changing environment. In the Louisiana counties of Plaquemines and Cameron, land loss from erosion and sea-level rise is accelerating. In Hancock, Mississippi and Lafourche, Louisiana, repeated storm damage has made rebuilding more expensive and less sustainable. These risks are already pricing out many homeowners.

Natural disaster risk is a housing cost

The old adage that real estate is all about location has never been more true. In high-risk counties, insurance premiums can double or triple in just a few years. That adds hundreds of dollars to monthly payments and can tip the balance for buyers who are already stretched.

Under the agreement, Baker Hughes will supply the project’s main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. The company has also made a strategic investment to support project development.

The announcement was made in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright in attendance, underscoring the administration’s support for expanding domestic LNG infrastructure.

“Baker Hughes is a welcome partner for Alaska LNG because of their leadership in LNG compression technology,” said Brendan Duval, CEO and founder of Glenfarne. “Their participation reflects Alaska LNG’s momentum and its ability to attract global partners to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

“Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy,” added Lorenzo Simonelli, Baker Hughes chairman and CEO. “We look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

The Trump administration has framed the partnership as a strategic move to strengthen U.S. energy independence and international energy leadership. “By forging this alliance and investment in Alaska LNG, we’re strengthening our nation’s energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence,” Burgum said.

Glenfarne is developing the Alaska LNG project in two phases.

Phase One will include an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline transporting natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet in-state energy needs. Engineering firm Worley is expected to complete final cost analysis in December ahead of a final investment decision.

Phase Two will add an LNG export terminal with 20 million tonnes per annum (MMtpa) of capacity, targeting a final investment decision in late 2026.

Since assuming leadership of the project earlier this year, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments for more than 60% of planned capacity, including agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc., and POSCO International Corporation.

Glenfarne’s permitted North American LNG portfolio now totals 32.8 MMtpa of capacity across projects in Alaska, Texas, and Louisiana.

Under the Advancing Renewables Program, this latest investment will support SunDrive in its collaboration with leading solar cell equipment manufacturing players Maxwell and Vistar to scale and commercialise its copper metallisation solar cell technology, from R&D at its Kurnell facility in New South Wales, to a 300 MW commercial scale production tool.

SunDrive’s copper-based process replaces silver in solar cells, aiming to cut costs and improve efficiency, supporting ARENA’s Ultra Low-Cost Solar goal. By building and testing new tools and upgrading its facility, SunDrive is working to bring this Australian innovation closer to real-world use, helping to reduce the cost of solar panels and supporting the growth of clean energy.

The funding will support SunDrive to upgrade its Kurnell facility to enable local development, deployment and refinement of production tools to further advance the technology, as well as undertake cost modelling to support the commercialisation pathway. Modules will be produced at SunDrive’s facility for in-field testing and early market acceptance.

These efforts will accelerate the adoption of copper-based solar cells and generate new licensing revenue streams for SunDrive.

ARENA CEO Darren Miller said ARENA has been a long-term supporter of SunDrive, watching them grow from humble beginnings in a Sydney garage to a leader in solar innovation.

“By tackling one of the biggest cost items in solar cell manufacturing, SunDrive is demonstrating how Australian research can drive next-generation solar innovation. Not only is copper more abundant and cheaper than silver, but SunDrive’s unique manufacturing process also results in higher cell and module efficiencies which could have huge benefits for global decarbonisation efforts,” Mr Miller said.

“We’re providing a further $25 million in funding to help scale up SunDrive’s technology which could significantly help push the boundaries of efficiency and affordability and unlock the potential of ultra low-cost solar.”

SunDrive CEO Natalie Malligan said this funding marks a major step in SunDrive’s journey, taking the leap from world-leading research to commercial reality.

“It’s a strong validation of our strategy to develop world-class solar innovation here in Australia and partner with the best in the industry to industrialise it. It shows how Australian innovation can compete globally, and how with the right support, we can take homegrown technology to the world.”

SunDrive Co-Founder Vince Allen said together with Maxwell we’ve already broken world records in cell efficiency.

“This next phase builds on that success and represents the culmination of our work to translate our copper plating technology into the industrial tools that will define the next generation of solar cell technology. With silver prices nearly tripling in three years and solar now using a third of global industrial silver, the industry urgently needs a silver-free alternative. With ARENA’s support and our partners’ expertise, this project intends to deliver a scalable mass-production solution.”

The project builds on previous ARENA funding of $14 million to demonstrate SunDrive’s copper metallisation technology. To date, ARENA has provided over $388 million to over 200 solar research and development projects.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that executives at Ford Motor is in “active discussions” about scrapping the F-150 Lightning, quoting “people familiar with the matter”. It comes just a month after the company said it was pausing production. The unnamed sources had little else to say about these discussions except that no final decision has been made.

If true, the death of the Ford F-150 Lightning could spell trouble for electric pickup trucks, or utes, in the United States.

Ford unveiled the F-150 Lightning in May of 2021 and delivered the first model a year later. It has never been officially released in Australia although some specialist importers have brought in some models, mostly for industrial and mining clients.

At launch, the F-150 Lightning boasted driving range of 370 kilometres for the base level, and up to 480 kilometres for the extended range option. The tech-heavy Flash model with an extended-range battery delivering range of up to 515 kilometres was brought to market in late 2023.

But despite huge interest and expectations at launch and over the first few years of its lifespan, the F-150 Lightning has failed to deliver on the promise of a “smartphone that can tow 10,000 pounds” – a claim made by Ford CEO Jim Farley at the car’s launch.

Despite promises that the car would sell around the $US40,000-mark, actual prices were closer to $US50,000 for the base-level model, and up to $US90,000 for higher end models.

Demand has therefore been lacklustre, and the car has subsequently been costing Ford billions since 2023. The future is even less rosy, with sales that are already well below expectations set to suffer from the withdrawal of government support for electric vehicles.

The writing may have been on the wall last month when Ford announced that it has pausing production of the F-150 Lightning.

Announced in late October, Ford first blamed the decision on a fire at one of its aluminium suppliers’ factories but matched that explanation with a concurrent ramp up of production of its F-150 gas and hybrid models, citing “strong customer demand” and claiming that these models “are more profitable for Ford and use less aluminium”.

If Ford does in fact scrap the F-150 Lightning, it will likely take solace from reports across the industry in the US. Executives at crosstown rival General Motors (GM) have reportedly been discussing discontinuing its own electric trucks, according to more unnamed people “familiar with the matter”.

Another big-name rival, Stellantis, announced in September that it was cancelling its own plans for an electric pickup, citing the slowing of “demand for full-size battery electric trucks” in North America for its axing development of the RAM 1500.

Meanwhile, Tesla has seen sales of its Cybertruck pickup plummet in 2025.

According to numbers from Cox Automotive published last month, Tesla sold only 5,400 Cybertrucks in the third quarter, down 62.6 per cent from the same period a year earlier, bringing the total number sold so far in 2025 to only 16,000 – well behind the 250,000 a year that CEO Elon Musk once declared was possible.",https://thedriven.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/F150-with-caravan-US-pic-V2.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 22:04:03.110357

Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.
Researchers focused on replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps because that one swap produces the biggest efficiency bang for the buck.
Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat.
Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades.","The data center boom has catapulted Virginia into a serious energy crunch. We have more data centers here than in any other state, by far, and four times as many more are expected in the next few years. Virginia utilities don’t generate enough electricity to serve them all; fully half of our power is imported from the regional grid. But now the regional grid is also running low on reserve power thanks to all the data center growth, according to grid operator PJM.

Most proposed solutions focus on the supply side: generating more power by building new solar, wind, gas and battery storage; keeping aging power plants running that were previously scheduled for closure; and even reopening Three Mile Island, shuttered three and a half decades ago following the worst nuclear accident in US history.

More nuanced solutions involve managing the existing generation better. Research shows that the grid could handle more data centers right now if operators ratcheted back consumption at peak times, either through installing batteries or through shifting some operations to non-peak times.

All of these approaches involve generating more power for the grid, or shifting use around to relieve grid stress at peak demand times. But there is another way to make room for new data centers: remove some existing loads.

A national advocacy organization, Rewiring America, recently released an intriguing proposal to free up grid capacity by retrofitting homes with high-efficiency heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, solar panels and energy storage. The cumulative effect would be to reduce total demand in the residential sector, making capacity available to data centers sooner, while also saving the participating residential consumers thousands of dollars on their electricity bills.

Oh, and the tech companies are going to pay for it.

I am reminded of a delightful sign I once saw announcing the coming of the best dog park ever, to be paid for by cats, itself a satire of a certain president’s pledge to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But, I notice, neither the cats nor Mexico have sent checks yet. Will Big Tech?

Rewiring America thinks so, if the policies are in place to aggregate and verify the household energy savings into a marketable package, and if buying the package means a data center can come online faster and more cheaply. Upgraded appliances and rooftop solar can be installed in a matter of weeks, compared to the many years that may be required to permit and build new generation and transmission.

Note that the proposed program would not include households that replace gas, propane or oil furnaces with heat pumps. That kind of upgrade results in greater, not less, residential electricity demand, making it counterproductive when the point is to shrink residential electricity usage.

Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.

Researchers focused on replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps because that one swap produces the biggest efficiency bang for the buck. An electric furnace is cheap to install but expensive to use; the reverse is true of a high-efficiency heat pump. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the conversion would save the average family $1,170 per year on its electricity bill. NREL calculates that heat pumps are cost-effective enough to pay for themselves in under 5 years.

According to Rewiring America, “If hyperscalers paid for 50 percent of the upfront cost of installing heat pumps in homes with electric resistance heating, they could get capacity on the grid at a price of about $344/kW-year — a similar cost to building and operating a new gas power plant, which currently costs about $315/kW-year.” (By my math, it’s an extra 10%, which might be acceptable to a power-hungry tech customer as a sort of rush fee.)

The report repeats the calculations for other technologies. Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat. Heat pump water heaters would replace conventional electric water heaters. Solar panels paired with battery storage could displace electricity the home would otherwise draw from the grid.

Further capacity could come from home batteries. The report posits, “If every single-family household in the U.S. installed a home battery, and those with a suitable roof installed a 5 kW solar system (about 11 solar panels), they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. We assume that households charge the battery off-peak, either from the grid or from rooftop solar, and they discharge the battery during peak periods to reduce the household’s contribution to peak demand.”

The researchers estimate that a mass purchasing program could squeeze costs of solar and storage down by 40%, primarily through reduced customer acquisition costs and cheaper permitting. Then the data center operators would pay 30% of this lower cost. By buying solar and storage at this now much-reduced price, households would get electricity at about a 30% discount off utility rates, while the tech companies would be able to buy capacity at a cost comparable to that of building a new gas plant.

You’ll notice the proposal assumes tech companies pay only a portion of the costs for the residential upgrades, so residents still face upfront costs – 50% of the cost of heat pumps, 70% of a hopefully-lowered price for solar and batteries. Rewiring America calculates that residents will come out ahead under all scenarios, while the data centers will pay only a little more than they would otherwise have to pay, buying capacity they might not otherwise be able to get.

Because Virginia has so many more data centers than anywhere else on earth, Rewiring America calculates that all of these investments would meet only 25% of our projected new data center demand. Other states could do much better, fully meeting projected new demand across most of the country and even exceeding it in about half the states. Virginia would presumably stand to benefit from surplus capacity in other PJM states.

Obviously, these calculations describe a best-case scenario, and I have my doubts about whether the uptake would be anywhere near what they believe is possible. Still, even capturing just a portion of the efficiency potential Rewiring America believes is there would relieve some of the pressure on the grid.

But is there really that much low-hanging efficiency fruit in Virginia? If the NREL data that the researchers use is correct, more than 300,000 single family homes in Virginia have electric furnaces. Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades. Our utilities have been running energy efficiency programs for years that are supposed to help residents save energy. Can there really be that many single-family homes that have not converted to heat pumps yet?

I consulted Andrew Grigsby, a home energy efficiency expert who is currently the energy services director at Viridiant, a nonprofit focused on sustainable buildings. Grigsby shared my doubts about the accuracy of NREL’s estimate of the number of homes with electric resistance heat, saying it was at odds with his experience. He also felt that an efficiency program would save more energy at less cost by targeting improvements to the needs of each home, instead of supplying a blanket solution.

But he also refuted my assumption that most of the low-hanging fruit should have been picked by now. “Virginia has 100,000 homes (at least) where three hours work and $50 in materials would reduce heating/cooling costs by 25% — via fixing the obvious, massive duct leakage,” he said in an email.

This doesn’t mean Rewiring America’s approach wouldn’t save energy; rather, it supports the conclusion that there is a massive opportunity for energy efficiency savings that Virginia hasn’t fully tapped into.

Legislators have tried. The VCEA set efficiency targets for Dominion and APCo, and the SCC followed up with further targets. APCo has consistently met its goals, Dominion has not. A review of Dominion’s sad little list of programs available to homeowners suggests that the problem is a lack of ambition, not a lack of opportunity.

An aggressive, third-party operated efficiency program would complement the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) pilot program that Dominion is developing in accordance with legislation passed in the 2025 session. The VPP’s goal is to shift some consumption to off-peak times, while the Rewiring America proposal would reduce overall consumption.

Both seek to achieve time-shifting through incentivizing residents to invest in home batteries, their only area of overlap. But whereas the VPP legislation set only 15 MW as its baseline target for home batteries, the Rewiring America proposal could incentivize much more, along with the solar systems to charge them.

The problem remains how to get tech companies to pay for it. My contact at Rewiring America, senior director of communications Alex Amend, pointed me to approaches being undertaken in other states. Minnesota legislation requires data centers to contribute between $2 million and $5 million annually toward energy conservation programs that benefit low-income households. Georgia Power is expected to file a large load tariff that, says Amend, includes pathways for off-site, behind-the-meter solutions.

Here in Virginia, though, both APCo and Dominion, as well as some co-ops, have already submitted large-load tariff proposals to the SCC as part of their rate cases. None of the proposals include incentives for demand reductions anywhere, much less the residential sector. Indeed, given Dominion’s track record on efficiency, the SCC would have to take the initiative to meld a large load tariff for data centers with the VPP program and aggressive home efficiency investments.

The SCC has announced plans to hold a technical conference on Dec. 12 to examine data center load flexibility. Rewiring America hopes to participate to lay out its proposal in more detail.

Even Musk’s much-hyped “Optimus” robot project, which the billionaire said last week is likely to be Tesla’s biggest new business, quit in June.
Last week, Musk suggested that Tesla’s two-door Cybercab will arrive by the second quarter of 2026.
“Tesla has acted unlike any car company.
For now, Tesla’s board, with its heavy promotion of Musk’s compensation package, is betting everything on him.","Tesla shareholders just overwhelmingly backed CEO Elon Musk’s unprecedented pay package that could be worth $1 trillion over a decade, but engineers running the company’s main vehicle programs, for its top-selling Model Y, Model 3 and the controversial Cybertruck, aren’t sticking around to see how things turn out.

Emmanuel Lamacchia, an eight-year Tesla veteran and program manager for the Model Y, said late Sunday in a LinkedIn post that he was leaving the Austin-based company. His announcement came just a few hours after a similar post by Siddhant Awasthi, another eight-year veteran who ran the Model 3 and Cybertruck programs. Neither gave reasons for their decisions, though both mentioned new career steps, which they didn’t detail.

They’re just the latest high-profile engineers to leave as Musk seeks to shake up Tesla’s business, prioritizing AI-powered businesses – namely robotaxis and humanoid robots – that don’t generate revenue currently, rather than selling more electric vehicles, batteries and charging services, which do. Earlier this year, Musk fired the company’s head of manufacturing and sales in North America and Europe. In August, the director of Tesla’s battery team left the company, as did the head of its former “Dojo” supercomputer team and vice president of North American sales and service. Even Musk’s much-hyped “Optimus” robot project, which the billionaire said last week is likely to be Tesla’s biggest new business, quit in June.

“There are no new models on the horizon. There’s just a focus on cost reduction”

Aside from the fact that the poor-selling, much-derided Cybertruck ranks among the auto industry’s biggest flops, Musk’s prioritization of non-EV businesses is making the company less attractive to auto engineers, according to a former Tesla executive.

“Imagine you’re someone who's been working in the automotive industry or studying engineering at university and you go to Tesla and there are no new models on the horizon. There’s just a focus on cost reduction,” said the person, who asked not to be named. “This isn’t exciting at all. They cannot be attracting the best people in the automotive industry.”

The most recent departures didn’t ruffle shareholders. Tesla rose 3.7% to $445.23 in Nasdaq trading on Monday.

Despite a spike in deliveries in the third quarter, the result of U.S. customers rushing to buy before federal tax credits phased out after Sept. 30, Tesla’s EV sales are down about 6% so far this year. Though the company has come out with cheaper versions of Model Y and 3, its global top sellers, its lack of new products and the slower pace of EV sales in the U.S. and Europe suggest the next few quarters will see a continued drop in its auto sales.

Last week, Musk suggested that Tesla’s two-door Cybercab will arrive by the second quarter of 2026. But that car is intended to be sold without a steering wheel and standard controls, operating exclusively as a self-driving vehicle. That’s a gamble, though, given that the company continues to struggle to prove it’s equaled Alphabet’s Waymo in mastering autonomous driving.

Ross Gerber, a Tesla investor and critic of Musk’s shift in strategy, thinks it would be better to simply release Cybercab as the so-called Model 2, “just a regular EV that they could sell for about $30,000,” he told Forbes.

“The thing about how car companies work is people want new models, new features and they want new designs for their car that's not too different than the original, but is different,” said Gerber, CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, which manages about $4 billion, including $80 million of Tesla shares. “Tesla has acted unlike any car company. They just refreshed the model Y and said, ‘Okay, we refreshed the car. We made it better and made the Model 3 better.’ But it's not a new model, and that’s the problem.”

Sales of the Cybertruck, which Musk once claimed would sell hundreds of thousands of units annually, are already dropping in the model’s second full year, down 38% through the third quarter to just 16,097 units. Aside from its polarizing styling, the truck has also had multiple recalls, the most recent announced last month.

Though Tesla is preparing to finally start selling its electric semi truck in 2026, according to Musk, that model is likely to only add tens of thousands of new sales to the bottom line, given how much smaller the Class-8 semi industry is compared to the broader passenger vehicle market.

Tesla claims to have the capacity to produce at least 2 million vehicles annually at plants in California, Texas, China and Germany. That’s considerably more than it needs at the moment, with annual sales likely to come in between 1.5 million and 1.6 million this year. At last week’s shareholder meeting, in which at least 75% of investors voted in favor of awarding Musk $1 trillion of stock over a decade if he hits a series of financial and strategic goals, the billionaire hinted it’s likely to absorb some of that surplus by making robots.

“We have to invent whole new terms for the key man risk involved here.”

The company is building a “million-unit production line in Fremont,” to make Optimus, Musk said. At some point, it will also add a “10 million unit per year line” at the Austin, Texas, plant that now builds Cybertrucks and Model Ys. Much like his robotaxi and Cybercab plans, however, Tesla’s ability to build and sell millions of units of Optimus depends on making the tech workable and affordable, which it has not done yet.

The departures of Lamacchia and Awasthi also underscore a continuing problem that Tesla’s board appears uninterested in solving: the lack of a strong executive team and a clear succession plan for the post-Musk era. Beyond its CFO, Tesla’s C-suite currently has no president, COO or executive vice presidents, or officials with titles higher than senior vice president.

For now, Tesla’s board, with its heavy promotion of Musk’s compensation package, is betting everything on him.

“I cannot imagine a scenario where the valuation of Tesla does not collapse following Elon Musk's departure,” said Gautam Mukunda, a professor with the Yale School of Management. “We have to invent whole new terms for the key man risk involved here. Normal key man risk doesn't even apply – and in particular doesn't apply when you're talking to someone who has, by his own admission, behaviors that are remarkably risky.”

ABTC says the project’s focus is on the safe handling and processing of damaged battery materials, and it has made “significant enhancements” to its recycling facility in Nevada in order to process these damaged battery materials.
At current market prices, the company says that if it were to process all of the battery materials from the site, the value of the recycled products generated from these materials is estimated at approximately $30 million.
“This unprecedented operation highlights the growing need for specialized battery recycling capabilities as electric vehicles, grid storage systems and consumer electronics continue proliferating,” the company says.
“The work being done on this cleanup between industry leaders and regulators is establishing safety and materials management standards for future large-scale battery facilities while demonstrating the viability of domestic recycling solutions for critical battery materials.”","ABTC says the lithium-ion battery cleanup is the “largest in U.S. history,” with $30 million in estimated project proceeds.

Battery materials recycler and refiner American Battery Technology Co. (ABTC), Reno, Nevada, has been contracted and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to recycle the end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from what it calls the largest LIB cleanup operation in EPA history.

ABTC says the project’s focus is on the safe handling and processing of damaged battery materials, and it has made “significant enhancements” to its recycling facility in Nevada in order to process these damaged battery materials. The company notes it has been receiving large-scale shipments of this material for the past several weeks.

According to the company, the cleanup effort comes after a fire at a grid-scale battery energy storage system (BESS) facility in Northern California in January, which affected up to approximately 100,000 LIB modules that would require specialized handling, packaging, transportation and recycling in accordance with procedures overseen by the EPA. In the spring, ABTC says it underwent an audit and review process and successfully received formal EPA approval for its battery recycling facility in Nevada to receive waste material under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).

ABTC says it now is EPA-approved as one of the only battery recyclers in the Western U.S. capable of receiving batteries that have been damaged and classified as “CERCLA waste,” such as battery materials that have been involved in large-scale BESS thermal events and fires.

“This unprecedented cleanup effort highlights the critical importance of building and deploying advanced domestic critical mineral recycling infrastructure capable of addressing the growing challenges of managing damaged lithium-ion batteries in a safe and responsible manner,” ABTC CEO Ryan Melsert says. “We are proud that we have established ABTC as one of the only recyclers in the Western U.S. to be capable of receiving CERCLA materials, and that we have already been processing truckloads of CERCLA material from this project for the past several weeks.

“This effort is not just about safely recycling damaged batteries—it’s about answering President Trump’s call to action for implementing immediate measures to increase American mineral production through demonstrating how U.S.-based infrastructure can rise to return these critical minerals back to the domestic manufacturing supply chain.”

ABTC says its internally developed recycling technologies can recover valuable critical materials, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, steel and copper from damaged batteries, preventing such resources from entering landfills while supporting the establishment of a closed-loop critical mineral manufacturing supply chain in the U.S.

The EPA is overseeing the complex logistics of battery characterization, transportation and delivery to ABTC’s Nevada facility. ABTC says the damaged batteries vary in condition, from intact units to severely compromised materials requiring immediate processing to ensure safety compliance. At current market prices, the company says that if it were to process all of the battery materials from the site, the value of the recycled products generated from these materials is estimated at approximately $30 million.

That’s what Devi Glick, an energy analyst with Synapse Energy Economics, told the commission in written testimony filed late last week.

Kentucky Power originally told the PSC that investing in Mitchell was the most cost-effective option for its customers. However, it told the commission last month that the plant would require extensive repair or replacement of one of its two concrete cooling towers.

Glick testified that converting the plant from coal to natural gas would be less expensive than fixing the cooling tower and would avoid other potential environmental costs.

Kentucky Power co-owns Mitchell, in Marshall County, West Virginia, with Wheeling Power. Both are subsidiaries of American Electric Power.

In 2021, the Kentucky commission rejected Kentucky Power’s bid to keep its half of Mitchell past 2028. The West Virginia Public Service Commission then allowed Wheeling Power to pay for the entire project and recover the cost from its electricity customers.

Kentucky Power came back to the Kentucky PSC earlier this year seeking approval again, this time with the support of Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman.

Coleman’s predecessor, Daniel Cameron, recommended in 2021 that the plant be retired. Cameron is a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in 2026.

In her written testimony, Glick faulted Kentucky Power for comparing the cost of repairing Mitchell’s cooling tower with building new gas generation but not with converting the existing plant to gas.

Glick’s earlier calculations revealed the excess costs of two coal plants, one in Ohio and the other in Indiana, for Appalachian Power and Louisville Gas & Electric, and Kentucky Utilities electricity customers.

As reported by the Appalachia-Midsouth Newsroom, Appalachian Power customers paid $328 million more than necessary for electricity from the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation from 2018 to 2024.

LG&E and KU customers paid nearly $168 million more than necessary for OVEC power in those seven years.

According to a news release, Citizens Action Coalition has urged the IURC to reject the request filed by Indiana Michigan Power to build and purchase power plants for new Amazon and Google AI data centers at undisclosed locations.

Indiana Michigan Power has filed an Expedited Generation Resource plan in a move that the CAC has said could become “the most expensive proposed expansion of generation by a utility in a docketed proceeding in Indiana history.”

The CAC estimates that a minimum of 39% of EGR Plan costs will be passed on to utility customers within the next five years. The organization also expressed concern with the power company’s request for IURC to permit the introduction of a new bill tracker to the monthly electric bills.

The EGR Plan proposal does not provide enough information about the rate and likely impacts on a monthly basis, according to the CAC. Indiana Michigan Power also requested preapproval for the expansion of natural gas power plants, which CAC said would cover approximately 85% of the electricity as part of the EGR plan.

Multiple AI data centers have already been announced or are in the process of being planned throughout the Hoosier state.

Google is currently constructing a data center on 390 acres of land in Morgan County. Meanwhile, data centers have been proposed in both Hendricks and Henry counties. The largest of these proposed data centers is the Amazon data center campus coming to New Castle.

But the environmental toll of these large data centers, which suck up gigawatts of power and require vast amounts of water for cooling, has been too diffuse and difficult to quantify.

Now, Cornell researchers have used advanced data analytics – and, naturally, some AI, too – to create a state-by-state look at that environmental impact. The team found that, by 2030, the current rate of AI growth would annually put 24 to 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the emissions equivalent of adding 5 to 10 million cars to U.S. roadways. It would also drain 731 to 1,125 million cubic meters of water per year – equal to the annual household water usage of 6 to 10 million Americans. The cumulative effect would put the AI industry’s net-zero emissions targets out of reach.

On the upside, the study also outlines an actionable roadmap that would use smart siting, faster grid decarbonization and operational efficiency to cut these impacts by approximately 73% (carbon dioxide) and 86% (water) compared with worst-case scenarios.

The findings were published Nov. 10 in Nature Sustainability. The first author is doctoral student Tianqi Xiao in the Process-Energy-Environmental Systems Engineering (PEESE) lab.

“Artificial intelligence is changing every sector of society, but its rapid growth comes with a real footprint in energy, water and carbon,” said Fengqi You, the Roxanne E. and Michael J. Zak Professor in Energy Systems Engineering in Cornell Engineering, who led the project. “Our study is built to answer a simple question: Given the magnitude of the AI computing boom, what environmental trajectory will it take? And more importantly, what choices steer it toward sustainability?”

In order to quantify the environmental footprints of the nation’s AI computing infrastructure, the team began three years ago to compile “multiple dimensions” of financial, marketing and manufacturing data to understand how the industry is expanding, combined with location-specific data on power systems and resource consumption, and how they connect with changes in climate.

“There’s a lot of data, and that’s a huge effort. Sustainability information, like energy, water, climate, tend to be open and public. But industrial data is hard, because not every company is reporting everything,” You said. “And of course, eventually, we still need to be looking at multiple scenarios. There’s no way that one size fits all. Every region is different for regulations. We used AI to fill some of the data gap as well.”

But projecting the impacts wasn’t enough. The researchers also wanted to provide data-driven guidance for sustainable growth of AI infrastructure.

“There isn’t a silver bullet,” You said. “Siting, grid decarbonization and efficient operations work together – that’s how you get reductions on the order of roughly 73% for carbon and 86% for water.”

By far, one of the most important factors: location, location, location.

Many current data clusters are being constructed in water-scarce regions, such as Nevada and Arizona. And in some hubs, for example northern Virginia, rapid clustering can strain local infrastructure and water resources. Locating facilities in regions with lower water-stress and improving cooling efficiency could slash water demands by about 52%, and when combined with grid and operational best practices, total water reductions could reach 86%, the study found. The Midwest and “windbelt” states – particularly Texas, Montana, Nebraska and South Dakota – would deliver the best combined carbon-and-water profile.

“New York state remains a low-carbon, climate-friendly option thanks to its clean electricity mix of nuclear, hydropower and growing renewables,” You said, “although prioritizing water-efficient cooling and additional clean power is key.”

If decarbonization does not catch up with the computing demand, emissions could rise roughly 20%.

“Even if each kilowatt-hour gets cleaner, total emissions can rise if AI demand grows faster than the grid decarbonizes,” You said. “The solution is to accelerate the clean-energy transition in the same places where AI computing is expanding.”

However, decarbonizing the grid can only do so much. Even in the ambitious high-renewables scenario, by 2030 carbon dioxide would drop roughly 15% compared to the baseline, and approximately 11 million tons of residual emissions would remain, requiring roughly 28 gigawatts of wind or 43 gigawatts of solar capacity to reach net-zero.

The researchers determined that deploying an array of energy- and water-efficient technologies, such as advanced liquid cooling and improved server utilization, could potentially remove another 7% of carbon dioxide and lower water use by 29%, for a total water reduction of 32% when combined.

As companies such as OpenAI and Google funnel more and more money into rapidly building AI data centers to keep up with demand, this is a pivotal moment for coordinated planning between industry, utilities and regulators to avoid local water scarcity and higher grid emissions, according to You.

“This is the build-out moment,” he said. “The AI infrastructure choices we make this decade will decide whether AI accelerates climate progress or becomes a new environmental burden.”

The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, successor to the North American Free Trade Agreement, has been in force for just over five years. That means a deadline of sorts is coming up. As passed by Congress in 2019, the USMCA includes a clause directing the three partner countries to “review” the agreement after six years — that is, by July 2026 — and decide whether they like it more or less as is, or want to see changes.

In principle, that’s fine. The agreement is a big human creation, with some notable innovations. As such, it has lots of features that look good to some groups but bad to others. With the “review” ahead, industry associations, pressure groups, labor unions, and agricultural commodity groups are all dutifully writing up lists of ways to improve it. But fundamentally, the agreement is working reasonably well — facilitating trade in agriculture, energy, and manufacturing, helping digital channels stay open, encouraging joint work on wildlife trafficking and ocean health, and experimenting with a novel approach to labor issues. At the same time, though, the Trump administration’s profligate tariffs and threats against Canada and Mexico are causing a series of genuine crises: usurpation of Congress’s Constitutional authority; erosion of relationships at the core of U.S. national security; and a deteriorating economic environment as tariffs raise costs for families and diminish the competitiveness of U.S. farming and manufacturing.

The “deadline,” meanwhile, is a very soft one. In fact, it requires no action at all. And in the circumstances of 2025 and 2026, the best choice is “let well enough alone.” Congress should make it clear that the USMCA does not need major changes at this point, and that policy should instead focus on ending these self-created crises. If the administration nonetheless wants to proceed, Congress should require three steps first:

Approve legislation such as Representative Linda Sanchez’s HR 2888, which would terminate the administration’s “emergency” and “national security” decrees under laws like “IEEPA,” “Section 232,” and “Section 301” and require votes on any future Presidential imposition of tariffs (or other import limits) with some carefully circumscribed exceptions.

Stabilize North American security by restoring trust, mutual respect, and common interest as the foundation of U.S. policy for America’s neighbors.

Restore Constitutionally appropriate policymaking, with Congress setting negotiating objectives for trade policy agencies and voting to approve, or not, any agreements making changes in U.S. tariff rates or trade laws.

With these done, it would be appropriate, and might be useful, to look closely at the USMCA and see whether a broad consensus exists for changes that would improve it. But not before.",https://www.progressivepolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photos-PPI-9.png,N,,2025-11-10 21:07:13.079133

If you’re ready to get rid of the jack-o’-lanterns sitting on your porch, don’t toss them in your trash can.

Every year, approximately 1 billion pounds of pumpkins end up in landfills across the country, where they release climate-warming methane that hurts the environment.

Hamilton County’s waste reduction agency is trying to combat that spooky statistic. It’s encouraging residents to give their pumpkins a sustainable second life through cooking, donating and composting them.

“Pumpkins are such an easy thing to prevent from going into the landfill because there are so many other outlets for them,” said Sam Goubeaux, program coordinator at Hamilton County ReSource.

Donate them to a farm

Some local farms are accepting pumpkins for animal feed. Bahr Farm, 969 W. North Bend Rd., is collecting unpainted pumpkins for its cows to enjoy. You can drop them off in the bin by the picnic table until Dec. 6.

Bahr Farm also has a composting operation on site.

“If your pumpkin is a little moldy, or if you're not really sure if it's appropriate for animal feed, they'll still take it, and they'll decide which ones they're able to feed to the cows and which ones that they're going to compost,” Goubeaux said.

Perch Farm, 900 Hopewell Rd., and Tewes Farm, 2801 Crescent Springs Pike, are also both taking natural pumpkin donations.

Turn your Halloween decoration into a tasty treat

If your pumpkin is still firm, you can turn your Halloween decoration into food. Goubeaux says there are endless recipes that call for pumpkin or pumpkin puree.

“Just cut the pumpkin in half, take out the insides, roast that exterior in your oven at a fairly low temperature for a few hours, and then you can puree it and use that puree in recipes,” Goubeaux said.

She suggests pumpkin pie or pumpkin cookies.

Opt to compost

Pumpkins are rich in nutrients and can make great additions to compost and soil.

Goubeaux recommends breaking up or smashing your pumpkins before adding them to a compost pile.

“Ultimately, that will help [with] decomposition,” Goubeaux said. “It'll help make everything go by a little faster, so that you're not looking at that pumpkin for quite as long.”

Then, cover the pumpkin with plenty of leaves or brown, carbon-rich material to ensure you have the right balance in your compost pile.

If you don’t have compost, a community garden or other organization may take your pumpkins. Lierer’s Market, 4170 Hamilton Ave., is collecting natural, unpainted pumpkins for composting. Use code 1031 to open the free drop-off bin outside the store.

Leave them outside for animals

If you leave your pumpkins outside, animals from racoons to deer will come feed on them. Goubeaux suggests breaking up your pumpkin and leaving it in your backyard.

“It'll attract some of those animals...by having that that fleshy interior out,” Goubeaux said.

Pumpkins without any paint or glitter on them are safer for wildlife.

Plug Power’s announcement that it is suspending work on its Department of Energy–backed green hydrogen projects marks a sobering turning point. Most companies would fight to secure a $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the federal government. Plug Power is walking away from it. That decision, combined with yet another round of cost cutting, is not a show of discipline. It is an act of triage.

The company’s new liquidity plan is described as generating $275 million through monetizing electricity rights, releasing restricted cash, and cutting maintenance costs. In practice that means selling off parts of its future in order to pay for the present. The decision to walk away from DOE-backed projects reduces the long-term strategic leverage Plug once had and underscores how much pressure its balance sheet is under. Each quarter it burns through tens of millions in cash. There are only so many assets left to monetize before the core of the company is compromised.

Monetizing electricity rights sounds like a clever financial instrument but it is closer to a short-term sale. Plug likely holds grid connection contracts and power purchase agreements in New York and other regions that could be valuable to data center developers. Selling those rights or assigning them is a one-time gain that reduces future flexibility. It is the corporate equivalent of pawning your tools to make payroll. The money may arrive faster, but the ability to generate sustained earnings disappears with it.

The same dynamic applies to maintenance cuts. Plug Power has been through multiple rounds of cost reduction. Project Quantum Leap in early 2025 targeted up to $200 million in savings through workforce reductions, facility consolidation, and lower service costs. The most recent announcement adds more “reduced maintenance expenses” to the mix. There are only so many ways to cut maintenance before it begins to affect plant reliability, regulatory compliance, and safety, and they’ve been cutting since the beginning of the year. The company is now within striking distance of those limits, and quite likely heading past them.

Plug’s hydrogen production facilities in Georgia, Tennessee, and Louisiana represent the heart of its operation. Together they can produce about 40 to 45 tons of hydrogen a day, although in practice they produce less on average due to standard maintenance and operational cycles. These are high-pressure, high-temperature industrial environments that depend on strict maintenance schedules for compressors, cryogenic systems, and leak detection. When preventive maintenance intervals are stretched, small problems can turn into failures. A leaking valve or a worn compressor seal does not just stop production. It can create an explosive or asphyxiation hazard for workers. Hydrogen ignites at low energy, spreads quickly, and is invisible when burning. Worker health and safety are the potential casualties when budgets are tightened too far.

Hydrogen leakage is not only a workplace issue. It is a climate issue. Recent atmospheric chemistry research has clarified that hydrogen has a global warming potential of roughly 33 times that of carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe. When hydrogen escapes into the air it slows the breakdown of methane and increases short-term warming. The same undetected leaks that endanger workers quietly increase the company’s greenhouse footprint. Each kilogram of leaked hydrogen equates to about 33 kilograms of CO2e. Even a 1% leak rate from a 40-ton-per-day system would create nearly 5,000 tons of CO2e per year. While this rules out a major hydrogen distribution system, it doesn’t preclude well-designed and operated industrial facilities. If Plug’s maintenance savings come from reduced leak monitoring or delayed seal replacements, the environmental risks will increase increase in lockstep with the safety risks.

This is not the first time Plug Power has been on the edge. Previous financial analyses I’ve done highlighted its reliance on continuous capital raises and stock dilution to cover ongoing losses. It hasn’t turned a profit once in its nearly 30 years of existence, and annual losses have been increasing, not decreasing. The company has struggled to turn technology demonstrations into stable cash flow. Hydrogen production and liquefaction are capital intensive. Margins on fuel cells and electrolyzers remain low. Service costs are high. Plug’s repeated claims of coming profitability have always been contingent on scale that never materialized. The DOE loan guarantee was supposed to provide the runway to achieve it. Walking away from that support reveals that internal forecasts have changed for the worse.

Plug Power’s offtake strategy was built around transportation and materials handling rather than industrial hydrogen demand. Its biggest customers are Walmart, Amazon, The Home Depot, and Uline, all using hydrogen to power fleets of fuel-cell forklifts and warehouse equipment. While there are a few tens of thousands of fuel-cell forklifts, millions of battery electric forklifts are sold annually. The story for materials handling is the same as every transportation segment: hydrogen can’t compete with batteries. The company signed a supply agreement with Universal Hydrogen—now defunct of course—to provide green hydrogen for aviation applications, where the competitive headwinds are different but the result is the same: no hydrogen. These relationships looked impressive when fuel-cell mobility was being promoted as the next revolution, but they tied Plug’s fortunes to a sector that was never going to achieve scale or stable margins.

A maintenance-related failure at one of Plug Power’s hydrogen plants would have immediate and severe financial consequences. The company’s three operating sites together produce roughly 40 to 45 tons of hydrogen per day, meaning that the loss of even one facility could eliminate a quarter to a third of total output. At an estimated internal cost of $6 to $8 per kilogram and limited ability to substitute supply from other plants, an extended outage could erase tens of millions in quarterly revenue while fixed costs continue to accrue. Emergency repairs would drive unplanned capex, insurance premiums would rise, and delivery contracts could trigger penalties or cancellations from large clients such as Walmart, Amazon, and The Home Depot. For a firm already operating on thin liquidity, months of lost production would accelerate cash depletion and likely force new equity or debt issuance under distressed conditions. In effect, one preventable failure could move Plug Power from restructuring risk to insolvency risk almost overnight.

Industrial offtakers such as fertilizer, methanol, or steel producers buy hydrogen in far larger volumes under long-term contracts and integrate it into core processes. Plug chose to serve high-profile logistics and mobility clients instead, where consumption is small, infrastructure costs are high, price sensitivity is acute and the battery-powered alternatives are cheaper and more reliable. The result is a portfolio of customers who cannot absorb enough hydrogen to support large production plants and who treat supply as a commodity rather than a partnership. Plug Power bet on hydrogen as a transportation fuel instead of an industrial feedstock, and that decision now defines its collapse.

I’ve updated my data set of hydrogen for transportation plays as a couple of new entrants came to my attention. One, Bramble Energy, did so in the traditional way by having its bankruptcy announced. Many of the firms on this list flew under the radar until they plowed straight into a hillside. Another, Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies, posted a breathless paean to its growth plans in Asian commercial vehicles and data centers on LinkedIn, then the CEO spent a lot of time proving that they’d never taken a public relations course in their life in responses to comments about why that’s going to be problematic. As I noted recently, heavy fuel cell vehicle sales are plummeting in China while battery electric vehicles skyrocket. China has run the market test, and just as with every other trial of hydrogen vs batteries, batteries have won handily.

As for data centers, they are an AI-inflated bubble right now, and hydrogen, while frothy, isn’t remotely a good solution for what power is required at them. Electricity is their first or second highest operational expense, competing with equipment depreciation, with public statements by analysis organizations ranging from 20% to 60% of annual expenses. Hydrogen fuel cell-generated electricity will be the most expensive option in the list, with even gray hydrogen turning into electricity that costs over $600 per MWh. Data centers were averaging $100–$180 per MWh in 2024, so aren’t going to be interested in multiplying their electricity expense by a factor of three or more.

I’ve added Bramble to my table as Defunct and Horizon as high risk as a result. I’m sure that there are more missing, just as I’m sure that many of the ones that haven’t announced failure or pivoting have quietly done one or the other.

Plug now sits squarely in the “Desperation” phase of hydrogen for transportation firms’ life cycle. The life cycle has become predictable enough to resemble a case study in technological and financial sociology. It starts with the hype phase, when visionary founders and early investors make grand claims about decarbonizing trucks, ships, or aircraft with zero-emission hydrogen. They release glossy investor decks filled with hockey-stick demand projections and “addressable market” charts showing trillions in future opportunity. These firms are buoyed by government enthusiasm and a media narrative hungry for the next Tesla, leading to inflated valuations long before a single refueling station or kilogram of hydrogen is sold at a profit.

The second phase is scale signaling. Firms begin announcing gigawatt-scale electrolyzer projects, transcontinental refueling corridors, and partnerships with brand-name logistics or automotive companies. They often describe these as “strategic collaborations” rather than binding contracts. Most of the deals are memorandums of understanding or pilot programs. Capital expenditure estimates are heroic, but the underlying unit economics are fragile. Production costs remain multiple times higher than the market can bear, and every plan assumes rapid declines in hydrogen prices that never materialize.

Then comes the financial engineering phase, when reality begins to intrude. Cash burn accelerates as projects move from press release to prototype. The company raises more capital through equity dilution, government grants, and creative accounting maneuvers like “monetizing electricity rights” or asset leasing. Executives start talking about “margin expansion” and “vertical integration,” code words for moving costs around to buy time. Stock offerings are framed as growth financing rather than survival funding.

By the desperation phase, liquidity warnings appear in quarterly filings, projects are delayed, and “operational discipline” becomes the new corporate mantra. Plants that were supposed to deliver green hydrogen at $2 per kilogram still cost $8. Maintenance budgets are cut, staff are laid off, and asset sales are rebranded as optimization. Safety incidents, production interruptions, and missed delivery contracts begin to surface. Public relations efforts shift from transformation to endurance.

The final phase is collapse or absorption. A few assets are sold to larger industrial firms that value the hardware or grid connections more than the business. Shareholders are wiped out, early believers exit quietly, and the technology itself continues on in diminished form. What started as a climate solution ends as a balance-sheet salvage operation. The core problem was never lack of engineering talent. It was the decision to build an entire company around hydrogen as a transportation fuel, a role the molecule was never suited for. The physics were wrong, the economics were worse, and the hype cycle simply postponed the reckoning.

Plug is a veteran in the sector but not immune to the same structural economics. Its liquidity measures buy time but do not change the math. Even if it manages to create the $275 million in new liquidity, Plug’s monthly burn rate and debt obligations suggest less than a year of operating runway.

The risk trajectory is clear. Financial stress leads to deferred maintenance. Deferred maintenance leads to higher safety risk. Higher safety risk leads to hydrogen leaks and downtime. Those leaks erode the climate justification for green hydrogen and damage the company’s credibility with investors and regulators. Plug’s management may see maintenance cuts as a temporary bridge, but the bridge is being built from the same materials that are supposed to hold up the plant.

There is also a moral dimension. Every technician working at a Plug site depends on those safety systems being tested, calibrated, and maintained. Each time the company reduces maintenance spending it is transferring risk from the balance sheet to the workforce and the surrounding community. That is not an accounting entry. It is a gamble with real consequences.

Plug Power’s financial collapse is more a matter of timing than anything else. When a firm is forced to sell critical assets, suspend government-backed projects, and reduce maintenance on facilities handling thousands of kilograms of hydrogen every day, the endgame is already in sight. Hydrogen still has core applications in industry as a feedstock, but transportation was never a viable path to profit. Plug’s trajectory is a warning to investors and policymakers that enthusiasm does not replace economics.

When a company is down to selling its grid connections and stretching the maintenance that keeps its plants safe, it is no longer in the innovation business. It is in survival mode. The question is not whether the cuts will expose vulnerabilities, but when. Worker safety, climate integrity, and financial solvency are now bound together by the same neglected valves and corroded fittings. If those give way, it will not just be hydrogen escaping. It will be whatever remains of trust in the promise that this industry was supposed to deliver. My only hope is that no workers will be injured in Plug Power’s end game.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ChatGPT-Image-Nov-10-2025-10_23_44-AM-800x445.png,N,,2025-11-10 18:01:07.303582

But a new front has opened, pitting these copper thieves against EV owners who are already trying to find the fastest chargers on the road. A rash of copper thefts targeting the valuable-for-scrap cables on EV chargers is leaving more and more EV owners wondering what to do when there's no way to connect their electric vehicles (EVs) to the charging network because the cables have been stolen.

Fortunately, a variety of solutions are being implemented by charging system providers, in the hope that the high rate of theft of EV charging cables can be brought under control. One of these providers is ChargePoint, which is combining 'cut-resistant' charging cables with alarm systems to reduce the rate of charger cable thefts. The cable-covering material is reinforced with steel, which resists the usual tools used to cut these cables, including bolt cutters, wire cutters, and battery-powered tools. These changes make it much more difficult and time-consuming for the thief to cut through a cable. ChargePoint also plans to license the use of these reinforced cables to other charging providers.

ChargePoint has also developed security software called ""ChargePoint Protect"" that can detect cable tampering or cutting in real time. The software, sent out as an over-the-air update and compatible with most of the company's charging stations, sets off alarms intended to scare thieves away while also notifying the owners of those charging stations about potential thefts in progress.

How are other EV charger companies getting creative?

Brooklyn-based charging provider It's Electric has eliminated the problem at its source by creating the first UL-certified detachable charging cable, the Brooklyn-718. Users of It's Electric's charging stations simply unlock the cables from a secure compartment near the charger and return the cables to the same locked storage area when they have finished. This innovation removes the cables from view while also making them much less attractive to thieves, who must first break into a storage compartment to access them — a big deal if you're in one of the states with the fewest public EV chargers.

In the UK, charging provider InstaVolt has collaborated with Formula Space, an EV design specialist, to introduce its new CableGuard system. CableGuard combines an outer sheath that is much more difficult to cut through with a 'forensic liquid' that is visible under UV light. This liquid not only identifies the copper cables as stolen but also the location from which they were stolen, in a database accessible to police. This feature will aid greatly in quickly prosecuting the offenders.

InstaVolt has also added security measures, including AI-powered CCTV that will identify nefarious activity as it happens. This starts with continuous, around-the-clock monitoring and ends with ex-military operatives patrolling charging sites and authorized to detain individuals acting suspiciously, leading to arrests and prosecutions. In addition, geo-tracking technology is used to alert security personnel when cables leave a charging site, enabling them to respond quickly.

CBS reports that flight bookings are up 2% compared with 2024, when an estimated 79.9 million travelers journeyed 50 miles or more from home.

The vast majority-71.74%-traveled by car last year. While owning and driving cars will continue to be a fundamental mode of transport for the foreseeable future, Thanksgiving traffic might look much more sustainable in the not-too-distant future, CANOPY reports.

Train travel in North America will soon get a lot faster

Choosing electric rail travel over a direct flight can cut emissions by around 86% (though, as The New York Times reported, much of the rail network in America still runs on highly polluting diesel). But while Japan's Shinkansen ""Bullet Trains"" debuted high-speed rail in 1964 and France's TGV marked a global high-speed train revolution once it began rolling in the early 1980s, North American rail travel has languished on the wrong side of the tracks.

But railfans, rejoice! Amtrak partnered with Alstom to deliver its next-generation premium Acela trainsets along 457 miles of track in the heavily traveled Northeast Corridor (NEC) in August 2025. Amtrak's trains can operate at top speeds of 160 mph versus today's fleet, which operates at top speeds of 150 mph, and connect Boston, New Jersey, and Washington, DC as part of a $2.45 billion investment in the NEC. Twenty-eight new trains will enter service through 2027. Elsewhere, high-speed train links operated by various bodies will soon follow between Portland and Vancouver, Las Vegas and Southern California, Miami and Tampa, Houston and Dallas, and, hopefully, San Francisco and Los Angeles-making future journeys faster and more relaxing.

By 2040, rush hour won't exist-thanks to self-driving electric vehicles

EVs and hybrid vehicles are mainstays of freeways, and mobility experts agree that autonomous vehicles (AVs) will transform travel. McKinsey's 2025 The Next Normal report ""The future of self-driving cars: Safer, smarter, and everywhere"" declares that by 2040, autonomous vehicles could be as commonplace as any household appliance-shaping how families organize their days, how cities are designed, and creating a driving experience that is smarter, safer, and all-around better. Hours spent watching the road could be used for video calling a friend, watching a movie, napping, or even working-all of which would make traveling during the daily commute and holiday period a little less painful.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are looking to a future approaching net zero

Long-haul trips account for 60% of aviation emissions and 69.3% of CO2 emissions from passenger travel. Rather than reinventing the wheel, airlines targeting IATA's ""net zero carbon by 2050"" goal are developing sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to power existing aircraft engines.

In 2022, Swedish airline BRA made history as the first to operate a regional commercial aircraft with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Supplier Neste's SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. Used neat, it reduces greenhouse gas emissions over its life cycle by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel use.

Fifty airlines are investing in SAF, and over half a million flights have used SAF to some degree, but the industry is not without its critics. Some SAFs contain biofuels derived from crops, which can put pressure on global food supplies and contribute to deforestation. But the promise of ""synthetic"" or ""e-fuels"" created by artificially combining hydrogen with ambient pollutant carbon dioxide is looking to a future where the SAF lifecycle approaches net-zero.

Air Company's AIRMADE® SAF, which it markets under the dramatic tagline ""Extinction ends here,"" is a fully formulated drop-in jet fuel that can be produced at scale with access to carbon dioxide (CO₂) and clean hydrogen (H₂). AIRCO has commercial partnerships with airlines, including JetBlue and Virgin Atlantic, and has been awarded multiple government contracts, including with NASA and the United States Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Unit. If the technology holds up, it will change the conversation around fuel-based CO2 emissions for good.

Electric, hydrogen-powered, and supersonic aircraft promise to decarbonize and democratize air travel

Various technologies show promise for navigating the skies on short-, mid-, and long-haul trips. LA-based start-up Heart Aerospace's mission is to use sustainable, electrified regional aircraft to reduce emissions and make flying more accessible to more people around the world. Hydrogen-powered engines are a staple in space rockets, but challenging to apply in aviation, yet Airbus has bet big on hybrid hydrogen aircraft-its ZEROe aircraft concept is slated to launch by 2035.

And after the demise of Concorde, supersonic aviation is staging a comeback. Boom's sleek supersonic aircraft, Overture, has an aerodynamic, lightweight carbon-fiber design and new-generation supersonic engines that run entirely on SAF. In ""boomless cruise,"" the aircraft ensures there's no audible sonic boom using Mach cutoff physics, opening up overland routes. Boom has commitments from American Airlines and United Airlines, with the first aircraft due to be delivered in 2029, when passengers can fly from New York to San Francisco in four hours. In a few years, air travel time on some routes around the holidays and year-round could be halved.

Inspired by Star Trek, shuttles powered by ionic wind could enable us to boldly-and silently-go places we've gone before

Down the line, people might even take to the skies in a Star Trek-inspired, ionic wind-powered aircraft. In 2018, MIT engineers built and flew the first-ever plane with no moving parts-instead of propellers or turbines, the light aircraft is powered by an ""ionic wind,"" a silent flow of ions that generates enough thrust to sustain steady flight.

In MIT News, Steven Barrett, associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at MIT, explained how the aircraft was inspired in part by the futuristic shuttlecrafts in the Star Trek TV shows and movies he watched avidly as a child. The physical principle of electroaerodynamic thrust was first identified in the 1920s, but remained the realm of hobbyists until a jetlagged Barrett did some back-of-the-napkin calculations after an uncomfortable flight. In the near term, he believes ion wind propulsion systems could be used to fly silent drones. Long-term, he says, they might be paired with more conventional combustion systems to create more fuel-efficient, hybrid large aircraft, including passenger planes.

Over the last year, Duke Energy has also taken a more muted position on initiatives investors commonly lump together as a shorthand for responsible corporate citizenship: environmental, social, and governance, or ESG.

In 2022, the utility published a full ESG report, calling it “one of our most important annual publications” and its principles “essential to who we are.” As Daniel Walton reports, the acronym and the phrase it represents were entirely absent from company communications this year, and the 2022 report appears to have disappeared from its website.

Duke Energy, Once Outspoken on Diversity and the Environment, Now Whispers

North Carolina’s largest utility promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts and promised progress on environmental issues. But in recent years, those efforts have become harder to find.

Duke is far from alone. Across both the state and corporate America, many companies have pulled back from bold social statements and shed thousands of jobs tied to diversity efforts since a peak in 2023. Many fear the wrath of the Trump administration, which recently called ESG “a Marxist march through corporate culture.”

Chief Financial Officer Patrick Taylor said up-financings tied to new hydro contracts have been oversubscribed.
“Costs continue to come down, decreasing more than 50% in the past 12 months,” he said, and that counterparties are increasingly looking to execute long-term capacity contracts.
For utilities and IPPs planning portfolios around data center hubs, that combination of hydro contracts and multi-year storage capacity is a building block for firm service levels.
“The U.S. government will order new Westinghouse nuclear reactors to be built in the United States with an aggregate investment value of at least $80 billion,” she said.","Brookfield Renewable Partners sees a clear turn toward firm power as data centers, re-industrialization and broad electrification tighten supply in key markets.

On its third-quarter earnings call last week, the company highlighted hydro contracts with major technology buyers and a U.S. government partnership that could put Westinghouse at the center of a large nuclear build.

Chief Executive Officer Connor Teskey said demand is broad and rising.

“We continue to see accelerating demand for power across nearly all the markets in which we operate,” he said, pointing to three themes: electrification, reindustrialization and the “extraordinary demand for energy from hyperscalers.”

That demand profile is changing the resource mix.

“It is becoming increasingly apparent that meeting the surging demand for electricity will require an any-and-all solution, leveraging solar, wind, hydro, gas, nuclear and other technologies to ensure sufficient load and consistent delivery of electrons,” said Teskey.

The immediate shift is in baseload contracting. Brookfield is now re-contracting a meaningful slice of its U.S. hydro fleet to digital buyers. Teskey said the company has approximately 5 terawatt hours (TWh) of generation coming up for recontracting and is finding that hyperscalers are willing to sign long tenor agreements for dependable capacity.

“We also signed a new 20-year contract with Microsoft at another one of our hydro assets in PJM as part of our renewable energy framework with that counterparty,” he said. Earlier this year, Brookfield executed a hydro framework with Google and quickly followed with two facility-level deals.

Those PPAs are funding real work at the plants and in the balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Taylor said up-financings tied to new hydro contracts have been oversubscribed.

“We executed upfinancings at our Holtwood and Safe Harbor hydro assets recently, following the first contracts under our framework agreement with Google that we signed earlier in the year,” he said. “And we completed an innovative upfinancing at our Smoky Mountain Hydro asset.”

Taylor said the deals were “over 5x oversubscribed at the tightest spreads we have seen for these types of financings in the past 5 years.”

These long-dated baseload PPAs are enabling uprates and modernization packages at legacy hydro stations. That typically includes turbine and runner refurbishment, generator rewinds, excitation and relay upgrades, digital governors and controls, dam safety improvements and cybersecurity hardening. Brookfield did not list specific scope items on the call, but the company made clear that hydro pricing uplift plus up-financings are creating headroom to invest.

Batteries also featured in the quarter, both on cost trend and delivered projects. Teskey said storage costs are improving quickly.

“Costs continue to come down, decreasing more than 50% in the past 12 months,” he said, and that counterparties are increasingly looking to execute long-term capacity contracts.

Brookfield said it commissioned a large system in Australia that signals the scale of future tenders.

“We advanced our global battery development strategy, highlighted by the delivery of a 340-megawatt battery in Australia, which combined with the first phase of this project is now the largest operating battery solution in the country,” Teskey said.

For utilities and IPPs planning portfolios around data center hubs, that combination of hydro contracts and multi-year storage capacity is a building block for firm service levels. It also suggests steady work for balance-of-plant contractors and suppliers, including switchyard upgrades, transformers, grid-forming inverters and controls, HVAC and fire systems for battery enclosures and multi-year service agreements to match the tenor of capacity sales.

Brookfield’s nuclear interest is expanding as well. Through its ownership stake in Westinghouse, the company expects to participate across design, engineering and long-term services. Co-President and General Counsel Jennifer Mazin described a new government partnership.

“The U.S. government will order new Westinghouse nuclear reactors to be built in the United States with an aggregate investment value of at least $80 billion,” she said.

The agreement supports the government’s goal of having 10 large-scale reactors with completed designs under construction by 2030 and includes government support for arranging financing, facilitating permits and the approvals required.

Westinghouse’s near-term role remains focused on the front end of the build and then long-term support.

Mazin said the company will provide “design, engineering and procurement services for these new build reactors,” and after commissioning, “we would expect to provide fuel and maintenance services for the lives of these new nuclear facilities, which is on average between 60 and 80 years each.”

She said the partnership should also catalyze the broader supply chain, adding that “orders of this magnitude should provide both a catalyst and enhanced certainty to the sector that should enable investment in the supply chain for Westinghouse and the nuclear industry more broadly.”

Brookfield has also signed a letter of intent to evaluate completing two AP1000 units at the VC Summer site in South Carolina. Teskey said the diligence window is short and interest from partners and offtakers is real.

“We are encouraged by our initial feedback from potential partners and hyperscaler offtakers,” he said, adding that protections could include sharing cost overrun burdens with offtakers and suppliers and arranging financing “that provides incremental liquidity in the event of cost overruns.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-4-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 20:00:25.892187

The lawsuit, which names the White House budget director, Russell T. Vought, as a main defendant, claims that the Trump administration took advantage of the lapse in government funding in October to slash energy programs in states where voters have supported Democrats.

The lawsuit came as a group of Democrats in the Senate broke rank on Sunday to support a funding measure that, if adopted by the Senate and House, would end the shutdown after more than 40 days of deep financial pain and sputtering government services.

According to the lawsuit, immediately as the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the White House kicked into high gear to halt billions destined for Democratic-led states, in an apparent attempt to gain leverage as lawmakers settled into a prolonged fight over funding. It argues the decision amounted to “intentional discrimination” and “bare animus,” inflicting deliberate hardship on states that voted against Mr. Trump in the last presidential election.

In a social media post on Oct. 1, Mr. Vought announced the government would terminate close to $8 billion for climate-related projects in 16 states, all represented by senators who caucus with the Democratic Party.

The original blog is included below this update.

A few weeks ago, I tackled EV policy, the United Nations' “green shipping plan” and the fight over rare earth minerals and, more broadly, the poor policy decisions that fire up flywheels without any idea of where the train is headed.

The last two editions of the Wall Street Journal brought this timely topic to the top of the list.

The point of the blog was less about power sources and more about the government’s attempt to pick a replacement technology with what one might call “light-bulb-off” decision-making. First, the government miscalculated the market’s “true” demand and the depth of the greenie’s commitment once they had to use their own wallet.

Second was the absence of the evaluation of the challenges in manufacturing and supply, which distracted every corner of America while redirecting otherwise time, materials and energy to what will be recognized as the “scrap heap” of 2025.

The notion of holistic, cradle-to-grave type thinking apparently was stuck in park.

We’ll all be paying for that now… But as stated 3 weeks ago, there are lessons to be taught from foolishness.

Scrapping Plans Underway at Ford

In her October 7, 2025 WSJ article, “Ford Considers Scrapping Electric Version of F-150 Truck,” Sharon Terlep reported that production of the money-losing F-150 EV pickup – once hyped as significant of its earlier “Model T” — may be shut down for good.

Low demand for electric trucks at hefty price tags and 1-ton batteries — as well as a $13 billion loss for Ford – is expected to bring the U.S.’ first major EV casualty. In October, the first month since the end of the EV tax credit, Ford’s U.S. EV sales in the U.S. fell 24% year over year.

And guess what? The failing EV Ford F-Series — at risk of shutdown — is actually the top-selling large EV this year — ahead of #2 by 41%.

Jenkins: ‘Dissect the Dishonesty’

A WSJ op-ed from Holman W. Jenkins, Jr., appeared the following day on “Ford’s Electric Pickup is an EV Casualty.” While it was President Trump and the GOP Congress who removed the fines that ended the incentives, Jenkins adds that the Democrats will be in charge again. “Maybe the useful thing now,” he writes, “is to dissect the collective dishonesty of the climate crowd.

Jenkins says, tongue-in-cheek, that the government’s policy may have started with a directive to find a way to “produce electric vehicles that are worse for the climate than if no EVs were produced.”

Two types of people supported and authorized the policy, he writes. First was the “Obama figures, who wanted EVs to wave in front of greens but also to preserve the profit model of the Big Three.”

The other camp, he says, was the army of climate groups such as the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Princeton-related Repeat Group and others — and the New York Times. “All proved willing to say whatever words were necessary to convey falsely that U.S. EV policy made sense,” Jenkins writes.

He makes the point that if policy incentives were “genuinely aimed at replacing gasoline-driven miles to produce a net reduction in greenhouse emissions,” the output would not have been the “big showpieces like the Ford F-150 Lightning, the Hummer EV or the new and fabulously absurd $400,000 Cadillac Celestiq.”

He adds that “Building these cars’ batteries and keeping them charged is guaranteed to produce more emissions than they can displace in their lifetimes … These cars are net insults to the climate and lose billions — the very definition of policy perversity.”

Other Automakers in Trouble, Too

WSJ also reported the plans by Stellantis and GM to discontinue electric truck production, as well as tanking Tesla Cybertruck sales and how EV truck-maker Rivian is slashing jobs to conserve cash.

GM has lost billions on electric trucks after rolling out a string of them in recent years. It sold just 1,800 of its 3 electric pickup models in October. The automaker set aside $1.6 billion in the third quarter to account for losses, with more to be added to the pile.

Last month, GM said it was idling the Detroit factory that makes its EV Silverado truck, and also stopped making its EV cargo van.

Meanwhile, Honda booked the equivalent of $1.49 billion in one-time electric vehicle-related expenses for losses and impairment on EVs sold in the U.S. and wrote down EV development assets. This comes after the May announcement that it would cut its EV investment by $20 billion in the coming years.

We’ll Leave the Light on For You

No one revels in seeing a cash-kindled EV fire burn, but ponder the horrendous waste that has already happened and will occur for years.

Workers – At Ford alone, an estimated 730 workers were laid off by the F-150 Lightning stoppage. Terlep estimates the number of workers already put on the unemployment lines is in the thousands.

Suppliers – Our industry competes with the automakers for raw materials, components and supplies, and the waste to date is beyond comprehension. The fact that so much of these materials couldn’t be sourced domestically only added to the burning embers of the trade war because of a belief that America can only win if its automakers do, too.

Automakers – Coming to the auto companies last since they aren’t smart enough to consider how misled government regulations and propped-up incentives could be corrected by another administration. Ford alone tooled itself up with a capacity to build 150,000 Lightnings a year.

A few more observations:

When is the last time that a lack of a plan, or even a “concept of a plan,” has worked out — after the fact — when the government is calling the shots?

Just because the potential exists for advanced technology doesn’t justify subsidies or propped-up sales support. And a rush to choose one technology over another – and the wrong one at that – will delay real progress for years.

Emotional, bandwagon-jumping fanfare brought false hope and, in some cases, fear. The U.S. public was sold a bill of goods, and the bill will be paid in one form or another.

Regulations, subsidies and incentives … This is what happens when the government gets into the business of business.

The ‘Greening Up’ Numb-Skullery

Published October 21, 2025

The creation of an environmental agenda P&L — that recognizes the big picture rather than obsessions on any one piece — can keep foolhardy notions grounded where they belong

It was 31 years ago that I wrote my first business-to-business media op-ed piece. Over the years, I’ve advised our developing columnists and bloggers to always keep a few opinion-piece ideas on hand, even if half-baked. Because sometimes you gotta throw one away and start over.

Some of you, seated to my left, might say this one deserves the circular file. But hey, it comes with the territory …

Seriously, my advice to up-and-coming bloggers? Start a “stupid stuff” file folder and fill it when you see something that affects your audience’s livelihood.

My file folder, by the way, is overflowing these days…

Foolishness is a Great Teacher

In addition to the spectator sport of column-writing, reporting on foolishness does serve a purpose if we can merely learn from it. And since numb-skullery knows no bounds, a flag thrown on one poor decision can keep another from being made elsewhere.

In the Oct. 19, Wall Street Journal, I read about the U.N.’s “green shipping plan” (“Trump Backlash Delays Green Shipping Plan,” by Ed Ballard and Costas Paris) to decarbonize the ocean shipping trade. The WSJ reports that the proposal, supported by some 60 nations and intended to take effect in 2027, would require ship-owners to use lower-carbon alternatives to conventional shipping fuel or pay a fee that ratches up over time.

Lower-carbon fuels are more expensive. Shipping-services provider Clarksons noted that the plan for higher-cost “could cost the shipping industry more than $3 trillion to switch to new forms of green power.”

Thankfully, President Donald Trump quickly sank its prospects to the bottom of the ocean. Shipping accounts for 3% of global carbon emissions, but we also don’t need a cure that’s worse than the disease.

Closer to home, we have entire industries just hanging on while food prices skyrocket. Who in their right mind is asking for another propped-up “initiative” that further erodes farmers’ and manufacturers' razor-thin margins in the name of greening things up?

Few winners in endeavors like these, but plenty of losers.

How many times will we let the train leave the station without any idea where it’s going?

Rare Earths, Even Rarer Thinking

The dearth of rare earths – as well as other metals – is also story making headlines nearly daily. Rare earths are in demand for virtually every advanced technology today, including electronics, energy and defense.

Not only are rare earths controlled by China, but less-than-stellar domestic policies caused their already short supply to be compounded. As China chokes off our ability to source rare earths, our trade officers are consumed in negotiations to protect a segment not yet ready for prime time anyway.

Let’s talk EVs for a moment. President Joe Biden convinced Americans to artificially “prop up” the sales of EVs regardless of the automakers’ ability to actually manufacture the vehicles. According to Benchmark Source, the need for EV motors significantly increased rare earth demand. In 2024, rare earth demand grew 32% from the previous year. In 2025, this demand is expected to increase 16%.

We’d still have a severe rare-earth shortage, but we wouldn’t be scrapping for the minerals destined for automakers.

No, I’ve not been particularly supportive of the electric car obsession that our former president “chose” to create because it was “trendy” and without analysis, economic or otherwise.

Instead, one can argue that if and when the technology (and its infrastructure) is proven and John Q. Public believes in EVs of its own free will (and not because of a handout), those EV order books can be filled on their own.

Oh, and by the way, the Oct. 20 Wall Street Journal noted that General Motors admitted its own EV pullback would cost it $1.6 billion. Some maintain that “Old Joe” picked the wrong technology altogether for the next-generation powered vehicle.

If this were golf, nearly everyone would be shouting “Mulligan” at the same time.

An Environmental Agenda P&L

According to the Cambridge Dictionary, holistic is defined as “dealing with or treating the whole of something or someone and not just a part.” If we want to pursue things in the name of environmentalism, we need a holistic environmental P&L. That is, if carbon reductions are desired in say, autos, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to rev up the so-called “dirty power” elsewhere to create a grid that cannot be sustained. The ledger doesn’t balance.

I’ve seen it first-hand. You can attack one line item with such vigor that you can whittle it down to near nothing, but at an expense 10-fold on another line that results in little, if any, holistic impact on what was desired in the first place. Those byproducts like shock and surprise, egg on one’s face, frustrations and gnashing of teeth could have been altogether avoided.

On a lighter note, I have an analogy to make about those trains leaving the station without any plan or consideration.

Just over 20 years ago, my sisters and I pitched in and bought our dad, Frank, a season-long lawn care service after his riding mower went to its final resting place at the scrap yard.

Just a few months into it, Dad was complaining about the per-cut expense and the agronomic intellect of his “custom cutters.” So he bought his first-ever ZTR from a local equipment dealer. Not only did he purchase a contractor-grade model (a Gravely from Wisconsin’s Dan Ariens) that he’ll never put enough hours on in his suburban lot, but he also went “big” with the width of his mower deck.

Limited by his two-car garage, the footprint of the mower required a green-lighting of a new-shed construction to house his new ZTR. Then, apparently to give him more time on his new ZTR during the dry Wisconsin summers, he had an irrigation system installed. The purchases that summer easily exceed $30,000 in today’s dollars.

Perhaps to protect himself from the watchful eye my late mother (and chief financial officer), we don’t believe his accounting factors in the permits, concrete-pouring, shingling, painting and upkeep of the shed, nor the steadily increasing implement purchases, the water bills or the mobile-service to keep his trusty ZTR in tip-top shape.

“Yeah, it turned out to be an expensive mower purchase, I guess,” he says, smiling about his “investments.” And then almost always adds, “It was just going to be money I might someday give the kids.”

Frank has earned the right to have some fun on his property and toss some dollars around. Those with oversight of our hard-earned tax contributions, well, not so much.

You get the picture. As author Lewis Caroll voiced through the Cheshire Cat, “If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.”

It’s time to chart the course – and known and unknown variables – before starting up the locomotives. Are we ready to take inventory and learn?

Glenfarne has selected Baker Hughes as its supplier for main refrigerant compressors for the LNG terminal and power generation equipment for the North Slope gas treatment plant. Baker Hughes has also committed to a strategic investment to support Alaska LNG. The agreements were announced today in a ceremony in Washington, D.C., with U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Energy Chris Wright.

“Baker Hughes is pleased to support Alaska LNG with our gas technology solutions,” said Lorenzo Simonelli, chairman and CEO of Baker Hughes. “Natural gas and LNG provide secure, affordable, and reliable energy, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with Glenfarne to bring lower-carbon natural gas from Alaska to the global market.”

“Baker Hughes is a welcome partner for Alaska LNG because of their leadership in LNG compression technology,” said Brendan Duval, CEO and founder of Glenfarne. “Their participation reflects Alaska LNG’s momentum and its ability to attract global partners to achieve national and state energy objectives.”

""American LNG is not just an energy source – it's a strategic asset that powers our economy, strengthens our alliances, and secures our nation's future,"" said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ""By forging this strategic alliance and investment in the Alaska LNG Project, we're strengthening our nation's energy security while advancing a bold vision for U.S. energy independence and global competitiveness. Together, through partnerships with industry leaders like Glenfarne and Baker Hughes, we're building the infrastructure and partnerships that ensure U.S. leadership in reliable, responsible, and affordable energy for decades to come – starting in Alaska.""

“Alaska LNG has the potential to be one of the most significant energy infrastructure projects in our nation’s history,"" said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. ""Today’s investment announcement is an important step forward for the project, prosperity in Alaska, and the energy security of America and our allies. The Trump administration remains committed to unleashing Alaska’s energy potential, including by supporting Alaska LNG.”

Glenfarne is developing Alaska LNG in two financially independent phases to accelerate project execution. Phase One consists of an 807-mile, 42-inch pipeline to transport natural gas from Alaska’s North Slope to meet Alaska’s domestic energy needs. Worley is expected to complete final engineering and cost analysis for the pipeline in December leading into a final investment decision on this phase of the project.

Phase Two of the project will add the LNG terminal and related infrastructure to enable 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG export capability and is expected to declare FID in late 2026.

Glenfarne became lead developer of Alaska LNG in March. Since then, Glenfarne has secured preliminary commercial commitments with leading LNG buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand for 11 MPTA of LNG, more than 60% of the volume needed to reach FID, including recent agreements with Tokyo Gas, JERA Co. Inc. and POSCO International Corporation.

Glenfarne’s permitted North American LNG portfolio totals 32.8 MTPA of capacity across projects in Alaska, Texas, and Louisiana. The companies previously announced that Baker Hughes will supply compression equipment for Glenfarne’s Texas LNG project.

Inflation and higher energy costs were among the issues that helped Democrats notch larger-than-expected wins in last week’s off-year elections, particularly in gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, as well as in Georgia, where voters elected two Democrats to the state’s utility board, the first time any members of that party will serve on it in almost two decades.

In Virginia, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger made clean power, including renewables and offshore wind, central to her goal of lowering energy prices for the state’s residents. Likewise, in New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill pledged to declare a state of emergency over rising utility costs on her first day in office and freeze rate increases for residential customers. She said her administration will also “massively build out cheaper and cleaner power generation.”

Surveys consistently show that a majority of Americans favor increased use of renewable power, though earlier this year, Pew and Gallup found support for doing so had weakened considerably from past levels. Perhaps that’s because Donald Trump was elected on a promise of lowering costs for Americans, particularly energy prices, by setting aside environmental concerns to dramatically increase oil and gas production and even expand coal use. So far, that strategy has failed.

While gasoline prices are down slightly from a year ago, residential electricity rates have jumped about 10% this year, more than double the rate of overall inflation. The rapid increase in power demands from AI data centers has been a big factor in why electricity prices are rising. At the same time, the Trump administration’s elimination of federal incentives for clean power threatens to make it harder over the next few years for utilities to keep up with rapidly growing electricity demand, given that wind and solar systems, combined with battery storage, can be added faster.

And setting aside the climate benefits, clean power is now competitive with conventional natural gas, if not cheaper in many cases. “A gas-fired power plant, a simple cycle plant with a combustion turbine, is probably in the neighborhood of $2,000 a kilowatt to build,” Bob Frenzel, CEO of Minnesota-based utility Xcel Energy, told Forbes. “That's probably the same price as a wind farm, as a rule of thumb. … So you can see where if you're measuring sheer energy, wind can be competitive on a megawatt-hour basis.”

A year from now, when voters go to the polls to decide on who they want in Congress, politicians pushing cheap, clean power could have an edge.

The Big Read

Elon Musk’s $1 Trillion Pay Plan: The Case For Magical Thinking

The only thing more outlandish than Elon Musk’s demand for a $1 trillion pay package is the idea that Tesla’s shareholders would grant it. And yet that is how things played out, with everyone from massive investment funds to small, individual investors approving compensation so vast the new Pope decried it. It’s a bet that lightning will strike again for the most successful U.S. industrial entrepreneur of the 21st century — that Musk can overcome Tesla’s falling electric vehicle sales and his tarnished image by pivoting to AI-powered robotaxis and humanoid robots.

With its stock already trading near an all-time high, at over 300 times projected earnings, many investors appear to think that’s a foregone conclusion even before votes were tallied at today’s annual meeting. Over 75% of shareholders approved the package, Brandon Ehrhart, Tesla’s general counsel, told attendees.

“Tesla's current valuation only makes sense if you attribute magic powers to Elon Musk,” said Gautam Mukunda, a professor with the Yale School of Management. “If you break out the new business lines he’s talking about, there’s no particular reason to believe that Tesla is the leading company for self-driving cars. Waymo's technology is clearly better. … The only evidence that Tesla is the leader in this technology is that Elon Musk says so.”

And that’s also the crux of the proxy. “Musk’s greatest skill is his ability to convince investors that he can do the miraculous,” said Mukunda.

Hot Topic

Dandelion Energy CEO Dan Yates on its leasing program for geothermal systems to cut home heating and cooling costs

What you’re doing is different from conventional and next-generation geothermal systems that generate energy. How does Dandelion’s tech work?

We are not generating electricity or power at all. We are using a bore in the backyard effectively to exchange heat with the earth. So we're sucking heat out of the earth using a heat pump inside the house. The result of that is an ultra-high efficiency furnace and air conditioner. The vast majority of building emissions are from heating and cooling, not climate change, but climate control-related. We basically cut that in half. The big driver for our business and for the industry is that everything is getting electrified – and we've been an unexpected and happy beneficiary of some evolution in the federal regulatory landscape that’s supporting geothermal.

But again, things are getting electrified. We've seen it first and most notably with transportation and electric vehicles, but it's coming for heating now, too. In fact, for the last two years, more heat pumps have been sold than natural gas furnaces in the U.S., which is surprising to most people. That's trend one. Trend two is that there's a tremendous amount of pressure on the electric grid, and demand is going up most notably from AI data centers, but also just from the broader electrification initiatives.

Geothermal is by far the least impactful on the electric grid of any electric heating option. A homebuyer will enjoy half the energy consumption or utility bills from a geothermal system compared to a conventional air source heat pump.

How deep do you need to drill for a home system?

It's a question of the capacity or the heating demand of the house. As a general matter, it’s about 100 to 150 feet for every ton of heating. A typical new home requires maybe three tons, so that’s about 400 feet.

What's the approximate size of the hole you’re boring? And what are you installing in it?

Five-and-a-half inches. It’s a very narrow bore.

We install a ground loop, which is two pipes that are really right next to each other, and then they're connected at just the bottom with what's called a U-bend that connects the two pipes of the water. It flows down one and then comes right back up the other one. We run that down to the bottom, along with a third pipe that's called a tremie line. You end up with a fully cemented-in finished product where there's really no environmental interaction. It's locked in there, it's done.

I jokingly call our kind of geothermal “lukewarm geothermal.” A system like Fervo’s is going much deeper and looking for 500-degree heat, where they’re trying to make steam. … What we do is suck the heat out of the water that's circulating through this loop and concentrate that heat up to 110 degrees, then pump that, blowing air over it to circulate air into the house to heat the house. Then we're pumping water back down into the hole that's now almost at freezing, so we actually put antifreeze in the water. You'll have 30-degree water going back into the hole, and then that water gets heated up from the 50-degree Earth. Then we suck the heat out of that water again and push it into the house. It's a classic refrigeration cycle where you're making something hotter than the surrounding area by pushing heat into the hotter area.

The classic performance metric for a heat pump is COP, the coefficient of power, which is how many units of energy do you produce for every unit of heat that you consume from electricity? Our systems regularly have a COP around 5 or in the low 4s, and that's the full seasonal lifecycle of the system. What you'll see listed as the highest efficiency air source heat pumps will be in the 3s, but then when you get to the coldest days of the year, they drop into the 2s, and many of them drop into the 1s. So we end up having this major overperformance relative to conventional heat pumps.

You’re leasing systems to homeowners. So what does using this type of heating and cooling system cost, factoring in federal and state incentives?

We are already the happy recipient of a number of state-level incentives. We've got a lot of activity in the Mid-Atlantic, the Northeast and in Colorado. All of these regions have pretty robust state-level incentives that encourage geothermal.

One detail with federal rules is the tax credit is only available to commercially-owned geothermal systems. You can't build a home with geothermal, sell it to the home buyer, and then they go and file for the credit. They're not a commercial entity. The system doesn't have to be in a commercial building. It just has to be owned by a corporation, essentially.

That's where leasing came in. [Congress] inserted language that said geothermal systems can be leased. And that allowed us to take this sizable credit. The base credit is 30%, but you get 10% extra if the system is built, predominantly, in the U.S. – and essentially all geothermal systems are. So it's effectively a 40% credit across the board.

Our leasing partners typically will structure something like 20-year leases. The punchline is that the homebuyers are paying anywhere from as little as $15 bucks a month to $60, sort of in that range. And they're saving anywhere from $600 to $1,000 a year.

Sourced from the EU Emissions Trading System, these projects will benefit from a total of €643 million to help deploy their ground-breaking decarbonisation solutions.

The projects are expected to enter into operation between 2027 and 2029 and should reduce emissions by some 88 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent over their first ten years of operation.

Located across four EU Member States, these projects represent a major boost to Europe’s manufacturing industry and the emerging battery ecosystem. Implementing innovative processes and technologies, they will support key segments of the battery value chain with advanced material production, cell manufacturing, recycling technologies and second-life applications.

Their combined impact will contribute to:

the creation of direct and indirect jobs

increased European autonomy and reduced dependence on external suppliers

By accelerating the commercialisation of next-generation EV battery innovations, the projects will play a key role in delivering on the EU’s climate and industrial objectives, while strengthening technological competitiveness and resilience.

As a key clean technology, EV batteries advance the objectives of theClean Industrial Deal and Industrial Action Plan for the European automobile sector by supporting the business case for products necessary in the clean transition and improving Europe’s competitiveness in this area. They are also in line with the objectives of the Net-Zero Industry Act and the Critical Raw Materials Act by reducing dependence on imported materials and building resilient, sustainable supply chains. Their second life and recycling applications align with the Circular Economy Action Plan, the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy. Finally, the projects selected under this call are consistent with the Batteries Regulation, which promotes a competitive and sustainable European battery industry.

Background

A Grant Agreement is the formal contract between the European Commission and the project beneficiary that defines the project’s objectives, funding amount, eligible costs, rights, and obligations under the Innovation Fund.

The Innovation Fund 2024 Battery call was launched on 3 December 2024 and closed on 24 April 2025, attracting 14 applications from across Europe. In July 2025, the European Commission announced that six projects were invited to enter the grant preparation phase. One of the six invited projects decided to withdraw from grant preparation, resulting in five successfully signing their Grant Agreements with CINEA.

With an estimated revenue of €40 billion (calculated based on a carbon price of €75 per tonne of CO2) from the EU Emissions Trading System between 2020 and 2030, the Innovation Fund seeks to drive investment in cutting-edge, low-carbon and net-zero technologies, supporting Europe’s transition to climate neutrality.

Also launched in 2024, the Innovation Fund call for proposals for net-zero technologies has recently announced the 61 projects selected for grant agreement preparation along with its second renewable hydrogen auction under the European Hydrogen Bank. Grant agreements for both the call and auction are expected to be signed in the coming months.

(TSXV: SURG) (OTCQB: SRGXF) (Frankfurt: G6D2) (“Surge” or the “Company”) provides its perspective on recent policy and infrastructure developments that strengthen Canada’s critical minerals framework and investment climate. These initiatives, spanning fiscal incentives announced in the 2025 Federal Budget, the launch of the G7 Critical Minerals Alliance, and provincial investments in transmission infrastructure in British Columbia, highlight the evolving landscape for responsible development of projects such as the Company’s 100%-owned Berg copper-molybdenum project in west-central British Columbia.

Federal Budget 2025: Expanded Support for Critical Minerals

The Government of Canada’s 2025 Federal Budget introduced several measures that reinforce national competitiveness in critical minerals development. Key initiatives include:

Expansion of the Clean Technology Manufacturing Investment Tax Credit (CTMITC): Budget 2025 confirms the federal government’s intention to proceed with previously announced measures to expand eligibility under this 30 percent refundable tax credit (which can eliminate a company’s income tax payable in a given year and provide a cash refund for any remaining balance), including the addition of new critical minerals and support for polymetallic mining and processing activities. Once implemented, these measures could meaningfully expand access to this important fiscal incentive for projects such as Berg, where the majority of production by value is anticipated to come from copper.

Extension and expansion of the Critical Minerals Exploration Tax Credit: Budget 2025 broadens eligibility for this flow-through-share incentive to include molybdenum and other transition metals, reflecting the federal government’s recognition of their importance in high-performance steel and industrial, technological, and energy applications. Molybdenum represents a significant component of the Berg resource and a key value driver for the project.

Creation of new federal investment vehicles: Budget 2025 outlines new and expanded federally funded investment vehicles, including the Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund and the First and Last Mile Fund, aimed at providing direct equity and infrastructure support to qualifying projects.

Enhanced coordination of federal project financing initiatives: Budget 2025 introduces a new framework to align Canada’s major project financing institutions, including the Major Projects Office, Canada Infrastructure Bank, Canada Growth Fund, Export Development Canada, and the Canada Indigenous Loan Guarantee Corporation. The initiative is designed to streamline access to capital and coordinate support for “nation-building” projects that advance clean growth, economic competitiveness, and Indigenous participation. This integrated approach aims to accelerate the development of large-scale strategic projects across Canada’s resource and infrastructure sectors.

Collectively, these measures may influence the economic framework for Canadian critical minerals projects and provide potential incentives for advanced development projects such as Berg.

G7 Critical Minerals Alliance: Global Demand Alignment

Canada’s leadership role in the newly established G7 Critical Minerals Alliance underscores an international commitment to developing secure, transparent, and standards-based supply chains for materials essential to modern industrial, technological, and energy systems. Surge believes this framework will encourage long-term cooperation between allied nations and may support diversified and transparent supply chains for responsibly produced critical minerals, including copper and molybdenum concentrates.

As a potential future producer of copper and molybdenum concentrates with no offtake agreements yet in place, Berg offers flexibility to supply either domestic processors or allied markets, aligning with Canada’s goal of diversifying exports beyond the United States and strengthening trusted supply chains.

British Columbia: Enabling Infrastructure and Investment Climate

Complementing federal and international initiatives, the Government of British Columbia has advanced the North Coast Transmission Line (NCTL), a multi-phase transmission project intended to expand grid capacity in the northwest of the province to support growth in sectors such as ports, mining, and LNG. Under Bill 31 (Energy Statutes Amendment Act, 2025), the Province is fast-tracking the project by amending legislation to allow co-ownership with First Nations, streamline permitting, and adjust the electricity-allocation framework such that connection priority is given to vital growth industries (including mining and resource development) rather than the typical first-come, first-served basis. Construction is expected to begin in 2026 with phased in-service dates targeted around 2030.

While the Berg Project does not strictly depend on the NCTL for its power connection, the initiative creates important flexibility in a region where demand for industrial electricity is rapidly escalating. It reflects the government’s proactive recognition of potential infrastructure bottlenecks and its willingness to act in advance to unlock resource development.

Positioning of the Berg Project

With these converging policy developments, Berg is well aligned with current federal and provincial initiatives supporting critical minerals development. The project’s large-scale copper and molybdenum resource, favourable logistics, and low-carbon, hydro-powered design align directly with national and international priorities for responsible resource development.

“Recent policy developments, including Budget 2025 measures and federal and provincial infrastructure initiatives, highlight Canada’s efforts to strengthen its critical minerals sector,” said Leif Nilsson, CEO of Surge. “Projects such as Berg illustrate how these policy measures could create opportunities for advancing critical minerals development in Canada through coordinated efforts among industry, government, and Indigenous partners.”

“The Board’s approval of the EIR Scattergood Generating Station Units 1 and 2 Green Hydrogen-Ready Modernization Project is monumental not only for LADWP but the City of Los Angeles,” said LADWP CEO and Chief Engineer Janisse Quiñones. “The Scattergood project is a critical clean energy solution for Los Angeles that will also maintain power reliability and grid resiliency especially as we face more unpredictable threats to our electrical system and our environment.”

The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process for the project was initiated in 2023 and included community outreach that captured comments during the public review period. According to project filings, LADWP is proposing to install fuel-flexible combined cycle equipment capable of burning significant amounts of renewable energy-sourced hydrogen to replace the generating capacity currently provided by SGS Units 1 and 2. The 346 MW project would cost an estimated $800 million, with an in-service date of Dec. 30, 2029.

Scattergood Generating Station provides firm energy capacity in-basin. The plant provides local generation capability by bridging power shortfalls including periods of extreme demand during high heat, earthquakes and wildfires, as occurred in January 2025. Scattergood is also meant to provide the insurance of local power generation when LADWP works on transmission line upgrades to bring in more renewable energy from outside the basin. In addition, the completion of the modernization project at Scattergood will help ensure that LADWP meets California’s regulatory mandates related to Once Through Cooling.

The modernization project at Scattergood entails replacing the generating capacity of the existing Scattergood Units 1 and 2, which are conventional natural-gas-fired steam-boiler generators, with a rapid-response combined-cycle generation system (CCGS) capable of operating on a fuel mixture of natural gas and a minimum of 30 percent hydrogen by volume. The proposed CCGS would consist of a combustion-turbine generator and a steam-turbine generator operating in tandem.

A Request for Proposals to execute the Scattergood Modernization Project is closing in November, and the Board of Water and Power Commissioners must review and approve the contract award before it proceeds. The project is expected to be in service by the end of 2029.

This includes three dozen permanent, technically advanced positions at the plant and hundreds of jobs in West Virginia’s natural gas industry.
Tierney said the new generation would work alongside the company’s existing plants to deliver consistent, reliable power for customers, supporting a strong energy future for West Virginia.
“We want developers and decision-makers to see that West Virginia isn’t just adjacent to opportunity, it is the opportunity,” Tierney added.
“Between 2025 and 2029, we plan to invest $5.2 billion in West Virginia in infrastructure enhancements, people, processes and facilities.","FirstEnergy has proposed the construction of a 1,200-MW combined-cycle natural gas plant and 70-MW of utility-scale solar in West Virginia, with the company touting 3,260 jobs and $68 million in state and local tax revenue stemming from the project.

FirstEnergy subsidiaries Mon Power and Potomac Edison will file plans with the West Virginia Public Service Commission in early 2026 to pursue one of two options for the new gas generation: partnering with another company to build and transfer the plant to the companies, or building it independently with construction and design experts. A site for the new plant has not yet been determined.

“This planned generation is a promise – a promise to keep energy costs manageable, to ensure reliability during peak demand and to support local investment and job creation,” FirstEnergy Board Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer Brian X. Tierney said. “It’s a promise to West Virginia families, workers and industries that FirstEnergy is here for the long haul.”

In addition to the construction jobs, a study by West Virginia University Bureau of Business and Economic Research reports the gas plant’s ongoing operations are estimated to support nearly 2,200 direct and indirect jobs and $85.9 million in annual state and local tax revenue. This includes three dozen permanent, technically advanced positions at the plant and hundreds of jobs in West Virginia’s natural gas industry.

Tierney said the new generation would work alongside the company’s existing plants to deliver consistent, reliable power for customers, supporting a strong energy future for West Virginia.

“It will be designed to work in concert with our existing energy infrastructure, including the Harrison Power Station and Ft. Martin Power Station, supporting a balanced and reliable energy mix that leverages all of West Virginia’s abundant resources to power all of the state’s generation,” he said.

“We want developers and decision-makers to see that West Virginia isn’t just adjacent to opportunity, it is the opportunity,” Tierney added. “With this investment, we’re laying the groundwork for data centers, advanced manufacturers and other innovative businesses to choose West Virginia as the place to grow, invest and thrive.”

In addition to new generation capacity, FirstEnergy is upgrading transmission lines, strengthening local poles and wires and implementing advanced grid technologies to build a more resilient electric system across West Virginia.

“Our commitment to West Virginia’s future is expansive,” Tierney said. “Between 2025 and 2029, we plan to invest $5.2 billion in West Virginia in infrastructure enhancements, people, processes and facilities. Pending regulatory approval of this generation, we anticipate investing an additional $2.5 billion – further accelerating economic growth and opportunity throughout the region.”

The thirtieth anniversary of COP summits has little time to celebrate: Ten years after the world agreed to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, that threshold has been breached.

Brazil insisted on hosting the talks in Belém, a small coastal city on the Amazon’s edge, to place the rainforest, nature, planet and people negotiators are there to protect at the center of negotiations.

Limited hotels and housing has delegates housed on mammoth cruise ships casting long shadows over local fishing villages. Others will spend the week in local, pay-by-the-hour love motels. All will be working under the heavy humidity and heat of the world’s largest rainforest, a constant reminder of the climate future awaiting the billions around the world if negotiations fail.

“Climate change is not a threat of the future, it is already a tragedy of the present,” Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva told the opening plenary, citing the hurricane that levelled Jamaica and a “trail of destruction, droughts, fires in Africa and Europe, floods in South America and South East Asia” that have killed thousands and displaced millions.

“The climate emergency is a case of inequality, it exposes and exacerbates the unacceptable,” Lula said.

He also attacked rising military spending, arguing the world should prioritise climate finance over defence budgets. “The men that go to war, if they were here, present here, at this COP, they would perceive that it’s much cheaper to put $1.3 trillion for us to end the climate crisis than to put $2 trillion and sell $700 billion to buy weapons and go to war,” he said.

Progress has been made since Paris. The planet was then on pace for 4°C of warming by century’s end. Today’s business-as-usual scenario projects 2.8°C. If countries implement their Paris commitments, warming could fall to between 2.3°C and 2.5°C.

Unlike previous summits, COP30 is not expected to produce a landmark agreement. Instead, the focus is implementation: meeting the promises made in Paris, Baku and Dubai to raise climate finance, transition away from fossil fuels, and return warming to under 1.5°C.

The tasks ahead may be the most difficult COP in years: find the money, international cooperation and political will to protect billions facing life or death on current warming projections.

In his inaugural address as COP president, André Aranha Corrêa do Lago said three priorities will dominate the agenda: climate adaptation, finance for a just transition, and implementing the global stocktake recommendations on clean energy and reversing deforestation.

“This is a COP of implementation,” said Corrêa do Lago. “I hope it will be remembered as a COP of adaptation, a COP of advancing climate integration with economic activity and generation of jobs, and above all, a COP which will hear and believe in science.”

‘COP of truth’

The latest COP is the first in several years not to be clouded by the smoke and scandal of petrostate hosts.

The last two climate summits, held in the UAE and Azerbaijan, two nations heavily reliant on state owned oil conglomerates for government revenue, were hit with scandals alleging subterfuge and coordination between the chiefs of negotiations and fossil fuel interests seeking to weaken any global agreement.

This year, pressure on the negotiations comes from outside the host nation, as the United States, the world’s largest historical emitter, spurns the talks entirely. Presidents Xi and Modi of China and India, topping off the list of the world’s three largest polluters, will not attend the Brazil summit, either.

A fear of US influence from Washington looms over the talks despite them not sending a team. The Trump administration has used intimidation and economic threats to derail recent talks over maritime climate taxes, and employed similar tactics at the failed plastics treaty negotiations in Geneva in August.

Last week, Donald Trump declared on social media following an opinion piece by Bill Gates in which he argued for a change in the framing of climate change from a “doomsday view” to more optimistic framing to galvanise action: “I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax.”

“Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue,” Trump declared.

Brazilian President Lula has sought to frame COP30 as a direct counter to forces such as the US administration, who nixed all US climate commitments made by his predecessor, calling climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated” and a “hoax”.

European Union officials have taken a similar tack. The bloc’s chief negotiator, Jacob Werksman, said last week COP30 must press on against the “strong counter narrative that’s coming from a particular part of the world, suggesting that climate change is a hoax.”

In an indirect swipe at the US in his opening remarks, Lula referred to a coalition of ‘denialists’ which he said: “reject not only the evidence and science,” but attack multilateralism, spread “hatred and fear,” and “attack institutions, science and universities.”

“Now is the moment to defeat the denialists,” Lula said.

The Brazilian president’s crusade against climate denialism stems from personal experience. Under the nation’s previous president, Jair Bolsonaro, who like Trump dismissed climate change as a hoax, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon reached record heights and Brazil was entirely absent from the global stage. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for organizing a coup against Lula.

Under his presidency, Brazil’s emissions fell nearly 17% last year – the biggest drop in 15 years – as his government cracked down on illegal deforestation.

Whether the United States – which has never truly stepped into the climate leadership role its historical emissions would suggest – might one day follow a similar path from climate denial back to engagement remains an open question. But Brazil’s transformation shows it’s possible.

‘Growth story of the 21st century’

As green technology surges ahead, climate denial is increasingly at odds with basic economics. While the US retreats from climate leadership, China is moving to consolidate its dominance in renewable energy manufacturing and deployment, positioning itself to dominate the energy markets of the future.

“The economics of this transition are as indisputable as the costs of inaction,” UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates. “Solar and wind are now the lowest-cost power in 90% of the world. Renewables overtook coal this year as the world’s top energy source.”

“This is the growth story of the 21st Century, the economic transformation of our age,” Stiell said. “Those opting out or taking baby steps face stagnation and higher prices, while other economies surge ahead.”

But translating that economic momentum into the financing needed for a global transition remains the central – and likely insurmountable – challenge of COP30.

At the opening ceremony of COP30, outgoing president Mukhtar Babayev presented delegates with an “invoice for climate justice”, a document outlining the minimum financial commitments required from wealthy nations.

The invoice includes: $40 billion in urgent adaptation finance by 2025, tripling climate funds to $5.1 billion by 2030, and the $300 billion annual pledge by 2035 that emerged from last year’s negotiations.

The total including the aspirational $1.3 trillion annual climate funding target in the Baku finance deal? Several trillion.

The invoice is addressed specifically to what are known as Annex II countries under the UN climate convention: 39 developed nations identified in 1992 when the framework was first opened for signing. These include the United States, European Union members, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, and a handful of others.

But the US, historically the world’s largest emitter and responsible for roughly 40% of climate finance under this framework, has walked away from the table. The gap in the $1.3 trillion annual target agreed in Baku created by a US exit breaks the math: The EU and other Annex II nations cannot shoulder $1.3 trillion, or even the scaled-back $300bn commitment, on their own.

This leads to the second, politically fraught problem that has plagued environmental negotiations from plastics, to biodiversity and climate alike for years: several of the world’s wealthiest nations – China, Russia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Poland, the United Arab Emirates, and Mexico – are classified as developing countries under the 1992 framework. They are not obligated to contribute climate finance, and they have so far largely refused to do so voluntarily.

Since then, China’s cumulative emissions have surpassed the EU’s while it has become the world’s second-largest economy. Early drafts of the Baku agreement proposed expanding the donor list to include some of these nations. That language was quietly dropped from the final text, leaving the donor list unchanged.

China, the world’s largest annual emitter, contributes approximately $3.8 billion per year in climate finance, a fraction of what it would owe under a system based on current emissions or economic capacity. It does provide developing nations with cheap green technology, but resists any formal obligation to pay into global climate funds.

Analysis by the Center for Global Development suggests that by 2030, non-Annex II nations should collectively shoulder around 30% of total climate finance, with Annex II countries covering the remaining 70%.

Even the $300bn target, however, remains distant. Current climate finance flows are estimated between $28 billion, according to Oxfam, which excludes loans, and $116 billion by OECD figures, which count loans equally with grants. The $1.3tn economists say is needed grows more remote with each passing year as inflation and continued warming increase the cost of adaptation and mitigation.

The Baku agreement also made a key compromise to get it over the line: leaving unresolved whether loans should count toward the finance target. Loans currently make up two-thirds of climate finance for the Global South, with some countries, like France, providing 86% of their climate finance through loans.

If this loan-to-grant ratio continues, approximately $200 billion of the $300 billion 2035 target would come as loans rather than grants, which developing countries argue perpetuates rather than solves their debt crises.

“We now need to put the Baku to Belém roadmap to work to start moving towards the 1.3 trillion,” Stiell said.

Billions of lives, species, and nations

The planet warming in line with the latest projections is a matter of life and death for billions of people, species, and nations.

Over half a million people have died every year due to heat exposure over the past decade. Millions die due to air pollution. Conflicts drive resource wars, while droughts cause famine and displacement. Extreme weather destroys homes, while sea level rise threatens nations themselves.

The UNHCR’s latest report, released on the opening day of the summit, adds to the reality just decades away – or already here – for the world’s most vulnerable populations.

“Three in every four refugees and other displaced people fleeing war and persecution now live in countries that are highly vulnerable to climate-related hazards,” UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi said. “These communities face an impossible reality – they are being hit harder by more devastating floods, longer droughts and periods of extreme heat, without the means to adapt, recover and rebuild.”

Of the 117 million people displaced by conflict today, around 75% – 86 million – are exposed to extreme weather. The one million refugees who returned home in the first half of this year returned to countries highly vulnerable to more of the climate impacts that displaced them in the first place.

“Whilst mega droughts wreck national harvests, sending food prices soaring, it makes zero sense, economically or politically, to squabble while famines take hold, forcing millions to flee their homelands – this will never be forgotten,” Stiell said. “As conflicts spread while climate disasters decimate the lives of millions when we already have the solutions this will never, ever be forgiven.”

“We have already agreed that transition pathways must be inclusive and just, covering whole economies and societies,” the UNFCCC chief added. “Now we must agree on concrete steps to turn aspirations into actions.”

Health is back

https://www.twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1987182305517986083?s=20

The World Health Organization, in collaboration with Wellcome and the global health community, is hosting a Health Pavilion at COP30 in the Blue Zone throughout the talks to showcase evidence and solutions to maximise the health benefits of tackling climate change across regions, sectors and communities.

“A sick planet means sick people,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told delegates at the opening. “The climate crisis is a health crisis – not in the future, but now. It is already spreading disease, worsening malnutrition, displacing communities, and claiming lives through heat, floods, fires, and pollution.”

Featured organizations include WHO, Gavi, the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative, UNITAID, national health agencies, academic institutions, the International Committee of the Red Cross and pharmaceutical industry representatives.

It’s an apparent upgrade from last year’s COP29 in Baku, where WHO’s marquee health event took place in a cramped, windowless meeting room and peaked at just 18 attendees on a Microsoft Teams call.

The meeting resulted in a “letter of intent” to form a coalition to continue discussions about taking action – the kind of bureaucratic outcome that has left health advocates frustrated after decades fighting for recognition at climate talks.

Beyond the political rhetoric, health-specific climate action remains severely underfunded, capturing only 2% of adaptation funding and 0.5% of multilateral climate funding.

“Health is the strongest argument for climate action,” Tedros said. “It’s much easier to convince people of the need to protect their own health or that of their children, than to protect glaciers or ecosystems. Both are important. One is a lot closer to home.”

“Put health at the centre of every climate decision. Direct climate finance towards protecting lives and livelihoods. And recognise health as a measure of climate ambition and success. Because there can be no healthy people on a sick planet.”

The talks continue through November 21.",https://i0.wp.com/healthpolicy-watch.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54914367220_05f2ee1f93_k.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 16:11:08.758790

Located on a 1.5-kilometer stretch of the A10 motorway near Paris, this pilot project demonstrates dynamic wireless power transfer at speeds up to 300 kilowatts—surpassing even Tesla’s Supercharger network. Developed by Israeli firm Electreon in collaboration with VINCI Autoroutes and Gustave Eiffel University, the system embeds copper coils beneath the asphalt to generate a magnetic field, allowing equipped vehicles to charge seamlessly while driving.

Early tests have shown impressive results: cars, buses, and heavy trucks receiving continuous power at around 200 kW, with peaks hitting 300 kW. This innovation addresses key EV adoption barriers like range anxiety and lengthy charging stops, as reported by TechRadar. According to Electreon’s CEO Oren Ezer, ‘This is a pivotal moment for zero-emission mobility,’ highlighting the system’s potential for widespread adoption.

Pioneering Dynamic Charging Technology

The technology relies on inductive charging, where underground coils create an electromagnetic field that transfers energy to receivers on vehicles. Unlike static wireless charging pads, this dynamic version operates at highway speeds, making it ideal for long-haul routes. Fox News detailed how the French pilot delivered over 300 kW to multiple vehicles simultaneously, potentially eliminating the need for large battery packs in trucks, as per Fox News.

Electreon’s system has been tested globally, but this French deployment marks the first on a public highway. Posts on X from users like Disclose.tv emphasize its expansion plans to the U.S., Europe, and Asia, underscoring the technology’s scalability. The project, launched in late October 2025, involved rigorous testing with vehicles like the Iveco eDaily van and Renault Master, achieving charge rates that double the power for heavy vehicles compared to lighter ones.

Overcoming Infrastructure Challenges

Cost remains a significant hurdle, with installations estimated at nearly $2 million per mile, as noted in a BBC article on similar U.S. trials in Detroit (BBC). However, proponents argue that long-term savings from reduced battery sizes and downtime could offset this. In France, the A10 segment integrates with existing infrastructure, minimizing disruptions during construction.

Electrek reported on the trial’s world-first achievement, where four vehicles charged at up to 300 kW on a 1.5 km road (Electrek). This surpasses Tesla’s V3 Superchargers, which max out at 250 kW, and even approaches the V4’s potential. Industry insiders view this as a game-changer for freight trucking, where electric options have lagged due to charging logistics.

Global Precedents and Comparisons

Sweden pioneered a permanent electrified road in 2023, planning 3,000 km by 2035, according to Euronews (Euronews). Meanwhile, Indiana’s Department of Transportation announced magnetizable concrete highways in 2021 (INDOT). France’s version stands out for its high power output and multi-vehicle capability.

On X, posts from Indian Infra Report and Mossad Commentary highlight the Israeli innovation behind Electreon’s tech, with views exceeding 300,000, signaling strong public interest. The Indian Express noted the highway’s ability to charge at up to 200 kW continuously for buses and trucks (The Indian Express).

Implications for Heavy-Duty Vehicles

For electric freight trucking, this technology could be transformative. Electreon’s press release via PR Newswire states that heavy trucks received twice the power, enabling zero-emission long-haul operations (PR Newswire). New Atlas described early results showing over 300 kW transfers, making tailgating trucks an efficient charging strategy (New Atlas).

Cenex, in a 2025 report, discussed the rise of wireless charging in EV infrastructure, noting projects like Detroit’s quarter-mile road (Cenex). X posts from Sawyer Merritt in 2023 echoed this, with Detroit’s installation activating for equipped vehicles only.

Economic and Environmental Impact

Adopting such highways could accelerate EV uptake, reducing fossil fuel dependence. Electreon’s website claims their solutions charge vehicles while driving or idling, promoting sustainable mobility (Electreon). In France, this aligns with EU goals for net-zero emissions by 2050, as seen in X posts from NBCUniversal Catalyst about EV charging innovations.

However, challenges include retrofitting vehicles with receivers and ensuring compatibility across manufacturers. Industry experts, quoted in Carscoops, suggest this could make plug-in stations obsolete (Carscoops). Expansion plans, as per ESG Post, target broader European networks (ESG Post).

Future Prospects and Scalability

Looking ahead, Electreon plans pilots in the U.S. and Asia, building on this success. X sentiment, from users like Mario Nawfal discussing Sweden’s e-roads, shows growing excitement for eliminating range anxiety. TechPulse Daily on X praised the French system’s speed over Tesla’s network.

Ultimately, this French breakthrough, as detailed in multiple sources, positions dynamic wireless charging as a cornerstone of future EV ecosystems, with potential to revolutionize global transportation infrastructure.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/article-802-1762749406.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 18:01:03.308998

Louisiana is actively supporting new economic and industrial growth. We understand the needs of large power users, from data centers to advanced manufacturing, who are seeking reliable, cost-competitive clean energy solutions.”

“Our partnership with Meta marks a critical milestone for Treaty Oak and our commitment to support our customers and their growing clean energy needs in MISO’s Southern footprint, as well as our broader mission to deliver impactful, scalable clean energy solutions across the U.S.,” said Rohit Ogra, co-founder and Chief Revenue Officer of Treaty Oak. “Together with Meta, we’re strengthening local energy resilience, supporting economic development, and creating long-term value for the communities in which we operate in Louisiana.”

“Our partnership with Treaty Oak reflects Meta’s and Treaty Oak’s shared commitment to bringing new, additional clean energy to the local grid,” said Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of Global Energy. “When we announced our AI [artificial intelligence] data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid—and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy while contributing to local energy resilience and economic growth across Louisiana.”

“Beekman Solar in Morehouse Parish and Hollis Creek Solar in Sabine Parish represent our strategy coming to life,” said Elrod. He told POWER, “We’ve worked closely with local officials, landowners, and community leaders in both parishes, and we appreciate the strong support that has helped us advance these projects through the approval process. We’re excited to bring these facilities online in 2027 to support Meta’s operations in the region, and these projects are important milestones toward our goal of delivering 1 gigawatt of clean power in Louisiana by the end of the decade.”

The utility-scale solar projects are each expected to generate more than $100 million in combined lifetime state and local tax revenue and create about 300 jobs during peak construction.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-treaty-oak-clean-energy-adobe-stock-1024x655.png,N,,2025-11-10 15:06:02.801084

STARKVILLE, Miss.—Building on a growing energy-related research portfolio, Mississippi State University is launching the Energy Resilience and Innovation Hub to foster collaboration and innovation that will support the Magnolia State’s future energy needs.

Led by MSU Associate Vice President for Research and Economic Development Narcisa Pricope, the unit will serve as a thinktank and collaborative hub working to catalyze economic growth, strengthen community and institutional energy resilience, foster policy alignment, and promote access to energy resources.

“The Energy Resilience and Innovation Hub will bring together researchers, industry partners and communities to accelerate innovation and ensure Mississippi remains at the forefront of a secure and sustainable energy future,” Pricope said. “This initiative underscores our commitment to advancing technologies and strategies that strengthen energy systems statewide and beyond.”

The hub was announced at this month’s Mississippi Water and Energy Conference hosted by MSU. Pricope noted MSU is working toward several projects that tackle areas such as energy efficiency, local government retrofits and audits, water-energy resilience, policy and workforce, and renewable site planning. The new initiative builds on existing MSU expertise in energy systems, grid resilience, clean fuels, energy storage, artificial intelligence and carbon utilization.

The hub will provide a dedicated space for sharing information, building partnerships and aligning research and development efforts across multiple sectors. As energy systems evolve, the initiative will support emerging workforce development needs to ensure Mississippians are ready to take advantage of current and future job opportunities in the energy sector.

During the conference, Pricope said MSU was recently awarded $1.2 million to support R-STEP: Renewable Energy Siting Through Technical Engagement and Planning. Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and allocated through the Mississippi Development Authority, the project will support site planning and permitting for renewable energy developments in Mississippi.

With training and outreach carried out by MSU Extension’s Center for Government and Development, the funding will be used to build capacity and develop renewable energy playbooks tailored to Mississippi’s needs.

Vantage Data Centers Plans $2B Virginia Investment

More detailed information is available for another recent data center announcement: Vantage Data Centers will invest $2 billion to build a state-of-the-art data center campus in Stafford County, Virginia. At full capacity, the project will create 50 new jobs in the Commonwealth.

“Fredericksburg offered a significant opportunity for Vantage to serve our customers seeking capacity and access to the resources of Data Center Alley,” said Vantage Data Centers North America President Dana Adams. “The region’s proximity to major metros, access to robust infrastructure, and growing technology ecosystem make it an ideal location to meet skyrocketing demand. Virginia has been a cornerstone of Vantage’s North American growth since we first entered the market in 2017, and we’re pleased to expand our presence to Fredericksburg—helping establish it as a meaningful digital hub while contributing to the region’s economic growth and technological advancements.”

Located just over an hour from Vantage’s three existing Virginia campuses in Northern Virginia, the new campus — dubbed VA4 — will house three data centers on 82 acres, totaling approximately 929,000 square feet, bringing the company’s statewide capacity to 782MW with a combined investment of approximately $8 billion. The campus will be built to achieve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification and in alignment with Vantage’s “sustainable by design” blueprint, operating with a closed-loop chilled water system that minimizes the need for large volumes of water for cooling and supports Vantage’s industry-leading low water usage effectiveness. The new campus will feature liquid-to-liquid cooling with CDU-based equipment capable of handling 100% of IT workloads. The first building is scheduled to open in late 2027.

“Thanks to companies like Vantage, Virginia is leading the world into a future powered by the limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence,” said Governor Glenn Youngkin. “With this $2 billion in investment, Vantage is paving the way for a stronger Stafford County and a stronger Virginia. This project reflects our commitment to innovation, job creation, and economic growth — and it’s another example of how Virginia is winning for families and businesses alike.”

“As AI promises to transform the way we live and work, data center development like Vantage’s VA4 campus are placing Virginia at the center of it all,” said Virginia Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura. “By moving at the speed of business, we are ensuring that these centers can begin serving communities and providing vital revenue for many years to come.”

Launched in 2010 with one data center in California, Vantage has since expanded to more than 30 campuses across five continents.

Austin, TX – Sustainable business advocates and faith-based investment organizations have taken action to block wide enforcement of a new Texas law, known as SB 2337, that would prevent investors from having unrestricted access to expert advice about their investments. The filing argues that SB 2337 violates the free speech guarantees of the First Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The law’s restrictions on advice given to investors as they consider matters affecting their investments are a clear violation of the First Amendment rights of investors and advisors. Today, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, United Church Funds, and Ceres filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas seeking to stop Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton from enforcing the unconstitutional law. The coalition is represented by Democracy Forward in the matter.

In late August, a federal judge enjoined enforcement of the law against the two dominant firms in the world of shareholder proxy advising – Glass Lewis and ISS. The law, however, remains in effect for other organizations, and its scope covers a wide range of activities that are related to shareholder advocacy and proxy advising. Among other things, the law exposes non-profit organizations to liability.

The plaintiffs are faith-based and non-profit organizations that, as part of their missions, partner with institutional investors to engage with companies to seek strong long-term financial performance. As part of that work, the plaintiffs take into account environmental and social impacts of company practices, as well as strong corporate governance and other factors, because they believe – correctly – that these factors can be central to the long-term financial success of companies. SB 2337 classifies those factors as “nonfinancial” and places burdensome restrictions on sharing such considerations with shareholders.

“This law restricts the freedom to invest. Hiding the truth about important long-term aspects of their investments is a disservice to investors. Doing so is not just bad for the future of our communities and our planet, but it is also unconstitutional,” said Skye Perryman, President and CEO of DemocracyForward. “Our team at Democracy Forward is honored to work with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, United Church Funds, and Ceres to defend the right to speak about investments and exercise shareholder rights in Texas.”

“This attempt to silence investors is an unacceptable attack on the First Amendment and the rights of Americans across the country, all in service to special interests. A robust and dynamic economy requires honest competition and the free exchange of ideas that leaders in Texas are seeking to undermine with this law. For these reasons and in light of our longstanding mission to support faith- and values-based investors, we are grateful for the opportunity to join this lawsuit,” said Josh Zinner, Chief Executive Officer of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.

“Our approach to investing has always joined faith and fiduciary duty,” said Rev. Dr. Charles C. Buck, President and CEO of United Church Funds. “Texas’s law is written so vaguely that even ordinary, good-faith stewardship could be misinterpreted as unlawful. Responsible investors shouldn’t have to guess whether sharing our values or our analysis puts us at risk for simply doing our jobs.”

The Democracy Forward legal team working on the case includes Victoria Nugent, Tsuki Hoshijima, and Jennifer Fountain Connolly.

The state's rising population is driving the need for more power, but data centers, including the ones AI relies on, need more power, too.

He argues that Arizona Public Service is trying to serve too many new data centers.
EDITOR'S NOTE: This story has been modified to correct that Arizona Public Service ended its goal to be carbon zero by 2050.","Artificial intelligence is increasingly creeping into our lives. And in support of that super technology, nondescript data centers are popping up in cities, towns and even near cattle ranches.

They require lots of power — creating new challenges for utilities.

The largest utility in Arizona has a problem. It needs more energy.

""It's hard in the world we live in today to live without electricity,"" said Johnny Penrod, who works for Arizona Public Service.

And the buzzing sound from this power plant in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe is relatively quiet. But if the power turbines were on, we wouldn't be able to talk.

""Basically like a 737 jet engine is what it is,"" Penrod said.

Demand for power in Arizona is expected to keep rising. And meeting that demand can mean life or death in the desert, where temperatures stay above 110 degrees in the summer.

""Here, we can do something to make sure we keep the lights on for our customers,"" said Penrod.

And to keep the air conditioners running.

So, the utility has turned to a pipeline company to bring in more natural gas from Texas. The state's rising population is driving the need for more power, but data centers, including the ones AI relies on, need more power, too.

""I think natural gas is going to play that part,"" said Penrod.

Kevin Thompson is chair of the Arizona Corporation Commission, which regulates utilities. Renewables, including solar, are a part of the utility's portfolio, but not as reliable at all times. So data centers raise an immediate issue.

""It's going to take more generation. It's going to take dispatchable, reliable generation that can be dispatched at night time,"" said Thompson.

The Department of Energy estimates the demand from data centers could nearly triple in the next three years. Nationally, they could use 12% of all energy.

The Trump administration's energy secretary, Chris Wright, spoke about meeting that skyrocketing demand recently with the Council on Foreign Relations.

""With his abundant source of natural gas, that's what's going to power our data centers,"" said Wright.

The national renewable energy laboratory tracks data centers, and their map shows some of the major hot spots in the Mountain West — from Wyoming to Colorado, Utah to Nevada and, of course, Arizona, where driverless taxis are an increasingly common sight.

Tom Maples pages through notes at the DPR Construction office.

He's a project manager with the company, which builds data centers. One of his latest projects was for Meta — in another Phoenix suburb.

""It's really growing very fast in Arizona and around the country, moreso in the last two years,"" said Maples.

Maples says building energy efficient data centers is just good business. But many will still contend with high utility bills.

""As AI has come on,"" he said, ""there's a lot more electricity being consumed.""

Amid this unprecedented demand, some major utilities have slowed their transitions to renewables. Arizona Public Service is among them. It ended its goal to be carbon zero by 2050.

Some are concerned the demand is pushing residential bills up, like Abhay Padgoankar, a consumer advocate. He argues that Arizona Public Service is trying to serve too many new data centers.

""They don't have the capacity for it,"" Padgoankar said.

The utility says it's more complicated than that though. Still residential bills jumped about 8% last year.

""We as residential customers are doing the right things by conserving energy ... by installing solar, by buying energy efficient appliances. We're doing all the right things,"" said Padgoankar.

As data centers grow, so will the demands for more power from the utility, which helps explain why it is moving ahead with the natural gas pipeline.

Johnny Penrod says the utility aims to produce enough power for everyone.

""Basically to keep people safe. Keeping the lights on is so important for everybody,"" said Penrod.

Including the data centers.

One thematic fund to consider is the Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT ).
Furthermore, BATT tracks the EQM Lithium & Battery Technology Index, which includes global exposure for added diversification and to capture these worldwide trends.
“As renewable energy production becomes more widespread, the need for efficient storage systems to manage this energy and stabilize the grid grows,” the Data Bridge report said.
“Government support could prove decisive in determining which projects move forward and, therefore, to what extent U.S. production grows,” the Dallas Fed said.","With this year’s AI-fueled mega cap rally showing signs of potential frothiness, investors might be wondering how to recharge their growth allocation. One thematic fund to consider is the Amplify Lithium & Battery Technology ETF (BATT ).

Under the proverbial hood, BATT is comprised of companies poised to capture future growth from three sub-sectors: battery storage solutions, battery metals & materials, and electric vehicles (EVs). The AI rally confirmed that the world will require copious amounts of electricity in order to continue running. In turn, this will require the capability to maintain an electrical charge, which lithium-ion technology is capable of doing. Hence, the growth opportunity inherent in BATT.

Furthermore, BATT tracks the EQM Lithium & Battery Technology Index, which includes global exposure for added diversification and to capture these worldwide trends. As of September 30, about 50% of the country allocation is split among China and the U.S. However, it includes exposure to countries like Australia, Canada, Japan, and others.

Third party research firm Data Bridge forecasts that the global lithium-ion battery market could reach a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% in just seven years. The demand for renewable energy can certainly drive this growth. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted four years earlier that global renewable energy capacity is expected to grow 60% by the year 2026.

“As renewable energy production becomes more widespread, the need for efficient storage systems to manage this energy and stabilize the grid grows,” the Data Bridge report said.

Adoption of EV usage has been initially slow. However, government incentives could help bring more buyers to EVs in the U.S. Globally, the adoption is already materializing at a rapid clip.

Data from Rho Motion revealed that $2.1 million EVs were sold during the month of September. That represents a monthly record. From January to September 2025, global EV sales have risen by 26% to 14.7 million units. Europe is seeing the largest growth year-to-date, with China coming in second.

“Global EV sales topped 2 million units in a single month for the first time, driven by record-breaking demand across major markets,” said Rho Motion’s data manager Charles Lester. “The US surged ahead as buyers raced to claim expiring tax credits, the UK hit new highs on the back of fresh registration plates and the Electric Car Grant, and South Korea set records thanks to Tesla, Hyundai, Kia, and rising BYD imports. Year to date, EV sales have reached 14.7 million – up 26%.”

Every growth opportunity doesn’t come without its set of challenges. For lithium, macroeconomic headwinds include price volatility amid high supply, geopolitical pressures, and governmental policy changes. That latter, however, could be a prime factor in setting lithium prices on an upward trajectory.

As the Dallas Fed pointed out, one of the catalysts that could provide further tailwinds for lithium prices is the ongoing backing of the U.S. government. With a desire to reduce reliance on nations such as China and bolster domestic production, governmental policies that support mining will be crucial for the industry.

“Government support could prove decisive in determining which projects move forward and, therefore, to what extent U.S. production grows,” the Dallas Fed said. “Indeed, federal interest in securing domestic production has already shaped the industry through billions in subsidized loans and grants and with policies intended to boost demand for domestically produced lithium.”

This makes BATT an ideal buy-and-hold opportunity that could play out in its favor in the long run.

A new study from researchers at the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health; UNC Environment, Energy and Ecology Program; and University of Pristina in Kosovo is shedding light on a hidden challenge facing Southeast Europe’s clean energy transition: fragile, coal-dependent power grids.

The paper, published in Environmental Research: Energy, assesses the power grids of 12 countries in Southeast Europe to gauge their preparedness for a shift to renewable energy and their resilience against more frequent adverse weather events.

The findings show that nations that are most reliant on coal are also the most vulnerable to disruptions as they bring more wind and solar energy online.

The study was led by Serkan Sargin, a doctoral student in the Environment, Ecology, and Energy Program at UNC-Chapel Hill, with co-authors Majlinda Daci, a professor at the University of Prishtina, and Noah Kittner, PhD, an associate professor of environmental sciences and engineering at the Gillings School.

Together, the team built a new framework to evaluate “grid vulnerability,” using eight indicators ranging from reliability and storage capacity to renewable diversity and interconnection strength.

“This is a new study to identify vulnerabilities exposed by reliance on single-dominant electricity generation sources,” said Kittner. “Though focused on Southeast Europe, there are lessons for North Carolina.”

Their results paint a clear picture: Kosovo’s grid ranked as the most vulnerable in the region, followed closely by Albania. Kosovo’s dependence on coal — about 88% of its electricity generation — makes it particularly inflexible and exposed to failures.

Albania, on the other hand, produces all its power from hydropower, but its centralized system lacks diversity and storage, leaving it just as fragile when droughts or shortages hit. By contrast, Croatia and Turkey scored lowest in vulnerability, as a result of stronger infrastructure and a broader mix of renewable energy.

The researchers emphasize that there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. Each country has different weak spots, meaning investments should focus on where they’ll make the biggest impact — whether that’s expanding storage, improving forecasting, decentralizing generation or strengthening cross-border connections.

“Most people are familiar with extreme weather events impacting grid reliability, but our response to natural disasters is also augmented by the infrastructure available to respond to dynamic changes in the environment,” said Kittner.

First, this boxy truck being manufactured by Oshkosh Corp.'s Oshkosh Defense unit has to replace a fleet of vehicular fossils. These Long Life Vehicles (LLVs) built by Grumman from 1986 to 1994 with a 24-year planned lifespan continue to ply USPS routes despite their lack of such conveniences as air bags and air conditioning.

Second, the Biden administration's use of Inflation Reduction Act funding to convert three-quarters of NGDV orders to a battery-electric version means this truck must also bring the Postal Service into the EV era as support for that swings from Biden's sometimes-ineffectual support to President Trump's ignorant contempt for them.

But the vehicle that's supposed to deliver the USPS into modern mobility has itself fallen behind schedule: Last December, the Washington Post reported that the service had only received 93 of the planned 3,000+ NGDVs. Until a visit to Oshkosh's offices here in mid-October, I'd only seen NGDVs in exhibits at CES and parked in front of the USPS' Washington headquarters.

Face to Face With the Duckface Truck

Whenever an NGDV does make its way to your neighborhood, you won't mistake it for any other vehicle. Its low hood runs into a steep cliff of a windscreen that then meets a slab-sided, rhombus-shaped body. This ungainly appearance has earned descriptions like ""duckface"" or ""duck truck."" Letter carriers on Reddit's r/USPS forum seem to prefer ""platypus.""

This NGDV looks that way for a reason: so USPS employees can stand up in the back as they sort mail and packages. E-commerce shipments from Amazon and other retailers now constitute a large chunk of the service's business and have its trucks rolling on Sundays.

""This is transforming the United States Postal Service because it allows them to participate fully in e-commerce delivery,"" Oshkosh President and CEO John Pfeifer said at a meeting with journalists during our visit.

Stepping into an early-build electric NGDV parked outside revealed an interior with six large shelves and plenty of room to step back and forth between them. The right-hand driver's seat up front, meanwhile, was positioned low enough to make it easy to lean out the enormous window to the side and reach into a mailbox placed next to it.

The NGDV doesn't look like any other EV, but the model I took for a brief drive around Oshkosh's parking lot drove a bit like one, affording some of the pleasing instant pickup that I've come to expect from EVs while also yielding a tight turning circle.

It charges its 94 kWh lithium-ion battery via a standard CCS port; on the test vehicle, it was next to the right headlight but on production vehicles is at the back-left corner. That pack has a 10-year design life, which Oshkosh CTO Jay Iyengar suggested would result in a substantial upgrade whenever the pack gets replaced: ""We do see battery technology and energy density improving very rapidly,"" he said.

Visibility through all those windows seemed great, with a backup camera to help with reversing (meaning, it helped me to avoid running into that mailbox). The touch-screen-free dashboard did not feature a radio but included Bluetooth audio for phone calls and a cupholder, another thing absent from LLVs.

Additional exterior-facing cameras and sensors help with collision avoidance. Pfeifer suggested they could also generate valuable civic insights once the NGDV is rolling down every street in America: ""It'll be able to pick up intelligence about city streets and parking conditions and all sorts of things.""

Still Plugging Away

Oshkosh has delivered ""thousands"" of NGDVs so far, and is now rapidly ramping up NGDV production at a Spartanburg, South Carolina, factory to reach 16,000 to 20,000 vehicles a year.

USPS spokeswoman Kim Frum said the agency has received more than 2,500, including 500-plus battery-electric versions, out of a total order for 51,500, with 35,000 electric.

Its initial 2022 contract covered 50,000 mostly gas NGDVs, with a $2.98 billion cost. The agency now plans to spend $9.6 billion on vehicle modernization, including $3 billion in IRA funding to cover EV editions of those and other trucks, but hasn't published a revised budget for NGDV procurement. Pfeifer attributed the slow start to the USPS pivoting to a mostly EV order in late 2022 plus ""a few normal ramp-up issues that slowed us down.""

Reports from the USPS Inspector General in October 2024 and August 2025 faulted the agency for ordering a custom design via a prolonged sourcing process instead of picking one partner—in contrast to Amazon's partnership with Rivian to build EV delivery vans—and also cited such subsequent issues as supply-chain and testing holdups.

The electric version also suffered from a belated buildout of charging stations marred by procurement and permitting complications, which have tripped up private companies, too.

In June, a new threat emerged: Republicans in Congress added a provision to the massive budget-reconciliation bill that would have auctioned off the entire USPS EV fleet—both electric NGDVs and thousands of Ford E-Transit vans—and even its charging infrastructure.

""The language they tried to put in was very damaging,"" Pfeifer said, calling it a surprise to many other Republican representatives who ""thought it was crazy.""

Soon after, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough ruled that provision out of bounds for a budget measure. That language vanished from the bill that Trump signed in July, but it did wipe out tax credits for buying EVs.

Putting Electrification to Work Where It Works Best

Pfeifer said Oshkosh's lobbyists made a case for letting the USPS proceed with EVs where they made business sense, and he stuck to that line during the visit.

""We're not doing electrification for the sake of electrification, we're doing electrification when it matters because there's an economic case for it or when customers demand it,"" he said.

Mail trucks represent an especially compelling case for electric power because of their driving pattern: ""stop-start-stop-start-stop-start,"" as Pfeifer put it, saying this truck can often run for two days on a charge. Iyengar's assessment of electrification for USPS delivery: ""No better application.""

EVs' efficiency in that service scenario also explains why electrification is good for other vehicles that make frequent stops, such as school buses and garbage trucks. Oshkosh's driving demo included one example of the latter, a battery-electric Volterra ZSL model from its McNeilus subsidiary that I also got to take for a spin around the parking lot.

It smoothly moved out, which is not something I would have expected from a vehicle that weighs 39,500 pounds empty. The lack of a roaring diesel engine made this the quietest garbage truck I have ever driven, but also the only garbage truck I have ever driven.

Oshkosh also makes fire trucks, and for those it's opting for plug-in hybrid propulsion, with diesel as a backup to electric for long service calls. A Volterra fire truck that I drove for a couple of laps around a training facility next to the airport in nearby Appleton booted up as an EV but could be switched to the diesel engine with a button in the cab.

That pumper and the sleek airport firefighting vehicle next to it offered one other advantage over diesel-powered trucks: Firefighters can back them into a garage under electric power for a pollution-free return, granting their colleagues cleaner air after a day that may not have allowed much of it.

Across his work at NSI and NTI, Matzkin-Bridger focuses on the intersection of clean energy and security, specifically exploring fuel cycle choices that enable secure nuclear energy scaling.

Fresh off two presidential summits in just over two months, the United States and South Korea are approaching a pivotal moment in their bilateral relationship: the chance to define the next generation of clean, responsible, and globally competitive energy. With many countries currently betting big on nuclear energy, those who move fastest from theoretical plans to working plants that are safe, secure, and cost efficient will come out on top. The most direct route to success is through focusing resources on proven, innovative technologies and resisting distractions that promise more than they deliver. One of the most consequential decisions countries will face is whether to take a costly detour into nuclear fuel reprocessing, a technology that has failed every promise it has made.

Often marketed as “recycling,” reprocessing theoretically turns nuclear waste into a resource, which sounds appealing. In practice, it’s a messy endeavor that creates new waste that is harder to manage and yields little to no actual recycling. The process involves chopping up radioactive spent nuclear fuel and attempting to extract reusable portions. But after all the expense and complexity that it entails, approximately 99 percent of the recovered material remains unused. Plus, instead of solving the waste problem, reprocessing multiplies it, producing additional highly radioactive waste streams that are harder and costlier to contain, and still require permanent disposal.

How has reprocessing and recycling worked in practice? Its record of failure is clear. France has reprocessed for decades, but billions of dollars later, they are only able to recycle about 1% of their ever-growing stockpile of reprocessed spent fuel. Meanwhile, the government is still working to site a permanent geologic repository needed for all of the highly radioactive waste they have produced along the way.

Japan’s reprocessing program has faced even greater challenges, with taxpayers paying tens of billions of dollars to construct a facility that has suffered 27 delays since breaking ground in 1993. More than 30 years later, it is still not operational. The United Kingdom also had an extended foray into reprocessing, but abandoned the program after decades of frustration and expense.

Reprocessing also introduces serious security risks because it produces a purified form of plutonium, a material that can be used to make nuclear weapons. Every variant of reprocessing, including so-called “pyroprocessing,” which has gained attention in both South Korea and the United States, produces weapons-usable materials. That’s why U.S. policy has discouraged the spread of reprocessing technology for decades. Reversing course now would not only waste money and slow nuclear energy scaling, but also undermine decades of global nonproliferation leadership.

Each attempt to revive reprocessing ends the same way: billions of dollars down the drain, technical failures abound, and security risks increase. At a time when the world needs clean energy fast, reprocessing would be no more than a costly distraction. It diverts capital, talent, and political attention from innovations that can strengthen supply chains, lower emissions, and create real jobs. The lessons from abroad could not be clearer: reprocessing is a dead end.

The future of nuclear energy lies in advanced reactors, modernized manufacturing, and efficient fuel supply chains that actually work. Fortunately, the United States and South Korea are already showing what smart, results-driven nuclear collaboration looks like. The recent strategic agreement signed between X-energy, Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power, Doosan, and Amazon is an excellent example of a partnership with expertise across the nuclear energy value chain that can deliver measurable progress in a matter of years, not decades. When stakeholders like this come together with high ambitions and practical plans, nuclear energy can scale responsibly, profitably, and fast.

Reprocessing belongs to a bygone era—not today’s nuclear energy resurgence. It has failed on cost, failed on security, and failed to deliver real benefits. The future belongs those who pick proven technologies that can be deployed now and rapidly scaled. By rejecting the reprocessing trap and doubling down on real nuclear innovation, Washington and Seoul can emerge as the leaders of this era of global nuclear energy expansion, delivering energy security, economic growth, and climate progress for decades to come.",https://www.nti.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_512223682-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 15:01:11.970414

Doris Matsui, Mike Quigley, and Paul Tonko and Vice Chairs Reps. Don Beyer, Suzanne Bonamici, Mike Levin, and Chellie Pingree, in a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin demanding EPA reverse course and maintain the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

“We write to inform you that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is violating clear congressional directives by proposing to end the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP),” the lawmakers wrote. “For more than a decade, this program has been the most important source of transparent and verifiable climate pollution data in the federal government, and the EPA has clear authority and obligation to continue maintaining it. Ending it would undermine lawful, evidence-based governance at precisely the moment when climate and energy challenges demand better information, not less.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), codified and established in a final rule by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in 2009, requires large industrial facilities, fuel and industrial-gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites to monitor and report their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually. In September 2025, the EPA proposed eliminating reporting obligations to the GHGRP, undermining transparency, accountability, and the data infrastructure that supports both climate policy and private-sector decision-making. If finalized, it would end mandatory emissions reporting for virtually all large industrial facilities after the 2024 reporting year and suspend or eliminate requirements for the remaining sectors until 2034.

Text of the letter can be found below. A copy of the letter can be found here.

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We write to inform you that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is violating clear congressional directives by proposing to end the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). For more than a decade, this program has been the most important source of transparent and verifiable climate pollution data in the federal government, and the EPA has clear authority and obligation to continue maintaining it. Ending it would undermine lawful, evidence-based governance at precisely the moment when climate and energy challenges demand better information, not less. The elimination of the GHGRP represents yet another example of the Trump Administration’s censorship of scientific data, while simultaneously threatening statutory obligations, jeopardizing taxpayers’ ability to claim certain energy tax credits, weakening American competitiveness in global markets, and depriving American businesses and investors of the credible data they rely on for decision-making. These short-sighted partisan decisions from the Trump Administration will have long-term implications for the economic prosperity and wellbeing of our businesses and the American people.

EPA has clear legal authority and an obligation to maintain the GHGRP. The Consolidated Appropriations Acts for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2009 directed and funded EPA to promulgate and implement a greenhouse gas reporting rule covering “all sectors of the economy.” EPA did so relying on its broad authority under section 114 of the Clean Air Act, and has maintained the GHGRP since that time. The Agency’s new and unsupported view of its legal authority runs afoul of Congress’s clear direction and EPA’s own longstanding practice.

EPA’s proposal reflects a broad pattern of scientific data censorship under the Trump Administration as climate data is restricted, hidden, or defunded across the federal government. These actions have included funding cuts to researchers and scientists at the National Climate Assessment,the shutdown of the website for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the elimination of Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Future Risk Index,the discontinuation of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database, the disabling of the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, and significant censoring of hundreds of government websites related to climate change, among others. Suppressing scientific data does not make climate pollution or the systemic risk of climate change go away, it only blinds American policymakers, researchers, and the public to emerging threats and leaves our communities and families more vulnerable and defenseless.

The GHGRP is the backbone of the emissions verification needed to administer certain energy tax credits to American taxpayers. The GHGRP is indispensable to taxpayers in the energy industry, which rely on GHGRP data to verify eligibility for various federal tax incentives that support American industry. Without the GHGRP, even the American Petroleum Institute claims that major energy companies would lose the data infrastructure necessary to demonstrate compliance and claim these incentives, which would harm both American industry and our nation’s climate goals.

The GHGRP provides essential data that gives American manufacturing a competitive edge in rapidly innovating international markets. Eliminating this program would erode confidence in U.S. scientific data, drive up the cost of capital, and weaken American competitiveness just as the European Union, the United Kingdom, and other major economies adopt Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanisms (CBAMs) that reward verified low-emission manufacturing. For example, U.S.-produced low-emission steel and aluminum provide a clear market advantage relative to the high carbon intensity of materials produced in China, India, South Africa, and elsewhere. Without verifiable, trusted data like that provided by the GHGRP, the U.S. industry risks losing that global competitive advantage.

This data is equally vital as a business tool to investors and other stakeholders in the private sector, and is not easily replicable. EPA’s own website highlights GHGRP’s value as a business tool for cost-saving and risk management, noting that “data can be an important tool for businesses and other innovators to find cost- and fuel-saving efficiencies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.”The Facility Level Information on GreenHouse gases Tool (FLIGHT) and other GHGRP datasets are widely used by companies, analysts, and investors to evaluate emissions performance and manage exposure to risks. Private companies also rely on the data to demonstrate the credibility of their emissions reduction strategies to investors and regulators. Ending federal reporting for greenhouse gases would shift the data-collection burden to the states or to less-equipped actors, fragmenting quality, raising costs, and eroding market trust.

Terminating the GHGRP would jeopardize key programs and reports that rely on this data to meet statutory obligations. In fact, EPA itself has long recognized the GHGRP’s importance to its own work, the work of other federal agencies, state and local programs, and to the private sector.

Given these concerns, we demand that EPA reverse course and maintain the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. To that end, we request that EPA outline how it will ensure continuity and quality of the data, tools, and public reporting functions that American businesses, investors, states, and federal agencies rely upon for compliance, planning, and risk management.

They emphasize that ignoring climate stress comes with mounting costs — something North Carolina communities are already experiencing after repeated hurricanes, inland flooding and accelerating coastal erosion.","A group of scientists has proposed a new way to detect climate threats long before they show up as flooded roads, heat-related illnesses or collapsing homes along the North Carolina coast.

The approach comes from researchers at the City University of New York’s Advanced Science Research Center, who published their findings this week in Cell Reports Sustainability. They describe a “Climate BioStress Sentinel System” that would track how climate change is stressing living things — from microbes to trees to people — and use those signals as early warnings of bigger problems ahead.

The concept is rooted in a simple idea: life reacts to climate pressure long before humans do. Plants change their chemistry during drought. Microbes shift as water warms. Animals behave differently during heat stress. Even hospital records can reveal early patterns of illness during extreme weather. The research argues that these biological “stress signatures” can act like canaries in the coal mine, offering clues about how climate change is unfolding across entire communities.

Charles Vörösmarty, the study’s lead author, said the goal is to give cities and states real-time tools to anticipate climate impacts rather than respond after they hit.

“Climate change is already affecting every level of life on Earth,” Vörösmarty said. “Those stress signals are measurable, and they can tell us where risks are building.”

Why it matters for North Carolina

North Carolina offers a clear example of the kinds of stress the system aims to track. Raleigh has endured record heat in recent summers, producing spikes in heat-related emergency visits. Eastern North Carolina is seeing more “sunny-day” flooding as sea levels rise. And on the Outer Banks, coastal erosion has pushed 27 homes into the ocean since 2020.

Under the proposed system, those impacts wouldn’t be tracked in isolation. Heat-stressed trees in Raleigh, algae blooms in the Neuse River, and shifting fish behavior along the coast would all be monitored alongside public-health data, weather trends and economic disruptions. Together, the signals would create a clearer picture of which communities are most vulnerable and how climate stress is spreading.

The study argues that cities are particularly sensitive because heat, air pollution, infrastructure gaps and social inequality compound one another. Raleigh’s rapid growth adds another layer, increasing demand on water, energy and emergency services.

How it could be used

The authors envision a system that blends environmental monitoring with public-health and social data. In an extreme heat event, for example, sensors could show which neighborhoods are warming fastest and whether local ecosystems are reacting. Hospitals could identify illness patterns, and mapping tools could show where resources are most needed.

Scientists say the technology already exists. What’s missing is coordination and investment. That gap reflects how most agencies still monitor climate impacts separately, which makes it harder to see how those stresses connect.

“Climate impacts don’t unfold one at a time,” Vörösmarty said. “They cascade.”

The researchers argue that detecting those cascades early could help cities direct cooling resources, prepare for flooding, manage water quality, and protect vulnerable residents.

The proposal is a framework, not a ready-made program. But the authors say the science is strong enough for cities to begin building pilot systems.

“It’s healthy, it’s beautiful, but it’s also necessary,” Grocoff said.","Veridian at County Farm places a strong emphasis on community connection and sustainability with front porches facing shared greenways with native landscaping.

Monthly energy bills for some homeowners have been a few cents or even negative.

Imagine opening your electric bill and finding only a few cents owed or nothing at all.

That’s everyday reality for some residents of Veridian at County Farm, a new Ann Arbor neighborhood that is reshaping what home energy use can look like.

Targeted to be one of the nation’s first solar-powered, net-zero and net-positive energy, fossil-fuel-free communities, Veridian is designed to produce its own power, eliminate the need for natural gas and reduce carbon emissions.

The project is a collaboration between Ann-Arbor based THRIVE Collaborative, and Avalon Housing, is being built on a 14-acre site that formerly housed the Washtenaw County Juvenile Detention Center.

“Sustainability shouldn’t be a style, it shouldn’t be a luxury item, it’s something that should fundability be a right for everybody to have,” says, Matt Grocoff, co-founder of THRIVE Collaborative.

Grocoff, who lives with his family in a 125-year-old Ann Arbor home certified as net-zero energy, said his household disconnected from natural gas over 15 years ago.

“My daughters have grown up in a home where they don’t know what a fossil fuel house is like,"" Grocoff said. ""Their car charges in the driveway. This is normal to them.”

When complete, Veridian at County Farms will include more than 110 residences, ranging from single-family homes and townhomes to studio units, and 11 short-term rentals in a restored farmhouse, according to Grocoff.

Each home will rely entirely on rooftop solar panels, geothermal wells and battery storage systems, meaning no natural gas lines connected to any buildings.

According to THRIVE Collaborative Sustainability Development Director Sara Hammerschmidt, about 40% of carbon emissions in the U.S. come from the building industry.

“Being intentional about the things going into these homes is something we are really paying attention to,” she said.

Patrick and Tammy Ferry were among Veridian’s first homeowners last year. The sustainability feature drew them in, and the energy bills keep them smiling.

Their most recent bill totaled just 20 cents. It was a little high, Patrick joked.

Every home includes solar arrays, energy recovery ventilators, heat pump water heaters, induction cooking, EV charging, Bosch electric appliances, Swedish triple-pane windows, and a compact Sonnen battery that stores excess solar power.

Steve Hathaway and his wife moved in last spring, and Steve described buying at Veridian as “getting a house with a cause,” noting that they appreciated both the sustainability mission and the appeal of new construction.

One month their electric bill was 47 cents. Another month it was negative 18 cents.

“Everybody is really social, and we’ve had a lot of fun,” Hathaway said, adding that the switch to fossil-fuel-free living has even changed their cooking habits. “Now I have to learn to grill on a pellet grill. I don’t want to let down the team.”

Home prices range from approximately $280,000 to $995,000, with detached single-family homes expected to start around $1.5 million.

The Michigan Public Service Commission has approved a pilot “virtual power plant” microgrid system for the neighborhood, allowing homes to share stored solar energy across the community, a model that could influence future development nationwide.

Veridian also places a strong emphasis on community connection. Front porches face shared greenways with native landscaping. Amenities, some completed, and others planned, include walking paths, rain gardens, a farm market, community gardens, edible landscaping, a bike-repair shed, shared e-bike and car-share options, outdoor gathering areas, and seasonal events at a restored 1840s barn.

Ultra-high-speed 10 Gbps internet is included in the homeowner’s association dues for market-rate buyers.

“We’ve gotten to know neighbors really well in ways we just haven’t experienced in other places,” Patrick Ferry said.

“The sustainability aspect is exciting, but even more than that, it feels like a small village within the city. It has this European vibe, built around a center courtyard. It’s a unique experience. One that we’re thoroughly enjoying.”

Using housing to address climate woes

Interest in net-zero housing is rising across the country. A 2022 report from the Energy and Environmental Building Alliance found a 190% increase in zero-energy home construction in the U.S. and Canada since 2020.

Supporters say neighborhoods like Veridian could play a role in reaching climate goals. Residential buildings account for more than a quarter of the nation’s fossil-fuel consumption, according to Grocoff. By electrifying home systems and generating power on site, Veridian aims to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions at the neighborhood level.

Buyers who purchase before December 2025 may qualify for a federal tax credit of up to 30% on solar, battery storage and geothermal systems.

“It’s healthy, it’s beautiful, but it’s also necessary,” Grocoff said. “We want to be an example, to where every neighborhood in the nation is run with all electric and powered with renewable energy.”

The Trump administration's comprehensive offshore leasing program establishes a fundamentally new approach to U.S. energy development, centered on competitive fiscal terms designed to maximise industry engagement while generating substantial federal revenues. This historic initiative reduces the federal royalty rate to 12.5% from the previous 18.75%, representing a 33% decrease in fiscal burden that positions American waters competitively against international offshore regions.

The program operates under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act framework, providing congressional-level certainty that extends through 2040. Furthermore, this legislative foundation differs significantly from previous discretionary leasing arrangements, offering operators the regulatory predictability essential for multi-billion dollar deepwater investments that typically require 7-10 years from lease acquisition to first production.

What Makes This Gulf of Mexico Auction Historically Significant?

The December 10, 2025 lease sale represents the largest Gulf of Mexico offering in nearly a decade, encompassing 80 million acres across 14,000 individual tracts spanning federal waters from 3 to 231 miles offshore. This unprecedented scale dwarfs recent offerings and establishes the foundation for a 30-auction program scheduled through 2040.

Critical Auction Parameters:

Total Coverage: 80 million acres across multiple water depths

Tract Availability: 14,000 individual parcels

Minimum Bid Requirement: $25 per acre

Geographic Range: Shallow waters to ultra-deepwater zones

Program Duration: 15-year timeline with predictable scheduling

The sale includes strategically located areas adjacent to major operational projects, including Shell's Whale development and Chevron's Anchor project in Alaminos Canyon and Green Canyon blocks. This proximity to existing infrastructure provides operators with immediate access to established pipeline networks and processing facilities, significantly reducing development costs and timeframes.

Historical context reveals that individual Gulf lease sales have generated revenues ranging from $100 million to $9.5 billion, depending on oil price environments and industry demand. The 2022 Gulf Lease Sale 257 generated approximately $312.7 million from 89 leased tracts, while the 2008 pre-Deepwater Horizon sale reached $3.1 billion during more favourable market conditions.

The American Petroleum Institute characterised the reduced royalty rate as a competitive step designed to revive investment in deepwater exploration that had been hindered by previous fiscal terms. In addition, industry participants recognise that the fixed leasing calendar addresses critical requirements for long-cycle projects requiring regulatory predictability over multi-decade investment horizons.

How Does the 12.5% Royalty Rate Compare Globally?

The Trump 12.5% gulf oil auction establishes highly competitive fiscal terms when analysed against international offshore jurisdictions. The statutory minimum rate provides operators with predictable baseline costs whilst maintaining federal revenue generation through complementary taxation mechanisms.

International Fiscal Comparison:

Offshore Region Primary Royalty Additional Taxes Combined Effective Rate U.S. Gulf of Mexico 12.5% Federal/state corporate tax 21-25% Norway North Sea 20-28% 78% petroleum tax 60-70% UK North Sea 10-40% (tiered) Ring fence corporation tax 50-65% Brazil Pre-salt 5-15% (tiered) Special participation fees 35-50% Australia Commonwealth 10-12.5% Petroleum resource rent tax 45-50% Canada Federal 5-12.5% Income and resource taxes 35-45%

The U.S. Gulf's combined fiscal burden of approximately 21-25% positions American waters competitively against mature North Sea basins whilst remaining higher than Brazil's pre-salt developments, which have attracted aggressive international bidding through lower initial fiscal take. This competitive positioning addresses key concerns from international E&P companies that had shifted capital allocation toward South American developments offering more favourable terms.

Norway's 60-70% combined effective rate reflects the country's mature fiscal regime designed to capture maximum resource rents from established high-productivity fields. However, the UK's tiered system ranges from 50-65% depending on field characteristics and production levels. Australia's petroleum resource rent tax adds significant fiscal burden to the base royalty rate, creating combined effective rates of 45-50%.

Recent prolific discoveries in Guyana (Liza, Payara, Yellowtail fields) have attracted major operator investment partly due to significantly lower royalty rates of 2% on shallow-water developments, demonstrating competitive pressure the U.S. Gulf faces from alternative geographies offering more favourable terms.

Which Major Operators Are Positioning for Maximum Impact?

Industry intelligence indicates that established Gulf producers have strategically expanded capital allocation in anticipation of the new leasing framework. Chevron, Shell, and BP have already increased Gulf capital budgets according to industry reports, positioning themselves to capitalise on expanded opportunities under the competitive fiscal structure.

Strategic Positioning by Operator Category:

Integrated Majors (ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, BP):

Access to multi-billion dollar project funding capabilities

May require infrastructure partnerships due to limited U.S. Gulf presence

Service Sector Expansion Opportunities:

Drilling Services: Increased demand for floating rigs and specialised equipment

Well Completion: Enhanced requirements for deepwater completion technologies

Subsea Engineering: Installation and maintenance of underwater infrastructure

Project Management: Consulting and technical services for complex developments

Current Gulf of Mexico production accounts for approximately 15% of total U.S. crude output, with deepwater projects representing some of the nation's most technically advanced and productive operations. Furthermore, the expanded leasing program aims to maintain and potentially increase this contribution over the coming decades.

Shell's Whale deepwater project serves as a modern benchmark for development in similar lease areas, demonstrating technical feasibility and operational excellence in Alaminos Canyon blocks. Chevron's Anchor project in Green Canyon provides another operational model for large-scale deepwater development, showcasing scalability and capital efficiency for future developments.

What Economic Impact Will This Generate for Federal and State Revenues?

The 30-auction program spanning 15 years creates substantial revenue generation potential for federal and state governments through the established Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) framework. Historical auction performance provides baseline projections for long-term revenue streams.

Revenue Distribution Structure:

Revenue Recipient Allocation Percentage Primary Use Federal Treasury Primary recipient General federal revenue Gulf Coast States 37.5% of revenues Coastal restoration, infrastructure Land and Water Conservation Fund Dedicated allocation Conservation and land acquisition Historic Preservation Fund Specified contribution Historic site preservation

Gulf Coast State Benefits

The four Gulf Coast states (Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama) receive direct financial support through the 37.5% GOMESA allocation, providing dedicated funding for:

Coastal Restoration Projects: Critical infrastructure protection against subsidence and sea-level change

Hurricane Preparedness: Disaster resilience infrastructure investment

Economic Development: Regional infrastructure and industrial support

Environmental Protection: Marine habitat conservation and restoration

Louisiana historically receives the largest share due to production proximity and extensive coastal zone management responsibilities. The state utilises GOMESA revenues for comprehensive coastal restoration projects addressing land loss and environmental degradation caused by historical resource extraction activities.

Revenue Mechanics and Timeline

Operators pay minimum bid amounts of $25 per acre plus annual rental fees during non-producing lease periods, which typically extend 5-10 years through exploration and development phases. Upon achieving production, operators transition to royalty-based payments at 12.5% of production value, creating long-term revenue streams extending decades beyond initial lease acquisition.

The fixed 30-auction schedule provides Treasury with predictable revenue streams over the 15-year horizon, enabling long-term federal budget planning and reducing revenue volatility caused by ad-hoc leasing decisions. This predictability supports both immediate fiscal planning and strategic infrastructure investment across federal and state levels.

How Will This Affect U.S. Oil Production and Energy Independence?

The expanded Gulf leasing program directly supports U.S. energy security objectives by maintaining and potentially expanding domestic offshore production capacity. Current Gulf operations contribute approximately 15% of total U.S. crude oil output, with deepwater projects representing the most technically advanced and productive domestic operations.

Strategic geographic positioning for export markets

Development Timeline Considerations

Deepwater projects typically require 7-10 years from lease acquisition to first production, suggesting meaningful production impact from the current program beginning 2032-2035 for early-awarded leases. The 2025-2040 program timeline aligns with industry development cycles, ensuring continuous lease availability throughout extended project lifecycles.

Strategic Energy Security Benefits:

Increased domestic production capacity provides strategic flexibility in international energy relationships and reduces import dependency. Recent agreements with China and South Korea for increased U.S. energy purchases demonstrate how domestic production capacity translates into international market advantages and enhanced energy diplomacy options.

The predictable leasing framework supports investment stability that extends beyond immediate development opportunities, enabling strategic positioning for future energy market developments. As global energy markets continue evolving, domestic production capacity provides supply chain resilience and price stability buffers.

What Are the Environmental and Regulatory Considerations?

The Trump 12.5% gulf oil auction operates within comprehensive environmental frameworks whilst streamlining approval processes for qualified operators. All lease areas undergo rigorous environmental analysis, with sensitive marine habitats and protected areas excluded from offerings.

Environmental Safeguard Implementation:

Protected Area Exclusions:

Sensitive marine habitats remain protected from development

Marine protected areas excluded from lease offerings

Critical species breeding grounds receive special protection

Coral reef systems and essential fish habitat protections maintained

Operational Environmental Requirements:

Advanced blowout prevention systems mandatory for all operations

Real-time environmental monitoring protocols required

Seasonal restrictions protect marine mammal migration patterns

Enhanced safety systems exceed historical operational standards

Technology and Safety Standards

Modern offshore technology significantly reduces environmental risks compared to historical operations through enhanced safety systems, reduced surface footprints, and advanced environmental monitoring capabilities. Current drilling systems incorporate multiple redundant safety mechanisms and real-time environmental compliance monitoring.

The regulatory framework balances resource development with environmental protection through science-based decision-making processes. Environmental impact assessments evaluate potential ecosystem effects whilst incorporating best available scientific information and stakeholder input.

Regulatory Streamlining Benefits:

The predictable leasing schedule reduces regulatory uncertainty whilst maintaining environmental compliance requirements. Operators benefit from consistent permitting timelines and clear regulatory expectations, supporting more efficient project planning and development cycles.

How Does This Integrate with Alaska's Cook Inlet Development?

The Gulf program operates alongside a renewed Alaska drilling policy shift featuring six Cook Inlet lease sales planned between 2026 and 2032. This dual-basin approach diversifies U.S. offshore production whilst supporting Alaska's energy economy and addressing Arctic resource development considerations.

Alaska Program Components:

First Sale: March 2026 launch

Total Sales: Six auctions through 2032

Fiscal Terms: 12.5% royalty rate matching Gulf structure

Strategic Importance: Arctic resource development and geopolitical positioning

The Alaska component addresses both domestic energy security and geopolitical considerations, particularly regarding Arctic resource competition with other nations. The consistent 12.5% royalty rate across both regions provides operators with fiscal certainty and enables resource allocation decisions based on geological and logistical factors rather than regulatory differences.

Regional Economic Integration

Alaska's offshore development supports state economic diversification whilst providing operators with additional resource base options. The Cook Inlet program represents a reversal from previous administration restrictions and reinforces Alaska's strategic role as both an energy hub and Arctic gateway.

The dual-region approach creates operational synergies for companies active in both basins, enabling technology transfer and operational expertise sharing between Gulf and Alaska operations. This geographic diversification reduces operator risk whilst maximising domestic resource development potential.

What Investment Opportunities Does This Create?

The announcement comes on the heels of an election cycle where soaring energy costs were a defining issue for voters, including in Georgia. In an upset last week, Democrats made history by flipping two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission. Customers of the largest utility provider in Georgia have seen their bills increase by $518 a year over the last two years. Trump and Republicans’ war on clean energy is only making the problem worse by taking cheaper, cleaner energy off the grid – and voters are holding them accountable for it at the polls.

Climate Power’s October Energy Crisis Snapshot report shows over 158,000 jobs have already been lost or stalled in the clean energy sector, and gas and electric utilities have raised or sought to increase bills by at least $89.9 billion since Trump took office. Meanwhile, soaring energy costs dominated the political conversation in Tuesday’s elections, offering Democrats a roadmap for the 2026 midterms.

Climate Power Communications Director Alex Glass issued the following statement:

“Donald Trump promised to cut electricity prices in half, but less than a year into his presidency, Americans are facing soaring utility bills and a constant drumbeat of factory closures. His reckless energy policies are putting local jobs on the line and hiking utility bills at the same time that Republicans in Congress are jacking up costs for working families by refusing to lower health care costs. Trump and Republicans are making the affordability crisis worse, and last week’s election results show that Americans have had enough.”

Trump’s reckless energy policies are leaving a trail of shuttered projects across the country:

A new report from Climate Power shows that Trump’s energy crisis has resulted in over 158,000 lost or stalled jobs in the clean energy sector, with nearly half from grants eliminated during the government shutdown. With rising energy demand driven by AI and extreme heat, gutting clean energy is already taking critical production offline and increasing costs for consumers.

In just two months, six clean energy projects were closed in Michigan, including most recently, two electric vehicle battery plants that laid off 324 workers.

Last month, General Motors laid off 1,200 workers at its electric vehicle plant in Detroit, along with hundreds of additional permanent and temporary layoffs at battery plants in Ohio and Tennessee.

Topsoe cited the repeal of clean energy tax credits as a reason for canceling 150 jobs and a $400 million investment in their Richmond, VA facility.

Earlier last month, Fox 2 Detroit reported that over 100 employees at Dana Incorporated, an EV battery component manufacturer in Auburn Hills, Michigan, had been laid off.

General Motors canceled a $55 million factory that would have created 300 jobs, citing “decisions of the DOE”.

Fortescue blamed U.S. “policy settings” and the elimination of “critical tax credits” in Trump and Republicans’ budget bill for the cancellation of their $210 million Detroit EV battery factory.

Trump is using the government shutdown as an opportunity to sow even more chaos and uncertainty for American workers by cancelling $8 billion in investments in states that did not vote for him. The Trump administration has put $24 billion for energy projects on the chopping block since May.

Trump’s federal energy policies contributed to battery startup, Natron Energy, shutting down and canceling its planned $1.4 billion factory in Eastern North Carolina, which would have created 1,000 jobs.

That’s roughly 14,500 or 28.5% more than at the beginning of 2025 (which saw almost 51,000 stalls).

The expansion of EV charging infrastructure is not slowing down, and progresses at an average rate of about 45 new stalls per day.

There are more stalls, more stations, and the stations themselves are becoming larger than ever. All this is combined with an ongoing increase in average power, improved reliability, and accessibility between various EVs and networks.

65,000+ Ports and 14,500* Locations

According to the Alternative Fuels Data Center (AFDC), as of November 10, 2025, there were 65,447 public DC fast-charging ports (aka stalls), including all connector standards. This number includes DC fast-charging ports that are temporarily unavailable (778 ports, or 1.2%).

The number of public DC fast-charging stalls in the US increased by over 5,000 since late July, and by roughly 14,500 since January 1, 2025. We are now heading toward 70,000, which should be achievable by the end of Q1 2026.

*An EV charging port provides power to charge only one vehicle at a time, even though it may have multiple connectors. The number of individual connectors might be similar to or higher than the number of ports.

The temporarily unavailable points are “out of service or offline due to maintenance and plan to open again in the future”.

The numbers may differ slightly depending on the exact date of access, so please treat them as a close estimate.

The number of stations (locations) is estimated at 14,448, including 377 (2.6%) that are temporarily unavailable. However, this raw number may be inflated and somewhat misleading. That’s because some chargers are counted as separate stations, even when they are located next to each other.

The number of stations increased by over 2,000 during the past 11 months. The data indicates that, on average, several new locations go online every day.

On average, a DC fast-charging station has 4.5 stalls (compared to 4.1 at the beginning of the year).

One of the most positive pieces of news is that the share of charging ports and charging stations marked as temporarily unavailable has decreased noticeably over the past 11 months.

Number of DC Charging Points by States

According to the AFDC, the top five states with the highest number of DC fast-charging ports are:

California (16,542)

Texas (4,426)

Florida (4,034)

New York (2,771)

Georgia (1,909)

Together, they represent over 45% of all chargers (over 29,682 ports) in the country. Alaska remains at the other end of the list with just 66 ports (up from 52 at the end of July 2026).

Top DC Charging Networks by Ports

The top five largest DC fast-charging networks, based on the number of charging ports, represent over 77% of the total number of available ports. The remaining 22% belong to other networks or are non-networked points.

The top five’s market share is decreasing (by several percentage points already this year), which indicates that other networks are installing chargers at a faster rate.

The Tesla Supercharging network remains the largest network with over 34,700 stalls and a 53.0% share (down from 57% at the beginning of 2025). More than two-thirds of all Tesla Superchargers in North America are open to non-Tesla EVs (mostly to Tesla’s NACS partners or to all compatible EVs through built-in NACS-to-CCS1 adapters, aka Magic Dock).

The next three networks — Electrify America, EVgo, and ChargePoint* — are relatively similar in size, with between 4,375 and 5,228 charging ports. Blink is fifth, but far behind with fewer than 1,900 charging stalls, and closely followed by EV Connect.

*An important note to remember is that ChargePoint does not own the charging points (aside from a small number) because they are actually owned by thousands of individual charger owners or companies.

The top DC fast-charging networks are as follows:

Tesla Superchargers: 34,717 ports (a 53.0% share)

Electrify America: 5,228 ports (an 8.0% share)

EVgo: 4,575 ports (a 7.0% share)

ChargePoint: 4,375 ports (a 6.7% share)

Blink: 1,875 ports (a 2.9% share)

Top 5 networks: 50,770 ports (a 77.6% share)

other: 14,677 ports (a 22.4% share)

The all-new Ionna charging network is expanding rapidly. As of today, it has some 40 sites and almost 400 stalls. Meanwhile, Walmart recently reached 10 sites.

As a side note, we must add that the Tesla Supercharging network has only NACS (SAE J3400) plugs, while the other networks use mostly CCS1, with the addition of some CHAdeMO and a small but growing number of NACS (SAE J3400).

Canada

Canada noted a similar rate of expansion. According to the AFDC, the number of public DC fast-charging ports increased to 7,846 (a rise of over 1,700, or 28%, compared to mid-December 2024). Roughly 1.1% ports (88) were considered temporarily unavailable.

The number of stations in Canada increased to 2,647 (by over 21% in less than a year). However, the number of stations might be noticeably inflated. Roughly 2.0% of the stations are temporarily unavailable.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/64637-Hyundai-NACS.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 15:02:09.457722

Ministers Dabrusin and Hodgson outline Budget 2025's new Climate Competitiveness Strategy

TORONTO, Nov. 9, 2025 /CNW/ - Global trade upheavals, rapid technological change, and the clean transition are reshaping the world economy. Canada's economic strategy must adapt--and fast. Budget 2025: Canada Strong is our plan to make our economy stronger, more self-sufficient, and resilient to global shocks. It will catalyse over $1 trillion in investment over the next five years, driving growth in nuclear, hydro, wind, energy storage, and grid infrastructure to make Canada a leader in the low-carbon economy.

Investing in a clean future is both a moral imperative and the greatest commercial opportunity of our time. As the world moves toward net zero, Canada's climate competitiveness will define Canada's leadership on the world stage. By 2035, the clean technology market will triple, and demand for clean electricity will double. To compete, Canada's investment must keep pace.

Today, the Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change, and the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, outlined the government's new Climate Competitiveness Strategy at the Pearl Street Energy Centre in Toronto. The strategy, which positions Canada to compete and win in this new global landscape, is anchored by three pillars:

Boosting investment through Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits to make it more affordable for Canadian industries to transition to clean energy, modernise electricity grids, expand renewables, increase energy storage, and strengthen power connections across provinces. Our plan will:

Implement the 15%Clean Electricity investment tax credit and remove the conditions imposed on provincial and territorial governments for their Crown corporations to be eligible.

Expand the list of critical minerals eligible for the 30% Clean Technology Manufacturing investment tax credit.

Supercharge affordable, net-zero energy projects with the following tax credits:

Clean Technology, expanding eligibility to include systems that produce electricity, heat, or both electricity and heat from waste biomass and changed the eligibility requirements for small nuclear energy.

Clean Hydrogen, introducing availability for hydrogen produced from methane pyrolysis under this tax credit.

Extend the full value of the Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage investment tax credit by five years through 2035.

Strengthening industrial carbon pricing to reduce emissions and provide long-term certainty for businesses and investors. Effective industrial carbon markets are integral to driving investment in clean growth and emissions reductions. We are committing to improving carbon markets across the country to provide the confidence and predictability that industry requires to invest and grow. Our plan will:

Engage with provinces and territories to develop a post-2030 carbon pricing trajectory. We will set an industrial carbon price trajectory that supports net-zero by 2050, giving businesses the confidence they need to make long-term investments in climate competitiveness.

Engage with provincial and territorial governments on improvements to the federal benchmark. This process will ensure pricing systems across the country are working effectively and enable the implementation of a strengthened benchmark. Additionally, we will explore opportunities to harmonise or link carbon credit markets.

Apply the federal backstop whenever a provincial or territorial system falls below a strengthened federal benchmark, to ensure a stringent price signal and level playing field across the country.

The Canada Growth Fund will continue to issue contracts for difference as a means of further improving future carbon price certainty for investors making large, long-duration capital investments.

Clarifying greenhouse gas regulations, including finalizing enhanced methane regulations for the oil and gas sector. By tightening these regulations, we will significantly reduce emissions across Canada, while providing clarity and predictability for industry. We will also finalise new methane regulations for landfills. Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases--80 times more harmful than carbon dioxide over a 20-year period--and one of the easiest to reduce.

In parallel, Canada's new government is investing in the critical minerals that will power the clean energy future. Budget 2025 commits over $2 billion in new investments over five years to accelerate production, create thousands of new-high-paying careers, and strengthen our position in this strategic global market. Through a new Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund, the First and Last Mile Fund, and expanded eligibility for the Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit, we will bring more Canadian critical minerals projects into production and unlock the next generation of clean technology supply chains, from electric vehicles to advanced manufacturing.

Combined, these measures form a bold new strategy to supercharge Canadian competitiveness in the global transformation to clean energy. By investing in our people, technologies, and natural resources, we can strengthen our economy today, build resilience for the future, and position Canada as a clean energy superpower in a net-zero world.

Quotes

""Canada must act with urgency, unity, and determination. At this critical moment, we have a choice: lead--and seize the opportunities of the energy transition--or get left behind. With the Climate Competitiveness Strategy, we are positioning climate action and economic growth as inseparable, aiming to build a stronger, more sustainable, and more competitive Canada for decades to come. This will help us take action in a way that prioritises affordability for Canadians and strengthens our economy.""

- The Honourable Julie Dabrusin, Minister of Environment and Climate Change

""Canada is securing our place as a global energy and resource superpower--and by doing it responsibly and sustainably, we are securing wins for Canadians and the planet. We know what a strong economy and clean environment require, and our Strategy provides it: clarity and predictability that drives innovation, attracts investment, and mobilises capital. We have a responsibility to protect Canada's environment and economy for generations to come, and that delivery starts now.""

- The Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources

Quick facts

The Strategy outlines clear rules that will cut emissions, drive innovation, and attract investment. Public and private capital will be mobilised toward a net-zero economy, establishing sustainable investment guidelines, a Sustainable Bonds Framework, improving climate disclosures in collaboration with provinces and territories, and amending anti-greenwashing provisions to improve investor certainty.

Our government's commitment to a low-carbon economy is reflected in the work of the Major Projects Office (MPO). One of the criteria for designation as a Project of National Interest is how a project will contribute to clean growth and to Canada's objectives with respect to climate change. This office will continue to evaluate projects for fast-tracking based in part on their contributions to clean growth and Canada's climate goals.

The first unit of the Darlington New Nuclear Project will provide reliable and affordable clean power to 300,000 homes, and position Canada as a global leader in the deployment of this technology worldwide.

Expected to be the first net-zero copper project in Canada, the McIlvenna Bay Foran Copper Mine Project will strengthen Canada's supply of critical minerals, creating hundreds of new careers across local economies.

The Red Chris Mine expansion will increase Canada's annual copper production by over 15% and reduce the mine's greenhouse gas emissions by over 70% when operational.

Wind West could be Canada's first offshore wind development and will set the scale, direction and trajectory for future growth. Unlocking 5,000 MW in the first phase could produce 24 TWh of clean energy every year and drive billions in new investment and economic activity across Canada, led by the private sector. This Eastern Energy Partnership could include important projects like interties between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, transmission cables between Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick as well as Quebec's and Newfoundland and Labrador's further development of Churchill Falls and Gull Island.

Alto High-Speed Railway, spanning approximately 1,000 km from Toronto to Quebec City and reaching speeds of up to 300km/hour to cut travel times in half and connect close to half of Canada's population. This project targets 25 million tonnes of CO2 emissions savings, the creation of 51,000 new jobs and 63,000 new housing units along its route.

This approach also extends beyond those industries. In homebuilding, factory-built homes will give more Canadians an affordable place to live while cutting emissions by over 20% compared with traditional construction methods.

Carbon pricing systems are a major component of Canada's clean investment landscape. Seventy major decarbonization projects across the country, collectively worth over $57 billion, are supported by industrial carbon markets. Around $4.3 billion in annual clean energy investment is linked directly to the existence of carbon pricing for large industrial emitters.

Budget 2025 commits to implementing the 15 % Clean Electricity investment tax credit, which will be available once legislation is passed and guidance finalized. This can cover 15 % of capital costs of eligible investment in equipment related to low-emitting electricity generation, electricity storage and interjurisdictional transmission projects.

In 2024, global investments in clean energy reached over $2.8 trillion--nearly double the level of investment in fossil fuels--and the global clean technology market is expected to triple by 2035.

The government will provide transparent updates on progress and introduce new metrics to measure how businesses and households are cutting emissions, how the clean economy is expanding, and how Canadian exports are tracking to achieve world-leading emissions intensity.

Climate change is a growing threat to Canada and the world. We are already seeing the risks and costs of climate change through extreme weather events like wildfires, drought, floods, and more severe storms. Over the last decade, the average yearly cost of weather-related disasters and catastrophic losses has risen to the equivalent of 5 to 6% of Canada's annual GDP growth. The Insurance Bureau of Canada says that extreme weather events caused $9.2 billion in insured losses in 2024.

According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries (LDWF), public oyster seed grounds in St. Bernard and Terrebonne parishes were opened on November 3, throwing open the doors for fishermen to harvest marketable oysters under a strict permit and reporting system.

The opening was followed closely by a joint patrol blitz on November 3 and 4, orchestrated by the LDWF along with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The patrols served a dual purpose; on one hand, LDWF agents boarded vessels to ensure fishermen adhered to local fishing regulations, and on the other, federal officers checked for compliance with immigration laws amongst the crew.

Violations were not sparingly found; LDWF agents handed out a handful of citations—three for lacking the requisite seed ground gear permits, and two for failures in submitting harvest data, according to the official report. The outcome of these violations could hit the fishermen with fines climbing up to $350 per offense. Moreover, their catches — totaling 27 sacks of oysters — were seized and returned to their watery beds in the oyster seed ground, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.

Immigration compliance also proved to be a stumbling block for some crew members. A report from the joint operation detailed that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents and USCG officers detained 10 individuals on the first day of the patrol for purported breaches of immigration laws. The specifics of these infractions were not elaborated upon publicly, but the enforcement flag is clear, both in the water and aboard the harvesting vessels; regulation compliance is to be strictly maintained.

This collaborative effort underscores the complex balance regulators aim to maintain between supporting local industries and preserving natural resources. While there is a clear economic driver for communities relying on fishing as a means of livelihood, the coordinated enforcement operation signals the high stakes involved in managing and sustaining the regional oyster population. With officers from different agencies converging on the oyster seed grounds, it's evident that the scrutiny over this sector will remain as rigorous as the waters are deep.",https://img.hoodline.com/2025/11/louisiana-fishermen-facing-state-and-federal-scrutiny-over-oyster-harvesting-compliance-1.webp,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:23.502310

Imagine if the federal government enacted legislation that would lead to generations of prosperity for Americans without resorting to budget-busting federal handouts or subsidies.

Imagine if the law guaranteed the most affordable heating and cooling bills for households and businesses for decades to come.

Imagine if such legislation ensured U.S. energy independence and security, forever ending the threat of foreign countries cutting off our supply of oil or gas – and even making other countries dependent on American energy.

As the United States approaches its 250th birthday, could there be any better gift than such guarantees, securities and freedoms?

We don’t have to imagine such a tremendous birthday present. A bill has been introduced in Congress which would accomplish all those objectives and more.

U.S. Rep. Troy Balderson (R-OH), has introduced the Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act (ARC-ES), designed to codify into law several commonsense directives that the nation’s leaders should have been following for decades.

As described by a press release announcing the bill’s introduction, the legislation “would require relevant federal agencies—such as the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency—to review any actions relating to affordable, reliable, or clean energy within 90 days and submit a report to Congress. The bill guarantees that our most affordable and reliable energy sources, including nuclear and natural gas, remain part of the energy mix – a crucial requirement to guarantee affordable and reliable energy for American households and businesses.”

As Balderson put it, “We saw under the Biden Administration how unelected bureaucrats were able to derail American energy policy by effectively shutting down our baseload, reliable energy productions. This bill restores regulatory sanity. There could be no better gift to all Americans as we approach our 250th birthday than the promise of affordable, reliable and secure energy, for today and for generations to come.”

The ball started rolling in the last couple of years in states like Louisiana and Ohio, with others on the verge of following suit. State after state has begun to break away from the stranglehold of politically motivated energy initiatives based on the fallacy of “alternatives” – a dangerous movement that was putting Americans on the fast track to a bleak energy future featuring unreliable electric grids, reliance on foreign countries to rescue us from blackouts, and skyrocketing energy bills.

As states begin to realize that affordable and reliable energy is crucial to our prosperity and security, they began to act. But always hanging over their heads during the Biden administration (and even before that) was the threat of penalties and loss of subsidies for not setting target dates to phase out oil and gas in favor of a complete reliance on “renewables” like wind and solar.

While so-called “renewables” can be an important part of the energy landscape, they have so far proven to be unreliable, failing test after test when they are artificially employed as the dominant energy provider. The widespread blackouts earlier this year in Spain, Portugal and parts of France were testaments to the still untested properties of “alternatives,” and it’s no surprise that those countries had to turn to natural gas to restore power.

Someday in the future, when their efficacy is more perfected, “renewables” might be in a position to carry more of the energy load. But forcing our most reliable and affordable energy sources to the sidelines before emerging technology is complete is illogical, impractical and unaffordable. The consequences would be disastrous.

While President Trump and his administration are doing all they can to roll back the disastrous Biden energy policies, enduring changes must come from Congress. That’s why the ARC-ES bill introduced by Balderson is not just important – it’s historic.

For the first time, states will know with confidence that their efforts to codify safe, reliable and affordable energy for their citizens will be supported by federal legislation, policies and agencies. Definitions of what constitutes “clean energy” will be aligned locally and nationally. State-based energy projects seeking federal loans or grants will be consistent with federal guidelines.

Crucially, the Balderson bill, as detailed in the press release, “formally defines three key energy terms for energy regulators: affordable, reliable, and clean. Currently, these terms can be left open to interpretation by the executive branch and can shift from one administration to the next. While President Trump has worked to roll back the previous administration’s Green New Deal agenda, this legislation would make those reversals legally binding.”

Thanks to this legislation, science and evidence will replace leftwing political correctness and radical climate change ideology as the guiding principles of U.S. energy policy. When passed by Congress and signed by President Trump, the law will be regarded as among the most significant pieces of legislation ever enacted. It would represent the greatest gift to the U.S. from the president and Congress that Americans could hope for on the occasion of our nation’s 250th birthday.

Americans from coast to coast should contact their elected officials in Congress and urge them to support the ARC-ES act. It’s a fitting birthday present for our entire nation, and a lasting legacy for our children, grandchildren, and generations to come.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/70/701912_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:06.719686

Barely a week goes by without Donald Trump announcing a new public investment or industry-specific subsidy. Late last month, the Trump administration committed to investing $80 billion in nuclear power. A day earlier, the United States and Japan agreed to a robust set of investments in critical mineral production, an extension of the pattern of direct investments the U.S. government has already made. Meanwhile, the government is now the largest stockholder in Intel and worked with Nvidia to suspend export controls on certain high-powered chips to China.

Some observers have described these actions as a new “economic nationalism,” citing the administration’s prioritization of domestic economic interests over international economic integration. But that term fails to explain what makes this administration’s decision-making unique. Economic nationalism suggests a focus on industries that disproportionately benefit American workers, but the administration talks of the importance of semiconductors, critical minerals, and shipbuilding in the same breath as its support of AI companies, pharmaceutical production, banking and finance, and soybeans. There is little evidence for a particular focus on restoring blue-collar manufacturing jobs, which many might expect from an economic nationalist agenda.

Other writers call it “state capitalism.” But that projects too much coherence onto what so far has been an idiosyncratic collection of half-step policies. State capitalism entails public direction of market activity, either directly through state ownership of firms, or more indirectly through allocation of investment, credit, and subsidies. While the Trump administration’s actions constitute a level of state involvement in markets unusual in American history outside of wars and other crises, there is little evidence that these actions are coordinated across sectors in a systemic fashion.

Or could this be marketcrafting, the term I often use to think about a broad history of state action shaping markets toward the public interest? It isn’t—yet. Marketcrafting requires a particular economic goal, and a coordinated effort to use the tools of public policy to shape the market toward the public interest. Trump’s economic agenda looks to enhance presidential power in pursuit of an independent, even self-sufficient, economy. Just as Trump imagines himself to be superior to other businessmen, he now proclaims that America should dominate other nations through its economic leadership. Relying on other countries is no longer an option, whether they be distant foes such as China or friendly neighbors such as Canada. This search for independence and dominance extends to domestic institutions. No more should Americans need to rely on the expertise of administrative institutions, like the Federal Reserve or the Federal Trade Commission, to deliver economic policy that improves American lives. Only the president, in his unique capacity as the consummate outsider who is now head of state, can make America economically self-reliant and independent.

Trump’s economic policy is best understood as rule by deal. He makes ad hoc agreements with domestic companies, and deals with foreign nations that benefit particular businesses the president favors. Each deal is individually negotiated, unpredictable, and contingent on executive favor.

Lacking clear policy goals and without a coordinating institution to enforce the terms of the agreements, many of these commitments may end up being as thin as the paper the press release announcing them was printed on. Similar deals in the first Trump administration ended in failure, including the promise of 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin created by Foxconn that never materialized, and the eventual bankruptcy of Lordstown Motors in Ohio despite the promise of new investment and jobs.

Some of these deals may eventually add up to a marketcraft, if the administration builds an apparatus to manage the investments. Yet having bulldozed the bureaucracy, the administration has destroyed the institutional capacity required to convert dealmaking into durable policy, making it likely that rule by deal will produce little more than a trail of abandoned commitments and squandered opportunities.

TRUMP HAS ALWAYS SOLD AN IMAGE OF HIMSELF as a master negotiator. During his most recent presidential campaign, he promised farmers in Iowa that he would make a “great deal with China” and bankers in New York that he would use his dealmaking skills to force corporate leaders to onshore manufacturing. Once re-elected, he recruited fellow dealmakers from finance, particularly Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the former investment banker and head of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who had 40 years in global investment management. Neither had served in government before, but they had spent decades doing deals.

Foundational to the administration’s dealmaking is the need to create leverage where it might not already exist. In his second term, Trump has used tariffs to bring companies and foreign governments to the negotiating table. In the first Trump administration, and in the Biden years, tariffs were primarily used tactically to craft particular markets, like supporting American automobile production. Trump and Biden both employed them as a means to build negotiating leverage with foreign adversaries, particularly with China, and to signal to voters their seriousness about supporting domestic manufacturing.

But Trump’s vision of the relationship between government and private industry transformed in the COVID crisis. In Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration led a public-private collaboration to develop and distribute lifesaving vaccines, illustrating how policymakers might work with private companies to further political goals. In the absence of a problem as urgent as the pandemic, national self-sufficiency has emerged as the rhetorical goal. Instead of a public-health emergency to compel corporate action, the threat of new taxes on imports has forced business leaders to negotiate with the White House.

The “Liberation Day” tariffs implemented in April are the most sweeping since the 1930s. Trump has used questionable legal authority to claim the ability to set and adjust taxes on imports on any nation, at any time, on almost all imported products, from avocados to diamonds. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that the current U.S. average effective tariff rate across all goods is at 18 percent, the highest level in a century. Every country in the world is subject to a base tariff of 10 percent, and additional tariffs are negotiated individually on a country and market basis. The relative level of a tariff has little to do with the balance of trade specific to a country, but rather depends on the administration’s opinion of the foreign leader and how effective business leaders in a particular sector have been in securing lenient terms.

Trump variously justifies the need for tariffs as a means to reshore domestic manufacturing, strengthen national security, or raise revenue. Yet the primary utility of today’s tariffs is the leverage they build over other countries and domestic companies. With the threat of significant damage to their businesses and economies, many American companies and foreign countries feel they have no choice but to seek a deal with the White House to improve their financial position. Relief is routinely conditioned on explicit domestic‑investment pledges—from individual firms and allied governments alike—in the form of new capital expenditures and hiring commitments inside the United States.

Take Pfizer. In May 2025, Trump issued an executive order instructing American pharmaceutical manufacturers to lower prescription drug prices. The president threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on any branded pharmaceutical product entering the United States, exempting only companies that had begun building manufacturing plants in the U.S. Over the summer, the CEO of Pfizer personally negotiated with the president to sell drugs to Medicaid at the low prices it sold to other nations, reducing the price Medicaid pays for these drugs by an average of 50 percent. Pfizer also agreed to participate in a new “TrumpRx” website for direct-to-consumer sales and invest $70 billion in U.S. manufacturing and research. (TrumpRx doesn’t itself sell drugs; it will point patients to company sites where drugs can be purchased at set cash prices.) In exchange, Pfizer received a three-year exemption from pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, as long as the firm further invests in domestic manufacturing. The administration has paused the 100 percent tariff on pharmaceuticals while other companies proceed to negotiate similar deals, including a recent one with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk.

This case is not isolated. General Motors announced a $4 billion plan to move production of several models from Mexico back to the United States. The move reduced exposure to tariffs on Mexican-made vehicles and curried favor with the administration. The corporate leaders of Illycaffè, TSMC, and Samsung, among others, have made similar announcements of additional domestic investment.

Tariffs are a major source of leverage, but they are not the only one. Since 2022, U.S. regulators have restricted what semiconductor chips Nvidia, designer of the chips that power the revolution in artificial intelligence, could sell to China. Nvidia developed a specific chip, just powerful enough to meet Chinese demand, which would also comply with American export restrictions. After months of negotiation, including a $1 million gift to Trump to attend a Mar-a-Lago dinner, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang asked the White House for export restrictions to be eased so Nvidia could sell its specialized chips to China. “If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us as a country something, because I’m giving you a release,” Trump claims he replied. Trump agreed to suspend bans on the export of semiconductors critical to national security in exchange for a kickback payment to the government. Trump initially asked for 20 percent of sales revenue, but Huang negotiated him down to 15 percent. They announced the deal in August. No American company had ever agreed to pay a portion of revenues to obtain export licenses. Bessent called it a “beta test” and said the administration could “see it in other industries over time.”

In other deals, the administration has used government equity investments as a policy instrument. American government has frequently made investments in private companies, sometimes with great success. Policymakers often invest across an industry, like banking in the 1930s, semiconductors in the 1980s, or automotive manufacture in 2009. Rather than supporting a particular market broadly, Trump and his team have singled out specific companies to receive policy advantages. In June 2025, as a condition of Nippon Steel’s approval of the acquisition of U.S. Steel, the government secured a “golden share,” a noneconomic equity stake that gives the president veto power over major corporate decisions including plant closures, salary reductions, and relocation of headquarters. The government has already exercised this authority once, blocking U.S. Steel from shutting down a plant in Illinois. In July, the Department of Defense paid $400 million for a 15 percent equity stake in MP Materials, owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the U.S. The Pentagon agreed to support a price floor for certain minerals and committed to buy all of the magnets MP produced at a new facility for a decade. Other ad hoc equity investments in mining companies have followed, including in Canadian companies Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas. The criteria for these deals are unclear, as are the benchmarks for success.

Also in July, the Trump administration announced commitments for nearly $1 trillion of American investments from the Japanese and South Koreans as part of trade deals. The funds will be invested in specific companies that the Trump administration selects, and all money must be spent by the end of Trump’s first term. In August, the government took a 10 percent equity stake in chipmaker Intel. Rather than converting all grants from the CHIPS Act into equity investments, Trump decided to prioritize Intel because of the “personal” appeal of its CEO.

Rule by deal picks winners and losers—the exact fear that so many free-market voices wielded incorrectly at the Biden administration. In all of these deals, there is no industry-wide analysis, credit facility available to all companies in a sector, or equitable offering of investment capital. It’s also not clear what legal authority they are relying on to make direct investments. This selective approach risks trapping the government in a cycle of doubling down, investing more public money to prop up struggling, politically favored companies rather than letting them fail. Promising firms in the same sector may lose access to private funding, as investors gravitate toward firms with governmental support.

WHILE RULE BY DEAL MAY BE CHAOTIC, it is effective in consolidating political power in the office of the presidency. In no domain is this more apparent than in the response of corporate leaders in the second Trump administration. The transformation from Trump’s first term is dramatic. In August 2017, after a white supremacist ran a car through a crowd in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing a 32-year-old woman, Trump declared that there were “very fine people on both sides.” Immediately, the CEOs of Merck, Intel, and Under Armour resigned from Trump’s manufacturing council. Dozens of other CEOs followed—including Disney’s Bob Iger and Tesla’s Elon Musk—in what became a mass exodus from White House advisory positions; Gary Cohn, the chair of the National Economic Council, left as well. In the wake of the January 6th, 2021, insurrection attempt, the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers quickly condemned the administration, a rare moment of elite business leaders breaking from conservatives.

This time was different. In August 2025, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Trump with a glass plaque mounted on a 24-karat gold base at the White House. The gift was in recognition of Apple’s announcement of a $100 billion U.S. investment commitment, bringing its total to $600 billion over four years. The company received an exemption from steep semiconductor tariffs in return. When Intel’s stock fell after Trump demanded CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s resignation in August over alleged China ties, Tan traveled to the White House. Trump offered to convert the CHIPS program’s grant dollars into a 10 percent government equity stake. Tan accepted, and shares rebounded.

Dozens of other corporate leaders have stayed quiet in the wake of unprecedented moves. Trump has weaponized the National Guard, the Department of Justice, and the IRS to pursue his political enemies, and corporate leaders have stayed silent. He has sought to coerce universities into compliance with his party’s ideology. Independent agencies, from the Federal Trade Commission to the Federal Reserve, are no longer insulated from the president. Immigrants are abducted and rushed into vans to be deported to developing-world countries beyond the rule of American law. For corporate leaders, protecting their businesses requires avoiding criticism of these actions. Rule by deal is an effective political strategy to neutralize what were once among the most powerful and independent voices in civil society.

Some go further, choosing to openly participate in the enrichment of the president, his family and friends, and other officials. In January, Trump made over $1 billion after issuing his own “meme coin,” a crypto asset with no underlying value outside of collective support in the president himself. Weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that meme coins are not securities, exempting them from oversight. The next month, Trump hosted a dinner at one of his golf clubs for the top investors in his coin. Collectively, attendees reportedly spent $150 million to gain access. Meanwhile, the president’s sons “advise” many private companies, enhancing their direct access to the president; a drone company that Donald Trump Jr. holds a $4 million stake in recently won a Pentagon contract. Business leaders can pay anywhere between $1 million and $5 million for access to dinner at Mar-a-Lago and a chance to meet the president. While Trump’s presidential envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff conducted delicate cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, his son solicited billions of dollars from the same governments involved in the peace talks. Lutnick says he has no conflicts of interest, since he no longer runs Cantor Fitzgerald—easily eliding the fact that the firm is now run by his son Brandon. Faced with a disappointing job report, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett countered: “Members of my family have been hired. Both of them started their new jobs about a week ago.”

AD HOC DEALMAKING MAY BE USEFUL for its effect on corporations, but the limits of such an approach may be showing on one of the most important markets to support in the short term: critical minerals. China dominates the production of many of the key inputs to phones, Air Force bombers, and even electricity transformers, giving it a choke point over the United States. Given their importance to American life, there are early signs of an attempt to pursue a critical minerals marketcrafting agenda. The Trump administration has made a series of public investments, procurement guarantees, and long-term loans to companies. For the moment, these deals have no institutional structure coordinating the investments, no structure of accountability to ensure the companies meet performance benchmarks, and no explicit congressional authorization to give investors long-term confidence in the strategy.

The administration could turn into a constructive marketcraft. It might work with Congress to charge a governmental institution with the mission of accelerating the production of important critical minerals in the United States or close allies. One option might be to use the “investment accelerator” at the Commerce Department that is coordinating the $900 billion investment from the Japanese and South Koreans. Or Congress could charter a new institution. Early interest in the creation of a sovereign wealth fund or national investment bank has morphed into a proposal to expand the Development Finance Corporation (DFC), a state bank created in the first Trump term charged with making foreign investments to further American foreign policy. Current legislative proposals imagine expanding the mandate to include investments in America and quadrupling its size.

The institution could run an open and transparent process to fund promising companies and cutting-edge research on extraction technologies. Investments could be made with clear benchmarks to ensure adequate progress. Given the urgency of the issue, government could also work to bring together competing companies to share premarket research, just as they did during World War II to produce synthetic rubber, or with semiconductors in the 1980s. Large buyers, like the Department of Defense, could commit to long-term supply contracts to ensure steady demand. The government could also partner with private-sector actors to set up new exchanges that facilitate the trading of futures contracts around these minerals, just as China did over a decade ago. Private investors have already rushed to support the ad hoc deals the government has made in the critical minerals sector. Institutionalizing rule by deal would attract even more capital.

This kind of institutional marketcraft is similar to what Marco Rubio, now secretary of state, and JD Vance, now vice president, championed in the years leading up to Trump’s second inauguration. Rubio and Vance made personal decisions to advance their own political ambitions rather than prioritize the use of institutions to shape markets. In an age of anger at the work of the administrative state, they deprecated their marketcrafting impulses to support Trump’s rule by deal. That will need to shift, if China moves forward on its threats to weaponize its mineral production and the issue rises in critical importance.

Policy-minded people are stuck in an impossible bind: How to advocate for good ideas to improve economic prosperity and resiliency in the short term if they serve to strengthen an autocrat-in-waiting? It feels wrong, or even unethical, to make the case for a more successful economic policy for this administration. Given the attack on the rule of law and the administrative state—key requirements for any marketcraft, let alone democracy, to function—it is unlikely that any kind of robust, effective marketcraft will emerge in the coming years. Perhaps that is for the best. The most potent check on consolidated presidential power may be the president’s own unpopularity, and nothing breeds unpopularity faster than economic mismanagement.

While Trump uses the presidency to force corporations to strengthen his power, Democrats search for policies that will shape markets to bring down the cost of living and boost wages for American families. The lonely voices who claim that unconstrained markets naturally create prosperity now have no political home. Today’s battle is about whether a marketcraft in the public interest can win out over an authoritarian impulse to bully corporations into strengthening presidential power. For marketcrafters, the task ahead will be practical: rebuild rule‑bound institutions with clear missions, persuade experts to return to the administrative state, and restore the practice of pursuing industry-wide programs so that policy does not devolve into picking winners and losers.

Xcel Energy’s sprawling Sherco Energy Hub will be among the United States’ biggest solar farms when the last of its three approved phases powers up next year. Soon after, the central Minnesota site could also host one of the Midwest’s biggest battery clusters.

In a Halloween filing, Xcel asked the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission for permission to double its planned battery capacity at Sherco while adding a 200-megawatt fourth phase of solar there and deploying about 136 MW of batteries at a separate site southwest of Minneapolis.

The push to build even more clean energy was spurred by rising electricity demand and the looming phaseout of federal clean-energy tax credits under the Trump administration, which has worked to hamstring renewables while attempting to boost coal and gas generation.

If the commission approves Xcel’s proposal, Sherco would host 910 MW of solar and 600 MW of battery capacity by the end of the decade. At peak production, that would go a long way toward offsetting the output of what Xcel representatives have called the ​“backbone” of the company’s Upper Midwest generation fleet: the roughly 2,300-MW Sherco coal plant, which shut down its first unit in late 2023 and is set to fully retire in 2030.

George Damian, director of government affairs for Clean Energy Economy MN, said the proposal underscores the growing importance of batteries as the grid shifts away from fossil fuels.

“As demand continues to rise, technologies like battery storage are becoming essential to maintaining reliability while integrating more carbon-free generation,” Damian said.

Xcel regional president Bria Shea agreed, saying in a statement that “[w]e’re making a significant investment in battery storage because we see it as a critical part of Minnesota’s energy future.”

The separate 136-MW Blue Lake project would replace retired fossil-fuel capacity, too, boosting output at what’s now a 332-MW gas peaker plant. Xcel retired Blue Lake’s aging oil-fired units earlier this year, leaving two newer gas units operating and freeing up more than 200 MW of grid interconnection capacity.

Minnesota requires its utilities to procure 100% clean power by 2040 and aims to decarbonize its entire economy by 2050, with ambitious targets for building and transport electrification. Meanwhile, developers have proposed at least a dozen large-scale data center projects around the state, including several in Xcel territory. In December, Xcel executive Ryan Long — then serving in Shea’s role — said the company could absorb 1.3 GW of data center capacity by 2032 without derailing its carbon-free power plan, though he added it may need to extend the life of some gas plants to accommodate the load increase.

In the filing, Xcel said it wants to move quickly to expand its generation capacity while there’s still time to qualify for federal clean-energy tax incentives of 30% or more.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act will sunset those incentives several years early, forcing most wind and solar projects to begin construction before July 4, 2026, to qualify for the full value. Energy storage projects qualify for the full credit value through 2033, but Xcel said uncertainty around new foreign-sourcing restrictions taking effect next year increases the urgency to deploy storage soon too.

Xcel says it expects to break ground on the Sherco and Blue Lake battery installations next year and power them up in 2027. It aims to commission the Sherco solar project by 2029.

Rather than contract with independent solar and battery installations in its territory, Xcel wants to build and own all three projects itself. In the filing, it said rules set by Minnesota’s grid operator require company ownership of new energy facilities reusing interconnection rights at retiring power plants. The same filing asks the commission to approve agreements to purchase power from several third-party solar and battery projects that will connect to the grid elsewhere.

John Farrell, the Minneapolis-based codirector of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance and a frequent critic of the monopoly-utility model, said the looming tax-credit cliff creates an unusual circumstance where the need to quickly develop more clean energy cuts against his preference for an open and competitive bidding process that could result in a better deal for electricity customers.

“I am more sympathetic than I would be normally because we are stuck in the regime we’ve got and there’s a lot of money on the table,” he said, referring to the tax credits whose rollback is expected to raise Minnesotans’ electricity bills in the coming years.

To incentivize faster clean-energy deployment ahead of the cliff created by Trump’s megalaw, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in August said it would allow projects that meet the deadline for federal tax incentives to also access extended eligibility for state renewable energy credits.

Xcel spokesperson Theo Keith said the utility has ​“already taken steps to ensure this portfolio of projects will qualify for federal tax credits before they expire.”

But with the North American Electric Reliability Corp. forecasting a ​“high risk” of capacity shortfalls on the Upper Midwest grid by 2028, there’s a chance that the U.S. Department of Energy issues an emergency order requiring one of the Sherco plant’s two remaining coal units to run past its planned retirement next year, said Allen Gleckner, chief policy officer for Minnesota-based Fresh Energy.

Related: States look to unleash wind and solar boom while tax credits still exist

The DOE has already done so for one retiring coal station in the Midwest, Michigan’s 1,420-MW J.H. Campbell plant. Its operator, Consumers Energy, says that order, which runs at least through Nov. 19 and which the DOE says it could extend for much longer, has already cost consumers at least $80 million. It’s unclear whether a similar order at Sherco would affect Xcel’s battery plans, but it would be disruptive to the utility either way, Gleckner said.

“The uncertainty that scenario contemplates is another reason why it would be a terrible idea,” Gleckner said.

Asked if Xcel had reason to expect a DOE emergency order at Sherco and whether that could interfere with its proposed clean-energy deployments there, Keith said only that Xcel is moving ahead with its plans to retire the coal units by 2030.

The aggressive campaign by successive governments to convert drivers from petrol to electric cars has resulted in collapsing fuel duty receipts for the Treasury. And so, the taxman has now set his sight on the owners of electric vehicles (EV).

The details are constantly evolving, but it is now all but certain that EV drivers will be hit with a new pay-per-mile tax in the upcoming Budget.

Drivers of petrol cars currently pay an average £600 each year in fuel duty, so, as The Telegraph reported last week, the Government is now attempting to ensure EV drivers also pay their “fair share”.

One has to admire the chutzpah of politicians who are attempting to frame the policy in terms of fairness. It was a political decision to relentlessly promote the adoption of EVs as a social good, with administrations of all colours zealously pursuing their Net Zero agenda.

It is impossible to work out how many would have opted for EVs had these vehicles – and the concept of “going green” – not been massively incentivised by the Government.

In January 2024, with the Conservatives in power, the Department for Transport and the Office for Zero Emission Vehicles announced that “the UK now has the most ambitious regulatory framework for the switch to electric vehicles of any country in the world”. This was no mere policy; it had been enshrined in law and declared “the largest carbon saving measure in government’s net zero strategy”.

That new law would enforce the Government’s plan for a “zero emission vehicle transition” by 2035. The first step would mean 80pc of new cars and 70pc of new vans sold in Britain were to be zero emission by 2030. By 2035 that would be 100pc. No new petrol or diesel vehicles could legally be sold beyond this date.

The Labour Party, not to be outdone by the Tories, pledged to bring this ban on new sales of petrol and diesel vehicles forward to 2030. We were told that £2bn had been “invested by government to expand charging infrastructure and incentivise zero emission vehicles”.

Virtue signalling comes at a price, and it is almost always borne by taxpayers.

From developing charging infrastructure to offering discounts through schemes such as the £650m electric car grant, it is taxpayers – including drivers of petrol and electric vehicles alike – who have been funding our politicians’ green dream of no more petrol cars.

Fuel duty, in the meantime, has taken on the role of a sin tax to penalise those who are either unable or unwilling to participate in the EV revolution. While it is pitched as a means of deterring fuel consumption, it’s clearly a nice revenue earner for the Treasury at its heart.

Now those same motorists who have been taxed and penalised and bribed into buying EVs are being lectured on the fairness of the Government’s lopsided, short-sighted policy.

Having successfully brought about an EV revolution, the Government has now realised it has killed off an important source of revenue. To make an honest case for this new pay-for-mile tax, the Chancellor needs to acknowledge the role of green ideology in creating the mess in which she now finds herself.

The system as it stands may well be unfair, but it cannot be right to hold owners of EVs responsible for it.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7Yjqr.xbPa_aUkX2oJjrkQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_258/5f170912564a93b8197b0c58f79cbc68,N,,2025-11-10 16:11:42.500816

President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — U.N. climate negotiations were expected to begin Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.

André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in “mutirão,” a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.

“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”

Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.

The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.

“I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. “The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity” of the whole negotiating system.

President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.

“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said.

The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the negotiations to a potluck dinner.

“Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,” which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. “And it’s obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.”

“The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,” Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.

In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.”

Not only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives,” Stiell wrote.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright summed it up well when he said that energy should make societies richer by driving economic growth, rather than making them poorer, through high prices.

In spite of the tensions in today’s energy debates, global leaders need to re-establish a common ground around energy and climate and recognize that the friction does not in fact represent a choice between decarbonization or affordability—we can still strive for both. This becomes all the more important in light of the rapidly growing demand for energy—and especially of electricity—to meet society’s needs, before even considering the rising power demand of artificial intelligence (AI) and data centers.

Reframing the energy and emission conversation

Finding this common ground again means moving on from the term “net zero.” The court of public opinion has made up its mind: net zero is now more associated with higher energy costs than delivering a desirable goal.

And the target is too absolute. The final 10 percent of the journey to net zero could be as expensive as the first 90 percent, which cannot be a sensible use of limited resources. Achieving 90 percent would still be an extraordinary achievement, and any target needs to be credible to be accepted, with a clear pathway for delivering it.

The old talk of an energy trilemma—balancing security, affordability and decarbonization—is evolving. The conversation now also needs to include sovereignty—those resources within a country’s jurisdiction—and abundance—that which is most abundant should be more affordable. Just as this has led the United States to a policy focused on its vast gas resources, in the United Kingdom and Europe more generally, it means a continuing role for the most affordable renewables.

A new approach to energy and climate needs to start with a set of clear principles, which determines priorities, values and what leaders are looking to achieve.

These can be summarized as follows:

Global leaders should prioritize secure and sovereign sources of energy to reduce dependence on others.

Lawmakers should craft energy policy to help drive economic growth, reduce electricity bills, and make countries more competitive.

Industry leaders should champion new technologies that address these challenges.

Public and private actors should ensure that the transition happens in a way that fairly delivers more choice to consumers and empowers them to be part of the solution.

Celebrating and building on achievements

The conversation should also champion what has already been achieved. The UK, for example, in 2022 became the first major economy to reduce its carbon emissions by half (compared to 1990 levels) while still growing the economy by 80 percent; the first major economy to end coal-powered generation; and the country that led the creation of a new global energy industry—offshore wind—in little more than a decade.

These achievements resonate with the public. Polling shows over 60 percent of the public support such policies—far and away the most popular policies of the last Conservative Government. However, it is also clear that people want to secure these achievements in a way that is much more affordable.

Accomplishing this goal has to start from facts—and the facts are promising. Many countries, including some of largest like Brazil and Kenya, get well over 80 to 90 percent of their power from clean resources. Solar generation doubled in the past three years, with China installing more solar power in one month this year than the United States did in the whole of the 2024. And most of the European countries that have lower energy prices than the UK use more renewables. These facts contradict the argument that there is no need for countries like the UK to reduce its emissions if other countries aren’t doing anything—because many are.

Rather than discarding what has been successful, leaders need to look at how energy systems should evolve in a new era and become more affordable.

Taking time to enact common sense policies

It is clear now that gas will have a long-term role to play in the energy transition in the UK and elsewhere. It thus does not make sense, as US President Donald Trump has reminded us, to prematurely close the North Sea with all the job losses that would entail. If gas is to be part of the mix, then it makes sense to maximize the recoveries from the UK’s own offshore fields.

A clean, affordable future also means more nuclear, despite setbacks. For a nation that led the world in civil nuclear power, the UK for one seems to have lost its way. Hinkley Point C, initially promised for 2018, will be fifteen years late and significantly over budget. The United States has had similar experiences. That does not mean nuclear isn’t worth the investment, but that leaders need to learn how to build it better and faster. It means more standardization of design and a regulatory approach that learns more actively from other countries.

COP30: A chance to reset global thinking on energy and climate

These considerations point back to what can be done at COP30. The news from the conference is likely to be disappointing, but it gives those leaders attending the chance to set out a new way of thinking, which shows that they don’t need to choose between energy security, decarbonization, and keeping bills low. Investors need clarity and long-term thinking. We need to see more of that in evidence over the coming days.

This proposed EGR Plan was enabled by House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1007, passed by the Indiana State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Braun earlier this year.
This new policy has been touted by the administration and many in the legislature as “the solution” that will protect consumers from the extraordinary costs that are required to meet the electric demands caused by AI data centers.
Most notably, Statehouse leadership has opined that Indiana policy requires AI data centers to pay at least 80% of the costs incurred to meet their voracious appetite for electricity.
Despite these claims, CAC estimates that at least 39% of EGR Plan costs will fall to other customers in 2030.","—

On Friday November 7, Citizens Action Coalition (CAC) filed expert testimony, with the assistance of counsel from Earthjustice, calling on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) to reject Indiana Michigan Power Company’s (I&M) request for what CAC conservatively estimates is a more than $7 billion blank check to build and buy unidentified power plants for new Amazon and Google artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. I&M’s Expedited Generation Resource (EGR) Plan is the largest, and likely the most expensive proposed expansion of generation by a utility in a docketed proceeding in Indiana history.

This proposed EGR Plan was enabled by House Enrolled Act (HEA) 1007, passed by the Indiana State Legislature and signed into law by Governor Braun earlier this year. This new policy has been touted by the administration and many in the legislature as “the solution” that will protect consumers from the extraordinary costs that are required to meet the electric demands caused by AI data centers. Most notably, Statehouse leadership has opined that Indiana policy requires AI data centers to pay at least 80% of the costs incurred to meet their voracious appetite for electricity.

Despite these claims, CAC estimates that at least 39% of EGR Plan costs will fall to other customers in 2030. An even higher share of the costs will hit I&M customers’ bills before 2030 as the result of I&M’s request that the IURC allow them to add a new bill tracker, or surcharge, to monthly electric bills that would force other customers to foot much of the bill well in advance of any new generation resources coming online, and while AI data centers are still under construction.

“Simply put, Google and Amazon are two of the most financially successful companies in human history. They each have multi-trillion-dollar market capitalizations and annual net incomes in the tens to hundreds of billions of dollars,” said Ben Inskeep, CAC’s Program Director. “It is not just and reasonable nor consistent with the state of Indiana’s policies for I&M’s non-large-load customers to be forced to subsidize the costs and risks of serving these Big Tech behemoths.”

The proposed EGR Plan lacks basic information about the rate and monthly bill impacts on other I&M ratepayers. This despite requirements included in HEA1007 that any EGR plan filed by a utility before the IURC describe how the Plan is consistent with providing “affordable electric service” at “economical rates.” Additionally, I&M is requesting preapproval for a massive expansion of natural gas power plants, which would generate 85% of the electricity under the EGR Plan and emit more climate-warming emissions than the combined pollution at five Indiana coal plants, according to CAC calculations.

“Indiana is rapidly emerging as a nationally prominent site of concentrated data center development, with a scope of proposals that promises to double — or more — the demand on electric utilities including I&M,” said Sameer Doshi, Earthjustice Senior Attorney. “Before these enormous facilities join the grid, Indiana regulators must quickly ensure that data centers’ energy usage fulfills the state’s policy and legal requirements for the power sector, including affordability and environmental sustainability.”

Under HEA 1007, the schedule for this case is extremely truncated, preventing more thorough evaluation and review by consumer advocates and the IURC, as well as effectively limiting the public’s ability to object to being forced to subsidize electricity for AI data centers owned and operated by Google, Amazon, and others. The entire procedural schedule is just 90 days from start to finish. An evidentiary hearing is scheduled for December 3 with an order mandated by the law by December 31.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-11-10 13:10:40.688271

Pablo McConnie-Saad was until January a senior Treasury Department adviser, working in the office helping homeowners, companies, cities and others to take advantage of the hundreds of billions of dollars of clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act.

That’s now a key part of his campaign for Pennsylvania’s 3rd District in Philadelphia. McConnie-Saad is focusing his message on affordability and arguing Republicans exacerbated the crisis when they rolled back renewable energy incentives through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

“Taking away something like the Inflation Reduction Act, that was going to reduce costs for folks, it’s just devastating,” McConnie-Saad told POLITICO’s E&E News in an interview this month.

“The Inflation Reduction Act was the single greatest investment in this country’s history to try to transition the country away from fossil fuels towards renewables. These are things that would save money for people,” he added. “Energy costs are going through the roof, and divesting from all of these provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act is going to make life more expensive across the board.”

McConnie-Saad worked in Treasury’s IRA Implementation Program Office, which was overseen by then-Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo. The job included helping shape tax credit guidance and to inform potential recipients how to use them.

The 2022 law leaned heavily on Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, since most of the clean energy-related programs were changes, expansions or new additions to the tax code.

An example of McConnie-Saad’s work was communicating to nonprofits and municipalities so they could get money under the IRA’s “direct pay” provisions.

“We needed the public to know what the Inflation Reduction Act was and how they could benefit from it. And that required a whole-of-government approach, and the Treasury was a good place to do that,” he said.

McConnie-Saad, whose parents moved to Philadelphia from Puerto Rico, is a political newcomer, running as a progressive candidate. He emphasized his Philadelphia roots in launching his campaign, along with his affordability message.

“Rents are still too high, and there still aren’t enough good jobs,” he says in his launch video.

He’s one of a growing group of 2026 congressional candidates bringing significant energy and climate change experience to their races.

The 3rd District — which includes Philadelphia’s Center City and West Philadelphia — has been held since 2016 by Rep. Dwight Evans (D). Evans, 71, announced this year that he wouldn’t seek reelection, following health concerns including a 2024 stroke.

The May Democratic primary is shaping up to be a crowded one, with McConnie-Saad competing against at least seven other hopefuls.

The field includes state Sen. Sharif Street, whose father and uncle were major political figures. McConnie-Saad used his launch video to accuse Street and others of contributing to the state’s political dysfunction.

Bechtel said the project will store excess solar power for use by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, grid for high demand periods.
It includes about 300 MW of battery storage and is set to be the largest solar project in the state's history.
ENGIE and technology giant Meta recently announced power purchase agreements for more than 1.3 GW of generation from four Texas solar power projects, including a new 600-MW facility near Lubbock.
The firm says it has procured more than 3 GW of solar power so far in 2025.","Israel-based clean energy developer Doral Group Renewable Energy Resources is expanding its U.S. footprint in solar energy—despite growing political headwinds—in selecting Bechtel this month to design and build a 430-MW solar power project in Texas. The Cold Creek Solar+Storage project, sited in Schleicher and Tom Green counties, will have more than 850,000 solar modules and include a 340-MWh battery energy storage system.

Bechtel said the project will store excess solar power for use by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, or ERCOT, grid for high demand periods. The contractor did not disclose project cost, but it was stated by the developer at an estimated $460 million, according to a report by Globes, an Israel-based business publication. Doral said construction will begin in the first quarter of 2026, with Bechtel committing to complete work by mid 2028.

“The Cold Creek project highlights the power of an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” said Scott Austin, Bechtel general manager of renewables and clean power. “Texas continues to lead the nation in blending traditional and renewable resources to strengthen its grid. We are proud to bring Bechtel’s experience to this important project.”

Bechtel ls currently managing design, engineering and construction for the final three phases of the 1.6-GW Mammoth solar project in Starke County, Indiana, set to boost the state’s solar power generation capacity by more than 20%, and be one of the largest U.S. solar projects when completed at the end of 2026, the contractor said. SOLV Energy completed its first 400 MW phase last year. Mammoth is estimated to cost at least $1.5 billion.

Jason Van Deusen, vice president of project management for Doral’s Philadelphia-based U.S. operation, Doral Renewables, said Cold Creek would create more than 500 jobs at peak construction and is the developer's fifth utility-scale solar facility in the state.

Doral also said it has secured a power purchase agreement with an unnamed “corporate buyer” for the project to cover 75% of its energy output, describing the off-taker as a “well-known and experienced energy buyer” that is a new commercial client for the company, which said it operates in 21 states. “This new relationship is a substantial accomplishment and a foundational agreement as Doral continues to expand its operating portfolio across the country,” said Sean Boyle, Doral vice president of markets, noting intent ""to continue this momentum as we embark on another significant project and contribute to the vision of a diverse energy portfolio and resilient grid in America.”

The firm has also proposed the 1.3-GW Vista Sands project in Portage County, Wisconsin, an estimated $1-billion, 7,000-acre solar array approved earlier this year by Wisconsin utility regulators. Doral aims to start construction next spring and begin operating in 2028 or 2029. It includes about 300 MW of battery storage and is set to be the largest solar project in the state's history. No contractor has been announced. The developer last summer settled a lawsuit with opponents concerned about project impact on an endangered species in Wisconsin.

Doral, considered a pioneer in solar and energy storage development in Israel, is also building its first facility to produce green hydrogen. In addition to the U.S. and Israel, the firm operates in Canada, Europe and elsewhere, with a global solar and storage development portfolio of about 18 GW, it said.

Tax Credit Crunch

But renewables project financing now faces new barriers, with the Trump administration squeeze on the federal investment production tax credits affecting solar and wind energy projects. Under new rules issued in August—after Trump signed the giant budget bill in July and issued an executive order to phase out the credits—a project can still qualify if it meets a July 4, 2026, deadline to break ground and is completed by 2030. Projects that don’t start construction by that date must be operating by Dec. 31, 2027, to qualify.

“Quite a lot is at risk,” said Rachel Patterson, senior policy director at Evergreen Action, a climate advocacy group, who is concerned that with lengthy state permitting for projects, those that lack approvals may not advance in time to qualify for credits. “By meddling with tax credit implementing rules, Trump is trying to create legal headaches and delays that will prevent clean energy projects from commencing construction in time to claim the credits,"" she said. ""That directly leads to fewer low-cost energy projects being built and higher costs for those that do.”

Despite the headwind, Nick Cohen, president and CEO of Doral Renewables, says the firm is moving forward with its U.S. projects, aiming to seek traditional project financing if the company cannot qualify projects in time for the tax credits, he told E and E News, although noting that power prices would also likely rise. “As long as there’s demand for power and not enough supply, we’ll have customers to buy our power,” he said. ""So our business is actually in a very good position because there’s so little supply out there and such strong demand.”

According to S&P Global, data center power need is expected to rise 22% in 2025 and nearly triple by 2030, with giant tech companies still eyeing solar energy to power the centers quickly.

ENGIE and technology giant Meta recently announced power purchase agreements for more than 1.3 GW of generation from four Texas solar power projects, including a new 600-MW facility near Lubbock. Meta also announced Oct. 30 it has agreed to purchase renewable energy certificates related to two utility-scale solar projects in Louisiana, the 185 MW Beekman Solar and the 200 MW Hollis Creek Solar project, both being developed by Austin-based Treaty Oak Clean Energy and set to operate in third-quarter 2027.

While the energy from both projects will support regional reliability, they will also contribute to Meta’s broader operations and decarbonization strategy, the tech firm said. “When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid – and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that,” said Urvi Parekh, Meta head of global energy. The firm says it has procured more than 3 GW of solar power so far in 2025.

Still, risks remain for the renewables sector. About two-thirds of wind projects and nearly three quarters of solar projects set to be online by 2030 have not yet begun construction, according to recent U.S. Energy Information Administration statistics.

Abigail Ross Hopper, group president and CEO of sector trade group Solar Energy Industries Association, says politically motivated administration actions such as tax credit rollbacks, funding cuts and new project review mandates by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum could threaten more than 500 U.S. solar projects that are set to provide 116 GW of capacity—more than half of all new power to be generated in the U.S. through 2030—just as electricity demand from AI is exploding.

Eighteen states are at risk of losing more than half of their planned power capacity through the end of the decade, the group said in a new analysis.

“Every delay and disruption drives up power bills and hands economic opportunity to China,"" Hopper stressed. ""We need to get back to building.”",https://www.enr.com/ext/resources/2025/11/09/BECHTEMAMMOTH.INDIANA.jpg?height=635&t=1762730737&width=1200,N,,2025-11-10 13:10:10.997171

Early, genuine engagement turns potential opposition into partnership — accelerating transmission projects and delivering shared benefits.

The most successful developers align projects with local priorities, from co-ownership models to infrastructure upgrades, creating lasting trust and progress.

The United States needs to build more electric transmission lines at an unprecedented pace to connect and deliver clean, reliable and affordable energy. But we are not building anywhere near fast enough, and that has a lot to with how we build. Too often, developers have followed a “decide, announce defend” approach — selecting routes and announcing plans without community input. That strategy has fueled opposition, delayed projects and, in some cases, stopped them altogether.

How to build transmission with communities, not around them Share on X

Communities as partners

A new report from Environmental Defense Fund and Clean Air Task Force, Beyond the Wires: Community Benefits from Transmission Projects, presents five case studies covering six successfully constructed transmission lines to understand how developers can work with communities rather than against them. We looked at Vineyard Wind in Massachusetts; Big Eddy-Knight in Washington and Oregon; West of Devers in California; Mona-to-Oquirrh in Utah and Sunrise Powerlink and Sycamore-Peñasquitos in California. These case studies show that when developers treat communities as partners, projects move faster, face less opposition and deliver more lasting benefits.

Creative community benefits

The most successful projects went beyond cash payments. They aligned with local priorities, coordinated construction with other infrastructure needs and tested innovative ownership models.

Vineyard Wind partnered with the Town of Barnstable to upgrade sewer infrastructure. The West of Devers Upgrade Project created a groundbreaking co-ownership arrangement with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians, advancing Tribal sovereignty and avoiding costly reroutes. Citizens Energy’s partnerships on Sunrise Powerlink and Sycamore-Peñasquitos reinvested profits into clean energy programs. Even settlements reached after conflict, like Mona-to-Oquirrh’s rerouting and conservation land transfer, show the value of addressing community concerns head-on.

Keys to success

Three lessons stand out. First, engage communities early — before routes are locked in. Second, think beyond financial compensation to deliver benefits that matter locally. Third, create space for regulatory and financing flexibility so new models for community benefits frameworks can emerge.

As the nation prepares to build the transmission backbone of a clean energy future, we have a choice: replicate the missteps of the past or embrace community benefit frameworks that foster trust and accelerate progress. These case studies prove that communities are not obstacles to overcome — they are essential partners in building the grid we need.",https://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/wp-content/blogs.dir/38/files//Fig1_Sunrise-Sunset-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 13:08:53.735334

Introduction

As part of Japan’s commitment in September to invest $550 billion in the United States, it signed a deal, negotiated with President Trump in October, indicating its interest in partially funding a U.S. nuclear project worth from $80–$100 billion for Westinghouse to build nuclear reactors. Additionally, the U.S.-Japan investment deal includes involving Hitachi GE Vernova to build small modular reactors.

Japan has strong capabilities in manufacturing nuclear reactor parts that require heavy forging of large pieces of metals, while the United States does not. Moreover, Japan is an important trading partner in nuclear energy products for the United States, which imported about $1.4 million worth of nuclear reactor parts – nearly 20 percent of its total nuclear reactor part imports – from Japan in 2024.

This insight provides a summary of the U.S.-Japan investment deal in nuclear energy and reviews the current nuclear energy market landscapes in the United States and Japan – as well as their trade relationship in nuclear energy products.

Japan’s Investment Commitments in the U.S. Nuclear Energy Industry

Overview of the Investment Deal

In October 2025, President Trump signed a deal with Japan outlining several investment projects – a follow on to Japan’s September commitment to invest $550 billion in the United States. The deal covers a variety of areas in which Japan will invest in the United States, including critical minerals, power infrastructure and nuclear reactors. Investment in these three areas would total up to $337 billion, according to the administration’s fact sheet.

Specifically, for nuclear reactors, the Japanese government is committed to partly fund a strategic partnership agreement between Westinghouse, a U.S. nuclear developer, and the U.S. government. Note that the Japanese government’s fact sheet states that this project is up to $100 billion, while the press release from the Cameco Corporation and Brookfield Asset Management (joint owners of Westinghouse) states the deal is at least $80 billion. Under the agreement, Westinghouse will build AP 1000 nuclear reactors, which are “the most advanced reactor commercially available.” Japan will also fund the project involving Japanese companies, such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Toshiba Group, and IHI, though it does not specify what the involvement will be. The portion of the project not funded by Japan will be funded by U.S. taxpayers.

Notably, under the agreement, the U.S. government would be entitled to 20 percent of Westinghouse’s returns in excess of $17.5 billion. If Westinghouse’s valuation exceeds $30 billion, the U.S. government could require the company to go public and would be entitled to a 20-percent equity stake in the company. This deal is similar to other deals the Trump Administration has made with Intel and MP Materials that provide the federal government more influence over business decisions in a form of state-directed capitalism.

Additionally, the U.S.-Japan investment deal also includes involving Hitachi GE Vernova (a Japanese company established through a strategic global alliance between Hitachi and GE in 2007) to build small modular reactors.

Japan’s heavy manufacturing capability in making nuclear reactor parts

Japan’s unique and strong capabilities in manufacturing heavy nuclear reactor parts may have played an important role in the investment deal’s focus on the U.S. nuclear energy industry.

Accessibility to heavy engineering plants for making nuclear reactor components is critical for new reactor construction. This is because constructing a new reactor requires special technical capabilities and an enormous capacity to move and forge large, heavy parts, such as reactor pressure vessels, which are used to contain the reactor fuel safely and hold the coolant. The newest generation of reactors, such as the AP 1000 included in the U.S.-Japan investment deal, requires pressure vessels that are produced by forging presses with a capacity of 14,000–15,000 tonnes that can handle hot steel ingots of 500–600 tonnes. Few countries currently have the heavy forging capacity, including Japan, China, Russia, France, South Korea, and Czech Republic. The United States does not have the capacity due to the significant decline in new reactor construction since the 1980s.

Japan Steel Works (JSW), a Japanese steel manufacturer, is the world’s largest and most well-known manufacturer with heavy forging capacity. As of 2021, JSW accounted for 80 percent of the global market for large, forged components for nuclear reactors. It has been supplying nuclear reactor components that require heavy forging to the United States since 1974.

U.S.-Japan Nuclear Energy-related Trade

Japan is an important trading partner in nuclear energy products for the United States. In 2024, the United States imported about $1.4 million worth of nuclear reactor parts from Japan, accounting for approximately 19 percent of America’s total imports of nuclear reactor parts. (Figure 2)

In 2024, the United States imported over $162 million worth of nuclear energy-related products, including nuclear reactors, fuel elements, and various reactor components. The import value of nuclear reactor parts (HTS code 840140) remained low over the last few years, totaling just $7.5 million in 2024 (under 5 percent of all nuclear-related imports). In 2025, the United States imported close to $31 million in nuclear reactor parts between January and July, a dramatic increase compared to the last decade.

As Figure 1 shows, there has been a substantial increase in imports of nuclear-related products in the past year. This trend is expected to continue, especially for nuclear reactor parts. Based on median monthly import values in 2025, American Action Forum (AAF) estimated that total imports of nuclear reactor parts will reach approximately $50 million in 2025, representing 30 percent of all nuclear-related imports. This surge in imports is primarily driven by a large increase in trade with Italy, from which the United States imported nearly 80 percent of all nuclear reactor part imports between January and July of this year. (See Figure 2 and Figure 3.) While the United States imported just $65,000 in parts from Italy last year, imports jumped to over $24 million in the first half of 2025, according to data from the U.S. International Trade Commission. This could be due to the U.S.-Italy partnership in nuclear reactor projects earlier this year. For example, Westinghouse signed a $180 million contract with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, drawing supplies from two Italian companies, Ansaldo Nucleare and Walter Tosto. In 2025, the United States also imported nuclear reactor parts from other countries including Canada, Germany, and Mexico.

Despite the Trump Administration’s introduction of wide-sweeping tariffs on “Liberation Day,” the effective tariff rates on nuclear products have not drastically increased. In fact, the tariff rate on parts of nuclear reactors is estimated to have declined from 2.5 percent in 2024 to 0.6 percent this year. Meanwhile, the tariff rate on the broader product category of nuclear-related imports is estimated to remain at close to 3 percent (See Figure 4).

Nuclear Energy in the United States and Japan

The United States is currently the world’s largest nuclear energy player in terms of its total net generation capacity (97 gigawatts) and number of active reactors (94). It significantly leads other top countries in nuclear energy capacity, including France, China, Russia, and South Korea.

Nuclear energy in the United States

A previous AAF’s Forum insight provides a detailed analysis of the nuclear energy landscape in the United States. Although construction of new nuclear reactors has stalled over the past few decades, nuclear energy has been an important energy source, generating about 20 percent of the country’s total electricity. Recently, there has been renewed U.S. interest in nuclear energy from a bipartisan group of congressional members, as well as the administration, the private sector, and the public.

The 2024 bipartisan ADVANCE Act of 2024 (Accelerating Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy), provides important support for the nuclear energy industry by lowering regulatory compliance costs and removing some regulatory barriers for developers. Following enactment of this bill, U.S. technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, have announced large investment projects in next-generation nuclear technology, including advanced nuclear reactors and small modular reactors.

The Trump Administration has strengthened the policy support for nuclear energy to meet the fast-rising electricity demand, mostly from AI data centers. Earlier this year, President Trump signed four executive orders to accelerate U.S. deployment of advanced nuclear technologies by expediting regulatory review processes, promoting nuclear energy exports, and reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

Nuclear energy in Japan

Nuclear energy was an important energy source in Japan, generating about 30 percent of the country’s electricity, until a major accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station caused by an earthquake in 2011. After the accident, public sentiment shifted significantly against nuclear energy in Japan, and the government suspended the operation of its nuclear reactors from 2013–2015 for safety checks.

Since then, Japan has been slowly restarting its nuclear reactors, and it currently has 33 operable nuclear reactors, generating about 6 percent of the country’s total electricity. It is planning to increase the share of nuclear power in the electricity generation mix to between 20–22 percent by 2030.

Looking Forward

As the United States expands its nuclear energy production and Japan continues to ramp up its nuclear energy capacity, it is important to monitor the progress toward realizing the nuclear energy investment commitments in the U.S.-Japan deal. How much of the promised investment is realized, and in what form (capital, nuclear reactor products, or technology support) is key to achieving the investment targets in the deal. It will also be crucial to keep an eye on how this U.S.-Japan nuclear investment deal unfolds in the broader context of the U.S.-Japan trade relationship.",https://www.americanactionforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nuclear-power-plant-6798214_1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 13:09:07.841182

RealClearFoundation

While the House of Representatives has understandably been quiet during the government shutdown, not everyone has been idle.

While most members of Congress were home in their districts, Rep. Troy Balderson, an Ohio Republican, quietly introduced a short, potentially consequential piece of energy legislation called “The Affordable, Reliable, Clean Energy Security Act.”

“We the People” will celebrate our nation’s 250th birthday next Independence Day. And truth be told, we are crossing this milestone birthday showing our age. We are politically bipolar. We are in debt. Our infrastructure is crumbling and our schools are a mess. We are in need of several new leases on life.

For starters, if America is to be made great again – by anyone’s definition – it will require a commonsense reordering of our approach to energy and electricity generation. Troy Balderson’s approach offers the kind of clear-eyed vision we need.

Aimed as a corrective to the “Green New Deal” priorities that took hold during the Biden administration, the ARC would direct federal agencies to reorder their policies with attainable objectives aimed at increasing attainable and cost-effective domestic energy production – and providing benchmarks allowing for effective congressional oversight.

The bill would formally require government regulators to prioritize these three words when evaluating energy projects: Is it affordable? Is it reliable? Is it clean? Most politicians give lip-service to these concepts, but under current law they are left open to interpretation by the executive branch and they shift from one administration to the next, Balderson points out. His bill would essentially codify a true “all of the above” energy approach – and would benefit all Americans regardless of their ideological leanings.

If enacted by Congress and signed by the president, his legislation would require the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency to submit a report to Congress within 180 days documenting what they are doing to incorporate all-of-the-above into our national energy strategy. Windmills and solar farms wouldn’t be suddenly sidelined. (On the other end of the energy scale, neither would coal.) But this bill would virtually assure that all viable, affordable, and reliable energy sources – including nuclear power and natural gas – remain in the nation’s energy mix. In other words, it replaces old habits and ideological fads with practicality as a way of supporting American families and businesses.

I don’t question liberals’ commitment to a cleaner environment. But Democrats campaigned this autumn on the need for “affordability” – and found a receptive electorate. This legislation would turn that rhetoric into action. And just as important to poor and middle-class families, it fuels our nation’s efforts to rebuild and onshore the energy sector that fuels economic growth.

Greater reliance on natural gas and nuclear power will deliver green and clean dividends. ARC is a win, win, win. The status quo is a lose, lose, lose.

Mine is a nonpartisan appeal for making this bill law. Legislators of America, let’s meet in the middle of the aisle. Without the re-ordering of energy interests in this bill – affordability first, reliability second, and clean third – our rate cards are going to go through the roof. The economy, the hopes of the American people, and their pursuit of happiness are predicated on considerably lower rates.

The American ratepayer is the American family. And “We the People” – the payers – are suffering unnecessarily, and it is not by the hand of foreign actors beyond our democratic reach and control. It is being done by those who are supposed to represent us.

My fellow Americans, lend me your ears for an ADHD minute. In the recent past, we have been governed by a shackling set of priorities. Clean energy has been in the driver seat, followed by affordability, and then reliability. This “CAR” approach has not delivered on its promises. And it is structurally incapable of getting us over the fast-approaching AI demand hill.

The status quo CAR approach and mindset can’t even service the status quo. Look no further than New Jersey, which is having a voter revolt partly because of rising electricity costs. This is not a only a blue state problem. Georgia sent an affordability message last Tuesday that should be a wake-up call for all red states, which like Texas have chased green subsidies. The rate increases are coming due for all.

If we continue to follow our current energy priorities, brown-outs, economic stagnation, and out-migration to energy-rich states will follow. “We the People” will all benefit from the passage of ARC Energy Security. Democrats, Republicans, and independent voters will all benefit.

What is our short-term future if we do nothing new? Take your present energy bill and multiply it by 2.3, which is the variance between American and British ratepayers in the business sector.

New Jersey, what’s the mid-term future of sticking with CAR? Give your present rate card woes about a 100% increase. This is what German ratepayers are gouged for – around 40 cents per kilowatt hour – to underwrite their country’s march towards deindustrialization.

Texas and Florida – states with lower energy costs and the beneficiaries of out-migration from blue states that have gone green crazy – deduct money from your energy bill and think about what that money can do in the hands of citizens spending it in your state, and investing for retirement.

AI’s appetite for reliable energy will require an energy-capacity building boom. The ARC approach will get us there; CAR will not. John Fetterman, Congressman Balderson needs a co-sponsor in the Senate. Senate Republicans will likely support this approach, but energy affordability and reliability should not be partisan concerns.

In the second Trump administration, the president has issued various executive orders, and Cabinet secretaries have put out their directives while incoming Democratic governor Mikie Sherrill has vowed to freeze utility costs. There’s a better way to govern – a better way to promote the general welfare and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.

Affordable, reliable, and clean energy should be an issue that unites us at a time when unity is in short supply.

To defend our livable future, our leaders must end carbon capture subsidies, ban the buildout of carbon capture infrastructure, and invest in our 100% renewable future.","The 45Q tax credit for carbon capture pays polluters for continuing to drill, frack, burn, pollute, and pursue dangerous climate boondoggles.

Fossil fuel barons, tech companies, and even some climate advocates have hailed carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a climate solution. But in the decades since the U.S. began subsidizing it, this technology has only served to give cover to Big Oil and Gas to keep polluting.

Carbon capture promises — and has failed to — fight climate change by capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from smokestacks or the air and permanently keeping it out of the atmosphere. It enables a fantasy where dirty energy can be made clean with the right technology; where we can fight climate change while continuing to drill and burn fossil fuels.

Nevertheless, U.S. leaders continue to lavish the industry with lucrative tax incentives. Recently, Trump’s Big Ugly Bill even bolstered 45Q, the main avenue for these incentives. He’s made even more taxpayer funds available to polluters.

Carbon capture won’t save the climate, and neither will 45Q subsidies. In fact, with the way 45Q works, it can pay dirty energy companies to pollute even more. Our newest research shows how the program rewards companies for drilling, burning, and wreaking havoc on our planet.

Here are four ways 45Q incentives for carbon capture are driving more pollution.

1. 45Q Pays Companies to Create More Toxic Pollution

The 45Q program rewards tax credits to carbon capture projects for every ton of CO2 they capture and store. This risks creating a perverse incentive for companies to pollute more, just so they can get those credits.

Take coal, for example. In 2024, coal-fired power plants paid an average of $2.55 per million BTU of coal. Burning that coal would emit CO2 that, if captured, would be worth $8.14.

In other words, carbon capture projects could buy coal only to burn it, capture just half of the CO2 emissions, and still make a profit. By incentivizing more fossil fuel extraction, 45Q threatens to drive more pollution.

Notably, carbon capture only addresses one kind of pollutant — CO2. It does nothing about other climate-wrecking gases like methane. Nor does it rein in other kinds of pollution from fossil fuels.

By giving climate cover for fossil fuel activities to expand, carbon capture threatens to grow the industry’s other pollutants, such as smog-forming and asthma-worsening nitrogen oxides and carcinogens like benzene.

Incentivizing carbon capture drives more drilling and burning with dubious climate benefits, while communities near fossil fuel operations will face even more dangerous pollution.

2. 45Q Incentivizes More Drilling through Enhanced Oil Recovery

The 45Q program rewards an oil drilling technique under the ridiculous guise that it’s a climate solution. Drillers can claim lucrative tax credits for enhanced oil recovery (EOR): injecting CO2 into a well to push out the last dregs of oil.

Notably, the vast majority — 89% in 2022 — of carbon captured in the United States is actually used to drill for more oil through EOR.

This, of course, is far from “good for the climate”; in fact, we found that burning the oil produced through EOR emits more CO2 than is injected during the process. Moreover, by one count, in 2022 EOR enabled the drilling of 88.2 million barrels of oil that would have otherwise stayed in the ground.

Nevertheless, with the 45Q provisions passed in the Inflation Reduction Act, companies could receive $60 per ton of CO2 they used for EOR (compared to $85 for “geological sequestration,” or plain old storage).

With Trump’s Big Ugly Bill, companies can now also get $85 per ton for EOR. This has unlocked a potential $210 billion windfall for oil companies to just drill more.

3. 45Q Rewards Gas Processing Facilities

45Q also allows gas processing facilities to use a simple relabeling trick to receive tax credits. This has helped to inflate reports of carbon capture’s success. Now, 60% of the CO2 the EPA reports as “captured” comes from gas processing facilities.

How has this happened? Many gas wells also contain naturally occurring CO2. Drilling brings this CO2 to the surface, along with the methane gas that’s sold and burned for energy. These processing facilities have long separated this CO2 and other waste from the methane and injected it back underground.

By relabeling these injection wells, many gas facilities can claim lucrative 45Q tax credits without changing a thing about their dirty operations.

Worse, reinjecting this naturally occurring CO2 creates the risk that companies start extracting otherwise unprofitable CO2-rich gas. With 45Q tax credits, they could inject a portion of the CO2, emit the rest, and still make a profit.

In this way, 45Q threatens to incentivize more CO2 emissions and gas production than we — or the planet — need, all to capture government subsidies.

4. 45Q Encourage Dirty Climate Boondoggles

The lure of 45Q tax credits has driven the expansion of whole industries of climate scams. That includes so-called “blue hydrogen” — hydrogen produced from natural gas and paired with carbon capture.

Blue hydrogen is another boondoggle falsely hailed as a climate solution. Besides propping up the gas industry, capturing CO2 at blue hydrogen facilities does nothing about the massive amounts of climate pollution emitted by the extraction and transportation of natural gas for blue hydrogen. In fact, these upstream emissions almost fully cancel out any emissions reduced via carbon capture.

To make matters worse, the vast majority of U.S. hydrogen is used for oil refining (68%) and harmful nitrogen-based fertilizers (21%). Subsidies supporting blue hydrogen indirectly subsidize Big Oil and Big Ag, too.

45Q is also boosting dirty ethanol; corn ethanol refineries have become one of the most rapid adopters of carbon capture. Touted as a “climate-friendly” gasoline alternative, ethanol is actually terrible for the climate.

Corn grown solely to be turned into fuel has devoured vast tracts of farmland and wreaked havoc on our environment. Accounting for its full lifecycle from seed to tank, ethanol is responsible for almost a quarter more emissions than fossil gasoline.

Tax credits from 45Q threaten to fuel this fire further. Similar to EOR and gas processing, they pay ethanol refineries for something they already do — capturing their waste CO2. Meanwhile, there’s no technology to address the climate pollution at every other step of the ethanol cycle.

Rather than help the climate, 45Q is a boon to dirty climate scam technologies, paying them to expand and pollute even more.

Big Oil and Gas Companies Know the Truth — You Should, Too

In press releases and on public stages, fossil fuel companies and utilities are touting their expansion of carbon capture as climate work.

Behind the headlines, they’re singing a different tune. According to Occidental’s CEO, “If it’s produced in the way that I’m talking about [with carbon capture], there’s no reason not to produce oil and gas forever.” At an oil and gas industry conference, an ExxonMobil lobbyist emphasized that carbon capture was about profit, not the environment.

For these companies, carbon capture and storage is a mirage behind which they continue to drill, burn, pollute, and profit as they always have. The lucrative tax credits of the 45Q program will reward them for even more of the same.

We can’t let them get away with this. Congress must change course on 45Q. To defend our livable future, our leaders must end carbon capture subsidies, ban the buildout of carbon capture infrastructure, and invest in our 100% renewable future.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/fww_featured_45QFundingScam-1-2880x1200-C-1024x427.png,N,,2025-11-10 13:09:54.407083

In response, state authorities are aggressively stepping in to fill a perceived enforcement void, taking decisive action to protect public health and safety.
State environmental agencies are adopting cost-effective enforcement methods, such as prioritizing citizen complaints, issuing warning letters instead of formal enforcement actions, and providing guidance to improve compliance.
The message for businesses is clear: Do not wait for state enforcement to escalate or for federal oversight to resume.","The second Trump administration has launched an aggressive deregulatory campaign at the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), raising concerns among legal experts, environmental advocates, and public health officials. Central to the deregulatory agenda is a redefinition of EPA’s mission, including a reallocation of enforcement priorities and resources. The potential consequences for environmental enforcement affecting chemical manufacturers under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)1remain uncertain. In response, state authorities are stepping in to protect public health and safety at the state level under state law.

During EPA's reorganization and reallocation of enforcement priorities and resources, companies should not scale back their compliance efforts. In this period of extreme and unpredictable change, businesses will benefit from conducting internal audits, reviewing product stewardship, and evaluating environmental, health, and safety (EHS) practices to help ensure full compliance with FIFRA, TSCA, and other applicable environmental laws. Proactive steps, including voluntary self-disclosure under EPA's self-disclosure policies, can reduce enforcement risk and protect companies as regulatory priorities fluctuate, now and in the years ahead.

The Trump administration's deregulatory agenda has altered EPA’s enforcement capacity to an uncertain extent, potentially representing a shift in the federal role in environmental and public health protection. In response, state authorities are aggressively stepping in to fill a perceived enforcement void, taking decisive action to protect public health and safety. Many states, including California, are implementing innovative and robust strategies to help ensure compliance, assuming part of the enforcement role performed by the federal government up to now. State environmental agencies are adopting cost-effective enforcement methods, such as prioritizing citizen complaints, issuing warning letters instead of formal enforcement actions, and providing guidance to improve compliance.

At the state level, environmental self-audits have become an essential component of due diligence in mergers, acquisitions, or other corporate transactions. These audits serve two main purposes: They help identify potential environmental liabilities associated with target companies, and they demonstrate proactive compliance, which can mitigate enforcement risk under self-disclosure and audit policies. In today's deregulatory environment, self-audits offer critical legal and business protections. Pre-acquisition audits identify legacy violations, cleanup responsibilities, and compliance gaps that could become costly after closing, while post-acquisition audits uncover undisclosed violations, allowing for timely voluntary disclosures under EPA and state policies. Post-acquisition audits, conducted promptly after closing, can identify previously undisclosed violations and enable timely voluntary disclosures under EPA's Audit Policy or analogous state programs providing substantial penalty mitigation—or even complete penalty elimination—for companies that self-disclose and correct violations discovered through qualified audits, particularly when performed in good faith and not under imminent enforcement threats.

Historically, along with EPA, state agencies have provided substantial penalty mitigation—or complete elimination of penalties—for companies that voluntarily disclose, correct, and take steps to help prevent a recurrence of violations identified through good-faith audits. For businesses in highly regulated sectors, such as chemical manufacturing, formulation, and distribution, self-audits demonstrate diligence, reduce transactional and operational risk, establish ""good actor"" status in enforcement actions or private litigation, and build credibility with regulators, investors, and the public. Whether employed for transactional due diligence or ongoing compliance, self-auditing remains one of the most effective tools for managing environmental risk amid regulatory uncertainty.

The Trump administration's deregulatory agenda has introduced unprecedented uncertainty in federal environmental oversight. In response, state regulatory agencies are stepping in to fill the enforcement void, ensuring continued protection of public health and the environment under state law. Businesses should act proactively by conducting self-audits, strengthening compliance programs, and considering voluntary disclosures at both the federal and state levels. Taking these measures now safeguards operations and transactions, preserves public trust, and positions companies to navigate rapidly shifting enforcement priorities.

The message for businesses is clear: Do not wait for state enforcement to escalate or for federal oversight to resume. Proactive steps reduce the risk of penalties, reinforce public confidence, help ensure compliance, and help avoid enforcement-related business interruptions in a complex and evolving regulatory environment. Companies seeking guidance on next steps or tailored compliance strategies can rely on experienced professionals with deep expertise across multiple administrations and regulatory landscapes to chart an effective path forward.",https://www.steptoe.com/a/web/173755/3ZEKXR/steptoe_og.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 15:01:33.536192

""Phosphate and potash production is critical to food security, and food security is national security,"" said Bruce Bodine, President and CEO of The Mosaic Company. ""These designations rightly recognize the strategic value of domestic phosphate and potash production, not just for farmers, but for the entire country."" According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the Department of the Interior's Critical Minerals List serves as a strategic tool to strengthen national mineral supply chains. It informs federal policy, investment priorities, and permitting processes aimed at enhancing economic resilience and national security.

Phosphate and potash underpin the nation's ability to produce food efficiently and sustainably. As essential nutrients in fertilizer, they support the crops that feed families, livestock, and industries across the country. A stable domestic supply helps protect America's food system from global market disruptions, so that U.S. agriculture, and by extension, the nation's economy and security, remain strong.

The decision to designate phosphate as a critical mineral also highlights the broader strategic value of its byproducts. Potash and phosphate are but two critical minerals present in Mosaic's fertilizer production. A production byproduct, phosphogypsum (PG), contains meaningful amounts of five rare earth elements (REEs) which also are critical minerals. All are critical to the nation's defense, energy, and technology sectors. Phosphate fertilizer production yields enough of these materials to serve as a meaningful domestic source in meeting U.S. demand.

Mosaic is supporting ongoing research into the responsible recovery of these materials from its byproducts. Rare earth elements are vital to technologies such as AI computing, electric vehicle batteries, missile guidance systems, and clean energy infrastructure, while uranium remains essential to clean nuclear power, a cornerstone of U.S. energy independence.

Potash and phosphate's designation as a critical mineral reinforces their role at the foundation of American agriculture and the industries that depend on it. From strengthening the nation's food supply chain to supporting emerging technologies, phosphate remains essential to both economic stability and national security, an area where Mosaic continues to lead through responsible production and innovation.

About The Mosaic Company

The Mosaic Company is one of the world's leading producers and marketers of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients. Through its Mosaic Biosciences platform, the company is also advancing the next generation biological solutions to help farmers improve nutrient use efficiency and crop performance sustainably.

Lessons from the field: Moving beyond money

Effective community benefit frameworks deliver more than financial compensation—they create lasting value by addressing local priorities and embracing innovative solutions.

Coordinated infrastructure

In Massachusetts, the Vineyard Wind project aligned its cable route with the Town of Barnstable’s planned sewer upgrades. The collaboration saved taxpayers an estimated $3 million, minimized construction impacts, and addressed water quality concerns through a Host Community Agreement.

Tribal co-ownership

The West of Devers Upgrade Project in California pioneered a co-ownership model with the Morongo Band of Mission Indians. By making the Tribe a transmission operator, the project upheld tribal sovereignty and avoided building a costly new line.

Reinvesting profits

California’s Sunrise Powerlink and Sycamore-Peñasquitos projects partnered with the nonprofit Citizens Energy, which invested in the transmission lines and reinvested profits into local clean energy initiatives, including a community solar program in Imperial Valley.

Conservation and mitigation

In the West, the Big Eddy-Knight (WA/OR) line funded conservation measures to avoid litigation. Similarly, a legal settlement for Mona-to-Oquirrh in Utah delivered a community-approved reroute and preserved 130 acres of hillside for permanent conservation and recreation.

Keys to future success

As the U.S. expands its next generation of transmission lines, these case studies make one thing clear: community benefit frameworks are essential. Success depends on three actions: engage communities early to prevent costly delays, look beyond money to create lasting local value, and stay flexible with creative financing and ownership that build broad support.

This seven-part series from the Rural News Network explores how industry, state governments and education systems are training this growing workforce.

From young ages, Joel Duncan and Haidyn Emerson were interested in how things work.

Duncan started small, familiarizing himself with the engines that power snowblowers, lawnmowers and four-wheelers. Working on a Shelby Cobra sports car kit at age 12 got him into bigger engines.

“That really cemented it as a cool thing to do,” he said of working on cars.

As a toddler, Emerson said, he liked taking things apart and putting them back together. “Ever since I was 3, I would take the door hinges off,” he said. “I’d take cardboard boxes and skateboards and make a wagon.”

Naturally, the two young men plan to work with their hands for a living. They’re enrolled in a college automotive services technology program to that end.

Unlike most of their predecessors, these aspiring repair technicians will enter the field with experience working on both electric and gas-powered vehicles.

The college, Minnesota State Community and Technical College in Moorhead, Minnesota, will embed electric vehicle courses into its curriculum starting this coming spring, a reflection of what an evolving automotive industry demands from its workforce.

M State Moorhead, as the college is known, developed the course after securing a grant from the National Science Foundation in 2022. Instructors have since been trained on the technology, readied two units for the 2026 semester debut and acquired vehicles and charging stations — one of which is available to the public outside the shop.

Other schools within the Minnesota State system — the larger of the state’s two higher education institutions (the other being the University of Minnesota), with seven universities and 26 state colleges — are offering similar units, leading the charge on EV technical education in Greater Minnesota.

The work is happening while the federal government’s support for renewable energy initiatives has gone from the fast lane to an off ramp. Compared with President Joe Biden’s embrace of clean energy investments, President Donald Trump has taken a more adversarial stance, saying that the elimination of EV incentives promotes “true consumer choice.”

Despite this political gear shift, M State’s funding is unaffected for now. Cindy Bailey, the grant coordinator for the college, said the prevailing trends show the automotive industry needs workers ready to work on electric vehicles.

“The fact of the matter is, whatever the political climate and landscape, people own electric vehicles and hybrid vehicles,” she said. “We owe it to our students to provide the most well-rounded training to make them competitive in the labor market.”

An industry jolt

Below a Dodge Durango SUV, a GMC Sierra pickup truck and other gas-powered vehicles elevated on lifts — so students like Duncan and Emerson can work on them — the college’s training space has newer, permanent additions, including a Chevy Bolt electric vehicle. Next spring, students will learn the ins and outs of electric vehicle safety and maintenance on the Bolt, bought with grant funding.

Clay County, where the campus is located, had a modest 244 electric vehicles on the roads as of July, according to data compiled by Atlas Public Policy. It’s likely that many more EVs are zipping around the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area.

Minnesotans own about 79,000 EVs. That accounts for only 1% of all vehicles, but state and national sales trends indicate acceleration. EV sales rose each year between 2015 and 2023, according to a Minnesota Department of Commerce report.

EV buy-in is most noticeable in the Twin Cities metro area, although four counties in Greater Minnesota have more than 1,000 in use. Olmsted County has the most in Greater Minnesota, with 2,200, followed by Wright, St. Louis and Stearns counties.

Minnesota is targeting a goal of 20% of registered vehicles being EVs by 2030, but a few speed bumps could keep the state from getting there. This year, the Trump administration ended tax credits for EV purchases and halted funding to build out a charging station network — two renewable energy initiatives approved during Biden’s term.

All this aside, EVs are undoubtedly becoming more common. More than 6% of all vehicle sales in Minnesota were EVs by 2023.

Having more EVs on the road without enough repair technicians to service them, however, wouldn’t do any good.

When a gas-powered vehicle goes kaput, owners have options. A dealership, an automotive center or maybe even a one-person shop could provide the right mix of affordability and trust when the inevitable breakdown occurs.

EV owners have options as well, but they are more scarce, particularly in rural areas, mostly limited to dealerships or specialized shops.

David Schulz, automotive instructor at M State, sees this changing in time.

“When something new comes out, the dealers are going to work on it first,” he said. “Then once it gets to a warranty, as soon as enough demand gets there you start seeing shops for it.”

Those shops will need technicians. A 36% increase in automotive service technicians and mechanics will be required to meet industry needs by 2030, according to projections by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Adapting to change

This is where Minnesota colleges fit into the equation, rolling out courses to familiarize the next generation of workers with electric vehicles.

Within Minnesota State’s system, Anoka Technical College started an automotive electronic diagnostic specialists program. Ridgewater College in Willmar folded EV maintenance into its programming. Minnesota State College Southeast in Winona introduces students to hybrid and electric vehicles using two vehicles and a charging station, a similar setup to what M State Moorhead will do.

Schulz grew up on a farm learning how to fix equipment before pursuing a career in automotive services. Fellow instructor Michael Rud, like Duncan, got into cars by working on a Shelby Cobra kit.

As educators, they’ve enjoyed learning about EVs in order to pass on lessons to students. Trade schools are teaching the electricians, plumbers and other workers of tomorrow, but Rud thinks few are changing as rapidly as automotive services.

“Diesel changes, too, but auto changes the most,” he said. “It’s pretty exciting. You’re constantly learning, and every day is different.”

What M State Moorhead staff learns while developing the courses may be shared with another institution in its system, Riverland College in Albert Lea. Riverland previously collaborated with M State Moorhead on autonomous vehicle technician coursework, also funded by a National Science Foundation grant.

Olle Gladso contributed to the curriculum’s development in Albert Lea before retiring last spring. He’s taken to electric vehicle technology, using a Ford Mustang Mach-E in his daily life.

EV growth, and an industry surrounding it, is inevitable, he said.

“Electric vehicles will continue to gain market share,” he said. “They’re simpler, they’re cheaper to maintain and they’re more reliable.”

Understanding how they work isn’t so simple. Technicians need to think differently about how to service EVs compared with gas-powered vehicles, Gladso said.

He gave the example of a window not rolling down. In an older vehicle, a mechanic needs to understand the mechanical components enabling a window to operate as intended in order to diagnose and fix it.

EV issues are more abstract, Gladso said. Mechanics may need to understand electrical systems to diagnose an issue. “For a technician to be successful today, they have to have a solid, and I mean very solid, understanding of electric concepts,” he said.

M State Moorhead’s two new units in spring 2026 will cover electric platforms and electric/hybrid technology. With electricity, safety is absolutely essential, Rud said.

“If they’re overconfident or not confident enough, both of those can cause problems,” he said.

Gladso used to show his students a picture of a house’s foundation to illustrate what’s most important in a unit. Learning to be safe around electric systems will be the foundation for the rest of the coursework, he said, as the voltage involved is dangerously high.

“When it’s an 800-volt circuit, you don’t have to touch it for it to kill,” he said. “Just get close enough and it’ll electrocute you.”

Talking after a class in October, Duncan and Emerson said they’re eager to learn. Both students are aware of the trends in their chosen field.

“That just seems where the trajectory is heading,” Duncan said of electric vehicles.

Outside of class, they’re working at dealerships. As is the industry norm, electric vehicles are sold there, so any hours put into electric vehicles on campus will come in handy after graduation. Someday, they said, they could see themselves opening their own shops.

Duncan said being able to fix electric vehicles would only give him a leg up in a competitive market. “I don’t want to set limitations for myself because I don’t have the knowledge to do something,” Duncan said.

Certain blue-collar jobs will always need workers, Gladso said. The rise of EVs has him feeling optimistic that automotive services will remain one of them.

“You’re always going to need somebody to fix your car,” he said.",https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RNN-EV-Programs-102825-es_5.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 16:11:03.876189

This story was originally published November 10, 2025 at 8:51 AM.","Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized the Trump administration Monday for “doing everything to put America in reverse” and trying “to vandalize California’s leadership” on climate, warning that the country risks losing its competitive edge in the clean energy economy.

The remarks came during his trip to Brazil, where Gov. Gavin Newsom joined Milken Institute CEO Richard Ditizio in Sao Paulo, speaking out as California fights a legal battle with the federal government over its right to enforce its own clean air and climate rules.

Newsom left California on Friday afternoon to participate in COP30, a United Nations climate conference taking place in Belém, Brazil, where world leaders, governors and investors are gathering to discuss strategies for accelerating the global clean energy transition.

The California governor has promoted his trip as a stark contrast to the Trump administration’s approach to energy policy, which embraces the “drill, baby, drill” slogan and seeks to expand fossil fuel production — including efforts by the president to block California’s authority under the Clean Air Act to set its own vehicle emission standards.

When asked why climate action has been slow to gain broader public and political support, and how to better communicate its economic benefits, Newsom connected the challenge to the lack of federal leadership, warning that the United States risks falling behind other countries in the clean energy economy.

“China gets it,” he said. “America is toast competitively, if we don’t wake up to what the hell they’re doing in this space — on supply chains, how they’re dominating manufacturing, how they’re flooding the zone here, EU, elsewhere, Africa.”

Asserting that California’s landmark green initiatives were built on bipartisan efforts by previous administrations, Newsom said California has been a reliable partner in advancing climate and environmental policy.

“I cannot say that for the United States of America, particularly as it relates to the current occupant in the White House — quite the contrary — but the state of California has been a consistent partner for a half century and will continue to be for decades to come,” Newsom said

The Democratic governor said California has continued to thrive despite tensions with Washington, arguing that in the state, “we punch above our weight” in clean energy investment and innovation in sectors like renewable energy, electric vehicles, and battery storage.

Meanwhile, he also noted that the state is leading in emerging fields like artificial intelligence, which require significant amounts of energy and have drawn criticism from researchers for potentially driving up electricity demand and straining the country’s transition to clean energy.

“I am proud that California dominates in artificial intelligence as well. We have no peers,” he said, adding that he is mindful of the growing energy demands tied to innovation and entrepreneurship and citing California’s streamlined permitting and procurement reforms as evidence of the state’s leadership in balancing technological growth with sustainability.

The OBBB retained 100 percent bonus depreciation, a policy that once sparked a wave of spending.
Looking more broadly, cuts in the OBBB to programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will have state-level budget impacts.
“The customer base the ski industry enjoys tends to be resilient,” he added.
Any time I’ve stretched our business to pay for bigger capex projects, we’re generally very happy that we did.","When we first started reporting this story, the question seemed straightforward: What does the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) mean for ski area capital planning?

The bill includes provisions such as the continuation of 100 percent bonus depreciation, R&D deductions, permanent pass-through tax relief, and a new “pay-to-play” NEPA option. It also accelerates the phaseout of clean energy and EV incentives. On paper, these provisions appear likely to affect some ski area investment decisions.

But after talking with operators and industry voices around the country, a theme emerged: while the OBBB matters, the real influences on capital planning today are tariffs, inflation, and the high cost of borrowing.

What the Bill Gives and Takes Away

Tax policy. The OBBB retained 100 percent bonus depreciation, a policy that once sparked a wave of spending. “The first time around, it absolutely drove projects for us and for the industry,” recalled consultant and former Vail Resorts COO Chris Jarnot. “There were shovel-ready projects that maybe didn’t quite meet the ROI threshold, or that banks weren’t confident in at smaller areas, but when the math changed and you could deduct the capital upfront, that pushed a lot of them forward. It also created an impetus. Even if you hadn’t done the ROI work yet, this was the push to figure it out.”

That helped fuel what National Ski Areas Association (NSAA) government affairs consultant Grant Colvin called “a golden age of ski area infrastructure.”

Today, though, “The fact that it’s been extended doesn’t really change anything,” said Jarnot.

“Bonus depreciation continues a lot of the benefits that had been in place, so from that standpoint, that’s a positive,” added Bill Jensen, longtime industry leader and a partner at Sundance Resort, Utah. “I’m not sure that ski area owners make their capital decisions based on the depreciation schedule, but the policy does allow more dollars to remain in the business that can be utilized across the whole business.”

The bill also continued immediate research and development expensing and made permanent the 20 percent pass-through deduction.

“If industry investments slow,” said Jensen, “it won’t be the BBB, it will be the economy and the interest rate environment.”

“Pay-to-play” NEPA. Another notable change: OBBB’s “pay-to-play” NEPA provision. This allows project sponsors to “opt in” by paying 125 percent of the Forest Service’s costs to supervise NEPA reviews. Once the fee is paid, an environmental assessment must be issued within six months, and an environmental impact statement within one year of the notice of intent.

In a “Capitol Watch” report, NSAA director of public policy Geraldine Link cautioned that other statutory reviews, such as Section 106 cultural reviews or Endangered Species Act consultations, are not bound by these deadlines. Nor are forest plan amendments or objection processes.

That suggests the new provision may not deliver the clean timeline operators are hoping for.

“There’s an appreciation for trying to fast-track things, but the process right now is muddled, not simple and straightforward,” said Ski NH president Jessyca Keeler.

Jarnot heard a different take from his clients: “The tone of business friendliness going on is absolutely driving the Forest Service to put the pedal to the metal on some projects and move them forward.”

For SE Group senior environmental planning associate Scott Prior, the economics are straightforward. “When considered against the rising cost of infrastructure, materials, or simply not being able to get returns on a project for a longer amount of time, the increase in fees to complete NEPA review seem negligible,” he said. “I would expect that most ski resorts would happily pay additional fees on the permitting process to save on other costs down the road.”

Clean energy and EV incentives. The OBBB speeds up the phaseout of clean energy and EV credits, rolling them back years earlier than the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act envisioned.

For Powdr, the rollback won’t stop clean energy investment but will change the math. “Powdr and our resorts will continue to facilitate EV charging, regardless of incentives,” said VP of sustainability Raj Basi. “We’ve used the 30 percent investment tax credit, including on a project that’s nearing completion, and we’ve tapped state incentives for other projects. But the competitive space is shifting—Blink declared bankruptcy, LG left the charger market—and that attrition almost certainly means higher prices for materials and labor.

“We’ll keep prioritizing alternative energy and EVs,” he added, “but the ROI is going to look different going forward. » Current projects aren’t affected, but it will impact how we analyze future projects and potentially their scale.”

For Ski Vermont president Molly Mahar, the bigger concern is consumer behavior. “The rollback of fleet credits will mean that it may not be as easy for our ski areas to adopt EV technology in their fleets, but the bigger impact is on the travel corridor infrastructure and consumer EV adoption,” she said.

Lost funding. “New Hampshire is an EV desert, especially in the northern and western regions where we rely on tourism,” said Keeler, elaborating on the same concern. “We worked with the state’s Department of Transportation and Department of Environmental Services last fall to include several ski areas, and more than 30 businesses in all, in a $15 million Charging and Fueling Infrastructure community grant proposal that would have covered about 80 percent of the cost of installing level 2 chargers at these businesses around the state. It was approved by the Biden administration in early January and then pulled by the Trump administration just a few weeks later.

“Any funding or policies to encourage EV charging installations are important to New Hampshire,” she continued, “because we’ve estimated the state could lose $1.4 billion in tourism by 2031 if EV drivers simply stop coming because there’s no charging infrastructure.”

State budgets. Looking more broadly, cuts in the OBBB to programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will have state-level budget impacts. “It’s still early to tell how the state budget is going to work out or if we’ll have a gap in funding,” Mahar said. “If there’s a gap, the money has to come from somewhere—maybe higher business or homeowner taxes, or fewer services.”

The state-level uncertainty may move businesses toward caution rather than bullishness, as they wait to see how things will shake out.

Beyond the Bill

Tariffs and inflation. The major destabilizers right now continue to be tariffs and inflation. “Unpredictability is definitely causing heartburn,” said Keeler. “Tariffs are driving up costs of construction, where even a two percent increase is painful; this is much higher. Everyone is affected.”

“A contact told me the cost of an average ski lift has increased 40 percent since Covid,” said resort adviser and analyst Tom Lithgow.

Rick Schmitz, co-owner of Little Switzerland, Crystal Ridge, and Nordic Mountain in Wisconsin, has felt the increase firsthand. “Fixed-grip lifts have doubled in price in the last ten years, a much faster rate than inflation.

“The price of ski area infrastructure has increased astronomically in the last five years, and I don’t think it’s going to slow down,” he continued. “Even if the economy or tariffs improve, prices generally don’t come back down.”

Jensen sees a likely outcome: “Whether it’s lifts or snowcats or snowmaking, equipment will be subject to tariffs. Manufacturers might try to absorb some of it, but more and more businesses are passing that cost on to the end user.”

Implications for the guests. “The industry has always been very sensitive about pricing,” said Jensen. “But with tariffs and inflationary pressure, it’s that much more challenging to figure out an operating plan that meets everybody’s needs without pushing too much onto the guest.

“The customer base the ski industry enjoys tends to be resilient,” he added. “Even in economic downturns, the impact on the ski industry has been modest. But as pricing increases, and the cost of skiing increases, are people deciding to take a pass for a year or two or spend less money on winter recreation?”

The cost of money. Another cost driver: “It’s really hard to get financing for big projects right now,” said Jensen. “Lenders have become very conservative. The cost of money to them is higher, so it gets passed on to you.”

“Many of the institutional lenders have backed out of the industry,” Lithgow agreed. “Finding the money is the challenge.

“For the big guys, it’s happy days,” he added. “The Alterras and Vails of the world fill up the lift manufacturers’ queue every year. Smaller operators don’t have the same access to capital, so they’re left behind.”

That limited access is not new, of course. “It’s been harder to access capital for the last 15 years,” said Lithgow. “After the 2008 collapse, institutional lenders pulled back and businesses had to keep bigger cash reserves. A lot of operators turned to local banks for bigger projects, but overall capital availability shrank.”

The Fed cut rates a quarter percentage point in September and has signaled support for additional cuts, which could help. “The federal interest rate cut will help make accessing funds a little more affordable,” Mahar said. “There’s a lot going on right now, so it’s still early to know the full impact.”

Pushing ahead. For Schmitz, who tries to self-fund as much as possible, the lesson is clear: “Waiting to do capex projects is not going to pay off. Three years from now we may not do something because we can’t afford it. Any time I’ve stretched our business to pay for bigger capex projects, we’re generally very happy that we did. We always look back and say, ‘why didn’t we do it sooner?’

“We just finished a two-million-dollar lodge at Nordic that we’d been saving for over five years,” continued Schmitz. “If I had built it three or four years ago, it would have cost 25 percent less and I could have secured a two percent loan instead of today’s much higher rates. But I don’t want to look back three years from now and wish I’d done it.”

To that end, he’s also borrowing money for two new chairlifts, “because we need them,” he said.

Despite high costs and uncertainty, hitting the pause button isn’t much of an option. “The reality is every resort has a business plan and capital investment is always part of it,” Jensen said. “You don’t buy a chairlift you don’t need.”

On the upside, akin to dealing with the fluctuations of winter weather: “Our industry is really good at tolerating uncertainty and managing through it,” Jarnot noted.",https://www.saminfo.com/images/issues/Nov._25/Reconciliation_Nov_25.png,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:02.250839

Negotiators from nearly 200 countries have gathered in Belém, Brazil, for the annual international climate change conference—known this year as COP30—in an effort to advance global climate solutions. University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability (SEAS) experts are available to comment.

CLIMATE ACTION

Jonathan Overpeck, professor and dean of the School for Environment and Sustainability, is an expert on climate and weather extremes, sea-level rise, and the impacts of climate change and options for dealing with it. He served as lead author on the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2007 and 2014 reports.

“COP30 needs to continue the acceleration of climate action globally in several important ways. The first is to be clear that the goal of global decarbonization is more important than ever, and that every country needs to increase efforts to transition to low-carbon energy. The second is to strengthen efforts by wealthy countries who have contributed the most to climate change to help low- and middle-income countries decarbonize their energy systems and mobility. And the third is for wealthy countries to increase their ‘loss and damage’ funding to help low- and middle-income countries recover from the increasing rate of disasters due to the global climate change they did little to cause.

“Despite a new fossil fuel-friendly administration, the U.S. continues to deploy low-carbon energy and mobility solutions. These solutions are becoming more affordable and less polluting than fossil fuels everywhere around the globe, and COP30 needs to make it clear that the nations of the world are committed to halting climate change and helping those who need assistance. Climate action must continue to accelerate even more starting with COP30.”

Greg Keoleian is a professor of environment and sustainability and co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems and of MI Hydrogen, U-M’s hydrogen initiative. He develops life-cycle models to analyze decarbonization pathways and accelerate sustainability solutions for clean energy transitions, alternative vehicle technologies, buildings and infrastructure, and food systems.

“Lack of participation by high-level officials from the White House is irresponsible and represents a major setback for COP30 and climate action. Climate change is a global threat and requires international cooperation and trust. The Trump administration withdrew from the Paris Agreement and has attacked multiple policies that curb climate pollution. Deeply rooted in the president’s false declaration that ‘climate change is a hoax,’ there has been a major assault on science-based policy and climate action. Challenges to the Endangerment Finding, termination of EV tax credits and stoppage of offshore wind farm developments highlight just a few examples.

“Despite the White House’s alarming actions, industry, state and local governments, NGOs, communities and individual households are continuing to play a vital role in implementing solutions to curb climate pollution. These stakeholders are continuing to stand up for climate along with the other national governments committed to COP30.”

Kai Zhu, associate professor of environment and sustainability, examines the ecological responses to climate change, with a particular focus on biodiversity. His recent study highlights the rapid shifts in grassland communities driven by climate change, offering crucial insights for restoration strategies and conservation efforts in these ecosystems.

“This past year, we have witnessed record-breaking heatwaves, wildfires and floods, which highlight that climate change is not a distant threat but a present-day crisis. To tackle these escalating impacts, we must urgently focus on both mitigation (reducing emissions and conserving carbon-storing ecosystems) and adaptation (supporting communities and biodiversity in adjusting to rapidly changing conditions). Scientific evidence demonstrates that healthy, resilient ecosystems play a crucial role in both strategies. It is more important than ever to invest in solutions that protect both nature and people, ensuring a sustainable future as climate risks intensify.”

Mike Shriberg, professor of practice and engagement in environment and sustainability, directs the U-M Water Center. He is an expert on environmental policy and planning, with a focus on the intersection of water and climate issues.

“The way many people in the region and around the world are experiencing the impact of climate change is through changes in water access, availability and variability. Our water cycle is changing rapidly, leading to increasing flooding, drought and other forms of extreme weather. The impacts for people, communities and wildlife are extreme.

“The COP process represents our best chance to turn the tide globally and to head off the increasingly severe water-based impacts of climate change. While we can’t stop the changes already taking place and those already destined to happen due to current emissions, we can lower the consequences and move toward a more resilient and equitable future through making and following through on global commitments to reduce pollution and fund adaptive measures.”

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

Tony Reames, associate professor of environment and sustainability, founded the Urban Energy Justice Lab and the Energy Equity Project and currently serves as director of the U-M SEAS Detroit Sustainability Clinic. His research centers on advancing fair and equitable access to affordable, reliable and clean energy, and on examining the root causes and persistence of energy disparities across race, income and geography. Prior to joining U-M, he was a presidential appointee in the Biden administration, serving in several senior roles within the U.S. Department of Energy, including deputy director for energy justice.

“The hope for climate and environmental justice activists and advocates is that COP30 becomes a real opportunity to translate pledges into real action. COP30 appears to be making climate and environmental justice central themes, focusing on community-led adaptation, increased financing, the protection of environmental defenders, and greater inclusion and participation of marginalized communities, Indigenous peoples and civil society in climate negotiations and decision-making.

“The Justice and Human Rights thematic day at COP will continue the growing emphasis on integrating justice and human rights into climate action discussions. Although the U.S. government has pulled back from climate action and environmental justice under the Trump administration, these issues maintain salience on the global stage. Despite this shift in federal posture, the hundreds of state and local leaders and other attendees representing the U.S. will highlight that many Americans and decision-makers remain committed to climate and environmental justice aligned policies.”

Regulators in Kansas and Michigan approved large load tariffs on Thursday that set rules for Evergy Kansas and Consumers Energy, respectively, to connect data centers and other energy-intensive customers to the grid.

At the same time, lawmakers in Delaware — part of the PJM Interconnection — are considering legislation that would require large loads to get permission from the Delaware Public Service Commission to connect to the grid.

In part, the new rules in Kansas and Michigan and the legislation in Delaware aim to ensure that existing utility customers don’t pay costs related to interconnecting large loads.

The moves come as PJM is considering rules for interconnecting data centers and other large loads, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is beginning a rulemaking process that could lead to requirements for connecting to the federally regulated transmission system.

Kansas regulators OK Evergy rules

On Thursday, the Kansas Corporation Commission approved a settlement agreement between Evergy’s Kansas utilities, the Data Center Coalition, the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Google and other groups. The agreement establishes a large load “power service rate plan” for new facilities over 75 MW.

Evergy was working with more than 20 potential large load data center and manufacturing customers totaling more than 6 GW of demand, according to the company’s mid-February application with the KCC. Across its service territory in Kansas and Missouri, Evergy has a roughly 15 GW large load pipeline, including about 5 GW in advanced stages, according to an earnings presentation.

Under the large load rate plan, customers can start with up to five years of a rampup period, and then must take service for at least 12 years. Other provisions require customers to pay a minimum monthly bill based on 80% of contract demand, even if they use less than that. They must also pay for any transmission upgrades that are needed to serve their facilities.

KCC staff estimates that customers using the large load rate will pay 7% to 10% more than existing industrial customers, according to the commission’s order.

“On an annual power bill of $200 million, that extra 7-10% can significantly reduce costs that would otherwise be borne by the rest of Evergy’s customers,” the KCC said.

The agreement also includes four options for large load customers to access clean energy.

“This settlement ensures that large energy users share responsibility for the infrastructure they require while also creating new opportunities to move the grid toward clean, renewable energy,” said Sarah Rubenstein, an attorney with Great Rivers Environmental Law Center, which represented the Sierra Club.

Michigan PSC approves Consumers’ rules

Meanwhile, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved Consumers Energy’s proposal to set rules for new data centers and other loads larger than 100 MW.

The new rules set a 15-year minimum contract term, require customers to pay 80% of their expected monthly demand, regardless of how much they use, and a ramp-up period of up to five years to reach full service levels, among other things.

The PSC required Consumers Energy to show that costs caused by each new large load user are not being subsidized by other customers.

In approving the rules, the PSC said it aimed to ensure that large load customers “fully pay for the costs needed to serve them, and that there are adequate guardrails in place to avoid both cross-subsidization from other customers and the risk of stranded assets should the anticipated load fail to fully materialize.”

Consumers Energy has a 9-GW pipeline of potential data center, semiconductor and manufacturing projects, including about 4 GW to 5 GW in “advanced” discussions and 1 GW to 2 GW in “final” stages, the utility’s parent company, CMS Energy, said in a Friday investor presentation.

Delaware lawmakers eye large load rules

In Delaware, lawmakers are considering a bill — S.B. 205 — that would require the Delaware PSC to issue a “certificate to operate” for new loads larger than 30 MW that interconnect with the transmission system. The bill gives the PSC the authority to require new loads to procure generation to meet their needs and to make financial commitments to cover their transmission costs.

Lawmakers could begin reviewing the bill when the Delaware General Assembly convenes in January.

It is unclear how the bill could interact with FERC’s rulemaking to consider a U.S. Department of Energy proposal that would set rules for interconnecting large loads to the transmission system.

It’s clear to everyone Texas Tech isn’t just the favorite to win the Big 12, it’s a team situated from a talent perspective to win games in January.
What the Big 12 actually needs is a team to win deep into the CFP and earn some national respect.
Penn State: While watching Penn State give Indiana everything it could handle, I couldn’t help but think about James Franklin.
UConn has more wins over ACC teams (3) than Florida State (2) the last two seasons.","A lot happens on college football Saturdays. It’s hard to keep up with everything.

So this season, in an attempt to bring everybody up to speed — while taking a chance to provide you with some takes in the process — I’m going to rattle off over-arching thoughts from the previous weekend. I’ll also do my best to spring thoughts forward, not just tell you what already happened.

Let’s keep it going with the latest edition of Unfiltered Takes.

1. Texas Tech: The Red Raiders played a huge game against a previously undefeated BYU team Saturday. The Cougars didn’t have a chance. Texas Tech’s defense smothered them in a 29-7 win, making it feel like there were two classes of teams on the field in Lubbock. In reality, that’s what it is. Texas Tech is far and away more talented than anyone else in the conference, and it got this way because a booster invested in the roster this offseason as if it were an SEC school. That booster, oil tycoon Cody Campbell, has gotten what he paid for. It’s clear to everyone Texas Tech isn’t just the favorite to win the Big 12, it’s a team situated from a talent perspective to win games in January.

2. The Big 12: If Texas Tech wins the Big 12 — and it seems very likely that’s what’s coming — this will be a one-bid league. But I was thinking about what commissioner Brett Yormark said at conference media days in the summer. He said he wanted a few teams to be consistently good, to separate from the pack and be respected as legit national contenders. It was almost like he was challenging the conference to replace Texas and Oklahoma by promoting from within. That sounded crazy at the time, but maybe it’s happening with Tech? Maybe Tech’s success will prompt other wealthy boosters at rival Big 12 schools to replicate what Campbell is doing? What the Big 12 actually needs is a team to win deep into the CFP and earn some national respect. It has to prove it isn’t a second-class citizen. Texas Tech, truly, has a chance to do that this season.

3. Indiana: Indiana has made blowouts so common the past two years, it felt easy deciding to lay more than 20 points on the road at Penn State. Perhaps it was too easy. The Hoosiers, who have played two close games all season, found themselves on the ropes in State College. Down by four in the game’s final minutes, the Hoosiers marched down the field and scored a thrilling go-ahead touchdown to steal the game. Penn State has been an absolute train wreck this year, so many viewed that game as the Hoosiers proving their mortality. It gave people reason to doubt Curt Cignetti‘s team again. For me, I found it to be quite impressive. Penn State, though a failure this year, has a lot of NFL players on its roster and Indiana found a way to win a game in a tough environment on the road. That should help the Hoosiers in the College Football Playoff. Every game can’t be a blowout, and I find it amusing people are ready to jump off the Indiana bandwagon the second it plays a close game. Everybody plays close games.

4. Fernando Mendoza: Was that quarterback Fernando Mendoza‘s Heisman moment? Funny enough, he was the second-most impressive player on the game-winning touchdown play. Indiana receiver Omar Cooper had the catch of the year on that game-winning grab. But people love resilient quarterbacks, ones who rise up and get wins when things are going poorly. Mendoza has been climbing up the NFL Draft mock boards during the last month, but it felt like that moment at Penn State — with the entire country watching — was when he took a step into college football stardom. He should be the favorite to win the Heisman right now.

5. Penn State: While watching Penn State give Indiana everything it could handle, I couldn’t help but think about James Franklin. How did it get so dire? How did things fall apart so quickly for one of the nation’s most consistent programs? It felt like losing to Oregon at home in overtime completely broke him. That didn’t need to be the case. This is still a team that has the second-most NFL talent of any Big Ten roster. Nick Singleton, who scored three touchdowns against Indiana, is so good. This is the era where losing one or two games in the regular season doesn’t crush your hopes. Even if Penn State would have stayed together, beaten UCLA and Northwestern and even lost to Ohio State, it absolutely could have beaten Indiana and gone to the CFP. This team was always going to be judged by what it did in the postseason, anyway. The roster tapped out a month too early, which is the reason Franklin is currently unemployed. It’s a shame what happened to this team. It had so much promise.

6. Oregon: Since Oregon lost by 10 at home to Indiana a month ago, the Ducks have fallen out of the national conversation. Maybe part of that was because it took overtime to beat Penn State, a team most don’t view as capable. However, Dante Moore led the Ducks on a game-winning drive after being dragged into Iowa hell. Moore had a 24-yard strike to receiver Malik Benson down the sideline in pourous conditions to set up a game-winning field goal. That Moore throw may have been as impressive of a “Heisman moment” as the one Mendoza had hours earlier. Oregon is walking in the shadows because it hasn’t really beaten up teams this year, but this Ducks team is every bit of a national title contender as a Georgia or Ole Miss.

7. Georgia: Georgia came into the weekend having won three games in a row it could have lost. It has made it easy to doubt this Bulldogs team, one that seems susceptible to losing again. That’s why Mississippi State was a trendy pick this week to keep things close in Starkville. Nope. Georgia absolutely demolished a much-improved Bulldogs team, showing the world that even if this team isn’t as dominant as some of the past Kirby Smart teams, it’s still very much a legit national title contender. There is so much football still left to be played, but it was a reminder that it’s hard to get rich doubting Georgia. Is the defense good enough to win it all?

8. Texas: I moved Texas back into my top 10 this week after the Longhorns won four in a row, two of which over teams ranked in the top 10 at the time. What is Texas? Is it a team with a bad offensive line that has masked that overt deficiency during the last month? Or is this a loaded roster finding itself at the right time and is very much alive in the SEC and national title races? Quarterback Arch Manning, who some were labeling a bust four weeks ago, has thrown for more than 300 yards and three touchdowns in consecutive games. Is he arriving right before our eyes? Thankfully, Texas is going to Georgia on Saturday for what should be the SEC showdown we were all anticipating this offseason. That’s going to be a game that provides a ton of context as the postseason picture continues to crystalize.

9. The ACC: Saturday didn’t feel like a dramatic day, but the ACC caught on fire. No. 14 Virginia lost to Wake Forest after quarterback Chandler Morris left the game in the second quarter. Around the same time, Cal finished a thrilling overtime win over No. 15 Louisville. Down by three in OT, Cal went for it on fourth-and-goal from the 3. Cal freshman quarterback Jaron-Keawe Sagapolutele hit receiver Jacob De Jesus on a little rub route for the score, closing a 29-26 win. Now the ACC standings feature five random teams with only one loss in conference play. None of those five teams are Miami, Florida State or Clemson. What a bizarre year.

10. Mike Norvell: There was a moment during Florida State‘s 24-10 loss to Clemson when the broadcast zoomed in on Seminoles head coach Mike Norvell. The man had a blank stare on his face, almost as if he were reflecting on how things got so bad so quickly. There are obviously going to be rumors every week from now until the end of the season about him being fired. Rightfully so. How much worse can it get? This feels like rock bottom. And while moving on from him is going to be expensive, we’re getting to the point where the Seminoles just don’t have a choice. This isn’t a competitive football team.

11. Miami: Miami beat Syracuse 38-10 on Saturday and Hurricanes fans were sitting on the edges of their seats watching ACC leaders lose to underdogs. Though you’d need a mathematician to try to figure out ACC tiebreakers, Miami is dreaming of situations where it can backdoor its way to Charlotte. Here’s the thing: I actually think 10-2 Miami is an at-large team in the CFP, regardless of whether it wins or even plays for the ACC title. Last year, 10-2 Miami was left out. But this year’s team has something valuable last year’s team didn’t posses: a top-10 win. Miami still has to win out, which may feel like a tough proposition, but I believe the Hurricanes are in a good spot for CFP contention still.

12. Duke: Duke is 5-4, but is one of the five teams who only have one loss in ACC play. That’s what happens when you lose three nonconference games. What if Duke wins the ACC? What if a four-loss team is the ACC champ? The Blue Devils still have to beat Virginia, North Carolina and Wake Forest and whoever it faces in a hypothetical matchup in Charlotte. But if Duke does it, will the CFP Committee automatically take Duke or does that open the door for two Group of 5 conference champions instead? Could we see a CFP without the ACC champion but Miami as an at large? Wild times.

13. The American: Friday night was a pivotal game in the America race. Tulane played at Memphis and the Tigers, who faced a 21-point deficit at the beginning of the fourth quarter, had the ball down six multiple times late in the game. Memphis ultimately couldn’t complete the comeback — like the one it pulled off against USF — and Tulane escaped with the win. The American is situated like the ACC at the top of the standings, with five teams having one loss. Those five teams are Navy, South Florida, Tulane, North Texas and East Carolina. The winner of that conference will make the CFP.

14. Jim Mora: Want to hear a wild stat that was floating around social media Saturday? UConn has more wins over ACC teams (3) than Florida State (2) the last two seasons. That isn’t just piling on Norvell more. It’s a way to compliment UConn coach Jim Mora, who led the Huskies to a win over Duke on Saturday. UConn was 10-50 the previous five seasons before Mora took over in 2022, a laughingstock of a program. Now the Huskies, 7-3, are 25-23 under Mora’s leadership. Does that turnaround get the former UCLA head coach some looks during the coaching carousel? What he has done there is tremendous and it’s time we start showing appreciation of a job well done.

15. USC: Guess who is still alive in the CFP race? Lincoln Riley‘s USC. After beating Northwestern 38-17 on Friday night, the Trojans improved to 7-2. They have three games left in its regular season — Iowa, Oregon and UCLA. If USC wins all three of those games — which certainly doesn’t feel impossible with Jayden Maiava, Ja’Kobi Lane and Makai Lemon hitting on all cylinders — it could be a legit CFP at-large selection. If USC beats Iowa next weekend (which isn’t easy), we’re going to get a vintage Pac-12 brawl between the Trojans and Oregon. Who doesn’t love West Coast nostalgia?

16. USC’s fake punt: Early in the second quarter of USC’s win Friday, the Trojans faced a fourth-and-6 from their own 46-yard line. The punter, wearing No. 80, threw a dart to receiver Tanook Hines for a 10-yard completion and first down. Guess what? The player wearing No. 80 was backup quarterback Sam Huard, who swapped his jersey with the punter and went into the game. USC doesn’t have name plates on the back of its jerseys. The Big Ten ruled Sunday that there should have been a penalty when the real punter came into the game later. The whole thing felt sleazy to me.

17. Notre Dame: USC winning games is good for Notre Dame, as the Trojans are still the Irish’s best win. Notre Dame blew out Navy on Saturday to improve to 7-2. After dropping its first two games of the season, it has won seven in a row and now has matchups with Pitt, Syracuse and Stanford on deck. Though playing Pitt on the road may be tricky, it seems likely the Irish will finish 10-2. Though I was confused by their No. 10 ranking Tuesday evening, it seems like all but a certainty the Irish will get into the field as long as they dont lose another one. USC winning is helping, too.

18. Wisconsin: Wisconsin AD Chris McIntosh announced Thursday Badgers coach Luke Fickell will return in 2026, which is kind of surprising given how much of a dumpster fire the program has been under his leadership. But if Fickell wasn’t given the proper resources to compete, which McIntosh acknowledged, maybe the program’s regression isn’t Fickell’s fault? Funny enough, two days later, Wisconsin beat Washington at home, 13-10, despite being down to its fourth quarterback of the season. That was an emotional win for a Badgers team and staff that haven’t gotten to enjoy much the last few years.

19. Luke Fickell: The most confusing thing about Fickell’s leadership of the Wisconsin program is how few good players he has brought in. He hasn’t done a good enough job recruiting the legacy Wisconsin offensive linemen and he certainly hasn’t done a good enough job signing elite-level skill positon players to improve this team’s explosiveness. Regardless of whether you’re for or against Fickell’s retention, I think we’ll know whether it was his fault or not after the portal season.

Over the period between April and September, power output from hydro, nuclear, wind, and solar installations accounted for 31.3% of the total, up from 27.1% a year earlier. Of that, large hydropower plants booked a 13.2% increase in generation, while the rest of the low-carbon capacity, excluding nuclear, posted an increase of 23.4%, the data showed. Nuclear power output booked a decline of 3.7% on the year.

The report noted that India’s installed capacity of non-hydrocarbon generation sources had topped 250 GW, which is half of the planned 500 GW in total by 2030. Of that, 127 GW was solar capacity and 53 GW was wind capacity.

India has significant ambitions in non-hydrocarbon generation, but a recent update to power market rules may interfere with developers’ plans. The changes concern mandates for power supply deliveries to the grid, essentially obliging wind and solar operators to supply exactly as much as they say they would supply, as do conventional power generators.

This prompted a reaction from the wind power industry, Reuters reported earlier this month, with executives warning this could hurt their bottom lines since their output depends on the weather and cannot be changed at will. The same is true of solar installations.

Earlier this month, the chairman of the Central Electricity Authority warned that the surge in wind and solar installations was leading to soaring transmission costs as the country's transmission network is being built on estimates of potential renewable power generation, not on actual capacity or demand.

India was struggling to accommodate the massive wind and solar capacity buildout, which could lead to developers installing renewable energy generation capacity that cannot be transmitted or sold, Ghanshyam Prasad explained, adding that the country needed to continue investing in baseload generation capacity as well in order to maintain grid stability.

By dismantling agencies and budgets, it undermines the US’s capacity to anticipate, mitigate and adapt to the climate crisis. There is no way to put a positive spin on it. A future Democratic administration will need consecutive terms in office to reverse the carnage. Paul Hockenos reports.

In less than 100 days, the cuts and closures reversed just about all of the Biden administration climate and renewable energy measures, as well as much of the environmental bulwark established by previous Republican and Democratic governments. This is a structural shift away from federal leadership in renewables buildout, climate science, adaptation, conservation, and regulation. The blitzkrieg heaps doubt on hard climate science and bets everything on the expansion of fossil fuel and nuclear energy as the way forward. They, not renewables, are boosted with federal lands and hundreds of millions in subsidies.

‘Through executive orders, agency memos and other policy moves,’ reports The Guardian, ‘the Trump administration has deleted a swath of Joe Biden-era green policies, frozen climate spending, removed the US from the Paris climate accords, and set about rewriting pollution standards for cars, trucks, and power plants.’

In the administration’s first hundred days, it took 145 actions against environmental laws. ‘The deregulatory ambition of this administration is mind-blowing. This is the most anti-environmental administration that our country and perhaps the world has ever seen,’ said longtime environmentalist and author Bill McKibben. The Trump administration’s budget law – the so-called ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ – is, according to a Heinrich Böll Stiftung report, a back door to implementing major portions of the MAGA agenda. It could become one of the most destructive, anti-climate, anti-poor and anti-working-class pieces of legislation in US history, it concludes.

Renewables

The solar, wind and grid-integration programmes that the Biden administration put into law are being zeroed out or dramatically reduced. The current budget eliminates tax incentives for solar, wind, battery storage and other clean energy technologies. These incentives, created under Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), were a driving force behind the rapid expansion of the clean tech sector in the US – in Republican states as well as Democratic. ‘The bill repeals several landmark consumer incentives from the IRA, such as the 7,500 US dollar federal electric vehicle tax credit, and subsidies for residential solar and heat pump installation,’ according to the Böll report.

Climate science

At the United Nations General Assembly in September 2025, Trump blasted climate science as the ‘greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world’ and claimed that ‘stupid people’ forged the scientific consensus on global warming. As it trashes climate science as a ‘hoax’, the government is slashing a third of the budget of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the scientific and regulatory agency charged with forecasting weather, and monitoring oceanic and atmospheric conditions. Climate research programmes are being terminated. Although the administration wants to eliminate NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the bill is currently in Congress, where it is facing fightback from both parties.

Moreover, the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Programme, ‘the country’s most comprehensive way to track the heat-trapping greenhouse gases that are dangerously warming the planet’ (according to the New York Times) has also been terminated.

The Trump administration has also purged government websites. It has removed the term ‘climate change’ and deleted webpages about climate impacts. Mandated scientific reports have been pulled from publication.

Climate adaptation

And then there’s the elimination or scaling back of programmes that help communities prepare and respond to climate-related disasters. Programmes that help coastal communities adapt to rising seas and increased storms are on the chopping block, as are the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA) programmes for disaster preparedness and recovery, and the construction of resilient infrastructure, such as storm-proofing of schools, hospitals and police stations. The Office of Community Planning and Development, which handles disaster recovery, is losing over three-quarters of its staff. Moreover, cuts to water infrastructure and clean water revolving funds reduce the capacity for municipalities to prepare for and respond to climate‐driven changes, such as more extreme precipitation and flooding.

Regulation

The rollbacks and evisceration of regulation fall squarely within the administration’s pledges to give business and industry much greater leeway to seek profit. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), for example, has proposed to repeal findings that establish that greenhouse gases like CO₂ endanger public health and welfare. This is the legal foundation under the Clean Air Act for many climate and emissions regulations. Reversing it would remove or weaken the EPA’s authority to regulate emissions from power plants, vehicles and landfills. The administration is also targeting rules limiting tailpipe emissions and other vehicle standards that were intended to push automakers toward more electric vehicles or stricter efficiency.

In September, the New York Times reported that the EPA will no longer hold thousands of polluting facilities responsible to report the heat-trapping greenhouse gases that their facilities emit. The EPA proposal, writes the New York Times, ‘would end requirements for thousands of coal-burning power plants, oil refineries, steel mills and other industrial facilities across the country’. The government has been collecting this data since 2010, and it is a key tool to track carbon dioxide, methane and other gases that are driving climate change.

Contrary to the dire warnings of economists, the president thinks he can revive the coal and oil industries with grants of over USD 600 million and the opening of over 13 million acres of federal land for coal mining.

Neither the opposition Democrats nor non-governmental institutions in the US have been able to slow the Trump juggernaut on climate. The best hope for a perch to do so is the US midterms on 3 November 2026, when the Democrats will have the chance to flip both the House and the Senate. Thus far, however, the restoration of climate protection has not been prominent on its banners.

The path forward is clear: creating a clear, predictable regulatory environment enables a future where Texas energy can fuel American progress.","By Ed Longanecker

In a new directive from U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will initiate rulemaking procedures to address the interconnection of large loads to the transmission system in a “timely, orderly and non-discriminatory manner.”

In his letter, Wright affirms the Administration’s commitment to revitalizing domestic manufacturing and driving American AI innovation, both of which will require “unprecedented and extraordinary quantities of electricity…”

To meet that level of demand, affordable, reliable, and dispatchable fuels like natural gas will be the backbone of AI deployment. Natural gas generation can ramp up quickly to handle the fluctuating demands of data centers, where even brief interruptions could corrupt massive AI training runs or halt real-time inferences. This on-demand flexibility sets it apart from variable other energy sources, providing the steady, 24/7 baseload power that AI infrastructure relies on.

Without natural gas, the rapid scaling of artificial intelligence could stall, handing advantages to global competitors. Texas’ leadership in natural gas production positions the state as the ideal supplier for this surge, ensuring American technologies stay ahead with energy that’s deployable and resilient.

Texas and the Permian have been leaders in meeting energy demand over the past twenty years and will continue to be critical in meeting this new era of economic growth. In a recent Energy Outlook, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported that both natural gas output and demand would hit record highs in 2025 as a result of strong domestic consumption and increased LNG exports

Data centers running large language models and training neural networks require high volumes of power. A single hyperscale facility can draw as much power as a small city – in fact, a large data center load like the one Secretary Wright references in his letter is equal to about to 20 megawatts (MW), the same amount of electric power consumed by 16,500 U.S. homes. Multiply that by the dozens of new centers tech giants’ plans to build amid the AI race, and the grid faces a historic test.

Texas is able to meet that demand, pumping more oil and natural gas than any other state, producing approximately 28% of the nation’s natural gas (over 12.7 trillion cubic feet in 2024 alone), with 2025 outputs climbing even higher, some reaching up to 36.9 billion cubic feet per day in recent months.

Month after month, the Permian Basin and Eagle Ford Shale churn out the fuel that light homes, power factories, and now stand ready to feed the ravenous appetite of AI.

Delivering that amount of energy also requires an efficient and predictable permitting process that supports the construction of new natural gas power plants, transmission lines and pipelines with sufficient capacity. Texas has been successful in getting new projects, like the Matterhorn pipeline, built and online in recent years, but greater predictability is still needed on the federal level.

Innovations in the Lone Star State like Project Horizon, a data center in West Texas that is right next to a natural gas production and processing facility, are setting an example for what an efficient and predictable permitting process could deliver across the country.

Secretary Wright and FERC, through its powers enacted by Congress, have the ability to create new standards that will bring efficiency and predictability to the process, allowing for the quick and necessary construction of critical energy infrastructure.

As Texas continues to lead the way in energy production, these regulatory improvements will ensure that our state’s formidable natural gas resources will continue to power innovation while delivering economic benefits. The path forward is clear: creating a clear, predictable regulatory environment enables a future where Texas energy can fuel American progress.

Today, COP30 is bringing together in Belém, Brazil, from 10 to 21 November 2025, the various actors of climate governance in a tense geopolitical context, marked by the rise of anti-environmental populism and the erosion of multilateralism. At this point of stocktaking, the aim is less to oppose successes and failures than to assess the capacity of the international system to mobilise in the face of the climate emergency.

A discussion with Mathilde Jourde, researcher at IRIS, head of the Climate, Environment and Security Programme.

What is the retrospective since the adoption of the Paris Agreement?

Since 1992, the Conferences of the Parties (COPs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have been the annual meeting of the Convention’s member states to review progress and determine the measures to be implemented for the years ahead.

Often described in binary terms as “successes” or “failures”, the COPs are frequently subject to a reductive reading that obscures their real progress. Yet several notable advances can be highlighted over the past ten years. COP26 stood out for its call for the gradual reduction of electricity generation from coal. COP27, in Sharm el-Sheikh, was a historic milestone as it endorsed, for the first time, the creation of a “loss and damage” fund to support the most vulnerable countries. COP28, held in Dubai, concluded with a call for a gradual transition away from fossil fuels. Finally, COP29 led to an agreement on a new quantified goal (NCQG) for climate finance for developing countries, to support their efforts to tackle climate change.

At the same time, these international negotiations have translated into progress at national level. In terms of public policy, more than 100 countries have announced carbon neutrality targets since COP21, often accompanied by national climate strategies – such as the European Green Deal. Through a spillover effect, these national policies have also delivered concrete results, such as the spectacular fall in the cost of low-carbon technologies, which has dropped by 60 to 90% since 2010.

Highlighting this progress does not mean ignoring its limits – whether in terms of overly communicative approaches, lack of ambition or insufficient implementation. It does, however, serve as a reminder that these processes remain genuinely useful. A study by World Weather Attribution showed that, before the Paris Agreement was signed, “global greenhouse gas emissions were following a trend that would have led to an increase in the planet’s average temperature of at least 4°C by 2100 compared to the pre-industrial era. Now, global warming is on a +2.6°C trajectory.”

Far from being sufficient, this study nonetheless illustrates the progress made and shows that the defeatism and disillusionment often associated with international climate negotiations should be qualified. All the more so since the fight against climate disruption is not a binary matter: every tenth of a degree counts. Every fraction of warming avoided helps to mitigate, at least a little, the potentially devastating impacts.

Ten years on, what lessons can be drawn from COP29 and what is at stake at COP30?

One of the fundamental differences between COP29 and COP30 lies in the international context. COP29, held last year in Baku, was already taking place against a complicated geopolitical backdrop. The consequences for climate diplomacy were tangible – relations between France and Azerbaijan were badly strained and Emmanuel Macron did not attend; Donald Trump had just been re-elected with the aim of once again withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement; and several major leaders – Ursula von der Leyen, Olaf Scholz, Joe Biden – were absent. Yet this COP was crucial to reaffirm the importance of climate issues despite international tensions, and could have demonstrated their unifying potential. Many topics were to be addressed, but the NCQG issue monopolised a significant share of the discussions, to the detriment of mitigation, adaptation or gender issues, for instance. The agreement on the NCQG was strongly criticised by developing countries, which had indicated the need to mobilise 1,300 billion dollars by 2035, whereas the amount adopted was 300 billion. Some progress was also made on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which defines the mechanisms of the carbon market, but the way it was adopted – without genuine debate – drew criticism.

The COP currently being held in Belém is set to be highly symbolic. Brazil wants to make this COP, convened in the heart of the Amazon, the COP for forest preservation, while also highlighting the role of indigenous peoples. COP30 will also be highly political: marking ten years of the Paris Agreement, it must reaffirm the credibility of climate multilateralism at a moment of great geopolitical uncertainty. Central issues will include the new Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – that is, states’ climate action plans – which each country must update in light of the 2023 Global Stocktake. Discussions must also continue on the implementation of Article 6, in particular on finalising the rules for its operationalisation. Deforestation will also be a core topic – Brazil will showcase the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), a fund dedicated to the conservation of tropical forests. Lastly, climate finance will remain a sensitive point, as the United States has suspended its contributions and several European countries are cutting their development aid budgets.

This COP also faces numerous challenges. Logistical, first of all: the lack of infrastructure and soaring accommodation prices in Belém risk excluding certain delegations and NGOs. The challenges are also political, linked to the growing wave of anti-environmental populism and the unravelling of environmental policies in some states. This trend runs across all continents, including those historically at the forefront on climate. In the United States, attacks on climate science and environmental policies are targeting scientific production (mass lay-offs at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency), climate strategies (the end of the Green New Deal and the Inflation Reduction Act) and financing (the Trump administration has ended the US contribution to the UNFCCC, i.e. 20% of the total budget). The same trend can be seen in Europe, with the gradual dismantling of certain regulations under the guise of administrative simplification. The “omnibus law” proposed by the European Commission in February 2025 aims, in particular, to “simplify” the Green Deal by easing, for example, the CSRD (reporting obligations) or the CSDDD/CS3D (corporate due diligence) frameworks. This ecological backlash is not, however, inevitable: on 22 October, the European Parliament rejected this draft law, preventing its direct adoption and opening up a new debate in plenary.

Finally, the challenge is geopolitical, as international rivalries are slowing down and fragmenting climate governance. Armed conflicts – whose number, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), rose from 30 in 1990 to 120 in 2024 – have direct impacts on ecosystems (pollution, destruction of soils and water infrastructure), but also indirect ones, by diverting financial resources towards the defence industry and the war economy, to the detriment of environmental policies, as some seek to pit investment in the energy transition against spending on defence. The correlation between higher defence budgets and greenhouse gas emissions illustrates this paradox: the more militarisation increases, the further the climate trajectory drifts away. In the long term, countries at war also display a lower environmental performance index than those in a state of “peace”.

Why is it essential to continue climate negotiations and efforts despite the challenges encountered?

COPs are indeed imperfect and sometimes lack effectiveness, but they remain absolutely essential. First, they are the only moment when global attention focuses on climate issues. Moreover, even if some states struggle to meet their climate commitments, other actors continue to stay the course and use COPs to introduce new measures – municipalities, non-governmental organisations, the private sector and civil society as a whole are actively pursuing their actions. These actors are sometimes more responsive than political bodies themselves and are adept at using alternative instruments to push states to be more ambitious. Since the Paris Agreement, the legal lever has in particular made it possible to hold certain actors to account – France, for instance, was taken to court in 2021 and then ordered to remedy the consequences of its climate inaction.

States, moreover, have every interest in continuing to engage in these forums. Beyond the obvious benefits for the planet’s habitability and for public health, international climate negotiations are also arenas of inter-state competition. Tackling climate change is a strategic tool, both to strengthen states’ positions on the international stage – for example by consolidating their credibility with other states or showcasing their climate strategies – and to increase their national resilience in the face of climate risks. China, for example, enshrined the concept of “ecological civilisation” in its Constitution in 2018, which under Xi Jinping has become a pillar of the national narrative. The Gulf monarchies are also using climate as a lever of diplomacy and diversification, having fully understood the benefits this approach can bring.",https://www.iris-france.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/COP30_Bresil_Belem-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 12:10:47.421369

HOUSTON, TX, UNITED STATES, November 10, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Utility Global (“Utility”), a U.S.-based leader in economic industrial decarbonization through innovative hydrogen solutions, and Symbio North America Corporation (“Symbio”), part of Symbio group, Europe’s largest fuel cell technology developer and manufacturer, with HQ in France, today announced that Symbio has received approval from the South Coast Air Quality Management District (South Coast AQMD) for a Clean Fuels Fund grant to design, develop, and demonstrate a hydrogen fuel cell refuse collection vehicle in the South Coast Air Basin. Utility will manage and oversee the hydrogen fueling logistics and operations throughout the one-year demonstration.

Utility and Symbio have also entered into a strategic alliance to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission, hydrogen-powered refuse trucks in North America.

This collaboration tackles two major challenges facing the refuse collection sector:

1. High-performing zero-emission vehicle: Developing a hydrogen-electric refuse truck powered by Symbio’s advanced fuel cell technology that will exceed the duty cycle and payload of available battery-electric vehicles while meeting operational expectations of refuse haulers.

2. Fuel economics: Delivering economic, reliable, low-to-negative carbon intensity hydrogen fuel from water, without electricity, using biogas (e.g., landfill gas) in Utility’s H2Gen system – a core enabler of Utility’s mission to drive economic decarbonization across heavy industries.

Together, Utility and Symbio will deliver an integrated, cost-effective solution that combines economic hydrogen supply with best-in-class vehicle performance and durability.

As part of the South Coast AQMD-funded demonstration, initial vehicle trials will begin in Southern California in collaboration with Waste Management, CR&R, and the Cities of Los Angeles and Riverside in the first half of 2026. The Clean Energy Institute at the University of California, Irvine will collect and analyze operational and performance data throughout the demonstration period to help validate the technology for future commercial scale-up.

“We support projects like this that combine advanced vehicle technology with innovative clean hydrogen solutions,” said Wayne Nastri, South Coast AQMD’s Executive Officer. “This strategic collaboration represents a meaningful step toward reducing emissions in communities across South Coast Air Basin.”

“This alliance is about turning waste into real, scalable decarbonization,” stated Parker Meeks, CEO of Utility. “By pairing Utility’s H2Gen technology – which produces economic, low-carbon hydrogen from water without electricity by utilizing the electrochemical energy in biogases such as landfill gas – alongside Symbio’s proven fuel cell systems, we can deliver a zero-emission hydrogen-electric refuse truck solution that matches diesel performance. This alliance embodies our mission of enabling economic industrial decarbonization through practical, cost-effective solutions.”

Jean-Baptiste Lucas, Symbio CEO, added, “Joining forces with Utility Global enables us to expand the reach of our fuel cell technology while supporting the growing need for sustainable transport solutions in the waste management sector.”

This non-exclusive Strategic Alliance is already effective while allowing both parties to pursue additional partnerships to further accelerate market adoption of hydrogen-electric refuse vehicles and associated scale up of decentralized hydrogen supply and infrastructure.

“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association.

Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins.","From Inside Climate News:

BAIROIL, Wyo.—The remote dirt road through dusty fields of sagebrush that John Cash drove along in June seemed to pass little of economic value. But his car was, in fact, rattling towards the top-producing uranium mine in Wyoming.

In 2022, the Lost Creek Mine became the first of several such sites across the West to restart operations as the U.S. scrambles to reestablish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel.

Cash, the CEO of UR Energy, which operates the Lost Creek Mine, believes more mines will come online in the years ahead.

“This [area] is loaded with uranium,” he said amid the vast, arid expanse of Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin. “I promise you right now, if I drilled a hole right here, we would hit uranium.”

Newly revived mines are also humming in Texas and Arizona, their owners hopeful that a boom in demand lies ahead. Ten uranium mines operate in the country today, up from three in 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Company announcements and public records show dozens of others on standby for reopening or queued up for permitting in Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with at least four currently fast-tracked for approval under recent executive orders.

“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association. “We’ve been off the playing field for decades on some of this stuff.”

For more than a generation, many of these sites sat dormant, stifled by a cheaper imported supply and modest demand from a stagnant nuclear power sector. However, uranium markets have recently re-awakened: Spot prices doubled between 2022 and 2024, driven by global supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tension and lofty expectations for a renaissance of American atomic power.

Lately, a buzzing landscape of nuclear startups has stirred excitement with announcements of ambitious plans for advanced reactors to power artificial intelligence and other heavy industries across the country. But almost all of these companies are waiting for the U.S. to rebuild a nuclear fuel supply chain before they can even power up their prototype units.

“Expectations for uranium demand have been growing,” said William Freebairn, an associate editorial director at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “But this kind of demand is slow to show up.”

Investor appetite for uranium started to increase around 2022, he said, “as climate concerns became more prominent.” Uranium is processed and enriched into nuclear fuel that provides abundant energy without carbon emissions, although it poses other significant health and safety risks.

Presidential administrations since Barack Obama’s have pushed to increase domestic production of uranium fuel to supply the national nuclear sector, but that goal remains years away. President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders this year to streamline permitting, expedite environmental reviews and impose tariffs on imports that compete with American products.

Despite the recent activity, the U.S. still has a long way to go before it could even come close to meeting its nuclear needs with uranium from domestic mines, Freebairn said.

Unlike pit mines, which scrape away acres of earth, most modern uranium extraction projects drill hundreds of wells, inject them with solvents and suck up the mineral slurry they create. This method has a much lighter impact on the surface but can contaminate or deplete freshwater aquifers if improperly managed.

In Wyoming, several hundred wells churn out a modest 28,000 pounds of uranium oxide per month at the Lost Creek mine. The mine is licensed to produce more than 1.2 million pounds of uranium oxide concentrate annually, according to UR Energy, but uranium miners are still waiting for the development of a domestic nuclear supply chain before ramping up production.

Supply chain bottleneck

For now, American uranium production remains a dribble. Despite recent steep increases, total output in 2024 was less than 2 percent of the country’s peak production in 1981. The U.S. lacks the infrastructure to transform uranium oxide concentrate, known in the industry as “yellowcake,” into the uranium hexafluoride gas used for enrichment. About 99 percent of the feedstock consumed by U.S. power plants is imported, and much of that uranium is enriched in Russia, despite the prohibition on importing Russian uranium then President Joe Biden signed in May 2024. The ban doesn’t fully go into effect until 2028.

“Uranium mining, uranium processing and uranium enrichment have all largely been offshored because they could do it cheaper,” said Rusty Towell, director of the Nuclear Energy Experimental Testing Laboratory at Abilene Christian University. “That whole supply chain was weakened.”

A flurry of new mines

In Wyoming, home to the nation’s richest known uranium deposits, three other companies have recently joined UR Energy in ramping up operations. To the south, in far western Colorado, Canadian firm Anfield Energy announced plans in August to begin exploratory drilling at an abandoned, 2000-acre pit uranium mine.

In Utah, Anfield’s Velvet-Wood project received an expedited environmental review that lasted just two weeks due to a March executive order from the White House.

“This approval marks a turning point,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release at the time. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries.”

The reviews of several mines in western New Mexico were also fast-tracked and are expected to conclude in late 2027. They include the Crownpoint-Church Rock and La Jara Mesa projects by Australian miner Laramide Resources, as well as Energy Fuels’ Roca Honda project in the Cibola National Forest.

On federal lands, where many of the reopened mines are located, digs for minerals are still governed by the Mining Act of 1872. Originally passed to draw settlers to the West, it declares all mineral deposits “free and open to exploration and purchase.” The law has enabled some mines to open in areas that are culturally important to tribes, critical habitat for vulnerable species or revered for recreational and scenic values, often over local opposition.

Some of the fast-tracked New Mexico mines border the lands of the Acoma and Laguna pueblos. In the nearby Navajo Nation, the new activity has sparked concern.

The Navajo Nation “continues to be affected—not only from abandoned uranium mines and mill sites—but also from other contaminants,” said Perry Charley, chair of the Diné Uranium Remediation Advisory Commission, at a public meeting in August in Shiprock, New Mexico.

From 1944 to 1986, mining activities left more than 500 abandoned mines and an enormous amount of uranium waste in various regions of Navajo land.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies of the Navajo Nation have shown widespread groundwater contamination by uranium, as well as other elements released by the mining process, including arsenic, vanadium, manganese and lithium.

“Though uranium mining ceased on the Navajo Nation in 1986, the contamination left from these operations still represents a significant danger,” said a study from 2019.

Recent studies have linked proximity to abandoned uranium mines with increased risks of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases on the Navajo Nation. Uranium concentrations in urine samples of Navajo women are almost three times higher than the national median and are associated with significantly increased risks of preterm births, according to studies in 2020 and 2023.

Navajo people’s cancer diagnosis rate is 6.3 times higher for gallbladder cancer, 3.2 times higher for stomach cancer, 1.9 times higher for kidney cancer and 1.8 times higher for liver cancer than white populations in New Mexico and Arizona, according to a 2023 report from the Navajo Epidemiology Center.

On the eastern edge of Navajo land, at the Church Rock site, a dam failure in 1979 released 94 million gallons of waste fluids into the Rio Puerco, the largest radioactive material spill in U.S. history. Church Rock is among the sites currently undergoing expedited environmental review to resume production.

“These communities are still trying to clean up from the last time this happened,” said Amber Reimondo, the energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit advocating for protection of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau. “For years, tribes have been reassured that the problems of the past are just that—problems of the past—and that now we have environmental laws that are supposedly protecting them.”

At the Navajo reservation’s western edge, uranium production began last year at the Pinyon Plain Mine, nestled among pinyon pine trees in the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, less than 20 miles from the Grand Canyon’s south rim in Arizona.

The mine operator, Energy Fuels, began trucking its uranium product through Navajo territory in July 2024, but was forced to stop after the tribal government issued an order banning unauthorized transport of radioactive material.

“Anyone bringing those substances onto the Nation should undertake that activity with respect and sensitivity to the psychological impact to our people, as well as the trauma of uranium development that our community continues to live with every day,” former Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch said in a statement at the time.

Later, the tribal government and Energy Fuels negotiated an agreement to resume transport of uranium from the Pinyon Plain Mine across the Navajo lands.

“Energy Fuels is pursuing an aggressive plan to quickly increase short-term U.S. uranium supply,” company CEO Mark Chalmers said in a press release this year announcing record production at Pinyon Plain.

Energy Fuels did not respond to requests for comment. The company has a long list of mines it’s working to bring back online across Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to public announcements.

Groundwater concerns

Permitted in 1986, the 14-acre Pinyon Plain Mine sat dormant for decades, like hundreds of other sites in the country, waiting for uranium prices to rebound. When they did, the U.S. Forest Service cleared it to begin operations for the first time last year although it last cleared federal environmental review almost 40 years ago. The decision prompted protests from local tribes, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes.

“We must protect the water supplies,” Mayes said in an August 2024 statement calling for reevaluation of the mine. “The risks are too great to ignore.”

The site contains a single mine shaft extending 1,470 feet down to the uranium deposits, and the company removed millions of gallons of groundwater to access the ore. The mine and others like it pose threats to the region’s network of interconnected aquifers that stretches across the Grand Canyon region, according to research published last year by Karl Karlstrom and Laura Crossey, Emeritus professors of earth science at the University of New Mexico.

“Energy Fuels doesn’t know how much their mining is contaminating the deep aquifer, and USGS doesn’t know, and we don’t know,” Karlstrom said. “Caution is needed.”

In an interview, both researchers said the Pinyon Plain mining plan assumes that two underlying formations holding water, the upper Coconino aquifer and the lower Redwall-Mauv aquifer, aren’t connected. But ample regional science shows that’s not true, they said; water moves between them.

The Redwall-Mauv aquifer feeds springs across the region, some of which provide drinking water for the Havasupai Tribe.

“Current well data are insufficient to rule out a connection between the two aquifers,” wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a review of the mine following Karlstrom and Crossey’s study. But the agency noted that USGS data from the mine’s well sites show elevated levels of uranium and arsenic contamination, and that it is unclear how or if it will spread.

“The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from operations at the Pinyon Plain Mine site cannot be assessed fully without additional investigations,” the EPA review concluded.

The uranium mining revival has churned up similar concerns in the savannah of South Texas. Encore Energy, based in the Gulf Coast city of Corpus Christi, started production at its Rosita site in November 2023 and its Alta Mesa site in June 2024. In August, it acquired 5,900 more acres adjacent to Alta Mesa, where it plans to begin drilling in October. Another Corpus Christi-based company, Uranium Energy Corp., expects to start mining at its South Texas sites in early 2026.

One rural groundwater conservation district is fighting the renewal of an old, unused mining permit UEC holds for a site in Goliad County.

“We are extremely concerned that UEC’s uranium mining activities will lead to groundwater contamination,” said a request for a hearing on the mine permits filed by the district with Texas’ environmental regulator late last year.

Faultlines and abandoned oil wells connect the mining area to freshwater aquifers, the district claims. Some 30 households, a church and about 400 cattle drink from wells in the area surrounding the mine. Groundwater levels there dropped 15 feet between 2000 and 2022, the district said.

The Goliad site will use about 130 million gallons per year, according to Art Dohmann, vice president of the Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District. But mining is exempt from groundwater permitting requirements under Texas law, he said.

“This may cause more wells in the area to go dry,” the district wrote in comments to the state.

In August, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality voted unanimously to grant the district’s request for a hearing on the permit. UEC did not respond to requests for comment.

Separate state permits authorize UEC to inject up to 105 million gallons of mining wastewater underground for disposal every year at its Goliad site. UEC has four other projects under development in South Texas.

The company, which calls itself “America’s largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium,” also owns sites in New Mexico and Wyoming, where its Christensen Ranch mine began production last summer and its Sweetwater Uranium Complex was selected in August for the fast-tracked approval authorized by President Trump’s executive order.

UEC calls Sweetwater “the largest uranium complex in the U.S.” It encompasses 20,000 acres of exploration and mining rights in Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin, and sits only a few miles from UR Energy’s Lost Creek Mine, where Cash, UR Energy’s CEO, was surveying his company’s project.

Before UEC can even develop the site, the expedited review is expected to take 18 months, according to a federal permitting tracker.

Drilling uranium

On a hot morning in June, three men and a 25-foot-tall winch pulled piping from the ground at the Lost Creek mine in Wyoming. They had just completed a new uranium well.

Cash, a trim man with brown hair lightly graying on the sides, inspected a slab of wood containing samples of wet earth taken every five feet down the well. A chunk he scooped up was a deep green, indicating it probably contained uranium.

“For a geologist, it’s like reading a book,” said Cash, who has a master’s degree in geology and geophysics from Missouri University of Science and Technology.

Lost Creek extracts uranium using in-situ recovery—ISR mining—a process pioneered in Wyoming in the 1960s. Over the eons, water carried uranium off the granite mountains surrounding the Great Divide Basin, burying it in the sandstone. Water is now used to draw it back out. The company drills wells patterned like the five-side of dice and then injects a leachate—water, oxygen, CO2 and occasionally soda ash at UR-Energy’s project, according to Cash—into the exterior four shafts. When that stew is pumped back to the surface through the center pipe, it’s full of uranium.

Wells’ surface impacts bother Cash, he said, looking out over the site. “I wish we could do this with less disturbance.”

But if this was an open pit mine, a crater would displace the vegetation on the surface and “this would all be gone in perpetuity,” he added. Instead, the company will replant native sagebrush and grasses, Cash said.

Hundreds of wells surrounded the site’s processing facility—a concrete and steel warehouse where employees wearing radiation-monitoring badges oversee chemical processes that turn uranium-filled slurry into yellowcake, the base ingredient of nuclear fuel.

Water that isn’t reused, about 21,600 gallons a day, according to Cash, is treated and disposed of underground.

Lost Creek has detected groundwater contaminated by what the company injects—moving “where it shouldn’t move”—four or five times since 2013, Cash said. If left alone, it could spread to freshwater sources. This is “exceedingly rare,” and each time it has happened, UR Energy has successfully prevented an escape, he said.

Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins. He chaffed at the fact that UR Energy was required to install and maintain a full-blown weather station at Lost Creek, and wondered why his company had to take groundwater that was already undrinkable and make it slightly cleaner, but still unpotable, before disposal.

“We need to be protective,” he said. “But we don’t need to be hyper-protective.”

Cash left Lost Creek for another UR Energy project, which would revive the Shirley Basin mine some 80 miles east at the foot of the Laramie Range. On his way that June day, he passed another potential mine, the Lost Soldier project, a claim he isn’t sure the company will ever develop.

“There’s a lot more work we need to do,” Cash said.

“As data centres expand, these machines are seeing renewed importance for their ability to provide inertia and short-circuit strength.","ABB has announced a major partnership with Texas-based microgrid company VoltaGrid to improve the reliability and stability of power systems supporting the rapid expansion of AI data centres in the United States.

As energy consumption surges due to AI workloads, the collaboration aims to deliver critical grid-stabilising technologies that ensure consistent, resilient power for hyperscale and modular operations.

Strengthening grid stability for AI growth

Under the agreement, ABB will supply 27 synchronous condensers with flywheels and prefabricated eHouse units that include power control, automation and excitation systems. These will integrate into VoltaGrid’s distributed energy sites currently under construction, supporting multiple AI infrastructure projects across the country.

The systems provide high inertia, stabilise voltage and strengthen grid reliability by managing reactive power across complex high-demand environments.

VoltaGrid’s proprietary natural gas-fuelled power generation technology will complement ABB’s systems, forming a hybrid energy network designed for rapid deployment. Capable of functioning as both short-term and long-term behind-the-metre solutions, the units will deliver flexible capacity for hyperscale data centres that require fast and stable power delivery.

Project delivery is expected to begin in December 2025, with the first operational units scheduled for April 2026.

“ABB’s synchronous condensers are vital for meeting the energy demands of next-generation technologies like AI data centres, thanks to their proven ability to ensure grid stability and enhance the overall resilience of power systems,” says Nathan Ough, CEO of VoltaGrid. “Partnering with ABB allows us to accelerate project execution and meet the growing performance demands of AI operations, delivering more value to our customers.”

Meeting the rising power demand from AI

The collaboration comes at a time when US data centre energy consumption continues to climb. In 2024, data centres accounted for around 1.5% of global electricity use, with the US responsible for approximately 45% of that total. Industry analysts expect data centres to drive nearly half of the country’s electricity demand growth by 2030, with AI workloads fuelling much of this expansion.

The growing demand for compute-intensive applications, including generative AI and machine learning, is straining national power grids. Maintaining stable and efficient energy delivery has therefore become one of the biggest challenges for hyperscale operators.

Technologies such as ABB’s synchronous condensers, combined with VoltaGrid’s distributed generation platforms, are emerging as key solutions to maintaining resilience while supporting AI-driven growth.

ABB’s contribution to energy resilience

ABB has been investing in power systems designed to enhance grid stability and support the transition to cleaner, more reliable energy. Its prefabricated eHouse systems are modular and transportable, enabling simplified power distribution and faster deployment of energy infrastructure for large-scale data centre and industrial applications.

“ABB is proud to partner with VoltaGrid and support the evolving energy ecosystem in the US,” says Per Erik Holsten, President of ABB’s Energy Industries division.

“Across the world, data centres are increasingly critical infrastructure and so maintaining grid stability has shifted from being optional to strategic. Delivering stable, reliable and efficient power generation is vital to enable data centre growth. Our integrated automation, electrification and digitalisation solutions play an important role to meet growing demand while maintaining energy security.”

Synchronous condensers for modern data networks

Synchronous condensers are becoming increasingly important for data centres and utilities facing grid instability caused by fluctuating renewable generation and rising load demands.

Although similar in design to large motors or generators, these systems are built to provide instantaneous inertia and short-circuit strength – both essential for maintaining grid balance and reliability.

“Synchronous condensers may resemble large motors or generators in design, but their real strength lies in grid support,” says Kristina Carlquist, Head of Synchronous Condenser Product Line at ABB’s Motion High Power division. “As data centres expand, these machines are seeing renewed importance for their ability to provide inertia and short-circuit strength. For VoltaGrid, they will help ensure reliable, resilient microgrid performance.”",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/b27a7bd26242258bb5d0fcc4f62b2008:6f6a2dbb0c74613f672e21a20cb68629/per-erik-holsten-president-of-abb-s-energy-industries-division.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:10.376178

The development combines 600 MW of solar generation with 1,900 MWh of energy storage and moves toward commercial operation in the second half of 2027. Furthermore, the project secures a 20-year busbar agreement with Arizona Public Service (APS), which strengthens predictable cash-flow for the build and operational phases.

The financing package was provided by a consortium of six major global banks including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., BNP Paribas, Natixis, Nord/LB, Crédit Agricole and MUFG Bank, Ltd. Enlight expects to secure tax-equity investment during 2026, and structure the debt such that part converts to a term loan post-commercial-operation while the remainder is paid via tax-equity proceeds.The first full year after commercial operation is forecast to generate roughly US $128 million revenue and US $104 million EBITDA.

Significance of the Project

From a construction-industry perspective, Snowflake A represents a large-scale industrial build involving major civil, structural, mechanical and electrical scopes. Contractors will engage in site-preparation works, large foundations for solar arrays and storage systems, modular equipment installation and utility-scale grid-interconnect overhead systems. Because of the energy-storage component, the project adds complexity. Additional requirements include specialized foundations, fire-protection systems, battery-containment design and high-capacity AC/DC conversions.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Project-5.avif,N,,2025-11-10 11:12:45.688724

But more than a month into the shutdown, workers at the EPA have mostly escaped the high-profile reductions in force and mass furloughs that have hit other agencies.
“We’ve been intentional and aggressive in establishing a structure to ensure EPA is focused on statutory obligations and Presidential priorities, not the overreach of the previous administration,” EPA spokesperson Mike Bastasch tells WIRED in a statement.
Walter Mugdan, a multi-decade EPA employee who last served as the head of one of the agency’s regional offices, says that the EPA is likely paying employees still coming to work with carryover funds from last year’s budget.
“Could be a method to the madness, but probably just disorganization,” says one EPA employee.","WITH THE END of the US government shutdown in sight, disorganization still reigns at federal agencies. Workers at the Environmental Protection Agency tell WIRED that they have faced increasing chaos over the past five weeks.

In recent weeks, varied phases of furloughs have forced staff to go home in seemingly random waves. Some employees remaining at the agency are working on policies friendly to fossil fuel and industrial interests that are a priority of the administration, even as the rest of the government shuts down.

Others have had to sit on their hands, as the shutdown takes out colleagues with no notice—and remaining employees have little to no information as to what is coming next.

“We learn who is furloughed when we send an email to someone and get the out-of-office message, or we hover over names in Teams for people who are showing out of office,” one EPA worker tells WIRED. (This worker, and others in this story, were granted anonymity because they aren’t permitted to speak to the press.)

Some employees who are being kept are at work revising pollution rules, a core deregulatory goal of the administration. An employee at the Office of Air and Radiation confirmed to WIRED that their team, which is working on rule revisions in that office, is still being called in to work, while others in the office—including support staff like administrative assistants and operations workers—were sent home the week of October 20.

“Staff working in the regulatory part of the air office are still working,” the employee tells WIRED. “Lots of furloughs elsewhere. But we’re still working on deregulatory actions.” The New York Times reported in mid-October that other staffers working to repeal rules friendly to oil, gas, and coal interests were also being told to “press on.”

Around 4,400 employees, WIRED has learned, had been furloughed at the agency as of late October. According to the EPA’s shutdown plan, which was last updated in September, the agency employed more than 15,000 people as of October 1. In the plan, the agency lists just 1,734 employees expected to be retained in the event of a full shutdown. These employees would work on “significant agency activities” deemed crucial enough to be continued in a lapse, including Superfund activities, disaster assistance, criminal investigations, and the preservation of research.

Following a Sunday vote in the Senate, the government shutdown could end as early as this week.

OMB director Russell Vought, the public face of the government shutdown, has tried to use it as a way to further cut back the size of the federal workforce. But more than a month into the shutdown, workers at the EPA have mostly escaped the high-profile reductions in force and mass furloughs that have hit other agencies. Many workers are still coming in to do their jobs as the agency tries to continue business as usual. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin, meanwhile, has squarely blamed Democrats.

“We’ve been intentional and aggressive in establishing a structure to ensure EPA is focused on statutory obligations and Presidential priorities, not the overreach of the previous administration,” EPA spokesperson Mike Bastasch tells WIRED in a statement. “Congressional Democrats have chosen to shut down the government. If they want to re-open the government, they can choose to do so at any time.”

Not everyone still at EPA is working on deregulations, or even top administration priorities, however. A staffer working on civil rights cases in the administrator’s office says their team hasn’t received furlough notices, and that they are still coming in to work. “Our work is definitely not a priority of the administration,” they said.

Many employees working on the Superfund program, which is responsible for cleaning up toxic sites around the country, have also retained their jobs. A regional Superfund worker told WIRED that their team had been largely unaffected by furloughs. But even those workers are facing uncertainty.

In late October, supervisors informed the staff that if the shutdown continues, the funding source for Superfund staff paychecks would switch to a trust fund established to help finance the program, avoiding the need to furlough them entirely. But a week later, the administration had apparently changed its tune: Last week, the employee tells WIRED, leadership informed Superfund workers in their regional office that a decision had been made to not use the trust fund for payroll, and that staff should expect furloughs in the coming weeks.

“Everyone was shocked,” the employee says.

Walter Mugdan, a multi-decade EPA employee who last served as the head of one of the agency’s regional offices, says that the EPA is likely paying employees still coming to work with carryover funds from last year’s budget. (Zeldin told reporters last week that the agency has “a whole bunch of pots of carryover funding” that it was using.)

Still, multiple employees tell WIRED that the source of their paychecks has not been made clear to them. And unlike previous shutdowns, when the agency communicated clearly the timelines for how long it could stay open, workers say that they have no idea when the money will run out.

“They seem to keep finding change in the couch cushions to pay us, so who knows [what comes next],” says one employee.

The uneven furloughs have affected some employees’ work. “The scattershot furlough of regional staff is making it difficult for us to get anything done that requires input from those folks,” says the civil rights employee.

The Superfund employee who spoke to WIRED says that even though their team is still intact, the furloughs have affected regional staff who help them book travel to the sites they need to monitor. “It’s taking a long time to get travel approved,” they say.

The late October furloughs also hit workers who are part of a long-awaited, large-scale reorganization of how the agency does science. In May, agency leadership announced that it would be significantly changing the Office of Research and Development, the EPA’s independent scientific research arm. Many of the scientists from ORD were to be subsumed into a new office within the Office of the Administrator. Two former ORD employees tell WIRED that they were informed of their new positions hours before they were then given a furlough notice and sent home.

“Could be a method to the madness, but probably just disorganization,” says one EPA employee.

Zeldin was not clear with reporters last week as to a specific date for when carryover funding would run out, but he said that in the “first, second week of November, the agency would have no choice but to then move towards a third phase of implementing a lapse plan—and we don’t want to have to do that.”

Even EPA supervisors seem to be in the dark about what to expect next.

“I just don’t understand why they wouldn’t be able to tell specific groups when they would be furloughed if the shutdown continues [or] how many days of funding they have left,” says one employee. “I can’t think of any reasons other than they want to cause confusion and strife, or if they’re just improvising every day.”

“It’s been a hallmark of this [administration],” claims another worker. “Keep everyone in the dark as much as possible—sow chaos to minimize effectiveness as an agency.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/69028b736d14ebc3afce7267/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Pol_EPA_Getty.jpg",N,,2025-11-10 12:10:51.803792

Analysts and stakeholders say political pressure and policy changes can be partially credited for big-picture changes like the collapse of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance. But what they will change within real estate companies’ policies and actions — and how that will impact actual carbon emissions from the built environment — is more opaque.

Real estate owners that have already invested in decarbonizing their portfolios are likely to continue those initiatives, though they may be less eager to share details.

“The volatility of the current regulatory landscape is causing a lot of people to just be very cautious in a way that they perhaps weren't before,” said Camilla Taylor, executive director of the American Sustainable Business Network.

“Businesses and markets don't like unpredictability. … So we're seeing a lot of slowdown of work, a lot of businesses pulling back on commitments, because the unknowns are just too large in forecasting.”

More broadly, investors’ attention to the issue has dwindled. Combined with the difficulty of measuring real estate carbon emissions, that may throw a wrench in some plans.

About five years ago, environmental, social and governance initiatives were a top priority for large corporations, said Daniel Ismail, co-head of strategic research at Green Street. Green Street began undertaking dedicated ESG research at the request of clients who were concerned about decarbonization, regulation and impact on building valuations.

“Over the past two years, it's been more muted than ever,” Ismail said. “It's not been top of clients' minds. What's been top of client minds has been interest rates, cap rate changes [and] insurance costs.”

Major real estate owners and lenders, including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Wells Fargo, this year dropped their commitments to make their portfolios meet net-zero emissions standards by 2050.

“The difficulty in meeting those, in practice, is high,” Ismail said. “It’s incredibly difficult to say, just with respect to commercial real estate, ‘Decarbonize a real estate portfolio.’”

While politicians claimed credit for the mass exodus from the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance, corporate strategies are largely driven by investors and practicality. There are both regulatory and commercial imperatives driving the decisions on decarbonization, and those imperatives don’t necessarily align.

Donald Trump signs an executive order in April.

Nationwide Policy

Trump’s second term began with a flurry of executive orders and a commitment to “unleashing American energy” by limiting states’ power to enforce climate change-related regulations. Many Biden-era climate policies were rolled back.

The Securities and Exchange Commission stopped defending its climate disclosure rule, which was challenged in court after being finalized in March 2024. The rule, which was never implemented, would have required public companies to disclose climate-related risks to help investors have comparable, decision-useful information.

During Trump’s first term, he expanded a 30-year-old resiliency program run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But three months into his second term, the administration canceled the program, calling it “wasteful” and “politicized.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law in July, placed an expiration date on several energy- and resilience-related tax credits. The energy-efficient commercial buildings deduction — introduced in 2006 for new construction or retrofits and expanded by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act — won’t apply to any buildings on which construction starts after June 2026.

While these deadlines could spur some developers to seek use of tax credits before a deadline, business decisions are often delayed while policy shifts, the ASBN’s Taylor said.

Tax credits have been the main driver of profitability when assessing new construction, she said. Now focus is shifting to adding value across an asset’s life cycle by fortifying buildings against climate risk and making them insurable.

“People are far more interested in the near-term reality of insurance expenses than they are in decarbonization,” Ismail said.

Continued Demand

Insurance costs alone make a case for energy efficiency, resiliency and decarbonization. Developers and owners wanting to build a building that will thrive in the foreseeable future also create demand for sustainability.

“What sustainability brings to a project, it brings risk mitigation, it brings transparency,” Taylor said. “So it just makes for better work.”

Businesses that understand how to leverage the opportunities that sustainability and energy efficiency bring aren’t going to pull back, because that would be bad business practice, she said.

There are also existing financial investments in decarbonization that would be wasteful to undo.

“Rolling those back just doesn't financially make sense,” Taylor said. “Sometimes they're just too big of boats to turn around, even if they wanted to.”

CBRE, for one, has significantly increased its investments in technologies and programs to help clients drive value creation while accelerating progress against their environmental commitments, CBRE Chief Sustainability Officer Rob Bernard said in a statement to Bisnow.

“Our investments at the intersection of sustainability and business are helping our clients accelerate investments, which improve their sustainability and business outcomes,” Bernard said.

CBRE validated its net-zero-by-2040 goal last year, setting new targets for 2030 to reduce its direct and indirect emissions by 50% and the intensity of emissions from properties it manages for clients by 55% from its 2019 baseline.

ESG isn’t as in vogue as it was during the latter part of the last decade, but institutional owners of real estate know that tenants prefer newer, high-quality buildings, Ismail said. It may not be as easy to invest in decarbonization as it was during the zero-interest-rate period, but it still pencils.

“That is synonymous with buildings that have more green features, that have better carbon footprints and so on,” Ismail said. “From just a strategic direction, I don't think it's changed much. … Landlords and tenants generally would prefer a greener building than a browner one.”

But it is hard to measure how much that is actually changing levels of carbon emissions in the built environment, which is known to account for about 40% of carbon emissions globally. With a lack of standardized metrics and knowledge of entire supply chains, exact carbon emission measurements remain unclear, making net-zero targets harder to reach, Ismail said.

“The same problems today existed a few years ago. You're not getting apples-to-apples comparisons across all property sectors or markets,” Ismail said. “That's a problem that, regardless of who's in charge of the federal government, is still going to persist. It's just a very difficult problem to crack.”

The vast majority of REITs still report the same level of disclosure that they did during the Biden administration, Ismail said. But some policy changes — like the Environmental Protection Agency’s move to no longer track power plants’ carbon emissions — could make tracking commercial real estate’s downstream impacts more difficult.

Opposing Forces

Despite a clear position from the federal government, state and local laws create a patchwork of regulations related to buildings’ carbon emissions, and it is these state laws that have been the major driver of sustainability regulation in the U.S. over the past decade.

New York City property owners began incurring fines over the past year under Local Law 97, which requires them to disclose greenhouse gas emissions for buildings 25K SF and larger to the New York City Department of Buildings.

Many landlords currently deem the penalties affordable, though Green Street estimates they will ramp up to about 1% of net operating income by 2030, Ismail said.

“The biggest pain point right now is just in meeting the law from a reporting and calculation standpoint,” he said.

The law suffers from being overly broad and generic, but it may help other local governments implement carbon taxes going forward, Ismail said. Local Law 97 and the state’s ban on putting natural gas appliances and systems in new buildings — which was overturned in court in California but upheld in New York — make the city a good testing ground for these types of laws.

The regulations could nudge landlords to prepare their entire portfolios to meet regulations and reporting standards, since they could broadly apply systems used to track emissions in New York City.

There is pressure from the other direction, though. Texas in 2021 began passing laws prohibiting state entities from doing business with banks that “boycott” energy companies.

The American Sustainable Business Council, an affiliate of the ASBN, is suing the state to challenge the law’s constitutionality. Texas, which has the world’s eighth-largest economy, can also present a replicable model for other states to roll back ESG legislation.

“It's a good incubator,” Taylor said. “So I do think what happens in Texas is extremely important in the entire country.”

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who opened a review of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions’ status under the state’s anti-ESG law in late 2023, applauded the banks for leaving the United Nations-affiliated Net-Zero Banking Alliance.

“More and more financial institutions are taking a major step in the right direction by leaving the radical and anti-energy Net-Zero Banking Alliance,” Paxton said in a statement. “The NZBA seeks to undermine our vital oil and gas industries, and membership could potentially prevent banks from being able to enter into contracts with Texas governmental entities.”

The mass exodus led to the organization officially folding last month, four years after its formation. JPMorgan, which said in its 2024 climate report that it doesn’t make decisions based on political or social agendas, said in a statement about leaving the NZBA that it would “remain focused on pragmatic solutions to help further low-carbon technologies while advancing energy security.”

Subdued external communication about sustainability initiatives despite unchanged internal policy is a phenomenon being referred to as “green hushing.”

“There has been a large attack on language and how people describe what they do,” ASBN President David Levine said.

The Trump administration scrubbed the words “climate change” from federal websites, including the Department of Agriculture and EPA sites, within a month of Trump taking office. A FEMA memo in February listed 34 words and phrases to be removed from its documents, including “changing climate,” “climate resilience” and “net zero.”

The Department of Energy added “climate change,” “green” and “decarbonization” to its list of words to avoid at its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in late September, Politico reported, citing a department email.

The attack on language has stoked fear among the business community of being singled out, Levine said.

“At the end of the day, silence around these issues is not going to get us progress,” he said.",https://cdn.bisnow.net/fit?height=1200&type=jpeg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3.amazonaws.com%2Fcdn.bisnow.net%2Fcontent%2Fimages%2F2025%2F11%2F690b858c0948e-thomas-richter-b09tl5bsqjk-unsplash.jpeg&width=1200&sign=bynYSJfmGX_AA3ApaV6h76Ao3oAgfRyYUyg3pJnDRLA,N,,2025-11-10 12:11:05.914400

Adding nuclear and gas

Vistra owns about 43.7 GW, including 22.3 GW in eastern U.S. markets, 19.6 GW in Texas and 1.6 GW in California.

Those numbers are set to grow through possible uprates at nuclear power plants and by building new resources, officials with the Irving, Texas-based independent power producer, said Thursday during a quarterly earnings conference call with equity analysts.

Vistra expects to finish analyzing by the end of the year the potential to add capacity at its nuclear power plants — with initial expectations that the company could increase its 6.6-GW nuclear fleet by about 10% starting in the early 2030s, Jim Burke, Vistra president and CEO, said.

Also, Vistra plans to build 860 MW of gas-fired generation in West Texas by mid-2028 for about $900 million, company officials said.

The plans come as Vistra is in discussions with companies seeking to buy power, including for data centers, according to Burke.

“Data center development remains robust, with the number of planned facilities across the U.S. more than doubling from 12 months ago,” Burke said. “We continue to see an acceleration in strong customer interest … and we believe the momentum we have today should enable us to realize multiple contracting opportunities.”

Vistra is seeing “record levels of interest” from customers across its existing portfolio as well as for new generation, according to Stacey Doré, chief strategy and sustainability officer and executive vice president of public affairs.

Excess capacity for near-term growth

Despite talk of energy shortfalls in leading markets, Burke said there is enough capacity in off “super peak” hours to meet near-term demand growth for customers willing to be flexible.

“There is excess capacity on the system in most markets today, particularly the major markets we’re in — ERCOT and PJM — to meet most of the load growth during these non-super-peak hours,” Burke said.

Data centers and other large load customers can use onsite backup generation to supply their power as well as demand response during those “super peak” hours, he added.

Load growth is already leading to higher utilization rates at Vistra’s combined-cycle gas-fired power plants, where capacity factors have increased in the low 50% to the high 50% range over the last several years, according to Burke.

Growing demand could drive utilization at combined-cycle gas plants to the mid-80% range over time, Burke said.

Kris Moldovan, Vistra executive vice president and CFO, said he sees opportunities for Vistra to grow by buying assets.

“The opportunity set for inorganic growth is … at a high level right now,” he said.

Last month, Vistra closed on a $1.9 billion deal to buy 2.6 GW of gas-fired generation from Lotus Infrastructure Partners.

Capacity factors — a measure of a power plant’s usage rate — at Vistra’s power plant fleet were generally lower in the third quarter compared to the same period in 2024, according to the company.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/r4mFXuzg2DwA0OpdtgV5TWdYyDvfsENaKgHZ5Ps2c1I/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Db21hbmNoZV9QZWFrX051Y2xlYXJfUG93ZXJfUGxhbnRfQXVndXN0XzIwMTdfY3JvcHBlZC5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-10 11:11:43.372464

It recently announced $1.84 million in taxpayer-funded grants through the Clean Fuel and Charging Infrastructure Program.

That amount makes up just the first two rounds of funding. In total, $30 million was allocated to the program in 2024 as a one-time amount.

The $1.84 million funded 201 new electric vehicle charging stations at 31 multifamily properties across Michigan. That means each station cost an average of $9,200.

The next two rounds of funding, which should be announced soon, will also fund stations as multifamily properties. According to a statement from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, which implements the program, this is because those sites often “lack at-home charging options.”

This is all part of a broader clean energy plan that Michigan is hoping to implement, titled the MI Healthy Climate Plan.

As part of that plan, the state plans “to build out the infrastructure to support 2 million EVs on Michigan roads by 2030.”

Currently, the state reports 1,700 charging locations across Michigan. To support its 2030 goal, “Michigan will need approximately 10,000 DCFC and 90,000 Level 2 chargers,” making this program just a small part of the state’s overall EV charger plan.

This is just one of many grant programs funded by the taxpayers in Michigan that are pushing this climate plan.

Another example is a recently announced new round of funding totaling $35.9 million for electric school buses. This funding is part of the Michigan Department of Education’s $125 million Clean Bus Energy Grant program, which will help 23 schools and districts add 87 electric buses and 10 propane buses to fleets across the state.

While the typical new diesel school bus can cost in the $125,000 to $150,000 range, electric school buses are substantially more expensive. Many electric school buses currently cost about $300,000 to $400,000.

The MDE’s grant program is allocating about $370,000 per bus. Interim State Superintendent Sue C. Carnell applauded the funding.

“Children and others in their communities benefit from cleaner air,” she said. “We are happy to work with our partners at the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy to make our state greener.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/2/72/272ed2ca-3931-4b8c-859f-26c359fec32c/68dab63d6fc45.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C22,N,,2025-11-10 15:05:41.148397

Around a quarter of methane emissions in the U.S. come from the oil and gas sector.","Sharon Wilson spent more than a decade in the oil business, never expecting to become one of its fiercest critics. But something in her snapped after she moved to rural Texas and saw her water and air fouled by a surge of fracking that quickly consumed her community.

Over the next 28 years, Wilson became one of the nation’s most relentless campaigners against the oil and gas industry—an industry that continues to enjoy near-unchecked sway in Texas, despite having extracted more planet-heating fuels across the country than any other nation in recent history. “It is a losing battle,” Wilson said. “But people are enraged. I’m not the radical here; they are. They called me all sorts of horrible names, threatened me—death threats, all kinds of things.”

Wilson’s work as a self-described “methane hunter” takes her across the vast, flat expanses of Texas, where at times the only structures breaking the horizon are tangles of oil and gas pipes and wellheads. Her workload is prodigious. Wilson has tracked methane gushing from tens of thousands of wells across the state and captured what she calls “horrific” emissions from gas turbines that power an Elon Musk-owned data center in Memphis, Tennessee.

Her persistence earned Wilson recognition well beyond Texas—she’s now worked with environmental groups including Earthworks and, more recently, Oilfield Witness—but she’s often seen as a lone operator, a one-woman chronicler of the secret smog that is cooking our planet. What began as a local crusade now has international implications: Wilson has briefed regulators and journalists in the United Kingdom, Japan, and across Europe.

In the past decade, Wilson has taken up a new weapon in her fight: an imaging camera that visualizes the emissions billowing from the myriad oil and gas wells that puncture central and western Texas. Methane, a potent greenhouse gas, cannot be seen by the naked eye—but through the lens of Wilson’s camera, it shows up in startling oranges and reds.

Filming from public roads, her infrared lens reveals what she calls “egregious emissions” from facilities that often have few, if any, workers onsite to prevent major leaks. “And they can do that because it’s invisible,” she said. “The industry can tell you anything, and there’s no way you can verify it by looking at the site unless you have a camera like I do.”

Her footage has shamed industry giants and won her new prominence. She appears in two new documentaries: This is Not a Drill, now showing at film festivals, and Gaslit, featuring Jane Fonda. If the American public could actually see the amount of methane spewing from oil and gas facilities, then “there never would [have been] a fracking boom [to begin with],” Wilson says in This is Not a Drill, which follows her as she aims her specialized camera at leaking wells and compressor stations.

“Sharon is a badass,” said Josh Eisenberg, who collaborated with Wilson at Earthworks. “Across the industry, methane emissions have been underestimated for a long time. There aren’t many of us doing this work, we are spread pretty thin, but the cameras have been pivotal to allow us to see how many pollution events are really happening.”

Methane hunting is a far cry from the quiet life Wilson imagined after leaving her data job in the fossil fuel industry and moving to a 42-acre plot in Wise County, northwest of Dallas. Back then, the sounds she cherished were the yips of coyotes and the laughter of her son, Adam, as they lay under the Texas sky tracing constellations onto paper.

That contentment was shattered by the advance of technology that turned the United States into the world’s oil and gas superpower: fracking. The method, which involves horizontal drilling deep underground to dislodge oil and gas from tightly-packed rock formations—first took hold in the 1990s near Wilson’s home atop the Permian Basin, a vast, mineral-rich formation stretching across western Texas and New Mexico that has since become the epicenter of America’s fracking boom.

It was in the early 2000s when Wilson began to notice towers of light so bright they washed out the stars. Adam, only 10 years old, wrote “they murdered the stars” in an essay for school. Disturbed, Wilson began snapping photos of drilling sites multiplying around her. She posted the images on a blog, which caught the attention of neighbors who shared with Wilson complaints of skin lesions, headaches, and tremors they blamed on nearby wells. One man even filmed a jet of flame erupting from his garden hose, claiming methane had seeped into his water supply.

Wilson had complaints of her own, too. “My air turned brown, and eventually so did my water,” she said. “At first, it just disappeared. I didn’t have any water. The house was shaking because there was air in the pipes. I suspect it was methane. It would come out of the faucet like a sharp burst of air, but no water, and then this big blob of black stuff plopped in my sink. After days, it [the water] started running gray and sandy.”

Wilson couldn’t prove fracking was the cause, but the experience perturbed her enough to move nearly an hour away to Denton, Texas, where she threw herself into activism. In 2014, she helped rally residents to vote for the state’s first ban on fracking within city limits—a victory swiftly overturned by the Texas Legislature the following year.

It was around that time that Wilson persuaded Earthworks to buy her the optical gas-imaging camera that came to define her campaign. She also took an industry course to learn how to use the camera. “The instructor kept quiet about who I was because they probably would’ve killed me,” she said, realizing then that the camera could become her most powerful tool. “People have a very strong reaction to those images. They’re just immediately either very angry or shocked.”

The backlash to Wilson’s work has been fierce. She says she’s been run off the road, threatened with violence, and warned her family would be taken out “Chicago style.” One commenter on Wilson’s blog told her to “remove this video before I remove your jaw.” Others, she said, have doxxed her online, posting her home address among many personal details.

Wilson suspects the industry’s hand in some of the harassment. She points to two lawsuits she believes were Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation—or SLAPP—suits meant to silence her. The Texas Oil and Gas Association, the state’s main industry group, did not respond to a request for comment on these or other allegations related to fracking.

Wilson presses on, alhough she stopped sending her videos and other evidence to the state regulator. She argues the agency is too supine to the interests of oil and gas companies to act. “The Texas Council for Environmental Quality views its responsibilities to ensure compliance as a priority and thoroughly and diligently investigates allegations of noncompliance, including citizen complaints,” a spokesman for TCEQ, the state regulator, told Atmos.

When it comes to methane, however, there is little for regulators to enforce. The Biden administration sought to strengthen oversight, but many of those efforts were rolled back under President Donald Trump. Earlier this year, a proposed fee on methane emissions was scrapped, and companies were granted extensions on several rules aimed at reducing leaks—which the Environmental Protection Agency called “an important step in unleashing the nation’s domestic energy supply.”

Despite being a lesser-known cousin of carbon dioxide, methane packs far greater heat-trapping power. It is responsible for around one-third of all global heating since pre-industrial times; alarmingly, its atmospheric levels have been rising at an accelerating rate since around 2006, driven by fracking, faster decomposition in wetlands, and the expansion of livestock farming, particularly cattle.

Around a quarter of methane emissions in the U.S. come from the oil and gas sector. Rather than capture and sell the emissions to make natural gas, many producers in places like the Permian Basin choose to vent the gas and release it in a bid to keep costs low and the methane invisible—that is, until Wilson’s camera makes it seen. Some methane escapes through leaky pipes. The flares that burn atop wells, a process known as flaring, convert methane into carbon dioxide, preventing the more potent gas from escaping directly into the atmosphere. But while flaring destroys methane, it still releases carbon dioxide, adding to overall greenhouse pollution.

The industry insists it has made progress in reducing methane leaks. But environmental groups claim the emissions are far higher than official figures suggest. The Permian Basin alone releases around 1.4 million metric tons of methane each year, all of which is essentially wasted, drifting into the shared atmosphere and deepening the climate crisis. “This really should be the low-hanging fruit of the climate problem,” said Amy Townsend-Small, a researcher and professor in the School of Environment and Sustainability at the University of Cincinnati. “Instead, the emissions rates are getting faster and faster, which is a scary thing for our climate. There are a lot of methane sources from human activities, but [methane leaks from oil and gas wells] are so obvious and clear to cut back on.”

Wilson sees little chance of reform under the Trump administration, so she has turned her focus abroad, speaking with lawmakers and activists from Mexico and the European Union to Japan about methane’s dangers. After all, some world leaders are already pushing for a binding global pact to slash methane, much as the Montreal Protocol once phased out CFCs and saved the ozone layer. “We need binding objectives on methane,” French President Emmanuel Macron said at a climate summit in New York in September. “We know that this is a reachable goal. This is the best way to reduce our emissions.”

That kind of talk gives Wilson a measure of hope. “For a long time, I didn’t think that it was moving the needle,” she said. “And I don’t know if it’s moving it enough, but I do feel like what we’re doing now, what Oilfield Witness is doing, is making a difference.” Still, for Wilson, the ultimate goal isn’t tighter methane rules—it’s an end to the age of combustion itself. “We have to stop burning things,” she added. “We just don’t need to burn things for energy anymore.”",https://atmos.earth/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Atmos_WIDE_SarahKarlan_MethaneHunters-16_hor-1280x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:11:31.562949

Labour argues that clean power will generate cheaper, more secure energy and support hundreds of thousands of new jobs. But Reform and the Conservatives blame the UK’s climate targets for rising energy bills and job losses, and Nigel Farage accuses the government of “deindustrialising Britain” by pursuing net zero.

Decarbonisation does not mean deindustrialisation: in many places it can be the opposite. IPPR research suggests green industries will revitalise communities that were devastated by the dramatic decline of manufacturing and heavy industry in the Eighties and Nineties. The north and Midlands could manufacture globally competitive wind turbines, heat pumps and green transport.

But it’s not straightforward. Some industries will change substantially as businesses adopt green technologies and others – especially oil and gas – will shrink, disrupting people’s livelihoods. Deindustrialisation in the 20th century led to hardship and disaffection; its legacy may be fuelling the rise of radical-right populism in “left behind” communities. Any hint of a repeat could be politically ruinous. Policy choices aren’t all win-win, because the interests of consumers and the energy workforce aren’t perfectly aligned.

Ed Miliband’s pledge to consumers is cheaper, more abundant energy generated by renewables. But the affordability of clean energy depends on the cost of building out renewables, which is partly determined by the labour costs incurred by energy companies. In our privatised energy market, the pursuit of an abundance of clean energy jobs may jar with the economics of providing cheap renewable energy if labour intensity comes at the expense of capital efficiency.

How should the government navigate these trade-offs fairly? Miliband’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has announced a raft of policies focused on the energy workforce. Its offer to energy workers is clear: the government is working to create abundant clean-energy jobs and is supporting oil and gas workers to access them, in Aberdeen for example.

Should ministers go further? Unions and researchers, including IPPR, have estimated that it would cost around £1.1bn to retrain millions of workers whose jobs will be affected this decade by net zero. In a highly constrained fiscal environment, the prospect of the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, stumping up that kind of cash seems unlikely.

Ultimately, the government must define what constitutes a “fair transition” and relentlessly pursue it. Miliband should remain bullish about the potential for renewables to provide secure and plentiful energy. Weaning our energy system off gas will make us less reliant on volatile global supply chains and hostile autocratic states – the public understands this. Ministers should also compel businesses to play their part. Oil and gas companies bear as much responsibility for the fate of their workforce – whose skills have buoyed their margins and whose livelihoods are now disrupted as investment is pulled out of the North Sea – as the state does for deliberately accelerating the industry’s decline.

With climate policy intensely politicised, the government’s judgement should be guided by what is most likely to keep the public onside. After a punishing cost-of-living crisis, the surest way to convince Britons that it’s in their interests to tackle climate change may be to cut their energy bills.",https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/11/10/gettyimages-2173950270-800x418.jpg?1762795398,N,,2025-11-10 14:05:25.235512

Found in everyday products and industrial applications, these persistent substances raise serious questions about their long-term impact on health and the environment.

Dr Kourtchev offers expert insights into how these chemicals behave, why they are so difficult to manage, and the challenges of tackling their widespread presence across the UK.

Can you explain what forever chemicals are and why they’re called that?

Forever chemicals are a term used to describe a large group of manufactured substances, also known as PFAS, which stands for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. They’re used in everyday products like non-stick cookware and waterproof clothing.

They’re called forever chemicals because they don’t easily break down in the environment or in our bodies. They can persist for years, even decades, which raises concerns about their potential health effects.

What industries and products are they most commonly used in?

They’ve been used in a huge range of applications – everything from pizza boxes and non-stick cookware to waterproof materials like Gore-Tex used in outdoor clothing.

Some of these chemicals have been phased out, but others have been reintroduced. For example, industries used to rely on long-chain PFAS, which were found to be very toxic. They then substituted them with shorter-chain PFAS, assuming they’d be safer.

But later studies showed that the shorter-chain versions can be just as harmful – perhaps a bit less persistent in the environment, but still potentially toxic. There are more than 5,000 known PFAS compounds, but only two or three are currently being regulated.

What are the potential health implications of these chemicals?

Based on the scientific literature, PFAS have been linked to hormone (endocrine) disruption, suppression of the immune system, and several types of cancer.

The challenge is that most of this data comes from just a small subset of PFAS that have been studied — and we know there are thousands more that haven’t been tested.

So there could be many effects we don’t even know about yet, given how many of these chemicals exist.

How do these forever chemicals end up in our water systems? Are there particular entry points that are especially concerning?

In my research group, we study wastewater treatment systems, which are often seen as repositories for liquid waste. We also investigate the atmospheric fate of PFAS, an area that is not only under-researched, but also largely neglected by regulators, as most existing regulations focus on water and soil. Unfortunately, current treatment technologies aren’t designed to remove PFAS effectively.

In some cases, treatment processes can actually break long-chain PFAS into shorter-chain forms, which are still not removed and continue into the water stream. So, PFAS can pass straight through treatment plants and enter rivers, lakes, and other water bodies.

You mentioned that treatment systems can’t currently remove them — are water companies developing new technologies to tackle that?

Yes, absolutely, and I don’t think we should blame the water industry — they’re under significant pressure to meet regulations, and as new evidence emerges, they’re actively developing better techniques.

Some companies are experimenting with carbon-based methods that can absorb PFAS. Because PFAS are water-repellent, they tend to stick to surfaces — like algae or other materials in the water rather than staying dissolved.

So, water companies are now working on absorption and filtration techniques to capture them. But the main challenge is that PFAS are incredibly stable.

Traditional treatment systems were never designed to deal with chemicals like these, which means they often slip through the process. We’re still in the early stages of tackling this environmental threat, so it’s not just about blaming water companies — they need support.

A recent BBC report suggests that around six million people in the UK could be at risk of PFAS in their drinking water. Are there certain regions more affected, or is this a nationwide issue?

The Environment Agency published a report last year identifying more than 10,000 potential PFAS ‘hotspots’ across the UK.

It’s not confined to one area – contamination can occur anywhere. For example, one major source is aqueous film-forming foams used in firefighting. Older versions of these foams contained PFAS, so areas near airports or firefighting training sites are often contaminated.

So, certain industries and sites should be prioritised when tackling contamination?

Exactly, and this isn’t just a UK problem – it’s global. For instance, in North Carolina in the US, one company was accused of contaminating large areas with PFAS. People living near affected plants had much higher PFAS levels in their blood compared to the general population.

Because PFAS accumulate in our bodies over time, even small, continuous exposures can become significant. For one common PFAS compound – perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) – the estimated half-life in humans is up to three years. That’s a long time for something potentially harmful to stay in your system.

Short-term exposure might not cause immediate effects, but long-term, consistent exposure through contaminated water or air could lead to serious health issues.

How would you assess the UK’s response compared to other countries? Do we need stronger regulation or more government support?

We definitely need more testing. If you look at global PFAS pollution maps, you’ll see many red zones across Europe. But in some areas, there’s no data — not because PFAS aren’t present, but because no one’s measuring them. So the first step is investment in monitoring. Without evidence, governments can’t act.

The UK is catching up, but countries like the US are further ahead because they’ve gathered more data. Once they had that evidence, they introduced stricter regulations — and many US states have now banned the production of certain PFAS compounds. By 2030, several companies have committed to stopping PFAS manufacturing entirely.

Therefore, we need to follow that example — conduct more testing to understand the scale of the problem, and then build regulations around the evidence. But it’s a massive challenge. For example, a report from Belgium, one of the most PFAS-contaminated countries in Europe, estimated that cleaning up all affected land would cost more than the country’s entire GDP.

Realistically, can we ever completely tackle this issue, or is it more about mitigation now?

That’s a very good, and also quite philosophical, question. I don’t think we should aim to eliminate PFAS entirely – they do have valuable uses, particularly in medicine, for example, in implants where stability is essential.

They were designed to be durable — that’s both their strength and their flaw. So rather than banning all PFAS, we need to strike a balance: restrict their use to essential applications and prevent unnecessary use in everyday products.

Simply replacing one group of chemicals with another won’t solve the problem. We need smarter regulation and a better understanding of the alternatives.",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2328374295.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 14:06:16.467086

Climate action is not only a moral responsibility—it’s an economic necessity. The global shift to a low-carbon economy is accelerating, changing how growth happens and where capital flows. To stay competitive, Canada must catalyse investment across clean and conventional sectors so our industries can meet the world’s rising demand for low-carbon products and energy. In the face of global uncertainty, Canada’s new government is focused on what we can control. How we respond to the challenge of climate disruptions will influence Canada's economic competitiveness, drive new investment opportunities, and shape our global standing for generations to come. Canada must take action to fight climate change, drive down emissions, and invest in building the economy of the future.

Today, the Honourable Adam van Koeverden, Secretary of State (Sport), echoed the announcement highlighting Canada’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy—a strategy based on driving investment and achieving results. Building on Canada's competitive advantages and global standing as a clean energy superpower, the strategy will strengthen our economy by:

strengthening industrial carbon pricing

providing clarity on regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

boosting clean economy investment through tax credits

supporting critical minerals projects

mobilising capital for the transition to net-zero

developing new metrics to track our success.

The Climate Competitiveness Strategy will help Canada build the strongest economy in the G7. With this strategy, we can leverage Canada’s unique strengths—like our abundant natural resources and innovation in clean technology—to attract investment, create good jobs in communities across the country, and ensure Canada continues to be competitive on the world stage. Every step we take to build infrastructure, train workers, and support innovation in this is an investment in Canada’s long-term prosperity.

The strategy will create the conditions to propel Canada’s competitive advantage through investments in clean growth technologies. By investing in innovation and scaling homegrown solutions, we will position Canadian companies to lead. We will leverage Canadian clean technology to reduce the emissions intensity of the energy we generate, and the products and resources we produce. This will both address climate change and open more economic opportunities internationally.

Canada has the assets to lead and seize the tremendous opportunities of the historic transformation towards low-carbon energy, growing jobs and improving affordability across the economy.

A solution is to use electricity generated by solar and wind power to power an electrolyzer, a device that splits water into hydrogen and oxygen. Hydrogen then can be stored, transported, and ultimately converted into electricity and water through fuel cells.

Developing a skilled workforce with knowledge of hydrogen technologies will be essential to expanding the hydrogen economy, Teixeira said.

“Massachusetts is investing in industry-academic collaborations aimed at improving the state’s energy resiliency, and hydrogen will play a big role in expanding economic activity,” Teixeira said. “The people we train will become workers for emerging and established hydrogen companies in Massachusetts.”

The WPI-led team will work with community colleges in Massachusetts to recruit the first cohort of 13 students for the training program before the end of 2025. Mortazavi hopes to attract a wide range of applicants, including first-generation college students, veterans, and people from low-income families.

Students selected for the program will receive stipends and spend about four weeks in training focused on hydrogen safety, production, use, and infrastructure manufacturing. The cohort will train in laboratories at WPI and at the Center for Advanced Manufacturing Systems at Western New England University.

Students then will be placed in internships with corporate partners for about three months. After their internships, students will have access to mentoring, career counseling, and other job placement services at WPI.

The program aims to equip students with the technical and practical skills needed to secure jobs across the hydrogen energy sector. Potential roles could include fuel cell and electrolyzer technicians or engineers and hydrogen infrastructure specialists.

“A critical element of this training program is the collaboration across academic disciplines at WPI and among WPI, other educational institutions, industry partners, regional workforce and clean energy organizations, and federal agencies,” Mortazavi said. “The program brings together the mechanical and chemical engineering programs, with support from several WPI offices and external partners, to offer a holistic experience for participants who might otherwise face barriers to finding jobs in emerging technology fields.”",https://www.wpi.edu/sites/default/files/2025-11/NDZ_6430-Edit.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:09:47.674011

Rising energy prices will continue to resonate with voters as a major problem requiring serious solutions.
Voters’ preferred solution to address energy affordability is clear: building more solar and storage, the fastest and most affordable forms of energy to add to the grid.
Solar energy is a winner at the ballot box.","In the months leading up to Election Day on Tuesday, November 4, fast-rising electricity prices — and what to do about them — emerged as a priority issue for voters around the country.

Soon after the polls closed and the results came rolling in, it became clear that supporting solar and storage to lower costs is more than just good policy. It’s good politics, too.

In race after race, voters elected candidates who made lowering electricity costs through investing in solar and storage a central tenet of their messaging and policy platforms. And some candidates learned the hard way that if you shy away from solar and storage, voters will shy away from you.

In New Jersey, where electricity prices skyrocketed roughly 20% this summer, exit polls showed a whopping 87% of voters considered electricity costs to be a problem. Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill won by running on an energy affordability platform that includes many of SEIA’s suggested solutions to help lower prices: growing capacity by investing in cheap, quick-to-deploy solar; streamlining permitting to reduce energy projects’ soft costs that quickly add up; promoting community solar; and expanding battery storage. Sherrill also promised to declare a “state of emergency on energy costs.”

In Virginia — the data center capital of the world, where power prices have surged 13% in the past year — Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger and many candidates for the Virginia House of Delegates won decisive victories by embracing solar and storage to lower people’s bills. Spanberger’s energy affordability plan includes expanding and incentivizing solar development in certain places like brownfields, rooftops, parking lots, and public buildings; deploying more energy storage; implementing Virtual Power Plants to take better advantage of existing distributed energy resources; and reducing costs for consumers “by speeding up timelines to bring new projects online.”

A similar story occurred in the race for two of five seats on Georgia’s Public Service Commission, the board that regulates the state’s utility companies and the rates they charge for electricity. Challengers Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson ousted incumbents in landslide victories by focusing on the need to lower utility bills and invest in clean, reliable energy.

Rising energy prices will continue to resonate with voters as a major problem requiring serious solutions.

In 2026, we will see elections for 36 Governor’s seats, 35 U.S. Senate seats, and every single U.S. House district — and voters will continue to gravitate to candidates that offer a clear, pragmatic strategy to lower their electricity bills. Voters in nine states (Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, and South Dakota) have the chance to decide on 14 commissioners to serve on their respective state utility commissions.

A recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that 76% of U.S. adults are concerned about their electricity bills — with 36% saying these costs are “major” concern. Customers in the PJM power grid territory, which serves more than 65 million people across 13 states, will see another spike in their bills next June.

If this Administration continues to block solar and storage projects from adding affordable, reliable energy to the grid, and energy intensive data centers and AI continue to proliferate, Americans’ electric bills will continue to rise. And voters will continue to demand solutions to increase energy supply and drive down costs.

Voters’ preferred solution to address energy affordability is clear: building more solar and storage, the fastest and most affordable forms of energy to add to the grid.

Solar energy is a winner at the ballot box. All policymakers and candidates for office in 2026 would be wise to follow the blueprint laid out by this year’s winners and prioritize lowering people’s electricity bills by expanding solar and storage.",https://seia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_537638398.webp,N,,2025-11-10 11:09:51.547989

Voters approved three pro-business tax amendments on Election Day, ensuring that the Lone Star State can never impose taxes on capital gains, estates or inheritances, and certain securities transactions.

While Texas doesn't currently levy these taxes, the new constitutional amendments make that tax certainty permanent, sending a signal to investors and corporations that the state’s low-tax structure is here to stay.

WHY MAJOR FINANCIAL FIRMS ARE EXPANDING TEXAS PRESENCE BEYOND TRADITIONAL WALL STREET HUB

""These votes make it clear that Texas’ low-tax structure isn’t just policy, it’s now permanent,"" Carliss Chatman, a law professor at Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law, told FOX Business. ""Whereas other states try to lure an Amazon or Facebook with temporary tax breaks or incentives, Texas doesn’t have to because we would never charge those taxes anyway. The incentives here are permanent, and now it’s unconstitutional for the state to start taxing you.""

Here’s what the three measures mean:

Capital gains tax ban: Prevents Texas from ever taxing profits from the sale of investments, real estate, or other capital assets, a move meant to reassure investors and entrepreneurs.

Securities transaction tax ban: Bars the state from imposing taxes on financial trades or payroll transactions, effectively ruling out a ""Wall Street tax"" on buying or selling stocks.

Estate and inheritance tax ban: Prohibits any future taxation on wealth transfers after death, a safeguard for business owners and families looking to pass assets to heirs.

NYSE COMING TO TEXAS AS LONE STAR STATE CONTINUES TO ATTRACT BUSINESSES

That’s the message Texas is sending not only to the more than 200 companies that have moved their headquarters to the state since the COVID-19 pandemic, including Caterpillar, CBRE, Chevron, Hewlett Packard Enterprises, KFC and Oracle, but also to potential newcomers weighing relocation.

Critics argue that locking in these bans could hamstring future legislatures from raising revenue during economic downturns or to fund essential state services. It also forces the state to rely more heavily on property and sales taxes, which tend to hit middle- and lower-income residents harder.

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL SECTOR LOSING GROUND TO RIVALS

Supporters counter that Texas’ growing economy – now the eighth-largest in the world – generates more than enough revenue without such taxes, pointing to the state’s budget surplus and rapid job growth as evidence that low taxes can fuel prosperity rather than constrain it.

The timing is also strategic. The Texas Stock Exchange (TXSE), which recently secured SEC approval, is slated to open in Dallas in 2026, positioning itself as a direct challenger to the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq.

TXSE executives say the goal is to revitalize competition and attract more companies to go public by offering a more affordable and business-friendly listing environment. Over the past 25 years, the number of publicly traded companies in the U.S. has dropped by nearly 45%, according to the exchange, a decline it hopes to reverse.

Meanwhile, on both coasts, Democrats are taking the opposite approach. In California, a proposed ballot measure would impose a 5% wealth tax on high-net-worth residents to help fund the state’s Medicaid program — underscoring a growing divide in how states approach taxing success.

Global petrochemical hubs are contending with oversupply and shrinking margins, pressures that are eroding plant utilization and investor confidence.","Renewables paired with storage have overtaken new gas projects on cost in most major markets—from India to South Africa to Brazil. The IEA’s Renewables 2025 report concludes that nearly all new capacity this decade will be renewable.

The “age of electricity” has begun, with renewable generation surpassing coal generation for the first time, in the first half of 2025. This significant milestone is highlighted in Ember’s Global Electricity Review 2025. Grids worldwide are being rebuilt around clean power, and fossil generation is rapidly losing market share.

Clean power generated closer to where it’s used, together with modernized transmission lines and advanced battery storage, is proving more reliable and affordable than volatile gas markets. The next challenge is scaling these solutions fairly—streamlining approvals, partnering with local communities, and ensuring that clean energy investments deliver shared benefits for the households and regions that need them most. But unlocking this transition also depends on lowering the cost of capital, expanding access to finance and technology, and building local capacity to deploy and maintain new energy systems.

This transition is already reshaping global labor markets. According to the IEA, clean power was the single-largest source of new energy employment in 2023, accounting for 40 percent of total job growth across the clean energy sector. Roughly 21 million people now work in power generation, including 4.5 million in solar photovoltaics alone after another record year of job growth. Employment in grids and storage rose by 230,000 to reach eight million in 2023. Ensuring that fossil fuel workers and other vulnerable communities share in these expanding opportunities will be essential to delivering a just and inclusive transition.

Heavy industry—sectors like steel, cement, and chemicals, long viewed as being hard to abate—is beginning to see the rising use of electrification, clean hydrogen, and circular production models, guided by frameworks like the European Union Industrial Emissions Directive and the United Arab Emirates Just Transition Work Programme. Globally, the drivers of energy transition are transforming how these sectors compete and innovate in a clean energy economy.

An equally important frontier is tackling non-CO2 greenhouse gases from methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases. The Global Methane Pledge—now endorsed by 159 countries and the European Commission—has catalyzed momentum for methane abatement across energy and industry. Progress is visible from the local to the global levels:

In the United States, New Mexico’s methane regulations have driven down oil and gas emissions, cutting the state’s methane intensity to less than half that of Texas.

The Global Methane Hub’s $10 million initiative to help cities in Latin America and the Caribbean curb methane emissions is accelerating regional action.

And at the same time, leaders like Prime Minister Mia Mottley of Barbados continue to push for a legally binding global methane pact, highlighting the growing political will despite implementation challenges.

China's decision to include methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated gases in its latest national commitment adds further momentum, broadening the base for industrial emissions reductions worldwide. At the same time, significant progress on hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) phasedowns under the Montreal Protocol and Kigali Amendment reinforces how cooperative global action on short-lived climate pollutants can deliver fast results—a theme underscored as the Montreal Protocol meetings coincide with the first week of COP30.

Reducing methane leaks, eliminating industrial nitrous oxide, and improving process efficiency are now core performance metrics for manufacturing companies competing in a global market that values transparency and compliance. By cutting these emissions early, countries and companies are lowering costs, building more resilient supply chains, and positioning themselves ahead of tightening global production standards.

The petrochemicals sector—once touted as oil’s “last growth market”—is now facing a structural overbuild. Derived from oil and gas, petrochemicals are used to make plastics, fertilizers, and countless manufactured goods that were once seen as the oil and gas industry’s next frontier. But new data show that global petrochemical supply capacity is expanding faster than demand, driving down margins and utilization rates. Global petrochemical hubs are contending with oversupply and shrinking margins, pressures that are eroding plant utilization and investor confidence.

Policy reforms are beginning to shift the petrochemical sector toward greater efficiency and circularity, but progress remains uneven and too slow. In many countries, energy efficiency standards for petrochemical plants are being updated, yet most remain voluntary or lack enforcement—limiting their impact on fuel use and emissions. At the same time, subsidies and tax breaks for new fossil-based facilities continue to drive excess capacity, locking in high emissions and financial risk. Industrial policies are starting to incorporate recycling and resource-efficiency targets, but they still largely prioritize export growth and cheap feedstocks over deep decarbonization, leaving circular-economy and climate goals only partially aligned.

Governments should strengthen efficiency standards, quickly end subsidies and tax breaks that encourage excessive petrochemical production, and align industrial policy with circular-economy and climate goals. Policies that reward recycled feedstocks and verified emissions reductions can stabilize markets while cutting harmful pollution and waste.

For investors, the message is clear: The petrochemical build-out has overshot realistic demand for these products. The next decade will reward optimization of existing facilities—through efficiency gains, lower emissions, and smarter resource use—rather than new capacity built mainly to prop up continued oil and gas extraction.

At the 2025 U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP30), countries have a unique opportunity to challenge fossil-fueled optimism—and the outsize influence of industry lobbyists within the U.N. climate talks—and to confront the realities of climate implementation. The credibility of global oil and gas demand will be tested not by models but by how decisively countries deliver on their Paris Agreement commitments in this decade.

Leaders can help turn ambition into measurable progress—by scaling up renewable power, protecting and restoring nature-based carbon sinks, and accelerating cuts in methane, fluorinated refrigerants, and other non-CO2 pollutants. COP30 must demonstrate that implementation delivers tangible results: cleaner energy, stronger economies, and fairer outcomes for communities, including the final ending of harmful subsidies that keep fossil fuels artificially competitive.

The oil and gas industry’s growth story rests on assumptions already undermined by technology, markets, and policy. Key economies shaping the COP30 agenda, from Brazil and major Asian economies to the European Union, are turning from fossil fuel expansion toward real delivery on clean energy and climate goals. The most resilient economies will be those building the next energy era—one that’s defined by efficiency, electrification, and innovation that delivers opportunity for people and communities.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/oil-refinery-air-pollution-communities-mississippi-river-chalmette-louisiana-91db4d3aab.jpg?h=7a7e2eb2&itok=2PzqPIXW,N,,2025-11-10 11:09:55.330035

Notably, one of the US’s largest solar projects, the 6.2GW Esmerelda project in Nevada, was cancelled last month after the Bureau of Land Management scrapped its environmental review, a key part of the permitting process.

Solar and other clean energy technologies have faced growing political headwinds from president Donald Trump’s government, with the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill passed over the summer scaling back the availability of tax credits brought in under the previous government. This is despite solar and storage being widely regarded as the quickest to meet the burgeoning demand for power from AI, data centres and manufacturing.

Based on an analysis of data from the US Energy Information Administration, SEIA stated that 73GW of solar and 43GW of planned storage projects had not yet received all necessary federal, state, and local permits to proceed and thus faced being stuck in “limbo”.

It said that 18 states have over 50% of their planned electricity capacity at risk of being blocked. Many of these states, including Texas, Virginia, Arizona, and Nevada, are expected to lead the country in data centre growth. For example, in Texas, SEIA said over 44GW of solar and storage projects are at risk between now and 2030, accounting for nearly 40% of the country’s at-risk projects.

“Despite declaring an ‘energy emergency’, this administration is threatening half of planned power from reaching the grid. America’s solar and storage industry is ready to build, save customers money, and strengthen the grid. We just need Washington to get out of the way,” SEIA said in a statement.

SEIA stated that actions by the administration, including enhanced federal permitting rules, the cancellation of grid upgrades and the creation of uncertainty in the American energy market, meant projects were being cancelled or facing extensive delays. Notably, one of the US’s largest solar projects, the 6.2GW Esmerelda project in Nevada, was cancelled last month after the Bureau of Land Management scrapped its environmental review, a key part of the permitting process.

“Under Washington’s new energy permitting bureaucracy, projects large and small are being trapped in limbo. And this extends well beyond projects on public lands. Many solar and storage projects located partially or entirely on private property are now being entangled in a myriad of federal reviews,” SEIA said.

The trade body said that developers who have already secured local zoning approvals, completed environmental studies and worked closely on projects with nearby communities are finding they are unable to move forward because their projects must still consult with federal agencies before construction can begin.

“This federal overreach erodes private property rights and local decision-making, inserting Washington bureaucrats into projects that landowners and communities want to host,” SEIA said. “It sends a chilling message to landowners, farmers, ranchers, and private investors that even if you play by the rules, the federal government can still pull the plug. This federal red tape also undermines the energy security and policy certainty that businesses need to plan for the future.”",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/arevon-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:10:18.107081

For water and electric utilities, it is critical to communicate with customers about potential leaks, rate changes and outages. Speed and clarity are essential to ensuring water is not wasted and customers know about outages. This boosts customer satisfaction.

Until recently, the water services department for the city of Bryan, Texas, communicated with its customers about these issues by calling or sending field crews to homes and putting door hangers on their doorknobs, said Kala Jeske, a data specialist with the city’s water services department.

With this communication system, the water services department often needed to field phone calls from customers with questions about issues such as outages. In addition, sending field crews door-to-door tied up personnel and resources such as trucks.

But in the spring of 2024, the department transitioned to using TextPower, which can send automated texts or allow users to manually send group texts. The water services department began receiving fewer phone calls from customers. Fewer employees and trucks were dispatched to the field. Customers said they liked the change to texting.

“We’ve received a lot of positive feedback from customers,” said Jeske.

“For outage notifications, typically our field staff went door to door with door tags. Now we can push out alerts to those customers,” said Jeske. Those alerts – which could include notifications about work being done on the water system – reduce the number of calls from customers about irregularities such as bubbles in the water.

Texting is also yielding efficiencies for the city’s electric utility – Bryan Texas Utilities (BTU). BTU has a separate account with TextPower because BTU has customers not served by the water department.

“There are several benefits to texting,” said Meagan Brown, public information officer at BTU. “From the utility perspective, TextPower replaces some manual labor so we can explore other ways to improve the system.” Additionally, in the digital age, customers expect communication about outages to be as immediate as possible. “This makes for happier customers,” she said.

Texting not only saves time and resources, but it can also boost the response rate from customers.

In fact, one of TextPower’s other city customers was using postcards and emails to reach customers and only yielding an 8% response rate. By using text, the response rate jumped to over 50%.

The city of Bryan’s water services department is now learning about how to best take advantage of texting, said Jeske.

To inform customers of water leaks, the city uses TextPower’s Group Tag feature to text groups of customers that have been flagged as having continuous water usage, which can be caused by a leak.

“I manually push out an alert,” Jeske said. “We don’t want to automatically push them out in case the leak has stopped.”

Communicating quickly about leaks – allowing customers and the utility to take swift action – benefits both the utility and the customer by significantly reducing wasted water and saving money.

“We have another customer that saves tens of thousands of gallons of water every month from early leak detection alert programs,” said Mark Nielsen, TextPower’s co-founder & Executive Chairman.

The city of Bryan also uses the TextPower platform to communicate about upcoming water outages or unplanned outages.

In the past, the water department hung door tags on doorknobs to inform customers of these issues, said Jeske. Being informed as early as possible about upcoming outages – caused by contractors interconnecting new water customers nearby, for example – gives customers time to find alternative sources of water such as bottled water. And that improves customer satisfaction.

Along with alerting customers about leaks and outages, a water department’s messaging must also include communication with crews in the field.

The city of Bryan’s water department has equipped its field crews with iPads to help with this effort. With the iPads, crew members can use TextPower to draw a circle around an area experiencing outages and send group texts to the customers living within that circle.

“We added a point for each location and included customer contact information,” said Jeske. “Crews can pull up a map on an iPad and draw a shape around the houses they want to send notifications to. It will build a list of phone numbers and they can push their alerts out in one group.”

This helps ensure that the water department reaches only the right customers with appropriate information, and doesn’t contact unaffected customers.

Just as important, the city’s water department can also send a message informing customers that their water service has been restored. The message might also tell customers that they should flush their lines if there’s sediment in their water. This also reduces the numbers of calls from customers, saving time and resources and improving customer satisfaction.

Currently, the water department is rolling out TextPower slowly so it can gather feedback as it deploys the system. “We went live the first week in June. Long term, we plan to expand our outreach,” said Jeske.

To help customers understand the transition to texting, the water services department deployed a social media campaign to address customers’ initial confusion over receiving texts.

“Once we got over that, people were appreciative,” Jeske said.

Next summer, the water department’s outreach efforts might include sending alerts about wastewater rate setting. The rates are based on water usage in December, January and February. The goal is for customers to understand in advance that conserving water during that time frame will lower their rates.

“We want to do conservation notices when we get into wastewater rate setting so customers are not surprised if rates change,” Jeske said. “Some customers irrigate year-round, and it affects their water rates. They can lower their rates by conserving.”

Water utilities have a number of other ways to take advantage of TextPower. They include account shut-off notifications, payment due reminders, disaster emergencies, boil water alerts, service appointment reminders, pipe corrosion inspection notifications and real-time customer surveys.

Such features allow water utilities to streamline communications, better inform customers – boosting satisfaction – and improve efficiency, all while substantially reducing operating costs.

Like the water utility, the city of Bryan’s electric utility is also using TextPower to get messages to customers quickly, said Brown. The electric utility has a separate TextPower account because BTU has more customers, and some of those customers aren’t served by the water utility. In addition, separating the two accounts allows customers to opt out of texts from either the water utility or BTU. It also allows the two departments to be billed by TextPower separately, so that TextPower’s text fees can be properly allocated to each department.

“We don’t want to mix the two departments,” said Brown. The water department has about 20,000 customers, and BTU has 68,000 customers, one-third of whom are located in rural areas.

Because all of BTU’s meters are smart meters, BTU can automate its TextPower messages. BTU does this by linking the TextPower platform with BTU’s outage management system, allowing the system to communicate directly with TextPower, Brown said. Again, that’s a timesaver for the utility.

The ability to integrate existing software with TextPower is available to all TextPower customers through a comprehensive set of APIs. “TextPower gives utilities a great deal of flexibility to utilize texting and integrate it with in-house or third-party software,” said Mark Nielsen, executive chairman and co-founder of TextPower.

Before BTU began using TextPower to inform customers of outages, the utility would rely on communicating with local media and posting on social media to get the word out.

Now, if a large number of customers are affected by an outage, TextPower will send a message telling the customers that BTU is aware of an outage in the area and instructs them to visit the company website for updates about the outage. Once power has been restored, TextPower notifies customers.

“We use a logic-based algorithm,” Brown said. “If it detects an outage on a device – fuses, breakers, transformers – and 15 people are affected, TextPower will send a text to the people affected.”

Using TextPower, users can report outages by merely sending a one-word text message: “Out.”

Such messaging is critical during storm-related emergencies, which are growing in frequency.

When Hurricane Beryl hit Texas in July, BTU sent out 12,700 text messages. The utility had more than one outage, and some affected only two people, others impacted thousands, said Brown.

Without the ability to text customers, electric utilities often are inundated with calls during outages. Utilities have reported that using texting – rather than other communication modes – reduces the number of calls customers make to the utility by 70% or more, said Nielsen.

Speed is also an advantage. When an outage threat looms, texting helps get the word out as quickly as possible.

When Texas utilities experienced electricity shortages in the winter of 2021 during Winter Storm Uri, many utilities used TextPower to proactively communicate about rolling blackouts and ask customers to reduce their electricity usage, said Nielsen.

“Generally, it was very effective. There was a significant amount of usage by Texas utilities in communicating the need for load curtailment. Customers were very appreciative and more responsive to texts,” he said.

For BTU, outage text messaging generally takes place automatically, with no human interaction. In conjunction with the Outage Management System (OMS), TextPower can be used to communicate outages that are predicted or only verified outages.

This is important to BTU because the outage management system may predict outages on three lines, when an outage may only affect one line. This might result in sending messages to more people than just those who are out of power. By only sending a text after the outage is verified by BTU personnel, it provides more accurate information being delivered to the end customer.

“We have to use our best judgment,” Brown said.

BTU customers also receive texts about planned outages. If, for example, the utility has to replace a transformer that might impact 20 houses, Brown can instruct TextPower to text those homeowners before the event. In the past, BTU sent out crews to hang notices on doorknobs.

In the future, BTU may use TextPower to inform customers about curtailing load when BTU is facing high demand. Texting would help keep customers informed during such important events and help BTU grapple with the challenges of electricity shortages.

“Implementing TextPower has allowed us to better communicate and serve our community, which is our goal,” said Brown.",https://www.publicpower.org/themes/custom/appa_foundation/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-10 11:11:47.282310

GWEC’s Japan country manager Takeshi Matsuki said: “Japan holds vast offshore wind potential and cannot afford to miss its chance to become an offshore wind leader, especially within the Asia-Pacific region.
OWC’s Japan country manager Masataka Nakagawa said: “Japan stands at a pivotal moment in its clean energy transition, and offshore wind has emerged as a central pillar of its strategy.
The white paper sets out short-term and long-term recommendations focused on three key areas: auction reform, offtake mechanisms and market bottlenecks.
GWEC said its next step will be to establish a bridging forum to foster dialogue between government and industry, helping shape a transparent and predictable policy framework for Japan’s offshore wind expansion.","Japan must urgently reform its offshore wind auction system and establish a public-private forum to guide policy and investment if it is to regain momentum in its clean energy transition, according to a new white paper by the Global Wind Energy Council (GWEC) and renewable energy consultancy OWC.

The report, Unlocking Japan’s Offshore Wind Potential: Strategic Pathways to Overcome Market Bottlenecks and Drive Industrial Growth, warns that without structural changes to the current auction framework, Japan risks major delays in meeting its decarbonisation and energy security goals.

Japan has completed three rounds of offshore wind auctions to date, but the sole Round 1 bidder has since withdrawn, while the winners of Rounds 2 and 3 face severe financial pressure. The trajectory of these projects, GWEC said, highlights the need for “timely reform and a more effective auction design” that better reflects market realities.

GWEC’s Japan country manager Takeshi Matsuki said: “Japan holds vast offshore wind potential and cannot afford to miss its chance to become an offshore wind leader, especially within the Asia-Pacific region.

“To put the industry back on a growth trajectory, Japan must pursue auction reforms, reassess offtake mechanisms, and remove critical market bottlenecks. By taking these steps, there is no doubt that offshore wind will remain the backbone of Japan’s power mix on its path toward carbon neutrality by 2050.”

Matsuki said unlocking this potential would deliver “clean, affordable, and locally produced renewable energy,” while stimulating regional economies through job creation and new opportunities for coastal communities.

OWC’s Japan country manager Masataka Nakagawa said: “Japan stands at a pivotal moment in its clean energy transition, and offshore wind has emerged as a central pillar of its strategy.

“Recent developments have highlighted the need for structural and institutional reform to ensure project delivery and investor confidence. Timely auction reform, including evaluation criteria optimisation, will be key to accelerating capacity build-out.”

He added that improving offtake mechanisms such as price caps and shifting towards more bankable models — including two-sided Contracts for Difference or Feed-in Tariffs — would help align bids with market conditions, while addressing issues such as certification, curtailment and supply chain visibility would strengthen investor confidence.

The white paper sets out short-term and long-term recommendations focused on three key areas: auction reform, offtake mechanisms and market bottlenecks.

In the near term, GWEC and OWC propose retendering Japan’s Round 1 site and revising evaluation criteria for upcoming rounds to balance price and non-price factors. Longer-term changes include adopting a two-stage auction model and setting Commercial Operation Date-based targets to improve delivery timelines and support domestic manufacturing.

GWEC and OWC presented the findings to Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI), Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) and Ministry of Environment (MOE) in late October. The ministries have expressed strong interest in the report’s recommendations.

GWEC said its next step will be to establish a bridging forum to foster dialogue between government and industry, helping shape a transparent and predictable policy framework for Japan’s offshore wind expansion.",https://renews.biz/media/21127/credit_gwec-2.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-11-10 12:09:25.330449

Trump recently crowed about fellow billionaire Bill Gates’s apparent backtracking on climate action, posting on Truth Social: “I (WE!)
“Due to bigger countries’ indifference to climate action, we are off track on the 1.5C goal, and heading towards even more destructive impacts,” she said.
“No country, including the United States that is now being led by an anti-science, increasingly authoritarian Trump administration, can stop global climate action,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
“The question is, is it going to accelerate fast enough, given the dire space we’re in now with the climate crisis?","For years, countries around the world pressed the US to engage with them in addressing the climate crisis and to show it was serious about taking action. Now, with key United Nations climate talks under way in Brazil this week, other nations have been quietly hoping the US stays well away.

Under Donald Trump, who has called the climate crisis “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”, the US has not only pulled back from climate action but openly agitated for greater global fossil fuel use and for other countries to tear down their own climate policies.

“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” the US president told leaders at a UN speech in September. “You need strong borders and traditional energy sources if you are going to be great again.”

There was an air of relief among some diplomats, then, when the White House said that no high-level representatives would attend the Cop30 summit in Belém, Brazil, this week. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,” a White House spokesperson said.

American commitment to curb global heating has waxed and waned over the years but the US now appears to not only be uninterested, but actively fighting for the other side. “Before, it was benign neglect, even in Trump’s first term,” said a former senior state department official. “Now it’s quite the opposite. They don’t want to participate and don’t want others to, either.

“If the choice is no US or a US that is there as a spoiler, to wreck and disrupt things, then I think most countries would prefer there to be no US,” the former official added. “I mean, we are now to the right of Saudi Arabia, when you think about it. The Saudis negotiate hard but they are OK with the Paris agreement. They aren’t against the word ‘climate’.”

Trump was not, as expected, present at a leaders summit held last week as a curtain raiser for Cop30, although the US president loomed over the event, with the leaders of Colombia and Chile calling him a liar for his rejection of climate science.

The US position on climate has hit a nadir, more hostile than during Trump’s first term or under George W Bush, when the US refused to ratify the Kyoto protocol, according to Todd Stern, a lead climate negotiator for the US during Barack Obama’s presidency.

“The president has made it clear he wants to withdraw from the Paris agreement, so it doesn’t surprise me they aren’t sending anyone because they aren’t engaged in this,” Stern said. “I don’t think they would add anything useful. This is a much more aggressive administration now, across the board.”

Any sort of US presence at the Belém talks, where countries will work through new emissions-cutting targets and topics such as climate finance, could have repeated extraordinary scenes seen when countries met in London last month to rubber-stamp plans for a small levy on greenhouse gas emissions from shipping.

US representatives at the talks were accused of using bully-like behavior to force countries to drop the plan, reportedly issuing threats of higher fees for docking in American ports and even visa restrictions upon US travel for negotiators and their families. Trump had called the proposal a “global green new scam tax on shipping” and demanded it be blocked. The tactics appear to have paid off, with the pollution fee now delayed for at least a year.

“It would have had a microscopic effect on the US economy, particularly compared to Trump’s tariff warfare, and yet they went into full thug tactics to batter that down at the very last minute,” said Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democratic senator.

While the US is unlikely to show up in Brazil at all – the state department’s office that dealt with climate issues is now shuttered and there was no US presence at UN climate meetings in Germany and then Peru this year – Whitehouse said countries should still be wary of an “Al Capone-style attack” from the Trump administration at Cop30, possibly upon a European Union mechanism to tax imports based on the amount of planet-heating pollution they create.

“I think if you allow yourself to be intimidated by this administration, they will seize all the ground that you cede them, and then come back for more,” he said. “It’s only when you stop and fight and push back that you have a chance.”

Embracing an unapologetic “drill, baby, drill” approach, Trump has struck individual deals to ramp up fossil fuel production with countries such as Japan and South Korea, as well as extracting a promise from the European Union to purchase more US oil and gas.

The EU’s climate rules have been targeted by the White House, as have windfarms in the UK. “We don’t do wind because wind is a disaster,” Trump said during a press conference with Keir Starmer, the British prime minister, in September. “It’s a very expensive joke, frankly.”

Although Trump has torn up climate policies and halted renewable energy projects in the US, this is unlikely to stymie the energy switch globally. The world is set to build nearly 4,600 gigawatts of clean power between now and 2030, the International Energy Agency recently found, which is nearly double the amount built over the previous five-year period which was, in turn, double the amount installed in the five years before that.

“The thing about climate change is that you can’t hold back the waves,” said Stern. “There’s irreversible, strong, vigorous motion towards clean energy across the world.

“This administration might want to go back to the future but it’s not going to happen. The countries at Cop won’t be paying any attention to the United States at the national level.”

But Trump’s antipathy toward climate action is just the most pointed manifestation of a general malaise in global climate politics in recent years. Governments are more intent to be seen fighting inflation than carbon pollution and almost every country is not doing enough to cut emissions or provide finance to those worst affected by worsening floods, storms and droughts.

Some climate advocates have become drawn to other issues or have even downplayed the severity of the crisis. Trump recently crowed about fellow billionaire Bill Gates’s apparent backtracking on climate action, posting on Truth Social: “I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful. MAGA!!!”

The most vulnerable countries are now casting around to see whether any leaders will now step up. “The US’s withdrawal from the Paris agreement leaves a void that must urgently be filled,” said Ilana Seid, chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, which advocates for low-lying countries most threatened by a hotter world.

Seid said smaller, developing countries do not have the resources to recover from the sort of devastation wrought by enormous storms such as Hurricane Melissa, which last month smashed into Jamaica and was probably worsened by an overheated atmosphere and ocean.

“Due to bigger countries’ indifference to climate action, we are off track on the 1.5C goal, and heading towards even more destructive impacts,” she said. “This is a poignant illustration of the disproportionate, unjust effect on the vulnerable people who have contributed the least to climate change.”

The US government may be absent, but roughly 100 US governors, members of Congress and state and city officials will still go to Belém to argue that a vast chunk of the US is still committed to dealing with the climate crisis. The task at Cop30 will be to keep despair at bay, until a rapidly heating world can again focus on the climate emergency that is exacerbating many of the other problems now drawing attention.

“No country, including the United States that is now being led by an anti-science, increasingly authoritarian Trump administration, can stop global climate action,” said Rachel Cleetus, policy director at the Union of Concerned Scientists.

“The question is, is it going to accelerate fast enough, given the dire space we’re in now with the climate crisis? We have this rapidly shrinking window. The science is absolutely stark.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/350d61e62dcec4bd84b1bbc9858b606974c87caf/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6af0caaddda9b4601a0068f0b9300e5c",N,,2025-11-10 10:05:04.915588

Take Control of Your Indoor Air Air pollution research and regulatory frameworks continue evolving as administrations change and priorities shift.","The Environmental Protection Agency closed its Human Research Facility in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, during summer 2025, eliminating a unique laboratory that studied how air pollution affects human health through controlled exposure studies. This closure occurred months before a new health strategy from the Make America Healthy Again Commission recommended that EPA and the National Institutes of Health study air quality impacts on children's health.

The MAHA Commission Recommendations

The Make America Healthy Again Commission released a strategy document on September 10, 2025, containing 128 recommendations for improving health and addressing chronic diseases. According to reporting by Ariel Wittenberg for Politico, the strategy specifically states that EPA and the National Institutes of Health ""will study air quality impacts on children's health and utilize existing research programs to improve data collection and analysis.""

Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin unveiled the strategy at a press conference, with Zeldin stating the work would include ""the work of our chemicals, air and water programs."" Both officials referenced using ""gold standard science"" to fulfill the report's objectives.

At the announcement, Zeldin stated: ""Protecting human health and the environment while powering America's comeback isn't just about serving Americans today, it's about ensuring future generations inherit clean air, water, and the foundation for healthy lives.""

The Human Research Facility's Unique Capabilities

The Chapel Hill facility represented one of the only laboratories in the United States capable of conducting controlled human exposure studies to air pollution. Laura Kate Bender, vice president of nationwide advocacy and public policy at the American Lung Association, explained: ""It was one of the only places in the country where you could put humans in a chamber and measure their reaction to ozone. Those studies have long informed our understanding of how much of these pollutants are safe to breathe.""

The laboratory contained nine sealed chambers where volunteers agreed to exposure to air pollution at levels matching those found in major cities around the world. EPA researchers monitored volunteers' vital signs and collected blood samples, enabling them to uncover specific information about how different air pollutants—including ozone, vehicle exhaust, and wildfire smoke—impact human health.

Before the laboratory's establishment in the 1990s, epidemiologists could broadly link increased deaths to high levels of particulate matter in air. The Human Research Facility's controlled studies helped connect specific pollutants to specific health effects. For example, research at the facility linked exposure to particulate matter pollution to increased heart rates in people with preexisting cardiac conditions.

Research Applications and Regulatory Impact

The laboratory's research informed multiple aspects of public health protection. Studies conducted at the facility helped shape air quality alerts that notify the public when pollution levels pose health risks. The research also underpinned major federal air regulations, including those limiting smog-forming emissions.

The controlled exposure methodology allowed researchers to isolate specific pollutant effects that would be difficult or impossible to determine through observational studies alone. By exposing volunteers to known quantities of specific pollutants in controlled conditions, scientists could definitively establish causal relationships between exposures and physiological responses.

Betsy Southerland, who worked at EPA's Office of Science and Technology for 30 years and now volunteers for the Environmental Protection Network, stated: ""We had this state-of-the-art facility, and they canceled the lease.""

Broader Research Program Changes

Beyond closing the Human Research Facility, EPA moved to dissolve its Office of Research and Development during summer 2025. This action involved terminating a large proportion of staff and relocating others to a new Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions within the Office of the Administrator.

EPA press secretary Brigit Hirsch responded to questions about how EPA could fulfill the MAHA report's directives without these programs, stating: ""We are confident EPA has the resources needed to accomplish the agency's core mission of protecting human health and the environment and fulfill all statutory obligations.""

Hirsch added that the new applied science and environmental solutions office ""will align research and put science at the forefront of the agency's rulemakings.""

Regulatory Changes Affecting Air Emissions

Concurrent with the research program changes, EPA proposed modifications to regulations controlling emissions of various pollutants. The agency announced plans to rescind multiple air pollution limits established during previous administrations, including regulations controlling mercury emissions, smog-forming ozone, and fine particulate matter.

A carbon rule finalized in 2023 would have prevented an estimated 1,200 premature deaths, 870 hospital and emergency room visits, 1,900 new asthma diagnoses, and 360,000 asthma attacks in 2035 by limiting pollution of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, along with fine particulate pollution and smog-forming nitrogen oxides, according to EPA estimates at the time of finalization.

EPA announced it would rescind that regulation in March 2025, along with 11 other air pollution limits. One regulation targeted for rescission limited mercury emissions from power plants. If it had remained in place, that regulation would have reduced emissions of the neurotoxin by more than 16 percent by 2028, according to analysis by EPA scientists.

Scientific Community Perspectives

Phil Landrigan, an environmental epidemiologist and pediatrician who leads Boston College's Global Public Health Program, noted the extensive research foundation supporting mercury emission regulations. ""All of that is well-established science, there is nothing new there,"" he stated regarding the existing body of evidence on mercury's health impacts including increased asthma risk, heart disease, stroke, and brain damage.

Natural Resources Defense Council senior attorney John Walke characterized air quality and its health impacts as ""one of the most researched and studied and reported phenomena across the world.""

Laura Kate Bender of the American Lung Association summarized the situation: ""There will be more air pollution to study, and fewer funds and staff with which to do it.""

The University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture helps producers do just that through its Arkansas Discovery Farms Program.

The Discovery Farms team documents water quality, soil health, climate effects and resource use in research at 18 private farms across the state's diverse agricultural sectors. The team also provides demonstrations and educational outreach to promote sustainable farming.

""The overall goal of the program is to document sustainable and viable farming systems that remain cost-effective in an environmentally sound manner,"" said Mike Daniels, a distinguished professor in the crop, soil and environmental sciences department at the University of Arkansas.

Examples of climate change parameters the Discovery Farms team monitors in the network of private, working farms include greenhouse gases and soil carbon in poultry, livestock, row crops, forestry and horticulture operations.

At each site, Daniels said the team evaluates conservation practices based on the farm owner's priorities, which often coincide with regional water or soil quality issues common to many producers in the area. Faculty from the Cooperative Extension Service and Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, the Division of Agriculture's outreach and research arms, collaborate with federal and state agencies promoting conservation of natural resources.

""In essence, the program uses research tools and equipment installed on private farms to conduct routine monitoring to help producers assess and improve their use of natural resources by using an age-old, time-proven extension technique of working directly with farmers on their land,"" Daniels said.

The team -- made up of faculty and staff from the Division of Agriculture and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff -- recently received the Excellence in Extension Team Award from the Association of Southern Region Extension Directors. The award was presented Aug. 19 at the association's annual meeting in Atlanta. The association includes extension directors from 13 southern states and two territories -- Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.

""Through cutting-edge monitoring tools and extensive outreach, the Arkansas Discovery Farms program demonstrates how sustainable agriculture benefits both the environment and the economy, positioning Arkansas as a leader in conservation and agricultural resilience,"" said Rich Bonanno, executive director of the Association of Southern Region Extension Directors.

POSITIVE IMPACTS

Water quality monitoring over the past 15 years indicates that less than 5% of nitrogen and phosphorus applied as fertilizer or manure is recovered in edge-of-field water runoff.

""By quantifying runoff volume, we have been able to demonstrate that improved irrigation water management can increase irrigation water remaining in the field from 60% to 90%,"" Daniels said.

The Arkansas Discovery Farms team shares its findings through virtual field trips that have educated thousands of farmers, students and policymakers, said John D. Anderson, senior associate vice president for agriculture for the division and director of the Cooperative Extension Service.

""We're proud of the collaborative work we're doing with Arkansas farmers,"" Anderson said. ""Being good stewards of our natural resources while ensuring sustainability of our state's top industry benefits everyone.""

As part of the program, a Discovery Farms Education Center on the UAPB farm adjacent to campus will give students hands-on experience in monitoring the impact of soil and water conservation on natural resources.

The Arkansas Discovery Farms team includes the following people:

Mike Daniels -- Distinguished professor of crop, soil and environmental sciences and Discovery Farms co-leader, UADA;

Kris Brye -- University professor of applied soil physics and pedology in crop, soil and environmental sciences, UADA and the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences at the University of Arkansas;

States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries.
Already, the Department of Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.
The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage.
Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.","Maryland is making bold moves. With new investments pouring into artificial intelligence and quantum technology research, our state is positioning itself as a national leader in the industries of tomorrow. This is an exciting and necessary step — these technologies will shape the next generation of health care, national security, finance and countless other fields.

But as we chart this path toward a more innovative future, it’s critical that we don’t leave one essential pillar behind: clean energy and energy storage. For Maryland to be a hub in AI technology, it must also be a leader in the energy systems that will power it.

The reason is both practical and moral. AI data centers, high-performance quantum computers and advanced manufacturing hubs consume staggering amounts of electricity. As AI models grow larger and more powerful, and as quantum computers begin moving from research labs into operational facilities, their energy needs will only surge. Without a robust, sustainable energy infrastructure, Maryland risks creating an innovation ecosystem that is ultimately unsustainable.

Clean energy isn’t just about climate commitments —it’s about economic resilience, energy independence and long-term competitiveness. States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries. Already, the Department of Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.

The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage. Therefore, enhanced efforts are required to transition technology from the lab to the marketplace and to facilitate manufacturing at scale. Similarly, the DOE Long Duration Storage Shot (LDS) aims to reduce storage costs by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of electricity within the decade.

Maryland has made admirable progress in clean energy, with many projects underway and aggressive climate targets on the books. But to truly match its ambitions in AI and quantum, the state must equally prioritize research and development in advanced energy storage, grid modernization, and clean generation technologies. Public universities, national labs, and private companies need support to pioneer new battery chemistries, scalable grid storage solutions and AI-driven grid optimization tools.

Imagine a Maryland where AI breakthroughs help predict energy demand spikes, where quantum computers model new solar cell materials, and where locally developed long-duration energy storage systems keep our power grid clean, stable, and resilient — even in the face of rising demand. This isn’t a distant fantasy. It’s a future we can build, but only if we invest wisely today.

Maryland has seen significant successes in clean energy technology, particularly in the battery and solar sectors. Companies like Saft and Ion Storage Systems are leading innovators in battery technology. Solar power is the state’s largest renewable energy source, with a significant installed capacity. By the end of 2024, Maryland had installed 1,750 megawatts of solar power, making it the largest source of renewable energy. Similarly, the POWER Act, set a target for Maryland to generate 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2031.

To date, the offshore wind supply chain has brought over $815 millionin investments to the state, which includes millions of dollars to redevelop Baltimore County’s industrial waterfront for offshore-wind steel manufacturing and component staging, a high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in Baltimore City, an additional $25 million in public funding to strengthen the state’s union workforce, and $11 million toward environmental research through the University of Maryland.

It would be shortsighted to invest heavily in energy-intensive technologies without ensuring the sustainability of the energy systems that support them. Maryland has the chance to be a model for how to do both — to be a state where cutting-edge tech doesn’t just consume resources, but actively drives cleaner, smarter, and fairer energy solutions.

Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.

In the race for the future, it won’t be enough to lead in AI or quantum alone. The true leaders will understand how deeply technology and energy are intertwined and build their innovation economies with that in mind. Maryland can — and should — be one of them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:09:59.455205

Jerry Brown, who got a hero’s welcome himself at the United Nations climate talks in 2017, the first year of Trump’s first term.
The Brazilian hosts billed this year’s climate talks as a chance to turn lofty promises into results.
Ken Alex, a former senior policy adviser to Brown who’s traveled with him to several international climate talks, said climate diplomats know where to look for a stand-in from the United States under a Trump administration.
“Countries and other places in the world start reaching out to California because the U.S. is missing.”","“The reason I’m here is the absence of leadership coming from the United States,” he continued. “There is a different picture that we can paint subnationally.”

It’s a well-rehearsed role for California, which has staked out a leading role in international climate diplomacy for decades under both Democratic and Republican governors. The Trump administration’s dismantling of climate policies to favor oil and gas interests — and planned absence from the Brazil talks — only give California more space to fill, said former Gov. Jerry Brown, who got a hero’s welcome himself at the United Nations climate talks in 2017, the first year of Trump’s first term.

“Trump, he’s saying one thing,” Brown said in an interview. “Newsom is saying something else, very important.” The impact, he said, will be determined in Belém. “That’s why it’s exciting. There’s not an answer yet.”

The conflict was already taking shape last week. At an energy conference in Greece, U.S. and Greek officials touted a new deal for Exxon Mobil to explore drilling in the Mediterranean, with U.S. Interior Department Secretary Doug Burgum saying, “there is no energy transition, there is just energy addition.” In Brazil, meanwhile, Colombian President Gustavo Petro called for an economy free of oil and natural gas during an opening speech to the climate talks, saying, “Mr. Trump is against humankind.”

That gives Newsom an opening — and also presents a risk. Where Brown led a coalition of states eager to demonstrate continued commitment on climate in Trump’s first term, Newsom will arrive in Belém, near the mouth of the Amazon River, at a time when U.S. politics are tilting rightward and even Democrats are pulling back on embracing climate policies.

California’s own claim to climate leadership has also lost some shine. Trump laid waste to its nation-leading vehicle emissions standards, getting Congress to overturn them in June, and state regulators have yet to propose making up the emissions losses. Other blue states were already getting cold feet about following California’s rules, citing the cost of switching to electric vehicles and equipment. Newsom himself has backtracked on some policies, including a profit cap on refineries, an acknowledgment that high gas prices are a liability. And while the state has met its own emissions targets so far, it was off track to meet its 2045 carbon neutrality goal even before the federal government began attacking renewable energy.

Newsom argues that Trump’s policies are hurting competitiveness. “China is sprinting ahead on clean energy to a scale and degree that I don’t think most Americans fully appreciate, and I’m deeply worried about how they will outpace this country and how we may not be able to catch up,” he said.

Amid his feuding with Trump and the passage of a nationally watched gerrymandering campaign benefitting Democrats, Newsom’s profile is soaring. He headlined a rally in Texas over the weekend and is rising on presidential primary shortlists.

White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers declined to comment on Newsom’s attendance at COP but pushed back on his embrace of low-carbon energy.

“President Trump will not allow the best interest of the American people to be jeopardized by the Green Energy Scam,” she said in a statement. “These Green Dreams are killing other countries, but will not kill ours thanks to President Trump’s commonsense energy agenda!”

There’s little Newsom’s team, which includes ex-State Department climate negotiators, can actually do to influence the closed-door talks reserved for countries. Instead, the team is focusing on expanding its list of voluntary bilateral or multilateral agreements with other subnational and national governments, some of which have been purely symbolic and some of which have led to research and policy exchanges. Among the most substantive are agreements with Chinese provinces, some dating back to Brown’s time but which paved the way for Newsom to take a headline-generating trip to China focused on climate change in 2023.

Now, amid his feuding with Trump and the passage of a nationally-watched gerrymandering campaign benefitting Democrats, Newsom’s profile is soaring. He headlined a rally in Texas over the weekend and is rising on presidential primary shortlists.

Newsom’s agenda in Belém includes a first-ever meeting with Jochen Flasbarth, Germany’s Secretary of Environment, Climate Action, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, on Tuesday. The two are expected to discuss and renew a climate agreement their predecessors first signed in 2017. Newsom is also scheduled to meet with Thekla Walker, the environment minister for the German state of Baden-Württemberg, which in 2015 co-founded the Under 2 coalition with California for states and cities looking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

He’s also expected to give plenary remarks at COP in Belém later this week, where top-tier global involvement is lacking. The Brazilian hosts billed this year’s climate talks as a chance to turn lofty promises into results. But no sweeping agreement is on the table, and many countries are behind on their emissions goals.

Only a smattering of European leaders are in attendance, and the European Union’s 27 member countries could not agree on a climate goal to present at the conference until mere days before its start — and only after watering down existing pollution-cutting rules to get a deal. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former U.N. climate representative, stayed home. Also absent is Chinese President Xi Jinping, whose country tops the U.S. as the world’s No. 1 greenhouse gas polluter but is also moving aggressively towards renewable electricity.

The Brazilian organizers have pivoted toward implementation — focusing on things cities and states can do on their own, from forest protection to electric vehicles and disaster resilience. That will leave at least some in the crowd of government officials, NGOs and industry groups hungry for input from California, with its massive economy and Democratic-leaning population. Christiana Figueres, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, named Newsom as the person she expected to generate the most chatter in Brazil.

“It is already predictable that, of course, Gavin Newsom will get quite a bit of media attention because he represents the huge state of California, but also because of his high-profile pushback on President Trump,” she said in an interview.

Ken Alex, a former senior policy adviser to Brown who’s traveled with him to several international climate talks, said climate diplomats know where to look for a stand-in from the United States under a Trump administration.

“Gov. Newsom is seeing the same thing we saw in the Brown administration,” he said. “Countries and other places in the world start reaching out to California because the U.S. is missing.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F16%2F7e%2Fac52d3064fa98c7d0e4aa8ebb9ae%2Felection-2025-redistricting-california-44447.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:12.505271

The decline in BEV sales could have been more severe without several OEMs increasing their own incentives in October to help make up for the loss of the federal credit. According to J.D. Power, average incentive spending per unit on BEVs totaled $13,161, up $2,047 compared to September 2025. It remains to be seen what the natural demand for BEVs will be in the absence of the credit, but we do expect it will take quite some time for BEV sales to reach the rate they were in the final months of the EV tax credits.

Our outlook for the rest of the year is for a slower sales pace relative to Q3 2025. Given the pull-ahead sales that occurred earlier this year, a slower Q4 won’t necessarily impact full-year sales totals too much. We expect sales will be flat or up slightly compared to full-year 2024.

The rise of 'don't say climate' politics. - Grist Magazine,Kate Yoder,,,,,https://grist.org/language/florida-adaptation-dont-say-climate-politics-bill-gates/,"The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.

Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding, and hurricanes.
You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country.
Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control.","Last May, as blistering-hot weather broke records across South Florida and smoke from distant wildfires in Mexico turned the sky hazy, Ron DeSantis, Florida’s Republican governor, signed legislation erasing most mentions of “climate change” from state law. “We’re restoring sanity in our approach to energy and rejecting the agenda of the radical green zealots,” he wrote on X.

Back then, it felt like just another Florida story, a fresh example of the culture war overriding reality. In hindsight, it was a preview of where the country was headed.

President Donald Trump’s second term has plunged the United States into “don’t say climate” politics. Even as horrific floods and fires unfolded around the country this year, Republicans in Congress reversed the country’s only climate plan. The administration has deleted “climate change” from hundreds of government webpages and dismissed facts about the warming planet as “brainless fear-mongering rhetoric.” Rather than pushing back, Democrats have been talking about climate change less since the 2024 election, emphasizing “cheap energy” instead.

Even if talking about climate change is politically radioactive, adapting to its effects is no longer optional. Florida tops some lists for the state most at risk from climate change, facing a combination of heat, drought, fires, flooding, and hurricanes. Miami Beach and towns in the Florida Keys have been raising their roads as the sea begins to rise. DeSantis has committed more than $1 billion to Resilient Florida, a grant program that helps local governments address some of these problems.

You don’t necessarily have to mention climate change to start adapting to it — a phenomenon now seen all over the country. PG&E is burying its power lines underground to avoid sparking fires in California’s drying forests, in the name of “wildfire safety.” After Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, the county began buying homes that have been repeatedly inundated and relocating residents, turning their former homes into open space to absorb floodwaters.

“There’s been a radical increase in how many people are realizing that whether it’s flooding, drought, fire, air quality impacts from fire — take your example — the disasters have been getting out ahead of us,” said Katharine Mach, a professor of environmental science and policy at the University of Miami.

Since at least the 1980s, the public discussion over climate change has revolved around trying to get the world’s carbon emissions under control. But as time has worn on and emissions have continued to rise, it’s become much more about living with the effects of an overheating planet. A United Nations report last week found the world will soon overshoot its goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with current policies likely to lead to 2.8 degrees C (5 degrees F) of warming by the end of the century. That’s a slight improvement from previous estimates, but still translates to an unrecognizable planet.

“We have unleashed a world where many climate impacts are now locked in,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director for climate and energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Because we did not act quickly enough, it’s not just about mitigation anymore. We have to adapt.”

Bill Gates, who’s long funded efforts to switch to clean energy, recently wrote an essay arguing that climate advocates have spent too much time and effort on reducing emissions, and not enough on programs that help people stay resilient in the face of increasingly dangerous weather.

“Unfortunately, the doomsday outlook is causing much of the climate community to focus too much on near-term emissions goals, and it’s diverting resources from the most effective things we should be doing to improve life in a warming world,” Gates wrote.

The question of how to fund efforts for low-income countries to adjust to this new, unpredictable environment has become a central concern for this year’s global climate talks in Belém, Brazil, starting on November 10. “It’s a responsibility that richer nations, major emitting nations, have been shirking for the longest time,” Cleetus said. Another recent U.N. report found that developing countries will need at least $310 billion a year over the next 10 years to prepare for the effects of climate change. In 2023, richer countries only provided $26 billion.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has eviscerated foreign aid, stripping away development funding for poorer countries while undermining its own ability to respond to disasters at home. Cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have hindered forecasters’ ability to predict what’s coming, at the same time as the diminished Federal Emergency Management Agency has forced local governments to fend for themselves. The U.S. isn’t sending any high-level delegates to the talks in Belém, marking the first time the country will go unrepresented at the annual U.N. climate conference.

“I’ve never seen an administration be so deliberately undermining a country’s capability to be prepared and to deal with challenges like this,” said Susanne Moser, a social scientist who’s considered one of the leading experts on climate adaptation.

Billionaires like Gates are stepping into the gap. MacKenzie Scott, another influential philanthropist, recently donated $60 million to the Center for Disaster Philanthropy to help with disaster preparedness and recovery.

Experts said the new focus on adapting to a changing climate was necessary, but they said that Gates — like many before him — needlessly pitted the need to adapt against the need to cut emissions when both things can happen at the same time.

“Adaptation can actually not succeed, ultimately, if climate change goes unchecked,” Moser said. Today, the world has seen about 1.3 degrees C (2.3 F) of additional warming since before industrial times, but as Gates notes, it could reach 3 degrees C (5.4 F) by the end of the century.

“A 3-degree world is not a world in which adaptation can provide well-being and health,” Moser said. “It’s just simply, people are living in ruins and are trying to basically survive.”

There’s an entrenched idea among environmentalists that discussions over how to adapt to climate change distract from the core mission of cutting planet-warming emissions, what’s known as mitigation. It’s sometimes perceived as a form of giving up. But studies have repeatedly shown that talking about adaptation doesn’t necessarily reduce public support for mitigation efforts. If anything, the challenges of adapting — the high price tag of raising roads in low-lying coastal areas, or the difficulties of relocating communities out of danger zones — highlight the need for reducing emissions. “Once you begin adaptation and you see how difficult it is, mitigation looks like a cakewalk,” Moser said.

If Florida is any indication, the two might go hand in hand. Yoca Arditi-Rocha, CEO of The CLEO Institute, a climate education nonprofit in Florida, says that the state has made a lot of progress that doesn’t often get discussed. In fact, it’s one of the largest markets for electric vehicles in the country, and also right near the top for installations of utility-scale solar and rooftop solar.

Arditi-Rocha hopes Florida can show the rest of the country that climate action can still move forward, even if the term itself remains politically off-limits. Getting specific helps, she said: Talking about how towns need more trees for shade, or how they need to be prepared for hurricanes and heat waves, is simply practical. Then again, so is reducing carbon emissions.

“We have to shut down the overflowing bathtub,” Arditi-Rocha said. “We cannot be mopping the floor forever.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Miami-Beach-shoreline-construction.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:17.079453

Kaufman,,,,,https://heatmap.news/am/cop30-new-york-pipeline,"The company hasn’t announced any partnerships with data center operators to date — though hyperscalers are certainly investing in the Indian market.
Until then, he said, he had 350 electricians working on a Meta data center project between Augusta and Atlanta.
Monterey Bay is surrounded by Monterey County and Santa Cruz County and both are considering ordinances around battery storage.
It’s important to say how important battery storage is going to be for the coastal areas.
Lawmakers in the state have been really behind energy storage and keeping things headed in that direction of more deployment.","“Obviously some Trump administration policies have weakened the business case for renewables and therefore also storage,” Eugene Beh, Quino’s founder and CEO, told me when I asked what it was like to fundraise in this environment. “But it’s actually outside the US, where the appetite still remains very strong.”

The deployment of battery energy storage in India lags far behind the pace of renewables adoption, presenting both a challenge and an opportunity for the sector. “India does have an opportunity to leapfrog into a more flexible, resilient, and sustainable power system,” Shreyes Shende, a senior research associate at Johns Hopkins’ Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab, told me. The government appears eager to make it happen, setting ambitious targets and offering ample incentives for tech-neutral battery storage deployments, as it looks to lean into novel technologies.

“Indian policymakers have been trying to double down on the R&D and innovation landscape because they’re trying to figure out, how do you reduce dependence on these lithium ion batteries?” Shende said. China dominates the global lithium-ion market, and also has a fractious geopolitical relationship with India, So much like the U.S., India is eager to reduce its dependence on Chinese imports. “Anything that helps you move away from that would only be welcome as long as there’s cost compatibility,” he added

Beh told me that India also presents a natural market for Quino’s expansion, in large part because the key raw material for its proprietary electrolyte chemistry — a clothing dye derived from coal tar — is primarily produced in China and India. But with tariffs and other trade barriers, China poses a much more challenging environment to work in or sell from these days, making the Indian market a simpler choice.

Quino’s dye-based electrolyte is designed to be significantly cheaper than the industry standard, which relies on the element vanadium dissolved in an acidic solution. In vanadium flow batteries, the electrolyte alone can account for roughly 70% of the product’s total cost, Beh said. “We’re using exactly the same hardware as what the vanadium flow battery manufacturers are doing,” he told me minus the most expensive part. “Instead, we use our organic electrolyte in place of vanadium, which will be about one quarter of the cost.”

Like many other companies these days, Beh views data centers as a key market for Quino’s tech — not just because that’s where the money’s at, but also due to one of flow batteries’ core advantages: their extremely long cycle lives. While lithium-ion energy storage systems can only complete from 3,000 to 5,000 cycles before losing 20% or more of their capacity, with flow batteries, the number of cycles doesn’t correlate with longevity at all. That’s because their liquid-based chemistry allows them to charge and discharge without physically stressing the electrodes.

That’s a key advantage for AI data centers, which tend to have spiky usage patterns determined by the time of day and events that trigger surges in web traffic. Many baseload power sources can’t ramp quickly enough to meet spikes in demand, and gas peaker plants are expensive. That makes batteries a great option — especially those that can respond to fluctuations by cycling multiple times per day without degrading their performance.

The company hasn’t announced any partnerships with data center operators to date — though hyperscalers are certainly investing in the Indian market. First up will be getting the company’s demonstration plants online in both California and India. Quino already operates a 100-kilowatt-hour pilot facility near Buffalo, New York, and was awarded a $10 million grant from the California Energy Commission and a $5 million grant from the Department of Energy this year to deploy a larger, 5-megawatt-hour battery at a regional health care center in Southern California. Beh expects that to be operational by the end of 2027.

But its plans in India are both more ambitious and nearer-term. In partnership with Atri, the company plans to build a 150- to 200-megawatt-hour electrolyte production facility, which Beh says should come online next year. With less government funding in the mix, there’s simply less bureaucracy to navigate, he explained. Further streamlining the process is the fact that Atri owns the site where the plant will be built. “Obviously if you have a motivated site owner who’s also an investor in you, then things will go a lot faster,” Beh told me.

The goal for this facility is to enable production of a battery that’s cost-competitive with vanadium flow batteries. “That ought to enable us to enter into a virtuous cycle, where we make something cheaper than vanadium, people doing vanadium will switch to us, that drives more demand, and the cost goes down further,” Beh told me. Then, once the company scales to roughly a gigawatt-hour of annual production, he expects it will be able to offer batteries with a capital cost roughly 30% lower than lithium-ion energy storage systems.

If it achieves that target, in theory at least, the Indian market will be ready. A recent analysis estimates that the country will need 61 gigawatts of energy storage capacity by 2030 to support its goal of 500 gigawatts of clean power, rising to 97 gigawatts by 2032. “If battery prices don’t fall, I think the focus will be towards pumped hydro,” Shende told me. That’s where the vast majority of India’s energy storage comes from today. “But in case they do fall, I think battery storage will lead the way.”

The hope is that by the time Quino is producing at scale overseas, demand and investor interest will be strong enough to support a large domestic manufacturing plant as well. “In the U.S., it feels like a lot of investment attention just turned to AI,” Beh told me, explaining that investors are taking a “wait and see” approach to energy infrastructure such as Quino. But he doesn’t see that lasting. “I think this mega-trend of how we generate and use electricity is just not going away.”

“We had challenges as we were building a new supply chain for a new technology and then workforce,” John Williams, an executive at Southern Nuclear Operating Company, which owns over 45% of Plant Vogtle, said in a webinar hosted by the environmental group Resources for the Future in October.

“It had been 30 years since we had built a new nuclear plant from scratch in the United States. Our workforce didn’t have that muscle memory that they have in other parts of the world, where they have been building on a more regular frequency.”

That workforce “hasn’t been building nuclear plants” since heavy construction stopped at Vogtle in 2023, he noted — but they have been busy “building data centers and car manufacturing in Georgia.”

Williams said that it would take another “six to 10” AP1000 projects for costs to come down far enough to make nuclear construction routine. “If we were currently building the next AP1000s, we would be farther down that road,” he said. “But we’ve stopped again.”

J.R. Richardson, business manager and financial secretary of the International Brotherhood of Electric Workers Local 1579, based in Augusta, Georgia, told me his union “had 2,000 electricians on that job,” referring to Vogtle. “So now we have a skill set with electricians that did that project. If you wait 20 or 30 years, that skill set is not going to be there anymore.”

Richardson pointed to the potential revitalization of the failed V.C. Summer nuclear project in South Carolina, saying that his union had already been reached out to about it starting up again. Until then, he said, he had 350 electricians working on a Meta data center project between Augusta and Atlanta.

“They’re all basically the same,” he told me of the data center projects. “They’re like cookie cutter homes, but it’s on a bigger scale.”

To be clear, though the segue from nuclear construction to data center construction may hold back the nuclear industry, it has been great for workers, especially unionized electrical and construction workers.

“If an IBEW electrician says they're going hungry, something’s wrong with them,” Richardson said.

Meta’s Northwest Louisiana data center project will require 700 or 800 electricians sitewide, Richardson told me. He estimated that of the IBEW’s 875,000 members, about a tenth were working on data centers, and about 30% of his local were on a single data center job.

When I asked him whether that workforce could be reassembled for future nuclear plants, he said that the “majority” of the workforce likes working on nuclear projects, even if they’re currently doing data center work. “A lot of IBEW electricians look at the longevity of the job,” Richardson told me — and nuclear plants famously take a long, long time to build.

America isn’t building any new nuclear power plants right now (though it will soon if Rick Perry gets his way), but the question of how to balance a workforce between energy construction and data center projects is a pressing one across the country.

It’s not just nuclear developers that have to think about data centers when it comes to recruiting workers — it’s renewables developers, as well.

“We don’t see people leaving the workforce,” said Adam Sokolski, director of regulatory and economic affairs at EDF Renewables North America. “We do see some competition.”

He pointed specifically to Ohio, where he said, “You have a strong concentration of solar happening at the same time as a strong concentration of data center work and manufacturing expansion. There’s something in the water there.”

Sokolski told me that for EDF’s renewable projects, in order to secure workers, he and the company have to “communicate real early where we know we’re going to do a project and start talking to labor in those areas. We’re trying to give them a market signal as a way to say, We’re going to be here in two years.”

Solar and data center projects have lots of overlapping personnel needs, Sokolski said. There are operating engineers “working excavators and bulldozers and graders” or pounding posts into place. And then, of course, there are electricians, who Sokolski said were “a big, big piece of the puzzle — everything from picking up the solar panel off from the pallet to installing it on the racking system, wiring it together to the substations, the inverters to the communication systems, ultimately up to the high voltage step-up transformers and onto the grid.”

On the other hand, explained Kevin Pranis, marketing manager of the Great Lakes regional organizing committee of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, a data center is like a “fancy, very nice warehouse.” This means that when a data center project starts up, “you basically have pretty much all building trades” working on it. “You’ve got site and civil work, and you’re doing a big concrete foundation, and then you’re erecting iron and putting a building around it.”

Data centers also have more mechanical systems than the average building, “so you have more electricians and more plumbers and pipefitters” on site, as well.

Individual projects may face competition for workers, but Pranis framed the larger issue differently: Renewable energy projects are often built to support data centers. “If we get a data center, that means we probably also get a wind or solar project, and batteries,” he said.

While the data center boom is putting upward pressure on labor demand, Pranis told me that in some parts of the country, like the Upper Midwest, it’s helping to compensate for a slump in commercial real estate, which is one of the bread and butter industries for his construction union.

Data centers, Pranis said, aren’t the best projects for his members to work on. They really like doing manufacturing work. But, he added, it’s “a nice large load and it’s a nice big building, and there’s some number of good jobs.”

A couple things are going on. Monterey Bay is surrounded by Monterey County and Santa Cruz County and both are considering ordinances around battery storage. That’s different than a ban – important. You can have an ordinance that helps facilitate storage. Some people here are very focused on climate change issues and the grid, because here in Santa Cruz County we’re at a terminal point where there really is no renewable energy, so we have to have battery storage. And like, in Santa Cruz County the ordinance would be for unincorporated areas – I’m not sure how materially that would impact things. There’s one storage project in Watsonville near Moss Landing, and the ordinance wouldn’t even impact that. Even in Monterey County, the idea is to issue a moratorium and again, that’s in unincorporated areas, too.

It’s important to say how important battery storage is going to be for the coastal areas. That’s where you see the opposition, but all of our renewables are trapped in southern California and we have a bottleneck that moves power up and down the state. If California doesn’t get offshore wind or wind from Wyoming into the northern part of the state, we’re relying on batteries to get that part of the grid decarbonized.

In the areas of California where batteries are being opposed, who is supporting them and fighting against the protests? I mean, aside from the developers and an occasional climate activist.

The state has been strongly supporting the industry. Lawmakers in the state have been really behind energy storage and keeping things headed in that direction of more deployment. Other than that, I think you’re right to point out there’s not local advocates saying, “We need more battery storage.” It tends to come from Sacramento. I’m not sure you’d see local folks in energy siting usually, but I think it’s also because we are still actually deploying battery storage in some areas of the state. If we were having even more trouble, maybe we’d have more advocacy for development in response.

Has the Moss Landing incident impacted renewable energy development in California? I’ve seen some references to fears about that incident crop up in fights over solar in Imperial County, for example, which I know has been coveted for development.

Everywhere there’s batteries, people are pointing at Moss Landing and asking how people will deal with fires. I don’t know how powerful the arguments are in California, but I see it in almost every single renewable project that has a battery.

Okay, then what do you think the next phase of this is? Are we just going to be trapped in a battery fire fear cycle, or do you think this backlash will evolve?

We’re starting to see it play out here with the state opt-in process where developers can seek state approval to build without local approval. As this situation after Moss Landing has played out, more battery developers have wound up in the opt-in process. So what we’ll see is more battery developers try to get permission from the state as opposed to local officials.

There are some trade-offs with that. But there are benefits in having more resources to help make the decisions. The state will have more expertise in emergency response, for example, whereas every local jurisdiction has to educate themselves. But no matter what I think they’ll be pursuing the opt-in process – there’s nothing local governments can really do to stop them with that.

Part of what we’re seeing though is, you have to have a community benefit agreement in place for the project to advance under the California Environmental Quality Act. The state has been pretty strict about that, and that’s the one thing local folks could still do – influence whether a developer can get a community benefits agreement with representatives on the ground. That’s the one strategy local folks who want to push back on a battery could use, block those agreements. Other than that, I think some counties here in California may not have much resistance. They need the revenue and see these as economic opportunities.

I can’t help but hear optimism in your tone of voice here. It seems like in spite of the disaster, development is still moving forward. Do you think California is doing a better or worse job than other states at deploying battery storage and handling the trade offs?

Oh, better. I think the opt-in process looks like a nice balance between taking local authority away over things and the better decision-making that can be brought in. The state creating that program is one way to help encourage renewables and avoid a backlash, honestly, while staying on track with its decarbonization goals.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjEzMDI3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc4NjYyODEyNX0.-CleOcSTmYOJR1bdnTtdE_px-4UPjU__n4lFbk6HF1U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-10 09:20:04.086079

Chevron to provide guidance through end of this decade

Oil firm has opportunities for growth after Hess

Investors eye updates on Kazakhstan talks and new power ventures

Reuters) – When Chevron executives and top shareholders convene in New York City on Wednesday for the oil producer’s investor day, portfolio managers will be eager to hear CEO Mike Wirth’s plan to finally reap rewards from the Hess acquisition and begin a new phase of growth.

The event is lining up to be a victory lap for Wirth after the company prevailed in an arbitration battle to clinch the $55 billion takeover of the smaller oil producer in July.

After oil and gas reserves hit a low point in 2024, investors also want more details about exploration plans, especially with major operations in Kazakhstan and the U.S. hitting a stride. They already had some good news last month, when Chevron reported record oil and gas production for the third quarter.

“Pre-Hess, the view was that Chevron had very little room to grow. But now, with the Kazakhstan project moving into cash generation and Hess on top of that, it gives them a lot of different opportunities for growth,” said Will Su, a managing director at asset management firm BlackRock, one of

The Hess acquisition came with a key 30% stake in the Stabroek block in Guyana that is operated by Exxon Mobil. The area holds at least 11 billion barrels of oil equivalent and was a driving force behind the upbeat third quarter report.

Wirth said during the earnings call that Chevron will provide guidance through the end of this decade at the investor day, its first since 2023.

WHAT NEXT FOR EXPLORATION?

Details about Wirth’s goal to improve exploration and find new sources of oil and gas is expected to be an important part of the agenda, especially as its other flagship projects mature.

Chevron said in August it reached one million barrels per day of production from the Permian Basin, a figure it will hold steady as it reduces capital spending and focuses on cash generation. An expansion project at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan is now operating at full capacity.

With intensive spending in the rearview mirror on two major assets, Chevron should have more capital available for exploration, said David Byrns, a portfolio manager and senior investment analyst at American Century Investments, which holds a $254 million position in the oil producer according to LSEG data.

Chevron’s cost-cutting efforts should also allow it to protect dividends and buybacks, he added.

“They leaned out the organization because there’s a recognition that the industry will need to allocate more dollars (to exploration) in the future, but it wouldn’t be wise for that to happen at the expense of cash return to shareholders,” Byrns said.

UPDATES ON KAZAKHSTAN AND OTHER PROJECTS

Byrns added that he is watching for developments in Chevron’s eastern Mediterranean assets and potential plans to monetize natural gas reserves to power data centers.

Chevron is in talks with major AI companies to build natural gas-fired power plants to provide the vast amounts of electricity needed to operate data centers, which is a new business venture for the company. Some remain uncertain about the idea, however.

“I’m on the fence about their power strategy and I think a lot of other (investors) would like more details as well,” said Priyal Maniar, an investment analyst at T. Rowe Price, another major Chevron shareholder.

Maniar added she hoped to hear updates about Chevron’s negotiations to extend its contract in Kazakhstan. It expires in 2033 and is already prompting regular questions from analysts on earnings calls.

During the third quarter call, Wirth said the talks were off to a good start but cautioned that discussions are in early stages.

“These are going to take some time. It’s a complex contract,” he said.

“Every dollar invested in renewables creates three times more jobs than a dollar invested in fossil fuels — and clean energy jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs worldwide.
Clean energy is rising.
African delegates, a statement from the bank said, highlighted the continent’s critical role in global climate stability.
“The African Development Bank warmly welcomes Brazil’s historic ‘Tropical Forest Forever’ initiative,” Ould Tah said, calling it a milestone in global climate solidarity.","The United Nations (UN) has stated that despite the $2 trillion investments in renewable energy last year, overshooting the 1.5°c global temperature agreed by nations of the world now seems impossible.

Secretary General of the UN, António Guterres, speaking at the Energy Transition Roundtable at the 30th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30), in Belém, Brazil, called for people-centred investment in grids as well as end to fossil fuel subsidies.

The 1.5°C global temperature idea refers to a global warming limit that countries agreed to try to stay under, mostly to avoid the most dangerous and irreversible climate impacts. It means limiting the increase in the earth’s average temperature to no more than 1.5°C above what it was before the Industrial Revolution (around the late 1800s). The world has already warmed by roughly about 1.2°C.

“Last year, 90 per cent of new power capacity came from renewables; global investment in clean energy reached $2 trillion — $800 billion more than fossil fuels; renewables are now the cheapest source of new electricity in nearly every country. They are powering prosperity and empowering communities long left in the dark.

“Every dollar invested in renewables creates three times more jobs than a dollar invested in fossil fuels — and clean energy jobs now outnumber fossil fuel jobs worldwide. The renewables revolution is here. But we must go much faster — and ensure all nations share the benefits.

“At COP28, countries agreed to transition away from fossil fuels in a just, orderly and equitable manner; and to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030. The mandate is clear — now we must close the delivery gap.

“And this, Excellencies, is where we are falling dangerously short. Even if new national commitments are fully implemented, the world is still heading for clearly more than 2°C of warming. That means more floods, more heat, more suffering — everywhere. Scientists tell us that overshooting 1.5°C is now inevitable — starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. But how high and how long that overshoot lasts depends on the speed and scale of our actions today,” the UN chief stated.

To return below 1.5°C by century’s end, he pointed out that global emissions must fall by almost half by 2030, reach net zero by 2050 and go net negative afterwards.

According to him, the first thing to do is to provide clarity and coherence and align laws, policies and incentives with a just energy transition; and eliminate fossil fuel subsidies that distort markets and lock us into the past.

“Second, put people and equity at the centre of the transition; support workers and communities whose livelihoods still depend on coal, oil and gas; provide training, protection and new opportunities — especially for young people and women.

“Third, invest in grids, storage and efficiency. Renewables are surging, infrastructure must catch up — fast. Fourth, meet all new electricity demand with clean power — including from the data centres driving the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Technology must be part of the solution, not a new source of strain,” he added.

Guterres stated that the fifth thing to do is to unlock finance at scale for developing countries, stressing that today, Africa receives 2 per cent of global clean energy investment and insisting that the world needs international cooperation to tear down barriers, cut the cost of capital and crowd in private investment.

“The pathways for each country may look different, but the destination must be the same: A net-zero world, followed consistently by a net negative world — powered by renewables. We must support developing countries to implement their commitment to transition away from fossil fuels: Through stronger cooperation, investment and technology transfer — and calibrated to different capacities and dependencies.

“Let us move with speed and solidarity. Make fairness the engine of acceleration — and build economies that are clean, inclusive and resilient.Turn climate necessity into development opportunity — everywhere. The fossil fuel age is ending. Clean energy is rising. Let us make the transition fair, fast and final,” the UN Secretary General stressed.

Meanwhile, the African Development Bank (AfDB) Group President, Sidi Ould Tah, has reaffirmed the institution’s commitment to transforming “promises into progress,” highlighting the bank’s status as the first multilateral development institution to achieve financing parity between climate adaptation and mitigation.

Speaking at the Belém Climate Summit, which brings together world leaders in Brazil ahead of COP30 to review progress on the Paris Agreement, Dr Ould Tah underscored the Bank’s determination to intensify climate action.

“We are all gathered here, driven by our collective responsibility to protect nature, our most precious asset in combating climate change and ensuring humanity’s survival,” he told the plenary during a session on Climate and Nature: Forests and Oceans.

African delegates, a statement from the bank said, highlighted the continent’s critical role in global climate stability. The Republic of Congo noted that Africa—home to 17 per cent of the world’s tropical forests—loses an estimated 3.7 million hectares annually, while Nigeria’s Vice President Kashim Shettima called for new mechanisms to safeguard forests and oceans.

“What Africa is asking for is equitable access to the carbon market to enable countries to restore forest and ocean resources,” Shettima said.

Bank president Ould Tah emphasised that Africa’s ecosystems are not just natural assets but vital climate regulators. “The Congo Basin is a compelling example — it holds the world’s largest tropical peatlands, storing about 29 billion tons of carbon, equivalent to three years of global emissions,” he said.

He outlined the Bank’s climate strategy, guided by its four cardinal points, which focus on mobilising capital for green growth, promoting debt-for-nature swaps, empowering women and youth in environmental protection, and investing in resilient, nature-friendly infrastructure.

Also, Ould Tah joined Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva to launch the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a global fund designed to support countries sharing the Amazon and Congo Basins, as well as other tropical forest regions.

“The African Development Bank warmly welcomes Brazil’s historic ‘Tropical Forest Forever’ initiative,” Ould Tah said, calling it a milestone in global climate solidarity. “This visionary partnership aligns with our biodiversity programs, such as the Congo Basin Forest Fund and the Central African Forests Commission,” he added.

As COP30 negotiations resume on November 10 (today), delegates are expected to pursue progress on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) for climate finance, which commits developed countries to mobilise at least $300 billion annually by 2035 for developing nations.

With those commitments yet to materialise, the AfDB said it is helping the continent explore innovative financing solutions.

CBP began detaining silicon solar cells made by South Korean-headquartered Qcells earlier this summer.
The lack of adequate solar cell supply means that Qcells cannot complete panel assembly at its Georgia manufacturing plants, thus requiring the temporary reduction in working hours.
A similar CBP detention has been affecting Maxeon, a solar panel manufacturer with some Chinese financing but no documented connection to forced labor happening in China.
Maxeon sold its European, Asian and Latin American sales channels and entities, while keeping its Mexican assembly plant and moving forward with plans for a 2-GW solar panel factory in New Mexico.","Solar panel manufacturer Qcells revealed on Friday that it would furlough one-third of its workers at its two plants in Georgia. The 1,000 employees will temporarily have reduced pay and working hours due to increased detentions by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of solar cells and other upstream panel components. Qcells will also lay off 300 workers from staffing agencies at the two plants.

The federal government has stepped up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA), which restricts Chinese goods made with forced labor from entering the United States. CBP began detaining silicon solar cells made by South Korean-headquartered Qcells earlier this summer. Qcells has repeatedly stated that its products do not use Chinese components. The company has a long history of using polysilicon from fellow South Korean company OCI and uses component manufacturing in Southeast Asia.

The lack of adequate solar cell supply means that Qcells cannot complete panel assembly at its Georgia manufacturing plants, thus requiring the temporary reduction in working hours. Despite Qcells being one of the first domestic manufacturers to start construction on new solar cell and wafer manufacturing operations, the company is still only performing panel assembly in the United States.

A similar CBP detention has been affecting Maxeon, a solar panel manufacturer with some Chinese financing but no documented connection to forced labor happening in China. Maxeon’s Mexico-assembled panels have been prevented from entering the country since summer 2024, despite the company providing thousands of pages of documents demonstrating full compliance in UFLPA. Maxeon has resorted to filing a complaint with the U.S. Court of International Trade and is awaiting updates amidst the government shutdown.

In Maxeon’s case, the once-global company now only focuses on the U.S. market. Maxeon sold its European, Asian and Latin American sales channels and entities, while keeping its Mexican assembly plant and moving forward with plans for a 2-GW solar panel factory in New Mexico. With most of its products unable to get into the country, Maxeon financials have nosedived. The company reported $39 million in revenue for the first six months of 2025, whereas it reached $371 million for the same period in 2024. Plans for the U.S. factory have paused.

Marta Stoepker, Qcells senior director of corporate communications, said in a statement to local news that the company was forced to scale back production “while our shipments into the U.S. were delayed in the customs clearance process.

“Qcells expects to resume full production in the coming weeks and months. Our commitment to building the entire solar supply chain in the United States remains,” she continued. “We will soon be back on track with the full force of our Georgia team delivering American-made energy to communities around the country.”",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/qcells-factory.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 08:59:04.670218

States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries.
Already, the Department of Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.
The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage.
Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.","Maryland is making bold moves. With new investments pouring into artificial intelligence and quantum technology research, our state is positioning itself as a national leader in the industries of tomorrow. This is an exciting and necessary step — these technologies will shape the next generation of health care, national security, finance and countless other fields.

But as we chart this path toward a more innovative future, it’s critical that we don’t leave one essential pillar behind: clean energy and energy storage. For Maryland to be a hub in AI technology, it must also be a leader in the energy systems that will power it.

The reason is both practical and moral. AI data centers, high-performance quantum computers and advanced manufacturing hubs consume staggering amounts of electricity. As AI models grow larger and more powerful, and as quantum computers begin moving from research labs into operational facilities, their energy needs will only surge. Without a robust, sustainable energy infrastructure, Maryland risks creating an innovation ecosystem that is ultimately unsustainable.

Clean energy isn’t just about climate commitments —it’s about economic resilience, energy independence and long-term competitiveness. States that lead in renewable energy and energy storage technologies will be the states that attract future-focused industries. Already, the Department of Energy (DOE) has highlighted energy storage as a key enabler of grid reliability and economic growth.

The Energy Storage Grand Challenge (ESGC) focuses resources from across the DOE to create a comprehensive program to accelerate the development, commercialization and utilization of next-generation energy storage technologies and sustain American global leadership in energy storage. Therefore, enhanced efforts are required to transition technology from the lab to the marketplace and to facilitate manufacturing at scale. Similarly, the DOE Long Duration Storage Shot (LDS) aims to reduce storage costs by 90% for systems that deliver 10+ hours of electricity within the decade.

Maryland has made admirable progress in clean energy, with many projects underway and aggressive climate targets on the books. But to truly match its ambitions in AI and quantum, the state must equally prioritize research and development in advanced energy storage, grid modernization, and clean generation technologies. Public universities, national labs, and private companies need support to pioneer new battery chemistries, scalable grid storage solutions and AI-driven grid optimization tools.

Imagine a Maryland where AI breakthroughs help predict energy demand spikes, where quantum computers model new solar cell materials, and where locally developed long-duration energy storage systems keep our power grid clean, stable, and resilient — even in the face of rising demand. This isn’t a distant fantasy. It’s a future we can build, but only if we invest wisely today.

Maryland has seen significant successes in clean energy technology, particularly in the battery and solar sectors. Companies like Saft and Ion Storage Systems are leading innovators in battery technology. Solar power is the state’s largest renewable energy source, with a significant installed capacity. By the end of 2024, Maryland had installed 1,750 megawatts of solar power, making it the largest source of renewable energy. Similarly, the POWER Act, set a target for Maryland to generate 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2031.

To date, the offshore wind supply chain has brought over $815 millionin investments to the state, which includes millions of dollars to redevelop Baltimore County’s industrial waterfront for offshore-wind steel manufacturing and component staging, a high-voltage cable manufacturing facility in Baltimore City, an additional $25 million in public funding to strengthen the state’s union workforce, and $11 million toward environmental research through the University of Maryland.

It would be shortsighted to invest heavily in energy-intensive technologies without ensuring the sustainability of the energy systems that support them. Maryland has the chance to be a model for how to do both — to be a state where cutting-edge tech doesn’t just consume resources, but actively drives cleaner, smarter, and fairer energy solutions.

Even in times of fiscal and budgetary challenges, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) and the Maryland Energy Innovation Accelerator (MEIA) continue to play a key role in supporting new clean energy technologies, fostering an energy innovation ecosystem that has launched 66 companies.

In the race for the future, it won’t be enough to lead in AI or quantum alone. The true leaders will understand how deeply technology and energy are intertwined and build their innovation economies with that in mind. Maryland can — and should — be one of them.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/solarwind2025-1024x6831762777540.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=tD811nCE,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:33.485312

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate.
The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.
The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.
The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.","California has long cast itself as the nation’s climate conscience — and its policy lab.

Now, as the Environmental Protection Agency moves to revoke the backbone of federal climate rules — the scientific finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health — one of the state’s top climate officials is weighing a provocative idea put forward by environmental law experts: If Washington retreats, California could lead on carbon-controlling regulation.

Absent what’s known as the endangerment finding, the EPA may soon consider abandoning the legal authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles, power plants and other sources, furthering the Trump Administration’s stated aim to dismantle U.S. climate policy.

While decrying the prospect of such a move, climate advocates say a repeal would yield a silver lining: California and other states could in theory set their own greenhouse gas rules for cars and trucks, regulations previously superseded by federal authority.

Cars and trucks represent more than a third of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. A long shot regulatory gambit could clean some of the nation’s dirtiest air – and keep the state’s clean-car transition alive.

“All options are currently on the table,” Lauren Sanchez, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told CalMatters in an interview.

Authority states have never had before

A former federal official and expert on the Clean Air Act — who is also a law professor at UCLA — first floated this idea.

Ann Carlson wrote in the law journal Environmental Forum that an aggressive federal action against climate policy “could, ironically, provide states with authority they’ve never had before.”

The Trump administration now argues that greenhouse gases do not endanger health and that regulation is more harmful — a claim widely rejected by scientists, businesses and environmental groups, as well as states, including California.

“If greenhouse gases aren’t covered by the Clean Air Act,” Carlson told CalMatters, “then California could presumably regulate them — and so could every other state.”

Carlson, who ran the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration until last year and has written extensively about the landmark law, argues that the act only preempts state rules for pollutants it actually covers. States “have a pretty strong legal argument” to regulate greenhouse gases, she said.

The EPA, for its part, argues that states would still be barred from setting their own standards, arguing that its broad authority over air pollution covers even emissions the agency chooses not to regulate. That’s a view shared by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association and lobbying group, which supported overturning California’s phaseout of new, gas-powered cars, as well as the American Trucking Associations, which has opposed some of California’s rules on trucks.

Carlson said that argument doesn’t hold up. In her Environmental Forum article, she wrote: “If Congress didn’t intend the act to cover greenhouse gases, as the administration argues, then it’s hard to believe Congress intended to preempt states and localities from regulating them.”

In other words, she says, preemption has its limits.

Other experts agreed the idea is worth considering.

Ethan Elkind, who directs the climate program at UC Berkeley's Center for Law, Energy and the Environment, said that states are free to “do whatever they want,” as long as the federal government hasn’t preempted them.

Not a slam dunk for California to step in

For the better part of a century, California has worked to curb air pollution at the state and local level. The state’s vanguard status positions it well to test Trump’s move to curb federal climate regulation, say experts.

“I personally would be advocating that they move ahead,” said Mary Nichols, a former air board chair. “And if I were there, I would be looking to gain support for doing it.”

California holds a unique status under federal law. It can set tougher tailpipe-emission standards than the rest of the country — a recognition of its early leadership in fighting smog. Since 1968, the state has obtained more than 100 federal waivers for its vehicle rules, and other states can adopt California’s standards under certain conditions.

UC Berkeley law professor Daniel Farber said the state could even take a dual-track approach. “We don’t really think we need a waiver,” he would argue after EPA abandons the field, “but just in case we do: yes, give us one.”

California’s latest clash with Washington stems from a decades-long dance over who sets the nation’s toughest clean-car rules.

The state’s strict vehicle rules have helped spur innovations from catalytic converters to cleaner fuel to electric cars. The regulatory push began in Los Angeles after skies grew so smog-choked they stung peoples’ eyes.

In 1966, California adopted the nation’s first tailpipe standards. When Congress passed the 1970 Clean Air Act, it gave the state rare authority to set tougher rules — making California both a laboratory and a trailblazer, so long as it secured a federal waiver.

In 2002, California passed the nation’s first law regulating greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles. The Supreme Court’s 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA ruling confirmed those gases are pollutants under federal law, leading to the Obama administration’s 2009 “endangerment finding” that they harm public health.

Such a move would fit California’s pattern of pushing first and asking permission later. In 2005, the state adopted its greenhouse-gas standards for vehicles and sought a waiver before it was even clear whether carbon qualified as pollution under federal law. The EPA initially denied that request in 2008 but reversed course a year later, granting the waiver in 2009.

“So this wouldn't necessarily be a slam dunk approach for the state to take, but I think the legal avenue is now there,” said Elkin, of UC Berkeley.

Targeting cars with new regulation

If California tried to regulate greenhouse gases on its own, it would have both experience and infrastructure to rely on. The process would look a lot like how the state has written past clean-car rules — except this time, the target would be carbon itself.

California’s clean-car rules have operated within the permission-seeking framework set up by the Clean Air Act — until this year, when Trump and Congress moved to block the state’s plans to phase out gas cars and tighten diesel-truck standards. Trump’s EPA then went further by proposing to repeal the 2009 endangerment finding, framing it as a win for “consumer choice.”

Most of the state’s climate programs already run under authority of California’s own groundbreaking state laws: clean-energy mandates for utilities, a carbon-trading program for businesses, even standards to cut the carbon in fuels.

Cars are different. They’re sold into a national market, and tailpipe emissions have long been federally preempted — one reason California has needed Washington’s permission to go its own way.

If the state decides to test those limits, regulators would need to draft new rules and open them to public review — a process that could take years.

California has already started down the path of new rules for clean cars and trucks. Last month, the Air Resources Board began the process of crafting clean car rules in response to the Trump administration’s rollback of the state’s new gas-car ban — a revocation the state is also fighting in court. In December, the board plans to begin the process of writing new emissions rules for trucks.

The automobile association declined to comment on the new rulemaking effort. Patrick Kelly, vice president of energy and environmental affairs for American Trucking Associations, said the group would work with its state affiliate to “respond to specific proposals. “

“More broadly, (our group) supports achievable national standards and opposes a patchwork of state and local standards that Congress sought to avoid,” Kelly wrote in an email.

Asked by CalMatters whether the new rulemakings could become the vehicle for California to go its own way under Trump, Sanchez, the air board chair, said it’s an option staff is studying.

“It's something that staff is looking into, and I look forward to digging into myself,” Sanchez said.

No downside to trying, and some upsides

Even if legal experts like the idea in theory, UC Berkeley’s Dan Farber says California going forward alone is a longshot in practice.

“There's a chance you would win,” Farber said, of the argument that the state could directly regulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars. “You're buying a lawsuit, but other than litigation expenses, I don't think there's much downside in trying to do it.”

Farber and others point out that the Trump administration and car and truck manufacturers would almost certainly sue to block state-level efforts to regulate greenhouse gases.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation warned, in comments to the EPA, that if states were not preempted, any unregulated emission “would then become fair game,” creating conflicting standards across the country. Automakers have long argued that letting states write their own climate rules would create a costly patchwork of standards, raising prices for consumers and complicating production for a national market.

California is in somewhat of a legal quandary. The Clean Air Act requires California to meet national pollution standards, and the state still has some of the most air-polluted regions in the country.

The state’s solutions rely heavily on clean-car and truck rules to meet those requirements. If California falls short, it could lose federal highway funding, a situation that Sanchez called a ""no-win, Catch 22.”

After decades of regulation and incentives, California has built a reputation as a leader in electric cars, and experts said if the state pushes further on policy, that could help keep California’s clean-car transition alive and its electric-vehicle goals within reach.

Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, said California could also risk getting ahead of consumers if it goes it alone. Electric cars proved less popular than policymakers expected when it originally passed its goal to do away with sales of new gas-powered cars.

“What is clear is that the program was not overwhelmingly popular amongst the public, even in California, right?” Nigro said. “That's usually a flag for policymakers.”

Craig Segall, an independent consultant and former state air board deputy, said there’s another factor to consider: by preserving demand and infrastructure for EVs, the state could maintain a beachhead for innovation that a future president might build on.

With no coherent federal policy to compete in the global EV market, California could again use its regulatory and investment muscle — just as it once did in helping spawn electric car maker Tesla — to push the market forward.

“What the feds are basically signaling here is that the field is open for anyone who's serious about being a competitive car or truck company in five years,” Segall said. “One of those paths is: the world's fourth largest economy figures out ways to take its manufacturing economic capacity and just plow ahead.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8e4cd60/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x630+0+11/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F18%2F96%2F9023a31f45fca374a4d13f1bd8b6%2F030223-los-altos-ev-sk-cm-16.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 10:05:26.328881

This story was originally published by Vox and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: Cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front—especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules—cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again—leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Trump’s Transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect.

That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.”

The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations—but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don’t have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance.

Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won’t come out until 2030—when someone else will be in the White House.

The US auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That’s why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond US shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the US and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/e32fe4e60967b2faa0cc8d32427b3271af63fc94.webp?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-10 08:01:58.758520

Duke Energy’s annual shareholder meeting in May appeared to be the acme of corporate comfort. The Charlotte-based utility’s leadership, featuring recently appointed CEO Harry Sideris, sat in cushy, grey padded chairs, accompanied by tasteful, white floral arrangements and potted green ferns.

It was all smiles and reassuring tones as they glided through shareholder proposal votes and plans to invest $83 billion in electricity generation and transmission over the next five years.

Yet when the presentation turned to shareholder queries, a disruption broke the placid surface. “Just a reminder that I’m reading these questions word-for-word as they were submitted,” said Duke Vice President of Investor Relations Abby Motsinger.

“‘Will you please stop all DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion] activities and fire all DEI function workers?’” Motsinger read. Her eyes closed and lips pursed into a frown before the camera cut to Sideris. The CEO stared straight ahead as he addressed the question.

“We respect that there are a lot of differing viewpoints on this social issue,” said Sideris. “First and foremost, let me emphasize that we’ve always had a merit-based approach to hiring—our employment decisions have always been, and still are, based on skills, experience, capabilities, and performance.”

“But it is also our experience that building a diverse workforce with different perspectives and experiences, as well as creating an inclusive workplace, makes us stronger and more resilient,” Sideris continued. “We see diversity as a competitive advantage, ultimately benefiting our employees and the customers we serve. We understand and value that everyone has a difference of opinion on this topic, and we will always remain compliant with the applicable laws and governmental requirements at the federal and state levels.”

If Duke Energy still regards diversity as an advantage, however, it has been less keen to champion its value. In the wake of the 2020 George Floyd protests, Sideris’s predecessor Lynn Good told investors that Duke would “continue to advocate for change, stand up for justice and ensure the communities where we work and live are provided with equal opportunities.”

Duke has also taken a more muted position on other initiatives investors commonly lump together as a shorthand for responsible corporate citizenship: environmental, social, and governance, or ESG.

In 2022, the utility published a full ESG report, calling it “one of our most important annual publications” and its principles “essential to who we are.” This year, the acronym and the phrase it represents were entirely absent from company communications, and the 2022 report appears to have been removed from its website (though a copy of the document is available through the nonprofit Internet Archive).

Duke is far from alone in making this shift. Across both North Carolina and corporate America, many companies have pulled back from bold social statements and shed thousands of jobs tied to diversity efforts since a peak in 2023. Many fear the wrath of President Donald Trump’s administration, which recently called ESG “a Marxist march through corporate culture.”

But activists argue that Duke’s stance—or failure to take one—is particularly important. The utility is the fourth-most valuable company headquartered in North Carolina and a leader among the state’s corporate citizens. It’s faced racial justice issues since at least 1971, when the U.S. Supreme Court found the company was discriminating against Black workers in a landmark case. Environmental groups have put pressure on the company as well, pointing to data that shows Duke Energy has placed polluting infrastructure like coal ash ponds in predominantly minority communities. They also suggest the company’s future plans for power generation could overburden the state’s most vulnerable residents.

Duke itself hasn’t been clear about the extent to which changes in how it talks about ESG relate to changes in practice. Over a series of email exchanges, Duke spokespeople first said that the company planned to comment, then that a response was being considered for approval, and then declined.

“We have decided to sit this one out and we look forward to working with you on future stories,” spokesperson Shawna Berger finally wrote, two months after The Assembly’s initial outreach.

Under the Radar

The clearest examples of Duke’s shifting messaging can be found in its proxy statements and 10-K forms, which are annual reports the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requires companies to submit informing their shareholders about the firm and its plans.

Documents Duke released in early 2024 featured both internal and external programs meant to further social and environmental goals. The latest iterations omit substantial parts of that language.

On diversity, last year’s 10-K includes references to an executive-level “Enterprise Diversity and Inclusion Council,” “aspirational goals” for workplace representation of women and people of color, and partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities aimed at “building a diverse and highly skilled talent pipeline.”

The 2024 proxy statement highlights employee discussions to “support an inclusive workplace,” along with “diversity, including racial and ethnic diversity [and] gender” as desired qualities for board members.

None of those references show up in the 2025 10-K or proxy statement, and Duke declined to respond to an extensive series of questions regarding the status of its DEI efforts.

Sue Sturgis, a Raleigh-based researcher with the California nonprofit Energy & Policy Institute, said these annual reports are signals to shareholders about where Duke is headed. If something is eliminated, an investor would reasonably conclude it’s no longer a company priority.

“I would presume, as an investor, that what I’m seeing in these documents are statements about material realities,” Sturgis said. “These are not just press releases.”

Attempts to independently verify the status of specific Duke DEI programs yielded mixed results. For example, the utility announced in 2018 that it had joined the HBCU Partnership Challenge spearheaded by U.S. Rep. Alma Adams, a Democrat who represents most of Charlotte. Adams’ office did not respond to questions about whether Duke Energy remains a partner.

Comment requests about Duke’s DEI work to the state chapter and national leadership of the American Association of Blacks in Energy, a nonprofit of which many Black Duke employees are members, were either unacknowledged or declined.

In 2019, Duke touted its work with the N.C. Governor’s HBCU Internship Program, a UNC System initiative, to bolster workforce diversity. But Andy Wallace, a UNC spokesperson, confirmed that the company has not been involved with the program since at least 2021.

In other cases, Duke appears to be continuing support for programs, particularly at HBCUs, though it no longer mentions that work in public communications. Jordan Howse, spokesperson for the North Carolina A&T State University’s College of Engineering, confirmed that the utility has continued to back its HOME Program, but declined to share specifics. At North Carolina Central University, Duke Energy continues to support an internship for law students and a dual-degree program for physics and math students, said spokesperson Quiana Shepard, but she did not provide current funding levels.

Another effort Duke has continued is a free laptop program with the Davidson-based nonprofit E2D. The company highlighted its support to distribute computers to students at 10 North Carolina HBCUs in a 2024 blog post, but hasn’t mentioned the program since then. When it was announced, E2D President Pat Millen said Duke’s leadership was “setting a new standard for corporate responsibility in North Carolina.”

In a recent interview, Millen said Duke’s commitment hasn’t changed and has helped provide more than 5,000 computers a year, along with volunteer hours and financial support. But he acknowledges that companies (and nonprofits like his both face “difficulties associated with how the White House wants us to perceive certain words and certain phrases.”

E2D’s laptop program now explicitly targets first-generation college students rather than HBCUs, though most students receiving computers already met that criterion, Millen said. The nonprofit made that change independently, he said, and not due to pressure from Duke or other business partners. Still, he recognizes that the shift may provide some donors political cover by not tying their gifts to race or diversity initiatives.

“Specific language seems to matter more at this moment than at any other time I can recall,” Millen said. “That said, we are proud to be leaning even harder into our core principles than ever, and our first-gen work, if anything, represents a broader and more expansive expression of E2D’s and our partners’ impact.”

The Bottom Line

Duke has also pulled back on its environmental positioning. This year’s 10-K drops a previous claim that the company was “advancing regulatory models that support carbon and methane emission reductions.”

Instead, the utility now seeks to “leverage regulatory models that support the delivery of reliable energy, timely cost recovery, and affordable customer rates.”

In Duke’s proxy statement, the company removed two full pages outlining plans to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. It also eliminated language that claimed the company’s carbon reduction goals were in line with the Paris Climate Agreement, an international treaty meant to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.

And Duke leaders now have weaker financial incentives to accelerate the company’s green transition. Progress on “energy modernization”—formerly called “clean energy”—now accounts for 10 percent of bonus pay, down from 12.5 percent in 2024. Changes to that bonus goal also no longer reward executives for boosting battery storage or expanding customer-owned rooftop solar. Company spokespeople declined to comment on any of these points.

As with its diversity language, Duke’s environmental messaging is responding to a new political landscape, said Mikaela Curry, a campaign manager for the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign in North Carolina.

But Curry believes the difference here is that the company sees economic opportunity in pivoting. She pointed to Duke signing on to a January letter to Lee Zeldin, Trump’s nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, asking him to roll back regulations on emissions and coal ash cleanup that it claimed were “unnecessary costs on the power sector.”

At the state level, the utility lobbied for Senate Bill 266, legislation passed this July that eliminated a previous requirement to reduce carbon emissions 70 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. (The company must still reach net-zero emissions by 2050.) Duke’s latest plan for meeting North Carolina’s projected power needs takes advantage of the delay in targets to add more gas plants, extend the life of existing coal plants, and delay building wind and hydropower infrastructure. It adds less utility-scale solar than the company had planned in 2023, even though it’s among the cheapest available sources of power.

The changes benefit Duke financially, as state regulations provide the utility an approximately 10 percent return on equity for power plants it builds.

Another 2021 state law requires Duke Energy to purchase 45 percent of its solar power from third parties, a cost it can pass on to ratepayers but does not yield a return on capital investment. Because the law does not require that for other sources of power, Duke profits more from building and operating its own gas power plants.

“The company will take advantage of any opportunity that it can to advance its own interests,” Curry said, “and those interests are not always necessarily aligned with the best interests of North Carolinians.”

Charging Ahead

Duke is certainly not acting in a political vacuum. The Trump administration has threatened companies it deems “the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners” with civil compliance investigations; in a recent appearance at the United Nations, Trump lambasted “the green energy scam.”

The North Carolina General Assembly is moving in a similar, if less rhetorically florid, direction. Democratic Gov. Josh Stein vetoed the measure eliminating the 2030 emission targets, but the Republican-majority overrode that veto with the help of three Democrats.

The N.C. Utilities Commission, which regulates Duke Energy, came under majority Republican control after the passage of legislation last December that removed an appointment from the governor. The most recently appointed commissioner, Donald van der Vaart, has denied the scientific consensus on humanity’s role in climate change and the health dangers of greenhouse gases.

Duke’s shareholders, like others across the country, don’t seem to be showing a particular appetite for progressive policies. According to investment firm Morningstar, the average support for shareholder resolutions on ESG has dropped to 16 percent, down more than half from a peak of support a few years ago.

Bryant Sewell, the co-executive director of the shareholder advocacy group Majority Action, said he encouraged Duke shareholders to vote against reelecting then-CEO Good and Lead Director Michael Browning to the company’s board in 2021 over what he called a failure to act on the climate crisis and racial equity.

Those votes didn’t come close to unseating the two leaders, but this year’s campaign against reelecting board members Theodore Craver and Robert Davis received even less shareholder support.

“Particularly in the electric utility sector, [companies] have made enough progress to where investor attention has been diverted elsewhere,” Sewell said.

But in a political landscape hostile to environmental and social activism, Sewell said, outside pressure on private companies may become even more important—at least to get shareholders to consider the potential impacts of climate change on their investments.

“Particularly in this moment where there’s government retrenchment, these institutional investors are critical players that can make or break our future,” he said. “I think that’s really important for people to know and to factor into not just their financial decision-making, but their decision-making around what kind of world we want to see and live in.”",https://www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP146589517236-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 08:23:20.347050

Emma Green’s piece provided a thorough examination of the effects that the Trump Administration’s attacks on higher education are having on research (“Degrees of Hostility,” October 20th). After twenty-four years of teaching at a suburban public university—one that primarily serves working- and middle-class students—I find that this is not the aspect of the Administration’s actions that frightens me most. What I see today is that, under Donald Trump’s direction, critical thinking is under assault. Across disciplines, Trump’s agenda threatens one of higher education’s core missions—to teach the next generation to think critically about power’s relationship to knowledge. When the search for knowledge is subsumed by ideology, we’re no longer in the business of education so much as that of teaching people to accept the dictates of official power.

According to Gallup, the share of Americans who view college as “very important” has declined sharply in recent years, from seventy-five per cent in 2010 to thirty-five per cent today. Many commentators have framed this as a symptom of anti-intellectualism. In my opinion, what this transition really reflects is decades of capitalist individualism. We stopped treating higher education as a shared civic good, and started selling it as a private investment promising personal prosperity. When the investment failed to pay off as promised, public trust collapsed.

In this respect, universities bear some blame for their own decline. Chasing privilege, tuition revenue, and rankings has blurred their mission. Green shows how federal strategy has weaponized this distrust by building on a feeling, already possessed by much of the public, that universities are not public partners but misbehaving contractors. This strategy deepens the cynicism that it exploits. If we want people to value higher education again, we must stop marketing it as a luxury with uncertain returns, and restore it to the status of a public good with collective benefits.

I appreciated the insightful piece by Green, but, as an architect, I wish that she had refrained from architectural criticism. The Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building, in Washington, D.C., is not, as Green calls it, an “ugly” “concrete shoebox” but an elegant example of International Style modernism, and an important part of our capital’s modernist heritage.

When it opened, in 1961, Federal Building No. 6, as it was then called, was lauded as the first modernist building in the capital’s monumental core, befitting the very modern mission of one of its first occupants, NASA. The austere structure, made of limestone (not concrete) and glass, demonstrated the compatibility of modern design with D.C.’s classicism—a concept that has since been attacked by Trump’s regressive executive order on “Promoting Beautiful Federal Civic Architecture,” which aims to purge modern architecture from the federal real-estate portfolio. Just as this Administration seeks to diminish or eliminate social-welfare agencies—the Department of Education, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental Protection Agency, the list goes on—it is moving to dispose of the mid-century-modern buildings that house them.

Disbursements from the landmark Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) Products Liability Litigation settlements with 3M and DuPont began this past summer for eligible water systems that submitted claims documentation on time. For many systems, awards from these settlements will be in the many millions of dollars, much needed funds to upgrade their facilities with PFAS treatment technology or to pay themselves back for investments already made to remove PFAS from their source water and comply with new EPA regulations.

It is now time for water systems eligible for the next phase of the 3M and DuPont settlements to ensure they submit their claims ahead of next year’s deadlines in order to access the funds available to them. These “Phase Two” systems are those that did not detect PFAS in their water (any PFAS, at any concentration) until after June 22, 2023, so long as they serve a population of more than 3,300 people or were otherwise required to test for PFAS under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 5 (UCMR-5). (Community systems of any size are eligible under the DuPont settlement, but not the 3M settlement, if they were required to test for PFAS under state law.)

A Potentially Overlooked Funding Source: The Special Needs Fund

For Phase Two water systems, deadlines are drawing near. The “Action Funds,” which compensate systems based on the levels of PFAS in each of their sources and the size of those sources, will account for the primary stream of settlement payments, but utilities should not overlook an additional source of support: the Special Needs Funds. This lesser known benefit of the settlements could mean substantial cost recovery for systems that have already incurred PFAS response costs and/or will incur such costs before Aug. 1, 2026. Utilities can be eligible for both funding streams, and with the 2026 deadlines approaching fast, understanding how these settlements funds work is key to ensuring no available dollars are left unclaimed.

Upcoming Deadlines: Testing Expense Reimbursement, the Action Fund and Special Needs Fund

There are three deadlines in 2026 that Phase Two water systems should know about. The first – Jan. 1, 2026 – is the date by which water systems must submit testing cost claims forms for both the DuPont and 3M settlements in order to get reimbursed for their PFAS testing expenses. This funding source is available to all Phase Two water systems – even those that haven’t detected PFAS in their source water – so long as they were not required to test their sources for PFAS under state law.

The second round of deadlines – June 30, 2026, for the DuPont settlement and July 31, 2026, for the 3M settlement – are the dates by which water systems must submit their Action Fund Claims Form. In order to be eligible for compensation under the settlement’s allocation procedures, systems must complete baseline PFAS testing for each water source and submit the lab reports of that testing, together with documentation of the production capacity and annual production of each source, by these deadlines.

The Special Needs Funds deadline is the final deadline in 2026: Aug. 1 for both DuPont and 3M settlements. A water system can apply for the Special Needs Funds, in addition to the Action Funds, if – by Aug. 1, 2026 – it will have spent money on efforts to address PFAS detections in its impacted water sources. Examples include taking contaminated wells offline, designing and building treatment facilities, purchasing replacement water, and/or drilling new wells to provide PFAS-free water sources to communities.

Expenses incurred before the Aug. 1 Special Needs Fund claims deadline may qualify for reimbursement, subject to the claims administrator’s discretion. These claims can offer additional funding beyond recoveries from the Action Fund. Applicants must provide thorough documentation to substantiate the project’s costs. For municipalities that have already invested or need to invest soon in protecting public health and water quality, this represents a valuable chance to recoup some of those unanticipated expenses.

How Phase Two Water Systems Should Prepare to Apply for Settlement Funds

To position your water system for the strongest possible recovery:

Document all PFAS-related costs. Utilities should capture invoices, contracts and staff time associated with their PFAS response. The claims process requires detailed evidence of spending to qualify for Special Needs reimbursement.

Coordinate with legal and finance teams. Working closely with legal counselors, who understand both the legal and financial requirements, will avoid delaying or jeopardizing funding eligibility.

Begin testing immediately. Testing must be completed and results submitted no later than July 2026, but the deadline for testing that can be reimbursed under the settlements is January 1, 2026.

The Upshot for Phase Two Water Systems: Act Now

For many municipalities and water utilities, PFAS-related costs have already strained budgets and delayed critical infrastructure work. The recent historic settlements are holding PFAS polluters accountable and easing that burden, but securing full recovery demands timely action, careful documentation, and awareness of all funding options, including the Special Needs Fund. A law firm with experience in water contamination litigation can take on the hard work of the settlement process, including eligibility review, analysis, strategy and paperwork, all while ensuring deadlines are met.

With major deadlines approaching in 2026, utilities that act now stand the best chance of receiving settlement payouts before the window closes.

Second, long-term and targeted financing will be crucial to develop the critical minerals supply chain.","As COP30 draws close, expectations are high that nations will work to translate climate commitments into on-the-ground action. The summit offers an opportunity to confront the material realities of the clean energy transition, including the need to secure critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, graphite and rare earth elements.

Minerals have long been part of the energy transition conversation. Growing trade tensions, export restrictions and the weaponisation of minerals supply chains have brought the subject to the forefront. A handful of countries, including China, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan, control most of the global refining and processing capacity. For instance, China alone controls around 90% of rare earth processing, 70% of global cobalt refining, and over 60% of lithium refining. This dominance is a result of two decades of strategic investment in refining, processing, and manufacturing, while other countries remained dependent on imports. In 2025, China imposed export controls on 12 rare earth elements, and tightened restrictions across the lithium-ion battery supply chain, showing how such concentration exposes the energy transition to strategic risks, from price volatility to potential supply chain disruptions.

The scale of the challenge is immense. The International Energy Agency under Stated Policies Scenario estimates that the demand for lithium can grow fivefold by 2040, while the demand for graphite and nickel might double. Meanwhile, the demand for cobalt and rare earth elements is likely to increase 50-60% by 2040. In short, minerals are fast becoming the new oil of the 21st century: vital, contested, and geopolitically charged. Like oil, the challenge is not just scarcity, it is concentration. The extraction of critical minerals is often geographically limited to resource-rich but economically vulnerable regions. This imbalance exposes developing economies to the risks of extractive dependence, while leaving manufacturing nations vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions.

Addressing these risks requires greater diversification and coordinated international engagement. COP30 must embed this agenda, recognising supply chain resilience and equitable access as climate imperatives. Global initiatives such as the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP), the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), the Group of Twenty, and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity have begun shaping a new architecture for responsible and resilient critical minerals supply chains. Multilateral partnerships like the India–Australia Critical Minerals Partnership (2022), US–Japan–Korea trilateral agreement (2025), and the recent US–Australia mineral framework (2025) and US–Japan framework underscore this momentum. Together, they aim to align trade and investment priorities, foster technology transfer and ensure equitable benefit sharing.

Yet, even as these global frameworks take shape, their success will ultimately depend on the readiness of individual nations to meaningfully participate in the global critical minerals value chain. This includes policy coherence, institutional coordination, infrastructure and human resource development, be it in extraction, processing, manufacturing or recycling. Examples include India’s National Critical Mineral Mission, Australia’s Future Made in Australia bill, and Japan’s Green Transformation Strategy.

The path forward lies in translating global and domestic commitments into practical frameworks that strengthen governance, mobilise resources, and build long-term technological capability.

First, countries must move away from past mining models and instead prioritise sustainability, and robust environmental, social and governance standards across the value chain. Tools like AI-based mineral mapping, digital traceability systems and stronger audit mechanisms can help enhance oversight. Frameworks like the G7 Minerals Action Plan and initiatives such as the MSP and QUAD can be leveraged to ensure wider participation in the setting and implementation of global standards.

Second, long-term and targeted financing will be crucial to develop the critical minerals supply chain. Establishing a global clean minerals investment facility could bridge capital and operational expenditure gaps, enable processing and recycling projects beyond traditional monopoly geographies, and mobilise capital alongside development banks and green financing institutions to ensure risk sharing and a steady capital flow. Such an initiative can also support long-term offtake arrangements and promote equitable access to investment.

Third, advancing technology, refining, and recycling will require coordinated leadership from governments, industry, and research institutions. Governments must create enabling policies and funding mechanisms for technology development and skill-building, while industry should invest in modern infrastructure. Universities and research institutes can drive joint R&D and cross-border training in mining, chemical, and process engineering. Partnerships that connect emerging economies like India, Indonesia, and African nations with technology leaders such as Japan and the US can accelerate progress in processing, recycling, and alternative battery chemistries. Such cooperation not only addresses workforce gaps but also supports a just, inclusive transition by enabling developing economies to participate more equitably in global value chains.

Ultimately, COP30 offers a defining moment to turn mineral diplomacy into climate action, ensuring that the race to decarbonise also becomes a race to cooperate, diversify, and build a just and resilient clean energy future.",https://ieefa.org/sites/default/files/2025-11/shutterstock_2515442005.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:10:03.893312

Detroit, MI — November 2025

Detroit — the city that once forged America’s iron, engines, and energy — is roaring back to life with a modern-day industrial marvel: the Intelligent Clean Coal Power Stove, a revolutionary home heating and power system that merges AI-driven clean combustion with micro steam-electric generation.

Invented and developed in Detroit, this technology honors the city’s legacy as the Stove Capital of the World — where the largest stove ever built once stood, before a lightning strike destroyed the monument in 2011. Now, in an almost poetic twist, that spark of lightning seems to have reignited Detroit’s furnace of invention.

From Heat to Power — The Reinvention of Coal

The new Detroit design combines three integrated systems into a single unit:

An AI-Controlled Combustion Chamber that burns coal with unprecedented precision — using real-time oxygen sensors and variable-speed fans to ensure complete combustion with minimal waste gases.

A Liquid Scrubber System that bubbles exhaust through ultra-pure circulating water, creating millions of microbubbles that strip toxins, ash, and acidic gases while capturing thermal energy.

A Steam Engine Generator Add-On, which harnesses the recovered heat from the scrubber to produce steam that drives a compact turbine connected to a high-efficiency alternator — charging an onboard battery bank or feeding power into a microgrid.

The result is a multi-function energy system that produces clean heat, clean water, and renewable-like electricity, all from one of America’s most abundant and inexpensive natural resources: Kentucky coal.

“Coal isn’t going away tomorrow,” said inventor Richard Gerber, the Detroit engineer behind the project. “But with intelligence, microbubbles, and smart thermodynamics, it doesn’t have to pollute. We’ve made a 19th-century fuel behave like a 21st-century technology.”

How It Works — The Intelligent Heat Cycle

At the heart of the system lies a self-learning embedded controller. Sensors constantly monitor combustion temperature, oxygen level, CO and SO₂ concentrations, and water quality in the scrubber. The AI adjusts fan speed and airflow to achieve a clean, steady burn that automatically adapts to the user’s heat demand.

The hot scrubber water — now laden with both absorbed heat and trace mineral particles — is routed to a closed-loop heat exchanger. This thermal energy generates pressurized steam, which spins a compact turbine generator, converting excess heat into usable electricity.

The generated power can be:

Stored in batteries for nighttime use or off-grid independence.

Fed into a home inverter to power lights, electronics, or even EV chargers.

Used to run the stove’s own intelligent control system, making it fully self-sustaining.

What remains after energy extraction is purified condensate water and a manageable byproduct — a mineral-rich sludge that can be filtered, dried, and analyzed for potential reuse.

A Return to Detroit’s Iron Heart

Detroit’s legacy in stove and furnace production stretches back more than a century, when cast-iron masterpieces from Michigan-based companies heated homes across America. The city’s foundries, which once poured molten metal for both stoves and engines, are echoed in this new design — blending craftsmanship with circuitry.

“Detroit was the world’s stove capital,” said Gerber. “Now it’s building the world’s smartest stove. The symbolism is powerful — the largest stove ever built was destroyed by lightning, and now we’ve brought it back as a lightning-powered, AI-integrated generator.”

Cheap Heat, Local Fuel, and Energy Independence

Coal remains one of the most affordable domestic energy sources, especially from nearby Appalachian regions such as Kentucky and West Virginia. With modern automation, safe ash handling, and microbubble scrubbers, the Detroit Clean Coal Power Stove offers a way to use local fuel responsibly — producing cheap, clean, independent heat and power.

In an age when home energy prices fluctuate and grid reliability is under pressure, this innovation could redefine rural and urban heating alike. A single household unit could offset both home heating costs and electrical bills, with emission profiles comparable to modern gas furnaces.

The catch? This isn’t grey hydrogen. It’s blue. Natural gas and steam team up to churn out hydrogen and CO₂, and the plan is to lock that CO₂ safely underground. We’re talking 30-plus miles of pipeline, nine injection wells—and even lines threading into protected wetlands around Lake Maurepas.

Why Louisiana?

Ascension Parish sits smack in the middle of “Cancer Alley,” a stretch of petrochemical plants along the Mississippi. About 130,000 people live here, trading pollution for paychecks for decades. Now the promise of “low-carbon” hydrogen is reopening old wounds: can a new plant really dodge adding more health risks?

What’s at Stake?

Production scale: up to 1,700 tonnes of hydrogen per day, if all goes to plan.

Ammonia edge: converting H₂ into a major fertilizer feedstock.

CCS spotlight: trapping emissions underground—but is it as foolproof as they say?

Economic push: billions in investment and dozens of construction jobs hanging in the balance.

Real-World Pushback

Grassroots groups led by Earthworks insist this is greenwashing. They cite the 2020 CO₂ pipeline leak in Mississippi and argue no carbon capture project has truly proven its safety or met its lofty capture targets. Protests, petitions and permit hearings have slowed progress and rattled investors and regulators alike.

Game Plan: De-Risking the Dream

Air Products isn’t throwing in the towel. They’re slicing the project into manageable chunks, inviting partners to take on the riskiest parts—ammonia synthesis and CCS. By spreading the risk, they hope to lock in offtake deals, secure financing and nudge those permits across the finish line.

Strategic Angle

This whole effort leans heavily on U.S. incentives for carbon capture and hydrogen production. Federal tax credits and grants are on the table, but so is intense scrutiny. If this Louisiana blue hydrogen plant pulls it off, it could trigger a wave of similar projects—or highlight the pitfalls of the so-called “low-carbon” route.

Looking Ahead

There’s no final green light yet. The Air Products CEO teases a decision by late 2025, but with permits, partner agreements and community buy-in still unresolved, it’s anyone’s guess. The outcome will show whether blue hydrogen delivers real climate wins—or just props up the fossil fuel era a bit longer.

Financial Statements

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

To supplement EVgo’s financial information, which is prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, EVgo uses certain non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. EVgo uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. EVgo believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of EVgo’s recurring core business operating results.

EVgo believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing EVgo’s performance. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to the Company’s historical performance. EVgo believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and (2) they are used by EVgo’s institutional investors and the analyst community to help them analyze the health of EVgo’s business.

For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures, please see the sections titled “Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Definitions of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This release includes some, but not all of the following non-GAAP financial measures, in each case as defined below: “Charging Network Gross Profit,” “Charging Network Gross Margin,” “Adjusted Cost of Sales,” “Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue,” “Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss),” “Adjusted Gross Margin,” “Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses,” “Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue,” “EBITDA,” “EBITDA Margin,” “Adjusted EBITDA,” “Adjusted EBITDA Margin,” and “Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets.” With respect to Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets, pursuant to the terms of certain OEM contracts, EVgo is paid well in advance of when revenue can be recognized, and usually, the payment is tied to the number of stalls that commence operations under the applicable contractual arrangement while the related revenue is deferred at the time of payment and is recognized as revenue over time as EVgo provides charging and other services to the OEM and the OEM’s customers. EVgo management therefore uses these measures internally to establish forecasts, budgets, and operational goals to manage and monitor its business, including the cash used for, and the return on, its investment in its charging infrastructure. EVgo believes that these measures are useful to investors in evaluating EVgo’s performance and help to depict a meaningful representation of the performance of the underlying business, enabling EVgo to evaluate and plan more effectively for the future.

Charging Network Gross Profit, Charging Network Gross Margin, Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses, Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under GAAP and the items excluded from or included in these metrics are significant components in understanding and assessing EVgo’s financial performance. These metrics should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP.

EVgo defines Charging Network Gross Profit as total charging network revenue less charging network cost of sales. EVgo defines Charging Network Gross Margin as Charging Network Gross Profit divided by total charging network revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before (i) depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, and (ii) share-based compensation. EVgo defines Adjusted Cost of Sales as a Percentage of Revenue as Adjusted Cost of Sales as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as revenue less Adjusted Cost of Sales. EVgo defines Adjusted Gross Margin as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as general and administrative expenses before (i) share-based compensation, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment expense, (iii) bad debt expense (recoveries), and (iv) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing performance. EVgo defines Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a Percentage of Revenue as Adjusted General and Administrative Expenses as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before (i) depreciation, net of capital-build amortization, (ii) amortization, (iii) accretion, (iv) interest income, (v) interest expense, and (vi) income tax expense (benefit). EVgo defines EBITDA Margin as EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus (i) share-based compensation, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, net of insurance recoveries, and impairment expense, (iii) loss (gain) on investments, (iv) bad debt expense (recoveries), (v) change in fair value of earnout liability, (vi) change in fair value of warrant liabilities, and (vii) certain other items that management believes are not indicative of EVgo’s ongoing performance. EVgo defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. EVgo defines Capital Expenditures, Net of Capital Offsets as capital expenditures adjusted for the following capital offsets: (i) all payments under OEM infrastructure agreements excluding any amounts directly attributable to OEM customer charging credit programs and pass-through of non-capital expense reimbursements, (ii) proceeds from capital-build funding and (iii) proceeds from the transfer of 30C income tax credits, net of transaction costs.

Management Comments

Stuart Bodden, Ranger’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Today, we are pleased to announce the acquisition of American Well Services, a Permian based well services provider, at a compelling valuation. This transaction galvanizes our role as the leading well services provider, while providing new growth opportunities through additional service lines that complement Ranger’s existing high spec rigs business. AWS, as well as Ranger, have benefitted from customer consolidation in recent history and we strongly believe this combination will create further value. AWS has created a strong platform with 39 well-maintained high-spec rigs that include complementary equipment and well-trained crews that will integrate seamlessly into Ranger. The combined company will become the largest well services provider in the Lower 48 with the most compelling technology in the space. Ranger is excited for the value that it will bring to our shareholders in the future.

“Ranger continues to demonstrate resilience as broader industry conditions fluctuate. Although our financial performance was recently challenged by a difficult macro-environment, I am confident in the strategic positioning and underlying strength of the company. Despite declines in our completion-focused service lines, particularly Coil Tubing in the Rockies, our production-focused business model has kept our operations on firm footing, attracting blue-chip customers who rely on us for their most difficult and demanding projects. Notably, production rig hours in our core HSR segment increased compared to the second quarter, reflecting our disciplined approach and stable demand in this area. We also maintained a strong balance sheet and allocated capital effectively during this period, including an aggressive share repurchase of 667,500 shares and payment of our base load dividend for the quarter. For the year, we have returned $15.6 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, a testament to our cash flow strength, having generated $25.8 million of free cash flow even while navigating challenging market conditions.

We also continue to be energized by the introduction of our ECHO rig, our recently introduced electric hybrid rig that offers an opportunity to convert conventional rigs into a next generation rig with a lower emissions profile, safety enhancements and operational efficiencies. ECHO is a differentiated solution that further solidifies Ranger’s position as the well-service provider of choice. The first two ECHO rigs have been delivered and are being deployed presently. Customer interest remains robust, and we look forward to updating you about our ongoing conversions as clients recognize the value and innovation these rigs bring to their operations.

As we look forward, our continued resilience is only possible with the hard work and dedication of our employees and the support of our customers. Our future success will be defined by their continued outstanding contributions,” concluded Mr. Bodden.

CAPITAL RETURNS AND GOVERNANCE UPDATE

Year to date through September 30th, 2025, the Company has repurchased 945,600 shares of stock for a total value of $11.6 million, net of tax, at an average price of $12.20 per share. Since the share repurchase program’s inception in 2023 through the end of the third quarter of 2025, the Company has repurchased a total of 4,271,400 shares, for a total value of $46.4 million, net of tax.

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

For the third quarter of 2025, revenue was $128.9 million, a decrease from $153.0 million in the prior year period, and from $140.6 million in the prior quarter. Quarter over quarter decreases are attributable to reduced operating activity across all service segments.

Cost of services for the third quarter of 2025 was $109.1 million, or 85%, of revenue, relatively flat compared to 84% of revenue in the prior year period. General and administrative expenses were $6.6 million for the third quarter of 2025, an improvement from $7.0 million in the prior quarter and from $7.1 million in the prior year period.

Net income totaled $1.2 million for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $8.7 million in the prior year period and $7.3 million in the prior quarter. Fully diluted earnings per share was $0.05 for the third quarter of 2025 compared to $0.39 in the prior year period and $0.32 in the prior quarter.

Adjusted EBITDA(1) for the third quarter of 2025 was $16.8 million, a decrease of $8.3 million from $25.1 million in the prior year period, and a decrease of $3.8 million from $20.6 million in the prior quarter. The year over year decrease was driven by lower activity levels from both the prior quarter and the prior year quarter as well as certain non-cash inventory adjustments recorded during the third quarter.

BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL RESULTS

High Specification Rigs

High Specification Rigs segment revenue was $80.9 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $5.8 million relative to the prior year period and $5.4 million relative to the prior quarter. Rig hours were down to 111,200 from 116,900 in the prior year period and from 117,000 in the prior quarter. Rig hours were down as a consequence of reduction in completion related work and softness in our northern region. Hourly rig rates slightly decreased by 2% to $727 from $741 in the prior year period and from $738 per hour in the prior quarter, a reflection of an increase in standby hours at lower rates during the third quarter of 2025 as customers chose to hold more rigs idle between projects.

Operating income was $10.0 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 28%, compared to $13.8 million in the prior year period, and a decrease of $2.0 million, or 17%, compared to the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $15.7 million in the third quarter, down from $19.2 million in the prior year period and from $17.6 million in the prior quarter.

Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services

Processing Solutions and Ancillary Services segment revenue was $30.8 million in the third quarter of 2025, down $1.4 million, or 4%, from $32.2 million in the prior quarter and down $5.2 million, or 14% from $36.0 million for the prior year period. The decrease from the prior year period was largely attributable to reductions in operational activity within coil tubing which is completions focused and declines in our P&A service line year over year as customers have cut back on any non-essential spending. The decrease from the prior quarter was similarly attributable to activity declines in our coil tubing service and some contract roll-over delays in the Torrent service line offset by more recent improvements in P&A activity.

Operating income was $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2025, down from $6.6 million in the prior year period and from $4.5 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $5.5 million, down from $8.8 million in the prior year period and from $6.6 million in the prior quarter.

Wireline Services

Wireline Services segment revenue was $17.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, a decline of $13.1 million, or 43%, compared to $30.3 million in the prior year period, and a decline of $4.9 million, or 22%, from $22.1 million in the prior quarter. Our Completions service line reported 1,800 completed stage counts, a decrease of 28% compared to 2,500 in both the prior year period and the prior quarter.

Operating loss was $4.2 million in the third quarter of 2025, compared to a breakeven in the prior year period and an operating loss of $1.2 million in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA(1) was $0.4 million, down from $2.7 million in the prior year period and $1.6 million for the prior quarter. Operating income was impacted by non-cash items related to inventory adjustments for explosives within the completions service line.

BALANCE SHEET, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY

As of September 30, 2025, total liquidity was $116.7 million, consisting of $71.5 million of capacity on its revolving credit facility and $45.2 million of cash on hand. This compares to December 31, 2024 when the Company had $112.1 million of liquidity, consisting of $71.2 million of capacity on its revolving credit facility and $40.9 million of cash on hand. The Company had no borrowings under its loan facility as of September 30, 2025.

Cash provided by Operating Activities for the year to date period through September 2025 was $44.9 million, compared to $51.8 million in the same period of 2024.

SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

(UNAUDITED)

Note Regarding Non‑GAAP Financial Measure

The Company utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes to be insightful in understanding the Company’s financial results. These financial measures, which include Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, should not be construed as being more important than, or as an alternative for, comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. Detailed reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures have been included below and are available in the Investor Relations sections of our website at www.rangerenergy.com. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from the reconciliations. Our computations of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

Adjusted EBITDA

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful performance measure because it allows for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed below from net income or loss in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially within our industry depending upon accounting methods, book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, equity‑based compensation, acquisition‑related costs, severance and reorganization costs, gain or loss on sale of assets, significant and unusual legal fees and settlements, impairment of assets, employee retention credit, inventory adjustment, and certain other non‑cash and certain other items that we do not view as indicative of our ongoing performance.

The following tables are a reconciliation of net income or loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the respective periods, in millions:

Free Cash Flow

We believe Free Cash Flow is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company’s financial performance, as it measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations. Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of Free Cash Flow is limited and does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view Free Cash Flow as supplemental to our entire statement of cash flows.

The following table is a reconciliation of consolidated operating cash flows to Free Cash Flow for the respective periods, in millions:",https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20251107640155/en/823721/22/RangerLogo-HighResolution-2000x1179.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 11:11:52.616194

The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country.
Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land.
“The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity” of the whole negotiating system.
President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.","BELEM, Brazil (AP) — U.N. climate negotiations were expected to begin Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.

André Corrêa do Lago, president of this year’s conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in “mutirão,” a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.

“Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,” do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. “We can change. But we must do it together.”

Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.

The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.

“I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,” said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. “The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity” of the whole negotiating system.

President Donald Trump’s actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.

“It’s a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn’t going to be constructive if they did,” he said.

The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the negotiations to a potluck dinner.

“Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,” which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. “And it’s obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.”

“The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,” Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.

In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, “but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.”

Not only must nations do more faster but they “must connect climate action to people’s real lives,” Stiell wrote.

Echoing the 1990s dotcom frenzy to build internet infrastructure, today's tech giants are spending unprecedented sums to construct the silicon backbone of the revolution in artificial intelligence.

Google, Microsoft, AWS (Amazon), and Meta (Facebook) are drawing on their massive cash reserves to spend roughly $400 billion in 2025 and even more in 2026 -- backed for now by enthusiastic investors.

All this cash has helped alleviate one initial bottleneck: acquiring the millions of chips needed for the computing power race, and the tech giants are accelerating their in-house processor production as they seek to chase global leader Nvidia.

These will go into the racks that fill the massive data centers -- which also consume enormous amounts of water for cooling.

Building the massive information warehouses takes an average of two years in the United States; bringing new high-voltage power lines into service takes five to 10 years.

Energy wall

The ""hyperscalers,"" as major tech companies are called in Silicon Valley, saw the energy wall coming.

A year ago, Virginia's main utility provider, Dominion Energy, already had a data-center order book of 40 gigawatts -- equivalent to the output of 40 nuclear reactors.

The capacity it must deploy in Virginia, the world's largest cloud computing hub, has since risen to 47 gigawatts, the company announced recently.

Advt

Already blamed for inflating household electricity bills, data centers in the United Statescould account for 7 percent to 12 percent of national consumption by 2030, up from 4 percent today, according to various studies.

But some experts say the projections could be overblown.

""Both the utilities and the tech companies have an incentive to embrace the rapid growth forecast for electricity use,"" Jonathan Koomey, a renowned expert from UC Berkeley, warned in September.

As with the late 1990s internet bubble, ""many data centers that are talked about and proposed and in some cases even announced will never get built.""

Emergency coal

If the projected growth does materialize, it could create a 45-gigawatt shortage by 2028 -- equivalent to the consumption of 33 million American households, according to Morgan Stanley.

Several US utilities have already delayed the closure of coal plants, despite coal being the most climate-polluting energy source.

And natural gas, which powers 40 percent of data centers worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency, is experiencing renewed favor because it can be deployed quickly.

In the US state of Georgia, where data centers are multiplying, one utility has requested authorization to install 10 gigawatts of gas-powered generators.

Some providers, as well as Elon Musk's startup xAI, have rushed to purchase used turbines from abroad to build capability quickly. Even recycling aircraft turbines, an old niche solution, is gaining traction.

""The real existential threat right now is not a degree of climate change. It's the fact that we could lose the AI arms race if we don't have enough power,"" Interior Secretary Doug Burgum argued in October.

Nuclear, solar, and space

Tech giants are quietly downplaying their climate commitments. Google, for example, promised net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 but removed that pledge from its website in June.

Instead, companies are promoting long-term projects.

Amazon is championing a nuclear revival through Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), an as-yet experimental technology that would be easier to build than conventional reactors.

Google plans to restart a reactor in Iowa in 2029. And the Trump administration announced in late October an $80 billion investment to begin construction on ten conventional reactors by 2030.

Hyperscalers are also investing heavily in solar power and battery storage, particularly in California and Texas.

The Texas grid operator plans to add approximately 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2030 from these technologies alone.

Finally, both Elon Musk, through his Starlink program, and Google have proposed putting chips in orbit in space, powered by solar energy. Google plans to conduct tests in 2027.

Habush Sinykin said the bill is meant to fill a “regulatory void” in Wisconsin, where the only mention of data centers in state statute is for tax incentives.
It comes as recent polling shows a majority of Wisconsin voters — 55 percent — believe the costs associated with data centers outweigh the benefits of those projects.
Stroud said tying the labor provisions and renewable energy investment to data center subsidies makes sure Wisconsinites see a return on their investment.
Electric utilities would also be required to report data centers’ energy usage and sources to the state.","A new bill in the Wisconsin state Legislature would create new rules for data centers aimed at protecting utility customers and ensuring fair pay for the workers building those projects.

State Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin, D-Whitefish Bay, announced the legislation on Thursday. Habush Sinykin and state Rep. Angela Stroud, D-Ashland, issued a memo seeking co-sponsors.

Habush Sinykin said the bill is meant to fill a “regulatory void” in Wisconsin, where the only mention of data centers in state statute is for tax incentives. She called the new proposal “the first of its kind in Wisconsin” and said it aims to establish “clear statewide guardrails.”

“This legislation guarantees water usage and energy consumption transparency, increases the acceleration and adoption of renewable energy sources, insulates ratepayers from the costs of these projects and prioritizes good-paying, family-supporting jobs,” she said.

The bill has already received support from state environmental, ratepayer and labor groups. It comes as recent polling shows a majority of Wisconsin voters — 55 percent — believe the costs associated with data centers outweigh the benefits of those projects.

The bill would require workers building or refurbishing large-scale data centers to be paid either the prevailing wage rate or union wages from a collective bargaining agreement, whichever is higher. Under the bill, the prevailing wage rate “may not be less than a reasonable and living wage,” according to analysis from the Legislative Reference Bureau.

Wisconsin Laborers District Council spokesperson Steve Kwaterski said many union workers are already working on major data center projects, and his organization is in favor of the bill. He said the prevailing wage requirement will help ensure workers receive family-sustaining pay and benefits.

“These are significant economic investments that are taking place,” he said. “You want to make sure that when you are making these investments in the community, that a part of the overall equation is investing in the workforce — the folks who are building the critical infrastructure.”

The legislation also requires data centers receiving Wisconsin’s sales and use tax exemption to meet prevailing wage requirements and receive at least 70 percent of their total annual electricity from renewable sources.

Stroud said tying the labor provisions and renewable energy investment to data center subsidies makes sure Wisconsinites see a return on their investment.

“If we are making public dollars available for private corporations, we need to make sure that these are family sustaining union jobs, and we need to make sure that the investments are beneficial to the public,” Stroud said.

Electric utilities would also be required to report data centers’ energy usage and sources to the state. It also requires water utilities to notify the state if a customer plans to use 25 percent of the utility’s total water usage, and requires data centers to report their water usage to municipalities.

Ryan Billingham, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Conservation Voters environmental group, said the reporting requirements are important because big tech companies behind data centers often don’t like to tell the public what they’re doing.

“They don’t like to tell you how much energy or water they’re going to use,” he said. “Being a Great Lake state, we have to be very, very careful about our water usage.”

Under the legislation, the state would also collect an annual fee from large energy customers based on their peak energy demand. The money collected would be split between a fund supporting energy efficiency, renewable energy and low-income energy assistance, as well as the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp.’s Green Innovation fund.

The bill also requires utility companies to get the electric rates they offer data center customers approved by the Public Service Commission every other year. The PSC would have authority to determine if those rates are fair and adjust them to be “just and reasonable,” the Legislative Reference Bureau analysis says.

Tom Content, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, said that would give the PSC more authority to make sure residential customers are protected by creating a new class of customers essentially just for data centers.

“In a case like this, where you have big tech companies involved — and We Energies and other utilities looking to profit from that — it’s so important that there be oversight to make sure that our power prices are affordable and that utilities aren’t just enriching themselves,” Content said.

Under the bill, electric utilities would be required to offer commercial and industrial customers the option to get some or all of their energy from new renewable energy projects. Participating customers would be required to pay costs associated with adding those resources to the grid.

“The legislation ensures that any expansion of the renewable energy infrastructure is not going to be paid for by the ratepayers of that region,” Stroud said.

The bill would need to pass the Republican-controlled Legislature before reaching Gov. Tony Evers’ desk. Habush Sinykin and Stroud, both Democrats, said they’re hopeful the proposal will receive bipartisan support.

“I am hopeful because this legislation creates a statewide framework that is responsible and adheres to Wisconsin’s values for transparency and accountability,” Habush Sinykin said. “People want to know the potential impacts. They want to make sure energy bills aren’t skyrocketing.”",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/datacenterharvestangela.webp,N,,2025-11-10 06:20:06.406678

To make meaningful progress on climate action, development, and climate finance at COP30, both developing and developed nations will need to recognize and account for these interconnected realities at the negotiating table.","The adoption of the Paris Agreement marked a landmark moment for global climate diplomacy. This year marks the 10-year anniversary of that historic agreement, when 195 countries came to unanimous agreement to adopt a legally binding climate treaty with the goal of keeping the global average temperature rise well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, while pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. Central to implementing the Paris Agreement are national climate action plans known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), through which countries articulate their national strategies for mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change, with updates every five years.

A non-mandatory and complementary plan, the Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategy, was intended to situate these commitments within the broader context of countries’ long-term development plans. The first round of NDCs were submitted in 2015 as intended nationally determined contributions, followed by updates and new submissions in 2020/21. The next round of submissions was due by September 2025, but at this time of writing, only 61 countries (representing 31% of global emissions) have submitted new NDCs, leaving 136 Parties who have yet to do so.

This uneven pace of submissions reflects broader challenges in translating international climate commitments into nationally owned and actionable strategies—a dynamic that is particularly evident in the African context. To better understand these dynamics, Clean Air Task Force (CATF) conducted a comprehensive analysis comparing African countries’ NDCs with their National Development Plans (NDPs). The study assesses how well these two frameworks align—or fail to align—at a moment when countries must confront development realities alongside escalating climate pressures. This policy brief highlights key findings from that analysis and explores their national, regional, and global implications as countries continue to update their NDCs at COP30 and beyond.

Implementing NDCs in Africa

While NDCs have served as important blueprints for national level climate action, they have so far fallen short of bending the emissions curve downwards and positioning countries to better adapt to the impacts of climate change. The recent Global Stocktake— a mandatory periodic evaluation of progress under the Paris Agreement— found that Parties are not on track to meet their long-term goals and called for a significant step-up in ambition.

In many African countries, implementation of NDC targets has been constrained by financial, technological, and institutional capacity limitations that reflect broader development challenges. While climate change remains a global priority, African countries are simultaneously addressing pressing development concerns: access to modern energy services, improving education and health outcomes, ensuring food and water security, and closing infrastructure gaps. Achieving climate goals in this context requires integrating climate ambition with these development imperatives, rather than treating them as separate agenda items.

As countries mark the anniversary of the Paris Agreement and prepare the next round of NDC updates at COP30, this question becomes more urgent: to what extent have African countries managed to align climate ambition with their development priorities— and what must change to prevent further misalignment?

The climate-development policy divergence

The study finds significant divergence between climate and development policy in Africa. NDCs and NDPs are arguably developed for entirely different purposes: NDCs are designed to shape climate action, while NDPs guide national development priorities. However, climate and development issues in Africa are deeply intertwined, with many synergies and trade-offs.

A recently published CATF study reveals that achieving net-zero targets by 2050 comes with economic costs and could result in significant impacts on land, food, and water systems. These potential system-level impacts of energy system transitions in Africa signal the need for climate action to be well-coordinated with other sectoral priorities. This need becomes even more acute when assessed against the continent’s vast development challenges and rapidly shifting demographics. As the fastest growing continent, Africa will account for 25% of the global population by 2050— up from 19% today. This explosive population growth will drive greater demand for energy, food, water, infrastructure, and basic social needs.

Our review of NDCs and NDPs in Africa suggests that governments may not be taking this holistic view of the climate-development nexus into account when designing climate strategies or development plans. Issues which are identified as critical to climate adaptation and mitigation— energy, agriculture, transport, water and forestry— tend to dominate NDCs, while NDPs emphasize themes such as private sector engagement, finance, economy, poverty alleviation. This divergence in policy focus implies that ambitious goals to transform energy systems, as articulated in NDCs, may not be effectively mainstreamed into national economic development planning and investment strategies. This raises serious questions about the feasibility of implementing these strategies, particularly regarding the financing and infrastructural requirements of climate action. Likewise, the economic impacts of climate action may be misunderstood, leading to climate investments that compromise, rather than promote development priorities.

While countries have been encouraged to develop Long-Term Low Greenhouse Gas Emissions Development Strategies to situate their NDCs within the broader context of their long-term development plans, this requirement is not mandatory, and very few countries have undertaken this exercise.

The NDC-NDP policy divergence also has major financial implications. The Paris Agreement specifies the need for developed countries to provide the financial support developing countries need to implement climate mitigation and adaptation strategies, but progress has been slow. According to the High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance, developing countries (excluding China) will need to mobilize $2.7 trillion annually to meet climate and other nature related goals. $1.3 trillion of this is expected to come from international sources, and $1.4 trillion from domestic sources. The 2024 African Economic Outlook projects even higher climate finance requirements for the African continent alone at $2.7 trillion by 2030. Africa’s climate finance requirements are almost at par with the continental GDP and far exceed its debt levels, which currently stand at $1.8 trillion, with a median debt-to-GDP ratio of 65.5%.

These domestic fiscal challenges, coupled with the failure of multilateral climate diplomacy to raise the needed international finance for climate action, create deep conflicts in resource prioritization for African countries which also face competing development priorities. Misaligned climate and development planning will only deepen this conflict, challenging the feasibility of both climate and development objectives and, in some cases, deepening development constraints.

The sectoral dominance of energy in African climate strategies

Energy is the predominant sector of focus in African NDCs.

This dominant focus on energy is consistent with the global focus on energy sector decarbonization as a key lever for reducing emissions. Climate mitigation accounts for up 66% of total climate finance needs articulated in the NDCs of African countries, with four sectors driving most of this demand: transportation, energy, industry, and agriculture, forestry and land use (AFOLU). Notably, AFOLU, Africa’s biggest emitting sector, accounted for only 7% of the total mitigation needs articulated in NDCs ($108 million), with the bulk of mitigation finance concentrated in the transportation and energy sectors. Over 94% of transportation finance needs are allocated to South Africa alone, while energy finance is distributed across renewable energy (88%), energy efficiency (10%), and crosscutting initiatives (2%). The relatively low ranking of AFOLU in climate mitigation finance could indicate two possibilities: (1) Africa’s mitigation priorities may be misaligned, or (2) mitigation measures in AFOLU may be cheaper than those in the energy and transport sectors. Regardless of which of these reasons hold, the AFOLU sector warrants deeper investigation, as it is also critically important for adaptation due to its high vulnerability to seasonal climate variability.

Energy, agriculture, and the future of employment in Africa

The AFOLU sector is noteworthy for its dual relevance to energy sector decarbonization and the African economy. The agricultural sector employs roughly 60% of Africa’s total workforce and remains the primary source of employment in some of the continent’s most populous countries.

Energy sector transformation, particularly the shift to renewables, is a key mitigation strategy in African NDCs. However, this transition could potentially come at a cost to the continent’s critical agricultural economy. CATF modeling of net-zero scenarios in Africa finds that achieving net-zero by 2050 in Africa will require a rapid shift to renewables— wind, solar, and hydro— alongside carbon removal technologies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). While emissions would fall below zero by 2050, this aggressive energy system transformation would place additional pressure on water resources and reduce cropland availability by 31%, driving up staple food prices. The potential land-use impacts of Africa’s energy transition could negatively affect the agricultural sector and associated employment. Yet, our assessment of African NDCs suggests this externality is not fully considered in climate planning. Employment is generally not a priority in NDCs— even in countries where economies are heavily dependent on agriculture for jobs.

Changing course

This analysis reveals that while linkages between climate and development may be recognized in theory, they remain disjointed in practice. This is not entirely surprising— climate discourse has largely evolved separately from economic development discourse. Yet in contexts like Africa, the climate-development linkage cannot be side-stepped. The ability to finance the full scope of climate action will require significant domestic capital, which is scarce in low-income economies. On the other hand, the rapid transformation of energy systems can threaten development imperatives and deepen competition for resources that are central to the structural transformation of African economies. This reality calls for a new approach to climate diplomacy, one which recognizes development as a key determinant of feasible climate action— and vice versa.

Several shifts are needed to change course. At the national level, governments need to better coordinate climate and development planning. NDCs are typically developed under ministries of environment, climate change, energy, or natural resources, while NDPs are typically led by ministries of economic planning and social development, often with little to no input from the environment or natural resources sectors.

Greater coordination across the environment and development ministries would help ensure that the tradeoffs between climate action and development are well understood and integrated into national level strategies.

Both NDCs and NDPs rely on external funding and technical assistance from international sources. In providing external support multilateral and bilateral partners must prioritize local context and the real trade-offs and synergies between climate and development, rather than imposing externally derived frameworks that may not reflect African realities.

Ultimately, global climate diplomacy must better reflect the reality that climate action in Africa is as much about development as it is about reducing emissions. African governments should incorporate this perspective into negotiations on the global stage. National governments and regional institutions like the African Union must invest in building a robust, data-driven understanding of the domestic trade-offs and opportunities of the climate-development complex. These insights can then shape Africa’s bargaining position in global climate diplomacy, promoting formal ambitions assessed not only by emissions reduction potential but also by metrics for energy access, food security, and poverty reduction. Multilateral support negotiations can also shift from non-binding pledges toward demands for deeper structural changes that provide the financial, institutional, and technological conditions necessary to meet both climate and development imperatives.

That legislation contained the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the nation’s history, which will result in tens of thousands fewer West Virginians having access to these programs.
For the households impacted, health care and groceries will become even more difficult to afford, as they already grapple with rising costs and a slowing economy.
Our elected leaders should be working to expand health care access in rural parts of the state, not rubber-stamping policies that result in less accessible care.
It’s not too late for West Virginia’s members of Congress to say enough is enough and address the affordability and economic crises created as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill.","Just this month, the state agency that administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program announced the implementation of new restrictions that are expected to take food assistance away from thousands of West Virginians — including older adults between 55-64, veterans, parents of teenagers and former foster youth.

More than 60,000 West Virginians received notices that their health insurance premiums will be skyrocketing on January 1, 2026, given ongoing uncertainty around whether Congress will extend tax subsidies that make ACA Marketplace plans affordable for people who do not receive health coverage through their jobs. And the only hospital in Greenbrier County just announced it will no longer provide labor and delivery services.

What do these concerning developments have in common? They are all part of the fallout from the passage of Congress’ “Big Beautiful Bill” enacted earlier this summer, which all four of West Virginia’s members of Congress voted for.

That legislation contained the largest cuts to SNAP and Medicaid in the nation’s history, which will result in tens of thousands fewer West Virginians having access to these programs. It includes the new restrictions that will take food assistance away from parents and veterans in the coming months. For the households impacted, health care and groceries will become even more difficult to afford, as they already grapple with rising costs and a slowing economy.

But that’s not all. The bill also slashed Medicaid and SNAP by shifting federal program costs onto state budgets, and lawmakers will now have to come up with tens of millions of state dollars in upcoming years to plug holes in Medicaid and SNAP.

Other components of the legislation impact reimbursements and funding streams for health care providers, which is why some hospitals and clinics across the country are trimming services and even consolidating or closing their doors in anticipation of lower reimbursements and a higher volume of uncompensated care when more patients are uninsured.

While officials at the Greenbrier Valley Medical Center didn’t explicitly blame the federal legislation, they noted the reorganization would give them access to a higher level of reimbursement in order to make the hospital more sustainable. Our elected leaders should be working to expand health care access in rural parts of the state, not rubber-stamping policies that result in less accessible care. Now families in Greenbrier County and surrounding towns will have to travel farther for treatment and staff may lose their jobs or be forced to transfer farther away for work.

What the legislation shockingly did not contain, despite the prioritization of windfall tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy (80% of the tax benefits go to the top 10% richest households), was an extension of the tax credits that help hardworking West Virginians — mainly self-employed, small business owners and their employees, and retirees — afford health coverage on the marketplace. That explains the sticker shock many are experiencing now while shopping for health coverage for January.

These are all the very real results of the Big Beautiful Bill, despite assertions from the legislation’s supporters that the impacts are delayed or that band-aid provisions like the Rural Health Transformation Program will dampen the harms.

While some of the effects are already here, there is much more pain to come in the form of deep cuts to Medicaid both via eligibility restrictions and more federal cost shifts onto states, higher costs for West Virginians with student loan debt, and higher energy prices due to the repeal of affordable, clean energy programs. These changes don’t only hurt the West Virginians who directly utilize these programs, but also the rest of us when our community hospitals reduce services, job losses in the health care and energy industries weaken our economy, and more of our community members experience hunger and suffering.

It’s not too late for West Virginia’s members of Congress to say enough is enough and address the affordability and economic crises created as a result of the Big Beautiful Bill. They can still roll back these harmful changes — but they must acknowledge that the harm is here. For many of us, it’s already undeniable.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trumpjuly42025-2048x1366.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 06:20:14.032026

“Pioneer reflects BrightNight’s long-term commitment to supporting Arizona’s growing energy needs,” said Martin Hermann, CEO of BrightNight. “We’re focused on being a trusted partner in the region—delivering reliable, flexible clean power that drives lasting value for our customers and the communities they serve.”

Financing for Pioneer was provided by a lending syndicate including Crédit Agricole, MUFG, Royal Bank of Canada, National Bank of Canada, CoBank, and ING. Construction is underway, with commercial operation expected in April 2027.

Meanwhile, Plus Power has secured $160 million in tax equity financing from Morgan Stanley to support two standalone battery energy storage projects in New England. The investment includes $95 million for the 150 MW / 300 MWh Cranberry Point facility in Carver, Massachusetts (shown in the photo above), which began operations in May 2025, and $65 million for the 175 MW / 350 MWh Cross Town facility in Gorham, Maine, due online in “late Q4 2025,” implying operation within weeks.

""It all boils down to people,"" Steve McKinney, vice president for U.S. Commercial Operations at Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company, said.","State and federal lawmakers, nuclear energy experts and industry professionals from around the globe met last week at the Global Nuclear Energy Economic Summit at Purdue University to discuss the future of nuclear energy in Indiana.

Rising energy demands from data centers loomed over the conversation. And while modern nuclear energy technology can be pricey, difficult to bring to fruition, and probably years away from reality, the resounding sentiment at the two-day summit Nov. 5-6 was enthusiasm for the industry’s future.

Indiana, with strong support from the state government, universities and utility partners, is a prime place for the nuclear industry to grow, said Brendon Baatz, who works in energy market development at Google.

The push for modern nuclear technology in the form of small module reactors known as SMRs comes alongside a steep rise in demand for energy. Indiana's energy grid is strained and Hoosiers face high energy bills.

Nuclear energy, which aligns with the state's desire for an ""all of the above"" approach to energy, probably won't solve those issues now — there are no nuclear plants ready to start creating energy in Indiana today — but the technology might help mitigate rising demand from future data centers.

A flurry of announcements about Indiana's nuclear future were made at the summit; here are four takeaways:

First American Nuclear moves to Indiana

First American Nuclear (FANCO), a nuclear energy startup, announced plans to move the company headquarters, manufacturing facilities and an energy park to Indiana. But company officials did not provide details, like where in the state the company planned to put its footprint.

FANCO plans to introduce the state's first nuclear energy to the grid by 2032, according to Bloomberg.

“Indiana is leading the nation in the next chapter of American energy independence,” Gov. Mike Braun wrote in a news release from the company. “With First American Nuclear planting its roots here, we’re bringing 5,000 high-paying, generational Hoosier jobs while cementing our state as a leader in clean, reliable nuclear power.”

At the summit, a FANCO representative said the company's nuclear reactor, called EAGL-1, will add 240 megawatts to the grid. In the meantime, FANCO plans to build a natural gas plant to bring energy online in the nearer-term future but provided no details on where either facility will be located.

AES launches study to determine if SMR’s are viable

Brandi Davis-Handy, the president of AES Indiana, announced the utility's plans to study the technical feasibility of incorporating SMRs at their Eagle Valley and Petersburg sites.

The goal, Davis-Handy said, is to analyze the possibility of building nuclear reactors onsite. The company is analyzing the availability of cooling water along with emergency planning considerations and transmission infrastructure capacity.

However, AES's 2025 Integrated Resource Plan, which guides the utility's long-term resource planning and which was filed this month, struck a different note on nuclear energy.

The report said that the company will not pursue small module reactors in the near term despite international and national efforts to advance the technology because nuclear technology is both new and incredibly costly to deploy.

""The ink isn't even dry on AES Indiana's IRP, which found SMRs are not cost effective under any scenario, and the utility is announcing it is doing a study on siting SMRs at its power plants!?"" Ben Inskeep, director of the consumer advocacy organization Citizen’s Action Coalition, wrote on X.

AES currently doesn't have nuclear in its portfolio, but Davis-Handy said she anticipates the Eagle Valley and Petersburg study will be completed by the middle of 2026 to provide a ""clear road map for future progress.""

The industry needs more workers

One resounding message from the summit: if nuclear is to thrive in the United States, more people must join its workforce.

""It all boils down to people,"" Steve McKinney, vice president for U.S. Commercial Operations at Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company, said. ""People design, build, operate and maintain nuclear power plants.""

In tandem with the industry's calls for bolstering the workforce, Purdue University announced a new arm of its engineering department at the summit on Wednesday, Nov. 5.

The Institute for Energy Innovation will ""spark and nurture innovations within Purdue University to create scalable technologies for the energy transition"" and train students interested in energy technology, according to a statement from the university.

McKinney emphasized that nuclear companies are connecting with union trades and tech schools to help rebuild the workforce.

""We also need pipe fitters and welders and electricians,"" he said. ""Believe it not, it's harder to find an electrician today than it is to find an electrical engineer.""

Nuclear isn't a quick-fix

Throughout the conference's panels, anonymous questions peppered the screen above panelists' heads. Some of these expressed concern over the high cost of electricity that Hoosiers are experiencing right now.

Energy experts often link soaring electric bills to a rising demand for energy, without a concurrent spike in supply. But nuclear energy isn't ready to fill the gap; at the summit, panelists and speakers theorized that reactors would be unlikely to start providing energy before at least 2030.

Skeptics of nuclear energy think the technology is unproven and they raise concerns that the high cost of building a nuclear plant will ultimately fall on consumers. Historically, nuclear projects tend to finish well over budget, and sometimes, not at all.

Even industry experts conceded that at the beginning of a plant's life, nuclear is costly.

""It may not be the least cost plant to bring online at the time it is constructed, over the life the plant it provides a lot of value for the community, a lot of value for the customer, and with the current policies and the Inflation Reduction Act, it becomes very attractive,"" Chris Nolan, the vice president of new nuclear generation strategy and regulatory engagement of Duke Energy, said.

Controlling phosphorus in Lake Champlain is one of the hardest and most important pollution problems in the region, according to a panel of experts hosted by Adirondack Explorer.

During a 90-minute discussion at SUNY Plattsburgh on Thursday night, the panel of scientists and advocates working in both Vermont and New York agreed that much work remains to rein in the amount of phosphorus making its way into the lake and grapple with a long legacy of farming, logging and other impacts to the region’s environment.

The types of projects needed to mitigate phosphorus loading in Lake Champlain, which drives harmful algal bloom growth, vary widely from specific agricultural practices to minimizing erosion by seeding roadside ditches.

Even simple mitigation projects are complex and costly. But the panelists agreed that in a region dependent on its abundant water resources, the cost of failing to address the projects is much greater.

“The cost of that inaction is much more substantial than the cost of the actions we need to take,” said Brendan Wiltse, executive director of the Lake George Association. “If we don’t protect clean water, the cost of turning the dial back will be much more.”

Phosphorus control is hard

With a vast watershed, legacy of agriculture and worsening storms, Lake Champlain and its advocates face a massive challenge in addressing phosphorus pollution to the lake. It touches every corner of the watershed and impacts all of its residents.

The sources of phosphorus range from runoff from dairy farms in northern Vermont to roadside erosion in Washington County. Overlapping government oversight and limited resources add to the challenge. And the growing impacts of climate change have scarcely been accounted for in the data and models that say the region continues to fall short of its phosphorus control target.

By comparison, the challenge of phosphorus control makes road salt reduction look easy.

On farms, the challenge can boil down to something as practical as whether an operation has the capacity — and weather — to harvest feed crops and plant cover crops before it’s too late. Farmers are often struggling to make it to the next day, let alone revamp their entire operation with up-to-date phosphorus control strategies.

“If you are struggling to put food on your table, that’s not exactly when you are going to decide to change how you live your life,” said Laura Klaiber, a research scientist with the Miner Agricultural Research Institute in Chazy. “It may not even have anything to do with opinion but what do I feel I can actually do and make it to the end of the day.”

Wiltse said the total amount of phosphorus in Lake George has remained relatively stable but that the form of phosphorus that can more easily be used by plankton and cyanobacteria in the lake is growing as a share.

“When we look at the issues facing Lake George, one of the top threats we have identified is nutrient pollution, specifically phosphorus,” Wiltse said. “The fact that the most available form of phosphorus is increasing in the lake is a real concern for us.”

Even where communities have identified mitigation projects they are often beyond their funding resources and involve substantial engineering and planning, which are also costly.

“Getting funding to implement changes, that’s always a problem,” said Sue Hagar, watershed coordinator of the Champlain Watershed Improvement Coalition of New York.

Phosphorus reduction projects do much more

A benefit of phosphorus control projects is that they often help address other challenges.

Many restoration projects that reduce flood risk, improve fish habitat and improve overall stream health also limit phosphorus runoff. Some projects might qualify for phosphorus funding, while offering other benefits.

The Lake George Association is working in communities around Lake George to incentivize better practices in how stormwater is managed in development projects, supporting towns to include those practices in local ordinances and in some cases offer tax credits to projects that utilize them. LGA is also working directly with developers to encourage the practices and make them aware of benefits.

Massive investments in wastewater treatment on Lake Champlain have pay dividends, and the wastewater sector is one of the few sources of phosphorus consistently meeting its targets.

But there is still much work to do under existing laws, the panelists said.

“We have to make sure that people are completely implementing all the laws that are out there,” said Julie Silverman, the Lake Champlain Lakekeeper. “We know there are a lot of things phasing in but we have to really get at it, we have to hold our legislators and leadership accountable. It’s not that they aren’t doing the work, we just have lots of stuff that needs to happen.”

Vermont ag oversight is a work in progress

When Vermont officials updated their phosphorus targets in 2016, they estimated that 69% of the phosphorus in Lake Champlain was coming from Vermont and 41% of Vermont’s phosphorus was coming from farm runoff.

Silverman and panelists Jenny Patterson, executive director of the Lake Champlain Committee, both represent organizations that in 2022 petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency, arguing Vermont state agencies were failing at protecting the lake from farm runoff.

After the EPA agreed with that claim, Vermont state lawmakers earlier this year adopted a new law requiring the state develop a permit for large concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Surely, those are already permitted, said Klaiber, who works in New York.

RELATED READING: Targeting the cause of Champlain’s algal blooms

“That is the problem in Vermont: the permits haven’t been issued,” Patterson said.

The state established a stakeholder process that will soon kick off the development of that CAFOs permit, and the requirements that large dairy farms will be held to going forward.

The law establishes that the current standards for CAFOs under federal law will remain Vermont’s standards even if they are changed at the federal level.

“One of the things that’s been challenging about the whole discussion in Vermont is the need for certainty, and the farmers need to understand what the standards are,” Patterson said.

Silverman said that EPA officials have remained engaged on the issue through the change in administration.

“They are still at the table,” Silverman said.

Klaiber said that in New York, where the state does administer a CAFOs permit, farms are obligated to adopt certain practices. She added that farmers would benefit from more technical assistance and funding support to expand the use of those best practices. Though, many of the agencies that provide that technical expertise, like cooperative extensions, have seen their funding cut in recent years.

“Do those extension agents have enough support for their continuing education to learn and grow as the technologies and principles are changing and growing, so that they can then take that information to the farmer,” Klaiber said. “Trying to get that information to farmers is a bit of a shortcoming.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.adirondackexplorer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Champlain-algae-2-scaled.jpg?fit=2048%2C1310&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-10 08:02:12.417422

Now, nuclear power is emerging as an unlikely solution.

One of the firsts to take the leap, Google and NextEra Energy Resources have announced plans to restart the Duane Arnold Energy Centre in Iowa – marking one of the industry’s most significant moves yet to address this power crunch.

The benefits of the Duane Arnold Energy Centre in Iowa

The 615-megawatt nuclear facility near Cedar Rapids shut down in 2020 but will return to service in the first quarter of 2029 under a 25-year power purchase agreement.

NextEra Energy Resources, a major US power generation company, is acquiring full ownership of the facility and will coordinate its restart.

Google purchases the majority of Duane Arnold’s output, while Central Iowa Power Cooperative buys the remaining portion under identical terms.

The arrangement gets at the heart of a problem that’s putting pressure on energy executives: AI infrastructure needs continuous power that wind and solar cannot provide on their own.

Data centres housing the servers that train AI models operate around the clock, creating relentless demand for baseload power sources that generate electricity regardless of weather conditions.

“AI is forcing an honest conversation about clean energy,” says Robert Little, gTech Sustainability Strategy Lead at Google.

“AI and cloud infrastructure need massive, reliable, clean power. Not just when the sun shines or the wind blows, but 24/7.”

Why NextEra acquires full ownership as Google shoulders financial responsibility

NextEra Energy is acquiring the combined 30% stake held by Central Iowa Power Cooperative and Corn Belt Power Cooperative, bringing its ownership to 100%.

The power purchase agreement enables the investment required to restart operations, with Google bearing the financial responsibility for its portion.

As a result, Iowa electricity customers won’t bear costs associated with Google’s purchases from the facility, according to NextEra Energy.

The economics paint an appealing picture for Iowa. An economic study projects the restart generates more than US$9bn in economic benefits to the state, with construction creating over 1,600 jobs.

Once operational, 400 direct full-time positions will be established, primarily in Linn County.

Conclusion Promoting renewable energy access in rural communities is a critical step toward achieving sustainable development, reducing poverty, and combating climate change.","Introduction

Access to reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy is essential for economic growth, education, healthcare, and poverty reduction. However, over 700 million people globally—mostly in rural and remote areas—still lack access to electricity. Many rely on traditional biomass and fossil fuels, which are inefficient, costly, and harmful to human health and the environment.

Renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, biogas, and mini-hydro systems offer viable, clean, and sustainable alternatives for rural electrification. This proposal outlines an initiative to promote renewable energy access in rural communities through technology deployment, capacity building, and policy advocacy.

Problem Statement

Rural communities in many developing countries face persistent energy poverty, which hampers social and economic development. Key challenges include:

Lack of infrastructure for electricity generation and distribution.

High cost of connection to national grids.

Limited technical knowledge about renewable energy technologies.

Dependence on firewood and diesel generators, leading to environmental degradation.

Without targeted interventions, these communities will remain trapped in a cycle of poverty, energy insecurity, and environmental harm.

Project Objectives

The main goal of this project is to enhance access to affordable and sustainable renewable energy solutions in rural areas.

Specific objectives include:

Install renewable energy systems (e.g., solar mini-grids, biogas plants) in targeted communities.

Build technical and entrepreneurial capacity among local residents for energy management and maintenance.

Promote awareness of the economic and environmental benefits of renewable energy.

Encourage policy support and partnerships for rural energy expansion.

Proposed Activities

We have more data centers here than in any other state, by far, and four times as many more are expected in the next few years. Virginia utilities don’t generate enough electricity to serve them all; fully half of our power is imported from the regional grid. But now the regional grid is also running low on reserve power thanks to all the data center growth, according to grid operator PJM.

Most proposed solutions focus on the supply side: generating more power by building new solar, wind, gas and battery storage; keeping aging power plants running that were previously scheduled for closure; and even reopening Three Mile Island, shuttered three and a half decades ago following the worst nuclear accident in US history.

More nuanced solutions involve managing the existing generation better. Research shows that the grid could handle more data centers right now if operators ratcheted back consumption at peak times, either through installing batteries or through shifting some operations to non-peak times.

All of these approaches involve generating more power for the grid, or shifting use around to relieve grid stress at peak demand times. But there is another way to make room for new data centers: remove some existing loads.

A national advocacy organization, Rewiring America, recently released an intriguing proposal to free up grid capacity by retrofitting homes with high-efficiency heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, solar panels and energy storage. The cumulative effect would be to reduce total demand in the residential sector, making capacity available to data centers sooner, while also saving the participating residential consumers thousands of dollars on their electricity bills.

Oh, and the tech companies are going to pay for it.

I am reminded of a delightful sign I once saw announcing the coming of the best dog park ever, to be paid for by cats, itself a satire of a certain president’s pledge to build a border wall paid for by Mexico. But, I notice, neither the cats nor Mexico have sent checks yet. Will Big Tech?

Rewiring America thinks so, if the policies are in place to aggregate and verify the household energy savings into a marketable package, and if buying the package means a data center can come online faster and more cheaply. Upgraded appliances and rooftop solar can be installed in a matter of weeks, compared to the many years that may be required to permit and build new generation and transmission.

Note that the proposed program would not include households that replace gas, propane or oil furnaces with heat pumps. That kind of upgrade results in greater, not less, residential electricity demand, making it counterproductive when the point is to shrink residential electricity usage.

Replacing electric furnaces with heat pumps would also mainly address the grid’s winter peak, not its summer peak, though the Department of Energy maintains that heat pumps use less energy for cooling than stand-alone air conditioners.

Researchers focused on replacing electric resistance heat with heat pumps because that one swap produces the biggest efficiency bang for the buck. An electric furnace is cheap to install but expensive to use; the reverse is true of a high-efficiency heat pump. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimates that the conversion would save the average family $1,170 per year on its electricity bill. NREL calculates that heat pumps are cost-effective enough to pay for themselves in under 5 years.

According to Rewiring America, “If hyperscalers paid for 50 percent of the upfront cost of installing heat pumps in homes with electric resistance heating, they could get capacity on the grid at a price of about $344/kW-year — a similar cost to building and operating a new gas power plant, which currently costs about $315/kW-year.” (By my math, it’s an extra 10%, which might be acceptable to a power-hungry tech customer as a sort of rush fee.)

The report repeats the calculations for other technologies. Ductless heat pumps would replace baseboard electric heat. Heat pump water heaters would replace conventional electric water heaters. Solar panels paired with battery storage could displace electricity the home would otherwise draw from the grid.

Further capacity could come from home batteries. The report posits, “If every single-family household in the U.S. installed a home battery, and those with a suitable roof installed a 5 kW solar system (about 11 solar panels), they could collectively generate 109 GW of increased capacity on the grid. We assume that households charge the battery off-peak, either from the grid or from rooftop solar, and they discharge the battery during peak periods to reduce the household’s contribution to peak demand.”

The researchers estimate that a mass purchasing program could squeeze costs of solar and storage down by 40%, primarily through reduced customer acquisition costs and cheaper permitting. Then the data center operators would pay 30% of this lower cost. By buying solar and storage at this now much-reduced price, households would get electricity at about a 30% discount off utility rates, while the tech companies would be able to buy capacity at a cost comparable to that of building a new gas plant.

You’ll notice the proposal assumes tech companies pay only a portion of the costs for the residential upgrades, so residents still face upfront costs – 50% of the cost of heat pumps, 70% of a hopefully-lowered price for solar and batteries. Rewiring America calculates that residents will come out ahead under all scenarios, while the data centers will pay only a little more than they would otherwise have to pay, buying capacity they might not otherwise be able to get.

Because Virginia has so many more data centers than anywhere else on earth, Rewiring America calculates that all of these investments would meet only 25% of our projected new data center demand. Other states could do much better, fully meeting projected new demand across most of the country and even exceeding it in about half the states. Virginia would presumably stand to benefit from surplus capacity in other PJM states.

Obviously, these calculations describe a best-case scenario, and I have my doubts about whether the uptake would be anywhere near what they believe is possible. Still, even capturing just a portion of the efficiency potential Rewiring America believes is there would relieve some of the pressure on the grid.

But is there really that much low-hanging efficiency fruit in Virginia? If the NREL data that the researchers use is correct, more than 300,000 single family homes in Virginia have electric furnaces. Yet electric furnaces are notoriously inefficient and expensive to operate, and heat pumps have been around for decades. Our utilities have been running energy efficiency programs for years that are supposed to help residents save energy. Can there really be that many single-family homes that have not converted to heat pumps yet?

I consulted Andrew Grigsby, a home energy efficiency expert who is currently the energy services director at Viridiant, a nonprofit focused on sustainable buildings. Grigsby shared my doubts about the accuracy of NREL’s estimate of the number of homes with electric resistance heat, saying it was at odds with his experience. He also felt that an efficiency program would save more energy at less cost by targeting improvements to the needs of each home, instead of supplying a blanket solution.

But he also refuted my assumption that most of the low-hanging fruit should have been picked by now. “Virginia has 100,000 homes (at least) where three hours work and $50 in materials would reduce heating/cooling costs by 25% — via fixing the obvious, massive duct leakage,” he said in an email.

This doesn’t mean Rewiring America’s approach wouldn’t save energy; rather, it supports the conclusion that there is a massive opportunity for energy efficiency savings that Virginia hasn’t fully tapped into.

Legislators have tried. The VCEA set efficiency targets for Dominion and APCo, and the SCC followed up with further targets. APCo has consistently met its goals, Dominion has not. A review of Dominion’s sad little list of programs available to homeowners suggests that the problem is a lack of ambition, not a lack of opportunity.

An aggressive, third-party operated efficiency program would complement the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) pilot program that Dominion is developing in accordance with legislation passed in the 2025 session. The VPP’s goal is to shift some consumption to off-peak times, while the Rewiring America proposal would reduce overall consumption.

Both seek to achieve time-shifting through incentivizing residents to invest in home batteries, their only area of overlap. But whereas the VPP legislation set only 15 MW as its baseline target for home batteries, the Rewiring America proposal could incentivize much more, along with the solar systems to charge them.

The problem remains how to get tech companies to pay for it. My contact at Rewiring America, senior director of communications Alex Amend, pointed me to approaches being undertaken in other states. Minnesota legislation requires data centers to contribute between $2 million and $5 million annually toward energy conservation programs that benefit low-income households. Georgia Power is expected to file a large load tariff that, says Amend, includes pathways for off-site, behind-the-meter solutions.

Here in Virginia, though, both APCo and Dominion, as well as some co-ops, have already submitted large-load tariff proposals to the SCC as part of their rate cases. None of the proposals include incentives for demand reductions anywhere, much less the residential sector. Indeed, given Dominion’s track record on efficiency, the SCC would have to take the initiative to meld a large load tariff for data centers with the VPP program and aggressive home efficiency investments.

The SCC has announced plans to hold a technical conference on Dec. 12 to examine data center load flexibility. Rewiring America hopes to participate to lay out its proposal in more detail.

Not a zero-sum choice The path forward does not have to be a zero-sum choice between gas and renewables.
In North Africa, that means gas remains part of the equation even as solar and wind surge.
As Ali Saffar notes, “North Africa already has a pretty well-developed natural gas power generating capacity, and that can play an integral role in integrating an additional share of renewables.
Its Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex, still the world’s largest concentrated solar power plant, symbolises this push, capable of powering over a million homes.","In just two decades, the Middle East and North Africa’s electricity consumption has tripled, rising by more than 1,000 terawatt-hours —a surge that places it behind only China and India as a driver of global power demand.

Driven by extreme heat and water scarcity, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects that power demand across the region will rise by 50% by 2035 in order to meet liveable conditions, the equivalent of adding Germany and Spain’s combined electricity use. Meeting that demand under current trends would mean burning roughly 2.8 million barrels of oil and 500 billion cubic metres of gas each year.

In its latest report on the future of electricity in the Middle East and North Africa, the IEA warns that this rise in demand could deepen the region’s dependence on gas-fired power; particularly in North Africa, where natural gas and oil already provide around 90% of electricity generation.

“This projection is alarming for North Africa as it highlights both economic and energy security risks,” says Abdelaziz Khlaifat, chair of the petroleum and energy engineering department at the American University in Cairo (AUC).

“Higher gas use could divert export revenues and trap countries like Egypt, Algeria, and Libya in a costly, carbon-intensive path just as global markets shift toward renewables. It would strain budgets, prolong subsidies, and limit funds for development – the region risks exchanging short-term stability for long-term vulnerability.”

Yet the IEA report also underscores the scale of opportunity for North Africa to reshape its energy systems. The region already attracts some of the fastest-growing clean-energy investment in the developing world – over $44bn in 2024, projected to rise by nearly 50% by 2035- and boasts some of the world’s highest solar irradiation levels.

Not a zero-sum choice

The path forward does not have to be a zero-sum choice between gas and renewables. That is what Ali Saffar, head of division for Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America at the IEA tells African Business.

“Gas will absolutely have a role to play in the electricity network,” he says. “Even in our most central scenarios, we see gas playing a big role alongside a large increase in solar, which will grow from about 5-6% of the mix today to roughly a quarter.”

Diversification, rather than replacement, is the real goal. The IEA’s World Energy Outlook 2024 stresses that a secure and sustainable transition in emerging economies will depend on using all available assets efficiently – including existing fossil-fuel infrastructure – while scaling up renewables and improving grids. In North Africa, that means gas remains part of the equation even as solar and wind surge.

The region’s well-developed gas networks can help stabilise power systems and balance variable renewables, providing a bridge toward deeper decarbonisation instead of an obstacle to it.

As Ali Saffar notes, “North Africa already has a pretty well-developed natural gas power generating capacity, and that can play an integral role in integrating an additional share of renewables. Between grid investments and existing capacity, countries can scale up variable renewables quite comfortably.”

That flexibility will be increasingly critical as climate pressures reshape the region’s energy needs. Rising temperatures and worsening water scarcity are driving up electricity demand not only for cooling homes and cities but also for desalinating seawater —two essential but energy-hungry processes that often rely on gas. Across the MENA region, cooling already accounts for up to 70% of peak electricity demand in the summer, while desalination consumes around 5% of total electricity output, a share expected to double by 2040 as freshwater demand grows.

As countries move away from thermal desalination, which burns fossil fuels, toward reverse osmosis, the process has become far more efficient and better suited to renewable integration.

“From an energy perspective, reverse osmosis is roughly ten times more efficient than thermal desalination,” says Saffar.

“You only need electricity, and that electricity can be renewable. Since 2018, no new thermal plants have been added; all new capacity is electricity-fed, which fits naturally with the region’s growing solar generation.”

Jauad El Kharraz, chief executive director of the Water Energy Climate Experts Network(WECEN) in Morocco, notes that his country’s mandate to power new desalination plants with renewables is “a critical test case”.

Its plan to produce 1.7 billion cubic metres of desalinated water annually by 2030, while ensuring that new plants are powered by renewables, reflects the kind of integrated water-energy plan approach needed to avoid locking economies into high-cost, high-carbon paths.

“Initiatives like TERAMED, aiming for 1 TW of Mediterranean renewables by 2030, are therefore essential to break this cycle and secure a sustainable future.”

Diverging paths

Every country in North Africa has its own particularities and challenges. Since launching its 2009 National Energy Strategy, Morocco has pursued one of the most ambitious clean-energy transitions in the Global South. It aims for 52% renewable installed capacity by 2030 – equivalent to roughly 40–45% of total electricity generation – and already reached about 38% of installed capacity in 2023, El Kharraz points out. That puts Morocco on par with countries like France (22.3%) and ahead of Japan (25.7%) in renewable share of electricity.

Its Noor Ouarzazate Solar Complex, still the world’s largest concentrated solar power plant, symbolises this push, capable of powering over a million homes. Wind capacity stood at 2.37 GW by end-2024, with another 2.6 GW under development, while solar potential remains enormous: irradiation levels reach 2,200 kWh/m²/year, among the highest globally.

“Morocco’s renewables push offers key lessons for neighbours like Algeria, Tunisia, and Egypt,” says El Kharraz.

“Strong political commitment and clear targets – like reaching 52% renewables by 2030 – drive progress. Strategic investments in flagship projects such as Noor attract funding, while policy frameworks like public-private partnerships enable scaling. Regional cooperation too, exemplified by TERAMED’s civil society-led 1 TW Mediterranean goal, can amplify ambition through shared financing and knowledge exchange.”

This exchange is crucial in a region where energy systems evolve at uneven speeds. Algeria remains bound to hydrocarbons, with renewables supplying barely 1% of its electricity despite ambitious plans for 22 GW of capacity by 2030 and vast untapped solar potential like the rest of peers. Tunisia, though committed to reaching 30% renewables by 2030, continues to wrestle with regulatory and financing constraints, leaving it reliant on gas and imports: roughly 11% of its power still comes from Algeria.

Egypt sits somewhere in between; more ambitious than Tunisia, less advanced than Morocco, but central to the region’s energy future.

“Egypt’s renewable sector shows promise but uneven progress,” says Abdelaziz Khlaifat from Cairo.

“Projects like the Benban Solar Park, one of the world’s largest with 1.8 GW capacity, showcase Egypt’s solar potential, while the El-Dabaa nuclear plant marks a broader diversification effort. The country also benefits from strong wind resources along the Gulf of Suez and growing grid interconnections, positioning it as a potential power-trade hub. Yet, financing gaps, grid limits, and regulatory hurdles slow momentum.

“Sustained progress will depend on policy stability, infrastructure upgrades, and private investment to speed up the energy transition.”

Resources and tech can meet demand

The International Energy Agency’s report is a wake up call, but one that should be met with enthusiasm rather than fear. While North Africa is going to experience one of the fastest surges of electricity demand in the next decade, it has the resources and technology to not just meet that demand, but also to exceed it if greater diversification, cuts to grid losses and regulatory harmonisation are put in place.

According to the IEA, the MENA region’s role “will have profound implications for global energy markets” as it shifts from being only a producer of oil and gas to a centre of electricity generation and trade. The Natural Resource Governance Institute (NRGI) describes partnerships between the European Union and North Africa as a “win-win formula for energy security, investment and development.”

From Tangiers, Jauad El Kharraz notes that under AfCFTA, there is also space for regional cooperation: “Morocco can export to West Africa via interconnections with Mauritania and beyond, fostering south-south ties.”

But before North Africa looks outward, it must look inward. The IEA’s Ali Saffar cautions against seeing the region purely through an export lens.

“It is premature to be talking about massive electricity exports in countries that have not really industrialised or where social pressures are so strong. Bringing stable, affordable electricity domestically is probably priority number one.”

North Africa’s demographic realities make this especially urgent. The region is home to one of the youngest populations in the world, with youth unemployment rates exceeding 22% according to the ILO. Reliable and affordable power is not only essential for homes and services, but also for attracting industry, creating jobs and anchoring low-carbon manufacturing. As Saffar notes, “simple commodity trading is not going to create the jobs nor the value nor the revenues to take care of some of these crucial issues: what matters is domestic value creation.”

His point resonates across the region, where export ambitions sometimes eclipse local needs. In Egypt, for instance, liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports have expanded even as the country faced rolling two to three-hour power cuts in 2024 due to fuel shortages and heat-driven demand surges.

Avoiding this trap will require pairing the energy transition with industrial policy, while ensuring that local firms, not just foreign investors, share in the gains. “Priority number two,” Saffar adds, “is seeing whether you can go up the value chain in developing a low-carbon industry on the back of your renewables endowment.”

If managed wisely, this dual approach —meeting local demand first and then scaling through regional and international trade – could make North Africa not only a bridge of clean power between continents but also a laboratory for inclusive industrial growth within Africa. The question now is not whether the region can produce enough clean energy, but whether it can harness that power to light up its own future before exporting it abroad.",https://african.business/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/000_692m8ax-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-10 06:20:31.151729

The United Nations annual climate summit, called COP30, begins Monday and is expected to last about two weeks.

This year, the U.S. will not play an active role in the talks. According to a White House statement to NPR, no high-level officials will attend COP30 — breaking a long-standing tradition.

During the previous Trump administration, U.S. delegates participated in the talks. Now, the administration has taken a stronger anti-climate stance, calling efforts to limit global warming a ""hoax.""

""President Trump will not jeopardize our country's economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries,"" says White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.

President Trump began to de-prioritize climate in January, when he withdrew the U.S. from the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. In that accord, countries agreed to try to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally less than 1.5 C (2.7 F). The planet is currently on track to warm roughly 2.8 C (5 F) over preindustrial levels by 2100, according to a recent U.N. climate report.

Since the Paris Agreement, the U.S. developed policies to cut climate pollution in ways that would lower future warming. But the Trump administration's sweeping rollbacks to climate policy are affecting those efforts, as well as communities' ability to cope with climate risks, like lengthening extreme heat seasons and increasingly destructive wildfires or floods. Climate experts worry that because the U.S. is setting an example, other countries might pull back on climate goals, too.

If all U.S. climate efforts were discontinued, the U.N. report estimates, the planet could warm by an extra 0.1 C — a small fraction of the total change to the planet, but a chunk that could still have significant real-life impacts.

""Each fraction of a degree matters for communities facing floods, drought, and heat extremes,"" says Ko Barrett, deputy secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization.

Here are six major shifts in U.S. climate policy initiated by the Trump administration.

Rolling back longstanding policies to target climate pollution

In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the ""most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.""

One key component of the administration's efforts focuses on attempting to reverse the ""endangerment finding,"" a legal basis for many of the country's climate policies.

In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. But legal challenges from fossil fuel interests and their allies delayed the finalization of rules to rein in greenhouse gas pollution. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that 2009 endangerment finding, which could make it easier to roll back other climate regulations.

In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated in the way courts and previous administrations have chosen to do it.

Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants

In March, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to target more than two dozen rules and policies in what the agency called the ""most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history.""

One key component focuses on reversing the ""endangerment finding,"" a legal basis for many federal climate policies such as improving vehicle mileage and cutting power plant pollution.

In 2009, the EPA labeled carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses a danger to public health and welfare. Now, the Trump administration wants to eliminate that endangerment finding, making it easier to roll back other climate regulations.

In July, Trump's EPA argued that the country's climate pollution is not harming people and doesn't need to be regulated.

Reconsidering limits on climate pollution from power plants

In June, the Trump administration announced plans to repeal limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants from the nation's fossil fuel-fired power plants. If the proposal survives expected legal challenges and is finalized, it would eliminate controls on the second-largest source of climate pollution in the U.S., behind transportation.

The administration argues U.S. coal and gas-fired power plants are responsible for about 3% of global greenhouse gases that are heating the planet. It says that number is declining — it was 5.5% in 2005. So, the administration argues, reducing it further would provide little benefit to public health. That ignores that the U.S. is responsible for nearly a quarter of the climate pollution in the atmosphere today–more than any other nation, historically.

Withdrawing support for renewable energy technologies

The Trump administration is taking steps to open up more areas of U.S. land and ocean to increased oil and gas exploration. At the same time, it has been dismantling federal support for wind and solar industries, which it falsely labels as risky and unreliable.

The new GOP spending law ends federal tax incentives for wind and solar, throwing into limbo thousands of projects. The Trump administration has also canceled more than $13 billion in funds for green energy projects and tried to halt offshore wind projects already under construction. Energy experts say it's too early to know the full impact of these policies, but in the first half of 2025, U.S. renewable investment fell by 36%, according to data from BloombergNEF.

The Trump administration is also targeting subsidies for consumers to buy climate solutions like rooftop solar, efficient heat pumps, and electric vehicles. And it ended a $7 billion grant program for local solar projects. Federal incentives for rooftop solar, heat pumps, and insulation go away Dec. 31. Tax credits for electric vehicles ended Sept. 30.

Cutting climate-preparedness grants nationwide

The Trump administration has also cancelled grants for climate and environmental initiatives around the country. Grant recipients, contractors and activists say the moves have thrown into doubt the government's standing as a reliable partner.

Funding cuts have targeted a range of energy projects, as well, from transmission lines to research on capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Jackie Wong, a senior vice president at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the moves would set back American innovation and competitiveness.

Democratic lawmakers warn that cancelling Energy Department funding risks driving up utility bills and slowing economic growth at a time when new data centers and factories are expected to increase electricity demand for the first time in decades.

Slashing federal support for climate science and removing climate data

The Trump administration has systematically removed climate science and climate scientists from the federal government. One of the administration's targets was the National Climate Assessment, which is the most influential and widely-used source of information about how climate change affects the United States. In April, the Trump administration dismissed those who were working on the next edition of the report. In July, the federal website that hosted the most recent edition went dark.

The administration also slashed funding for climate science research at agencies like NOAA, NASA, and even USDA. The cuts have affected long-standing data collection efforts and datasets, like NOAA's Billion Dollar Disaster analysis, which keeps track of the ballooning costs of climate-worsened disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, hailstorms, and floods. The database was discontinued in May.

He vowed to bring down the cost of groceries (an “old-fashioned” word with which he was obsessed), revive manufacturing, slash federal spending and inefficiency and distribute the savings to the citizenry, all while achieving energy dominance and the high-paying jobs that come with it.

By early summer, however, it was becoming clear that Trump’s economic policies were not having the promised effect.

Trump’s tariffs only exacerbated the post-COVID inflation that had haunted Joe Biden’s presidency. Prices rose on everything from steel pipe to coffee, while retaliatory trade barriers hurt U.S. manufacturers. The loss of Biden-era grants and loans caused several firms to cancel planned billion-dollar manufacturing facilities, and tourism fell as international travelers began to avoid the U.S. The mass firing of federal employees has further eroded the already-lagging jobs situation, while the mass deportation and harassment of immigrants has sent painful ripples through the West’s construction, agriculture, leisure and hospitality industries.

Across the Southwest, the economic cracks are widening.

Tourism

The administration’s “America First” creed — which often manifests as hostility toward anyone who is not the “right kind” of American — has begun to hollow out the nation’s essential immigrant labor force, hitting the agriculture, construction and service industries especially hard. It’s also discouraged travel from abroad, especially in the Southwest, walloping that region’s tourism sector.

The World Travel & Tourism Council predicted that the U.S. will lose about $12.5 billion in international spending this year, prompting Council President Julia Simpson to warn:

This is a wake-up call for the U.S. government. While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the U.S. government is putting up the ‘closed’ sign.

Following a string of record-breaking years for national parks, the number of visitors enjoying America’s “best idea” has dried up this summer, impacting gateway communities, especially in the Southwest, despite relatively low gas prices.

▼ 3.8% Amount that international air travel into the U.S. for January through July declined from the previous year.

▼ 15% Number of Canadian air passengers arriving in the U.S. this August compared to last year.

Trade War Fallout

Trump’s tariffs were supposed to help American businesses by raising costs on imported goods. But the haphazard way in which they’ve been implemented has spawned uncertainty and increased the cost of steel, aluminum, fertilizer and other inputs for American producers, in many cases hurting rather than helping them. Meanwhile, retaliatory tariffs have seriously dampened hay and meat exports from Western states, especially those going to China.

In September, there were 8% fewer drilling rigs operating in Western states than there were a year earlier, an indication of a struggling industry.

“The Liberation Day chaos and tariff antics have harmed the domestic energy industry. Drill, baby, drill will not happen with this level of volatility. Companies will continue to lay down rigs and frack spreads.”

▼ 27% Amount that hay exports from California, Arizona and Utah fell over the first seven months of the year, compared to the same period last year.

Clean Energy and Manufacturing

The Trump administration and the GOP-led Congress have been on a rampage against non-fossil fuel energy, clawing back Biden-era funding and incentives for electric vehicles and chargers, clean energy manufacturing, and solar and wind power — both the utility-scale and rooftop kind. In response, companies and states have canceled billions of dollars’ worth of investments, and dozens of planned projects are at risk.
