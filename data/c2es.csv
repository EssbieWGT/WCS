ESG scores are essentially a risk assessment mechanism increasingly being used by investment firms and financial institutions that forces companies and agricultural concerns to focus upon politically motivated, subjective goals which often run counter to their financial interests and the interests of their customers. Companies are graded on these mandated commitments to promote, for example, climate or social justice objectives. Those that score poorly are punished by divestment, reduced access to credit and capital, and a refusal from state and municipal governments to contract with them.

Texas Government Code Chapter 809, established by the enacting of SB 13 in 2021, prohibits the investment of state funds in firms that refuse to do business with fossil fuel companies without an ordinary business purpose in an attempt to penalize or harm them or get them to change their business practices.

Despite this, the AEI/CR report finds that the evidence indicates “BlackRock continues to engage in conduct that meets the statutory definition of an energy boycott. Despite claims of a policy shift, the facts demonstrate that BlackRock’s systematic pressure campaign against lawful fossil fuel production and use remains intact.”

Specifically, the report charges that BlackRock “maintains proxy voting guidelines that pressure companies to adopt net-zero emissions targets not required by law; enforces disclosure regimes modeled on abandoned Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules that the agency itself acknowledged would cause economic harm; opposes directors for failing to adopt these standards; supports shareholder proposals designed to restrict fossil fuel use and agricultural production; maintains a divestment policy against thermal coal companies” and “remains under litigation by the Texas Attorney General for alleged collusion to restrict fossil fuel output.”

“BlackRock’s conduct—including proxy voting demands, pressure to adopt climate disclosures that exceed legal mandates, votes against directors, support for restrictive shareholder resolutions, and an active divestment policy—clearly meets the statutory definition of an energy boycott,” the report concludes. It further adds, “Removal of BlackRock from Texas’s boycott list was inconsistent with the evidence and the law.”

Moreover, the report recommends that “Policymakers should obtain all records underlying the former Comptroller’s decision” to remove BlackRock from the list of entities state funds are prohibited to be invested with and “require independent verification of BlackRock’s representations, and consider further measures to protect Texas energy producers and energy users from discriminatory investment practices. The newly installed Acting Comptroller should also take prompt action to add BlackRock back to the state’s list of companies that boycott energy companies, consistent with the evidence and the statutory standard enacted by SB 13.”

ESG-driven financial discrimination, which BlackRock appears to be engaging in, imposes political orthodoxy at the expense of sound risk assessment, consumer choice, and economic vitality and is a threat to the Texas economy and the economic prosperity of all Texans. If what the AEI/CR report alleges is true, then the firm should absolutely lose control of whatever state funds it currently possesses. It is up to state legislators to ensure that process moves forward.

New independent analysis released today confirms that the Albanese Labor Government’s renewable energy plan for cheaper, cleaner energy is the right plan for Australian businesses and homes.

The 2024-25 GenCost report, prepared by independent expert bodies CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator, compares the cost to build and operate new coal, gas, solar, onshore wind, offshore wind, batteries and nuclear generators.

It shows that renewable energy, even when accounting for the costs of firming and storage, continues to be the lowest-cost new-build technologies, underscored further by the falling cost of batteries.

Australia is already a solar nation – with the highest rate of rooftop solar anywhere in the world. Now, barely a month in, the Albanese Labor Government’s Cheaper Homer Batteries program is seeing over 15,000 households add storage to their homes as more Australians embrace renewable energy.

The Australian people back independent science in this country. That’s why they thoroughly rejected the Coalition’s discredited, risky, and expensive nuclear energy scheme at the recent election.

New data from Canada’s Darlington project – the first commercial-scale western cost benchmark – demonstrates that small nuclear modular reactors remain the most expensive energy option, while the Coalition continues to back nuclear power.

For the first time the report quantifies the first premium for building large-scale nuclear in Australia, and finds that to be 120%.

While GenCost confirms Australian construction costs and global supply chain constraints for some technologies have continued to put pressure on costs, the Albanese Labor Government’s plan to build an affordable and efficient energy grid with renewable energy at its center remains the lowest cost option for Australia.

Quotes attributable to Minister for Industry and Innovation and Minister for Science Tim Ayres:

“Reliable, abundant clean renewable energy – backed by gas – is paramount to Australian industry getting the affordable energy they need and deserve.

“It is key to protecting traditional heavy manufacturing industries, as well as attracting new industries like AI and data centres.

“A flexible, reliable, cost-effective and expanded energy grid is critical to delivering a Future Made in Australia: our plan for good blue-collar and engineering jobs in our regions and outer suburbs.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen:

“Australia has the best wind and sun to power our future and we’re harnessing it to secure the better, fairer energy system our nation deserves.

“The latest GenCost confirms what our energy experts have been saying for a long time: the most affordable path to deliver reliable energy in future is with new renewable generation and storage, firmed by gas and pumped hydro.

“This is a test for the new Coalition – will they listen to the experts and embrace the cheapest form of energy or continue their anti-renewable expensive nuclear fixation?""",https://www.minister.industry.gov.au/sites/default/files/favicon_0.ico,N,,2025-07-29 02:59:26.735964

The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announced on Tuesday that the government would increase the size of its main climate and energy program – known as the capacity investment scheme – by 25%.

The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, announced on Tuesday that the government would increase the size of its main climate and energy program – known as the capacity investment scheme – by 25%.

It means Labor plans to underwrite the construction of 40 gigawatts of large-scale solar, wind and storage by the end of the decade. In capacity terms, this is nearly twice as much energy infrastructure as the country’s existing coal-fired power fleet.

The announcement follows concern the rollout of clean energy has been slower than promised due to issues with planning approvals for new electricity grid connections, supply chain delays and social licence concerns in parts of the country.

Labor has a goal of 82% of grid electricity coming from renewable energy by 2030, up from about 42% of generation over the past year.

Sign up: AU Breaking News email

The renewables construction is also central to the government meeting its legislated 2030 emissions reduction target – a 43% cut compared with 2005 levels.

An official projection of progress towards that target released in December suggested it was roughly on track to meet this. But the projection was greeted with scepticism by some analysts due to the slower than planned adoption of renewables and the lack of other policies that can drive short-term change.

In excerpts from a speech that Bowen planned to give to an Investor Group on Climate Change event at parliament on Tuesday, the minister said the transition to clean electricity generation was urgent as ageing coal-fired power stations were becoming more expensive and unreliable.

“We need new generation now,” he said.

He said the cost of deploying solar and batteries had fallen faster than expected – down 8% and 20% respectively over the past year, according to the CSIRO – giving the country the chance to “supercharge” its transition.

The underwriting program is open to only clean energy developments. Fossil fuels, including gas, are not eligible.

The scheme does not involve an upfront subsidy. Contracts are won through a competitive tender and include floors and ceilings for revenue earned by a development. If the revenue is higher than agreed, the proponent pays the commonwealth a percentage of the proceeds. If it is lower than agreed, the commonwealth pays the difference to the proponent.

Bowen said the first six tender rounds had been “massively oversubscribed”, and the government had secured $17bn of investment that would deliver 6.4GW of new clean generation and 2GW of dispatchable capacity, which typically means large-scale batteries.

Under the expanded program, the government has promised to underwrite a total of 26GW of large-scale solar and wind and 14GW of storage or clean dispatchable capacity that can be called on when needed. It had previously promised 23GW of generation and 9GW of dispatchable capacity.

The announcement comes during heightened focus on a national 2035 emissions reduction target due to be announced by September, and as a group of Coalition MPs led by the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce spruik a private member’s bill that would abolish all government climate change programs.

Civil society and climate-focused groups were hosting events in parliament on Tuesday calling for an ambitious 2035 target, ranging from a 75% reduction to reaching net zero by that year.

Bowen met on Tuesday with the UN’s top climate official, Simon Stiell, who is visiting several countries ahead of the Cop30 climate conference in Brazil in November.

In a speech in Sydney on Monday, Stiell said the 2035 target would be a defining moment for Australia. He urged the government to not pick a “bog-standard” number but to “go for what’s smart by going big”.

Bowen said he welcomed Stiell’s acknowledgment in his speech of the steps Australia was taking on renewable energy and batteries, and the UN official’s emphasis on the economic opportunity that could come from rapid action.

He said the government had not yet received advice on the 2035 target from the Climate Change Authority, led by chair Matt Kean.

“Targets are easier set than met,” Bowen said. “We will set a target informed by the expert advice in the national interest.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63d17862b0e48fd87ec7a2943011dd0f4073f69f/589_0_6880_5504/master/6880.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=10d1ca8c6ca7731d3d01ac56fbbe948d",N,,2025-07-29 02:59:30.049956

Traditional automakers and startups have found mixed success rolling out larger electric pickup trucks in recent years.","When Will Haseltine saw images online of a small, boxy electric pickup from startup Slate Auto this past spring, he got on the waitlist right away. The sparse interior and crank windows reminded him of the no-frills pickups he grew up around in Memphis, Tenn. — but he was most enamored with the sub-$20,000 USD price tag.

That price, though, factored in a $7,500 federal tax break, which is set to be a casualty of the budget package U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month. Now, Haseltine isn't sure the truck will fit his budget when it comes out, expected late next year.

""The Slate was the first time that I looked at a car, wanted it, and could also really make it happen,"" said Haseltine, a 39-year-old musical instrument technician.

Without the tax credit, he said: ""That's just plain too much.""

Michigan-based Slate has raised $700 million USD from investors, including Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and has racked up more than 100,000 reservations for its cars. But the company is launching into a tough U.S. market.

U.S. electric vehicle (EV) sales growth has cooled as consumer interest has faded. The loss of federal tax breaks will further hurt demand, auto executives and analysts predict.

Like other EV startups, Slate likely faces a long road to profitability. The EV business has proven to be a money loser for most industry players, partly because batteries remain relatively expensive. Even in China, where smaller, inexpensive EVs have proliferated and companies enjoy a cost advantage over western automakers, most are unprofitable.

Slate founders believe the company can overcome those obstacles by offering something that is in short supply in today's U.S. car market: affordability. The average new-vehicle selling price is above $45,000 USD.

""We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never delivered,"" Slate CEO Chris Barman said at a Detroit conference in July.

The company has a chance to fill a void left by Tesla, on plans to introduce a mid-$20,000s electric vehicle.

The startup has taken a bare-bones approach to its two-seat pickup, which is slightly smaller than a Honda Civic hatchback. How bare-bones? A stereo and power windows will cost extra. Slate hasn't disclosed the cost of such add-ons.

'It's a cool idea'

Slate's creation started with an idea from Miles Arnone, the CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing, a Massachusetts-based startup that includes several former Amazon employees.

Arnone believed workers needed better access to affordable vehicles.

Arnone shared his idea with Jeff Wilke, the company's chairman and a former Amazon executive, and eventually, a small team was formed. The group hired Barman, who spent most of her career as an engineering executive at Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis.

Barman told Reuters recently that Slate will be able to absorb a tax credit because the truck's price still will undercut competitors.

The company plans to build the pickup at an old catalog factory in Warsaw, Ind.

Executives are taking steps to hold down costs, starting with a simplified design that uses about 500 parts in the truck's assembly, compared with a few thousand for a traditional truck.

The pickup will be built with composite body panels in grey, with an option for a vinyl wrap. That will sidestep the need for a paint shop, which is one of the most expensive investments in a typical car factory.

Slate's minimalist approach is a leap of faith that Americans will forgo creature comforts they have been increasingly willing to splurge on. Last year, U.S. buyers spent 33 per cent above the base price on average, springing for higher-end trim packages and extra features, according to Edmunds.com. That was up from 28 per cent in 2014.

But there is mounting evidence that new cars are becoming out of reach for many Americans. That could worsen under the effects of the Trump administration's tariffs, which threaten to

increase prices on popular budget , Korea and elsewhere.

From that standpoint, Slate's price-conscious pickup might be hitting at the right time, said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific.

""There's a growing appetite, especially among younger drivers, for vehicles that are more honest, more modular and less over-engineered,"" he said. ""Slate taps right into that.""

Traditional automakers and startups have found mixed success rolling out larger electric pickup trucks in recent years. Now, startups like Slate and California-based Telo are focusing on smaller electric pickups.

In a town hall meeting in early May, Ford CEO Jim Farley and Executive Chair Bill Ford told employees they admired the company's customer-centred ethos and focus on affordability.

Tim Kuniskis, Stellantis' head of American brands called Slate ""super interesting"" at a June event, while also questioning how affordable it would be for some shoppers once they added all the options they wanted.

""The idea behind it, we've talked about that idea a million times,"" he said. ""It's a cool idea.""",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7595370.1753712170!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/autos-slate.JPG?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-07-29 02:59:50.871309

“This is a transformative win for Graham County and the entire region,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina.
“Beyond the jobs and investment, this project affirms the critical roles that sustainability and manufacturing play in Western North Carolina and across the whole state.","Zhejiang Kingsun Eco-Pacl Ltd. (Kingsun), a Chinese manufacturer of biodegradable paper tableware, has announced it will establish its first U.S. production facility in Robbinsville, North Carolina.

The company will hire for 300 jobs, and with successful initial operations and phased project development, hopes to create up to 515 jobs in Graham County, representing a $80.5m investment in the Western North Carolina region.

“North Carolina offers global companies a perfect location for expansion into North America,” said Governor Josh Stein. “We welcome Eco King to western North Carolina, where it will find a welcoming business climate, education and workforce programs tailored to its needs, and the full range of competitive advantages that make North Carolina the top state to do business in the country.”

Kingsun will open its operation in an adaptively reused space in a former furniture manufacturing building, located at 68 Snowbird Road. The building has been officially vacant since 2020 and largely underutilized in square footage since 2014, when previous tenants ceased operations. The arrival of Kingsun marks a new opportunity for the community—making it the largest manufacturing project announced in Graham County and the seven-county region in the last 15 years.

“We have been impressed by how welcoming Robbinsville, Graham County and North Carolina have been to our company and this important project,” said Ping Zhang, Chairman, Eco King Solutions. “We worked very hard to find the right location for our business to thrive. We know we found it right here due to the excellent workforce, quality of life and friendly business climate. We are excited to be a part of the community, and we are excited for our company to prosper here.”

The facility will be used to manufacture Kingsun’s full range of eco-friendly disposable tableware, including biodegradable dishware, bowls, and plates. In addition to production, the company will dedicate a portion of the space as a showroom for buyers of its products, hosting clients and potential partners on-site.

The project not only reactivates a long-dormant facility but also reestablishes an important industrial capability in Western North Carolina. Kingsun uses wood pulp and recycled cardboard as raw materials for its products—resources that align well with the region’s legacy of wood-based manufacturing. This investment helps preserve that skillset and reconnects the local economy with its manufacturing roots.

“This is a transformative win for Graham County and the entire region,” said Christopher Chung, CEO of the Economic Development Partnership of North Carolina. “Beyond the jobs and investment, this project affirms the critical roles that sustainability and manufacturing play in Western North Carolina and across the whole state. We are proud to have helped bring Kingsun here and look forward to supporting their long-term success in our state.”",https://themanufacturer-cdn-1.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/29052058/Kingsun.jpg,N,,2025-07-29 01:00:50.736354

Attorneys for West Virginia Citizen Action Group, Solar United Neighbors and Energy Efficient West Virginia filed testimony last week in an expanded net energy cost petition filed in April by Appalachian Power and Wheeling power, subsidiaries of Columbus-based American Electric Power. The companies, which provide power to residential and industrial ratepayers in 25 West Virginia counties, are seeking a $71.6 million — or a 3.79% increase — in ENEC rates from the state Public Service Commission by Sept. 1. The proposed increase would result in residential power bills rising by $5.31 per month, with commercial customers seeing a $15.05 monthly increase and industrial customers being charged $13,400 more a month. The ENEC process allows electric utilities to petition the PSC to consider rate increases to allow utilities to recoup actual costs for the previous year and prepare for projected costs. According to company testimony, $52.6 million of the $71.6 million was for the ENEC deferral balance, with $19.1 million for forecasted costs. “The Companies have demonstrated reasonable and prudent actions to procure economic fuel for their plants, maintained adequate coal inventory levels, scheduled and performed maintenance at their plants in an attempt to optimize their availability, and utilized bidding strategies, all in an attempt to minimize rates for their customers,” said Randall Short, director of Regulatory Services for Appalachian Power, in direct testimony submitted to the PSC in April. But testimony submitted on July 23 by West Virginia Citizen Action Group, Solar United Neighbors and Energy Efficient West Virginia refutes these claims with analysis from Catherine Kunkel, an energy consultant with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. According to her testimony and analysis, Appalachian Power/Wheeling Power’s costs were due to poor decisions on its part to run its power plants at a financial loss by burning off excess coal supplies during the 2024-25 period. “Throughout the review period, the Companies frequently operated the Amos, Mitchell, and Mountaineer (power plants) at a loss – i.e., when the units’ fuel and other variable costs were higher than the revenues they earned from the PJM markets,” Kunkel said. “The Companies ran these units at a loss due to an oversupply of coal.” Appalachian Power/Wheeling Power operate the John Amos Power Plant in Winfield and the Mountaineer Power Plant near New Haven. The companies own a 50% stake in the Mitchell Power Plant in Moundsville. As well as serving West Virginia customers, the plants provide power to PJM Interconnection, a wholesale energy transmission company serving a 13-state region in the Northeast. According to Kunkel, the three power plants operated at a net margin loss of $81.4 million during the reporting period, a formula based on the difference between the revenues obtained from the PJM energy markets and the plants’ total variable costs. That loss grows to more than $153 million over a two-year period. Kunkel placed much of the blame for these losses on the companies buying more coal than needed, then burning off the excess. “Simply put, the Companies contracted for more coal than it would have been economic to burn during the review period, and needed to burn down their coal piles to avoid potentially exceeding their on-site maximum coal inventory levels,” Kunkel said. “With an oversupply of coal, the Companies faced the risk that the coal inventories at their plants would exceed the maximum that the Companies are able to store.” Instead, Kunkel said the companies’ real ancillary losses were closer to $66 million, of which approximately $36 million was the responsibility of ratepayers in West Virginia. “If the Companies had not over-procured coal, putting themselves in a position where they needed to burn down the coal pile, ratepayers could have been spared those additional costs,” Kunkel said. The issue of purchasing too much coal is the opposite of issues from a few years ago when the PSC was critical of the companies not burning enough coal and relying on PJM for purchased power. In a previous ENEC request, the companies had originally sought $552.9 million in rate increases through the PSC for costs incurred but not reimbursed between March 1, 2021, through Feb. 28, 2023. The companies also sought $88.8 million to cover forecasted costs between Sept. 1, 2023, and Aug. 31, 2024. Instead, the PSC only allowed $321.1 million in ENEC costs to be collected over a 10-year period – approximately $32.1 million per year or $2.50 per month for residential customers. In its January 2024 order, the PSC determined that due to the companies purchasing power from PJM instead of generating their own, they were responsible for covering part of the $552.9 million ENEC request. At the time, both Appalachian Power/ Wheeling Power claimed they had to purchase power from PJM instead of self-generating power from its three coal-fired power plants in the state due to increased costs of coal at the time and the non-delivery of 3.8 million tons of coal in breach of contracts. A previous PSC order set an expectation that coal-fired power plants need to achieve at least a 69% capacity factor in order for in-state electric companies to self-generate power and reduce reliance on purchased power. But according to a report commissioned by the PSC, Mitchell Power Plant remained at 6% capacity between September 2021 and December 2021, with the John Amos Power Plant at 3% capacity and the Mountaineer Power Plant at 0% capacity.

Notably, the Trump administration and Congress seem focused on cutting regulations and increasing subsidies to the coal industry. Ignoring the policy merits and demerits of those ideas, a more fundamental question is: Why is coal declining in the United States?

From the perspective of many politicians, if not for the “war on coal” — in which they argue Democrats are using government power to cudgel the coal industry — it would still be the country’s dominant power source. But good policy analysts should not be taken in by political rhetoric. A more grounded empirical approach to the question reveals a big disconnect between the politics and the markets.

Coal used to be the primary source of electric power generation in the United States, producing just over 2,000 terawatt hours at its peak in 2007. From 2001 to 2008, coal provided roughly half of all electricity in the nation. Its share of power generation began to fall rapidly starting in 2009.

The coal industry and politicians explain this by claiming President Barack Obama’s “war on coal” and its punishing regulations made coal uncompetitive compared to politically favored industry. But if that were true, why didn’t coal rebound after Obama left office, or after those regulations were defeated in court?

The problem with the political argument is that if coal really were a cheap but profitable source of energy impeded only by regulations, then we would expect to see investors risking capital on a potential future payday by investing in it, but that’s not happening. Nobody is building new coal plants in the United States. So what else could explain coal’s decline?

Looking at other factors in the electric power sector, it’s clear that coal’s decline aligns with the increased utilization of other fuels — most notably, natural gas. Although coal’s share of electricity generation decreased from 54 percent in 2001 to 15 percent in 2024, natural gas’ share increased from 18 percent to 43 percent over the same period.

In other words, coal lost 39 percent of the market while natural gas picked up 25 percent. Additionally, wind and solar picked up 17 percent of the market while nuclear and hydropower together lost about 4 percent. In short, coal shrank and most of that market was replaced by natural gas, along with renewables.

Natural Gas Didn't Need Subsidies

Although some might point to renewable energy subsidies as a major contributor to coal’s woes, the comparison with natural gas is more revealing.

Natural gas has not benefited from the same sort of subsidy treatment in the market as renewable energy, and as a thermal resource, it’s a more direct substitute for coal than renewables.

It’s no accident that the increase in natural gas generation coincides with falling natural gas prices (thanks to directional drilling, or fracking). Since 2008, natural gas prices have fallen by about 69 percent. Meanwhile, coal hasn’t gotten any cheaper. In fact, it’s increased in cost by 16 percent since 2008. Add in the fact that the thermal efficiency of natural gas power plants is also improving, and we get a clear explanation for why investors are shifting away from coal.

Stripping away the politics, the data tells an economics tale as old as time: the story of creative destruction. This is the idea that incumbent products give way to newer ones that are cheaper or better.

We’re all familiar with this concept in our everyday lives. We see cars on the road instead of horses, and we use computer keyboards instead of typewriters. Creative destruction is a resisted economic force because a visible industry in decline is impacted while a hypothetical future economic benefit is harder for policymakers to see.

But letting the market do its thing always leads to creative destruction, and it is through this process that we grow economically. Quite simply, this is how we improve productivity, grow the economy, and improve quality of life.

Is there a war on coal? I don’t want to dismiss the impact of regulations out of hand; increased regulatory costs do burden industry and the economy as a whole. Some of Obama’s regulations on the coal industry were particularly egregious examples of illegal government overreach, notably the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards.

But the simple observation that customers prefer coal’s competitors over coal itself is a more reasonable explanation than the idea that profit-motivated investors are somehow missing big opportunities in coal.

An empirical approach shows that coal’s decline is a result of natural market forces that replace older, less efficient ways of doing things with newer, better ones. This means that attempts to use government interventions to prop up coal power under a misguided notion of leveling the playing field will distort markets and weaken growth.

The market delivers innovation, and politicians using government to force us backward are not practicing good economics.

Executive Summary

On Friday, July 4, 2025, President Trump signed H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB), into law. The law includes new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions on many of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) clean energy tax credits. FEOC restrictions are primarily intended to prevent Chinese companies from claiming the tax credits and to reduce reliance on China for supply chains of clean energy technologies. This general goal has bipartisan support.

The FEOC provisions in the OBBB, however, are extremely complex and will require extensive work by President Trump’s administration to implement.

Following the IRA’s enactment in August 2022, the Departments of the Treasury and Energy did not publish final guidance on the 30D New Clean Vehicle Tax Credits and FEOC restrictions until nearly two years later in May 2024. Promulgating guidance or regulations can be difficult and time-consuming, even for statutory provisions that are far less complex than the new FEOC restrictions. Regulatory uncertainty is likely to stifle near-term investment as companies wait for guidance from the administration and assess their eligibility for the credits under the new requirements.

In addition to new FEOC restrictions, OBBB shortens the phase-out timeline for many of the IRA’s energy tax credits so that they end several years earlier than they previously did. These changes, combined with long implementation timelines for the FEOC guidance, will drastically shorten the window in which companies can claim the relevant energy tax credits. The net result of this will be a significant reduction in energy projects that qualify for the credits that are developed and put into service. There will also be additional challenges in developing the new energy resources important to meeting the current and expected significant future growth in America’s electric power demand.

In an effort to address concerns over U.S. reliance on Chinese-dominated supply chains, the Bipartisan Policy Center proposed six key principles for placing FEOC restrictions on energy tax credits. The goal of these principles is to identify bipartisan, durable policy solutions to maintain U.S. leadership in clean energy production and manufacturing.

Introduction

In December 2024, BPC convened a bipartisan group of stakeholders to identify principles to prevent foreign adversaries from benefiting from the IRA’s clean energy tax credits while strengthening U.S. energy and manufacturing competitiveness and ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy. Because the supply chains for clean energy technologies are global and complex, careful crafting of policy is necessary to prevent unintended consequences that could cede energy leadership to China. Based on these discussions, BPC published a set of six key principles for Congress to consider when crafting FEOC restrictions on energy tax credits. This explainer provides analysis of the OBBB’s FEOC restrictions and evaluates them against BPC’s six FEOC principles:

Design New Restrictions in a Manner that Preserves the Energy Tax Credits

Avoid Penalizing Minimal FEOC Ownership

New Sourcing Restrictions Should be Targeted and Include De Minimis Exemptions

Allow Responsible Technology Licensing

Adopt Simple and Clear Statute

Set Realistic and Phased Compliance Timelines for Sourcing Restrictions

How the OBBB Changes FEOC Provisions

At a high level, the OBBB’s FEOC provisions limit the majority of the IRA’s energy tax credits from being claimed by a company that is a Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE), either a Specified Foreign Entity or a Foreign-Influenced Entity. The law places stipulations on a company’s ability to receive a credit from building or investing in the U.S. if it engages in 1) licensing, 2) sourcing, or 3) payments to a PFE. These restrictions are not applied evenly across these tax credits, as seen in the chart below:

How is a Foreign Entity of Concern Defined?

Inflation Reduction Act FEOC Definitions

The IRA applied FEOC restrictions to the 30D Clean Vehicle Credit. As defined in the IRA, a FEOC is an entity that meets any of the following criteria:

A designated foreign terrorist organization

An entity included on the Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List

An entity owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign government

An entity involved in criminal activity under various U.S. national security laws

An entity that is engaged in conduct detrimental to U.S. national security or foreign policy

OBBB’s FEOC Definitions

New Definitions: Prohibited Foreign Entities

The OBBB expands upon the IRA’s FEOC definition and creates two new FEOC categories: Specified Foreign Entities and Foreign-Influenced Entities. Both categories are considered PFEs.

Specified Foreign Entity

The law’s definition of a Specified Foreign Entity adds new criteria on top of the IRA’s 30D FEOC definition. Restrictions are extended to any of the following:

Chinese military companies operating in the United States

An entity that is subject to Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act restrictions

A battery-producing entity that is ineligible for Department of Defense contracts, as identified by the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (2021 NDAA), including:

Contemporary Amperex Technology Company (CATL); BYD Company; Envision Energy; EVE Energy Company; Gotion High Tech Company; Hithium Energy Storage Company

A foreign-controlled entity, defined as a government, individual, business, or entity (including subsidiaries) under the control of China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran, including any citizens of those countries or an entity controlled by another entity where more than 50% of the stock, 50% of the profit or capital interests, or 50% of the beneficial interest lies with a government, individual, or business of China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran.

Foreign-Influenced Entity

As defined in the OBBB a Foreign-Influenced Entity is an entity over which a Specified Foreign Entity exercises influence, meeting any of the following criteria:

Can directly or indirectly appoint a covered officer

Covered officers are defined as a member of the board of directors, or an executive level officer, such as the president, CEO, COO, CFO, general counsel, or senior vice president of an entity

Has 25% ownership over the entity Owns, in the aggregate, alongside other Specified Foreign Entities at least 40% of the entity

Holds, in the aggregate, at least 15% of the debt of the entity

Made a payment to a Specified Foreign Entity that allows a Specified Foreign Entity to exercise “effective control” over a qualified facility, energy storage technology, or eligible component. “Effective control” is defined in the bill as a contract or licensing agreement that allows a foreign party to exert influence over the production of components, generation, or storage. The bill directs the Treasury Department to issue guidance defining effective control.

Types of FEOC Restrictions

The OBBB includes four new FEOC restrictions:

Prohibited entities cannot claim certain credits

Material assistance (sourcing) must be below a certain threshold

Licensing agreements are limited

Significant payments to a prohibited entity are banned

Prohibited Entities Cannot Claim Certain Credits

Which tax credits are impacted by the requirement?

The OBBB’s FEOC restrictions would limit prohibited entities from claiming the following credits: 45Y (Tech-Neutral Electricity Production Credit); 48E (Tech-Neutral Electricity Investment Credit; 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Credit); 45U (Nuclear Energy Production Credit); 45Q (Carbon Capture Credit); and 45Z (Clean Fuels Production Credit)

How does the restriction work?

The OBBB prohibits taxpayers from receiving any energy investment or production tax credits if the taxpayer itself is a Specified Foreign Entity or a Foreign-Influenced Entity.

Example: The Chinese battery company Gotion would be considered a Specified Foreign Entity because it is a battery-producing entity that is ineligible for DOD contracts, as identified by the 2021 NDAA. Even though Gotion plans to invest in a battery plant in Michigan, none of the components from that plant would be eligible for the 45X tax credit under the new FEOC restrictions.

When does the restriction start?

45X, 45Y, 48E and 45Q: The prohibition on Specified Foreign Entities and Foreign Influence Entities begins immediately.

45U and 45Z: The prohibition on a Specified Foreign Entity begins the tax year after the date of enactment.

45U and 45Z: The prohibition on a Foreign-Influenced Entity begins the second tax year after the date of enactment.

Analysis

The OBBB’s FEOC provisions adhere in part to BPC’s principle #2 (avoid penalizing minimal FEOC ownership) because the threshold set for ownership matches existing ownership standards used by the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and State. However, the definition is broad, including familial ties that will likely pull in entities not actually and materially “of concern.” The provisions do not adhere to BPC’s principle #5 (adopt simple and clear statute) because determination of Foreign-Influenced Entities based on payments made to, and licensing agreements with, Specified Foreign Entities is complicated and difficult to track.

Material Assistance (Sourcing) Restrictions

Which credits are impacted by the material assistance restriction?

The material assistance restrictions are applied to the following credits: 48E (Tech-Neutral Electricity Investment Credit); 45Y (Tech-Neutral Electricity Production Credit); and 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Credit) tax credits.

How does the material assistance restriction work?

An entity would be ineligible to receive the relevant credits if a certain percentage of the value of the manufactured products or components in a project are sourced from a PFE. These percentage thresholds, known as material assistance cost ratios (MACRs), vary between tax credits and types of components being sourced. Somewhat counterintuitively, the MACR is a measure of the percentage of the component value that is sourced from non-PFEs, so a company would need to have a ratio that is higher than the threshold to qualify for the tax credits.

The material assistance provision also includes safe harbor rules, certification requirements, and existing contract exceptions. The law directs the IRS to publish “safe harbor tables” by the end of 2026 that “identify the percentage of the total direct costs of any manufactured product which is attributable to a foreign entity” and “identify the total direct material costs of any eligible component which is attributable to a foreign entity.” In the time period before safe harbor tables are published, the taxpayer aiming to claim any of the applicable credits may use either the safe harbor tables updated in IRS Notice 2025-08 or issue a certification requirement that verifies the MACR calculation.

Certification requirements are used to verify that manufactured products, constituent elements, materials, components, and subcomponents supplied to the taxpayer were not produced by a PFE. Suppliers who issue false or misleading certifications face fines from the IRS. The law also exempts existing contracts from material assistance restrictions. This allows taxpayers who acquire a manufactured product, constituent element, material, component, or subcomponent from a supplier based on a contract finalized before June 16, 2025, to exempt those items from their MACR calculations as long as the component is then “placed into service before January 1, 2030 in a facility the construction of which began before August 1, 2025.”

When does the material assistance restriction start?

The OBBB phases in material assistance restrictions. Percentage thresholds and phase-in timelines vary depending on the technology. The law separates qualified wind and solar facilities from energy storage technologies under 48E, putting storage in its own category with different percentage thresholds than wind and solar. It also directs the Secretary of the Treasury to issue updated threshold percentages for each applicable critical mineral no later than December 31, 2027. These percentages would either “equal or exceed” the original threshold and would be determined by taking into account “domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.”

The IRS must publish the safe harbor tables no later than December 31, 2026.

Analysis

The law’s material assistance provisions adhere to BPC’s principle #3 (new sourcing restrictions should be targeted and include de minimis exemptions) in part because the percentage thresholds vary by component and are applied to specific components. The OBBB provisions, to an extent, also adhere to BPC’s principle #6 (set realistic and phased compliance timelines for sourcing restrictions) because the percentage thresholds phase in over the course of several years. Finally, the material assistance provisions fail to adhere to BPC’s principle #5 (adopt simple and clear statute). As written, it is unclear which components count for inclusion in the cost ratio calculations, and only some technology types have existing safe harbor tables.

Limited Licensing Agreements

Which credits are impacted by the licensing agreement restrictions?

The licensing agreement restrictions are applied to the following credits: 45Y (Tech-Neutral Electricity Production Credit); 48E (Tech-Neutral Electricity Investment Credit); and 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Credit)

How do the licensing agreement restrictions work?

The OBBB puts a restriction on any component or applicable critical mineral produced using technology that was licensed from a PFE if the licensing agreement allows the PFE certain rights related to the facility, component, or critical mineral, including the right to:

Specify or direct sources of components

Direct the operation at the facility or production unit that produces the qualified component

Limit the utilization of intellectual property

Receive royalties beyond the tenth year of the agreement

Direct the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for longer than two years, or if the contract does not provide the licensee with all the technical data, information, and know-how necessary to enable them to produce the component without further involvement of the foreign entity

Example: If a U.S. battery company enters into a licensing agreement with any of the battery-producing entities currently ineligible for DOD contracts—like CATL—and their agreement includes the right for CATL to direct the operation of the facility or production unit that produces those batteries, those batteries would be ineligible for the tax credit.

When do the licensing agreement restrictions start?

The restriction starts in the taxable year that begins after the date of enactment.

Analysis

This provision adheres in part to BPC’s principle #4 (allow responsible technology licensing) because it allows for a narrow pathway through which companies can license foreign technologies without losing access to the tax credit. However, compliance may still prove to be a challenge given the statute’s complexity. As stated in BPC’s six key principles publication, “to remain globally competitive, U.S. projects need access to the most advanced technologies.” Responsible technology licensing agreements, even from certain FEOCs, are still needed to ensure we can manufacture certain technologies here in the United States and to avoid ceding the entire industry to countries like China.

Significant Payments to a Prohibited Entity

Which credits are impacted by the restriction on significant payments?

The restrictions on significant payments are applied to the following credits: 48E (Tech-Neutral Electricity Investment Credit); 45Y (Tech-Neutral Electricity Production Credit); and 45X (Advanced Manufacturing Credit) tax credits.

How does the restriction on significant payments work?

The OBBB disqualifies a taxpayer from receiving the relevant credits if it made a payment in the previous taxable year to a specified foreign entity in compliance with a contract, agreement, or other arrangement which allows the specified foreign entity to exercise effective control over a qualified facility or energy storage technology (in the case of 45Y or 48E) or production of an applicable component or the extraction, processing, or recycling of any applicable critical mineral (in the case of 45X).

In the case of 48E, if any of these payments are made within 10 years after the facility is placed into service, the taxpayer would be forced to pay back the entire value of the previously claimed tax credit.

When does the restriction on significant payments start?

The taxable year following the date of enactment.

Analysis

Payments were not directly addressed in the principles, but they are analogous to sourcing and licensing restrictions. Since these provisions would prohibit credit usage in cases where a FEOC does not necessarily have significant control over U.S. manufacturing, they do not adhere to BPC’s principles #2 (avoid penalizing minimal FEOC ownership) and #4 (allow responsible technology licensing). This design could potentially undercut domestic manufacturing of advanced energy products in the United States. Further, the OBBB’s restriction applies to ANY payment at all to a PFE. This means that a single payment during the previous year, no matter the amount, would disqualify a taxpayer from receiving a credit.

Conclusion

While FEOC restrictions can help secure global supply chains and boost U.S. manufacturing, overly restrictive or overly complex FEOC restrictions can freeze investment in U.S. manufacturing and energy production while ceding competitive ground to China. The FEOC restrictions passed in the OBBB are likely to do the latter. The high complexity of the OBBB restrictions as well as a few key details make it likely to stifle important and useful American investment. As implementation gets underway, BPC’s six principles can provide a guide for future decision making on how to help address concerns about Chinese influence on our manufacturing supply chains as well as taxpayer money going to U.S. adversaries through energy tax credits.",https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/shutterstock_2504192729_capitol_senate.jpg,N,,2025-07-29 01:59:55.004546

E.U. would have to more than triple its annual U.S. energy imports to meet its pledge

President Donald Trump said the U.S. deal on tariffs and trade with the European Union includes Brussels' agreement to buy $750 billion of U.S. energy products over the next three years, but industry analysts say the math doesn't even remotely add up.

Some energy experts have referred to that as a ""wholly unrealistic,"" and even ""absurd,"" number given that U.S. energy-product exports to the E.U. would have to more than triple to get there. But there are some ways to significantly boost U.S. sales of the commodities to Europe.

""While it is possible to imagine an increased level of [energy] exports to Europe, this would be a major upheaval in our energy trade,"" said Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research. ""How this is supposed to be accomplished is also unclear.""

'While it is possible to imagine an increased level of [energy] exports to Europe, this would be a major upheaval in our energy trade.'Michael Lynch, Strategic Energy & Economic Research

U.S. energy exports to the E.U. totaled $78.5 billion in 2024, which was just about the same as in 2023, according to data from the Energy Information Administration shared with MarketWatch on Monday.

To get to that $750 billion figure, the E.U. would have to buy roughly $250 billion per year of energy products from the U.S. for the next three years - more than triple what it purchased in 2024.

To hit that figure, Lynch, who is also a distinguished fellow at the Energy Policy Research Institute, said he would imagine that ""all U.S. LNG [liquefied natural-gas] exports would go to Europe, doubling the current amount."" U.S. oil exports to Europe, which he said are at around 2 million barrels a day, would have to quadruple. That would mean essentially ""all"" U.S. crude and product exports would have to go to Europe, he said. In 2023, the EIA said the U.S. exported 10.15 million barrels per day of petroleum to 173 countries and three U.S. territories.

The U.S. exported a total of $332.4 billion in energy-related products to select trading partners in 2024, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. The only E.U. member in the top 10 U.S. export markets for energy-related products is France.

On X, Rory Johnston, founder of CommodityContext.com, said that ""even if the $250 bn/yr in E.U. energy purchases from the U.S. pledge wasn't absurd on its face - it is, for the record - there's still the small issue that those energy flows are determined by private-sector purchasing decisions, not Brussels.""

""So how would literally any of this work?"" he asked.

'Unrealistic' number

Matt Smith, lead U.S. analyst at Kpler, said the $250 billion-a-year figure just to the E.U. seems to be a ""wholly unrealistic number.""

That doesn't even consider how to force European companies to purchase U.S. energy, he said. ""The economics have to work.""

Breaking it down, Smith said U.S. crude is the highest-value product among these energy exports. Europe takes in roughly 1.6 million barrels a day of U.S. crude, which equates to more than $40 billion in a year, he said.

""Even if U.S. crude exports to Europe were to ramp up materially, [that] wouldn't really move the needle"" since total U.S. crude exports equate to roughly $85 million per year.

So $250 billion a year is an ""unrealistic number - even if U.S. energy was the most attractive option from a cost perspective,"" Smith said.

And it isn't. The price of benchmark Russian crude in June, for example, averaged below the $60-a-barrel price cap set by the Group of Seven to reduce Russia's ability to finance its war in Ukraine, according to the International Energy Agency. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude (CLU25) (CL.1) settled at $66.71 a barrel on Monday.

""Even if we are optimistic"" in reaching that pledged-value figure, ""we only get to [roughly] $100 billion in U.S. energy exports to the E.U., said Smith.

Even so, the energy sector rallied Monday, with WTI oil futures posting a gain of 2.4%, and the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund XLE, an exchange-traded fund that focuses on companies in the energy sector, trading up by 1%.

The First Trust Natural gas ETF FCG, which focuses on companies that get most of their revenue from natural-gas exploration and production, also traded up 2.1%. Natural-gas futures on Nymex, however, continued their decline from last week on the back of expectations for higher U.S. production. They settled Monday with a loss of 3.9%, at $2.99 per million British thermal units, the lowest since April 25, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Logistical challenges

Crude oil and products, as well as natural-gas liquids offtake, are significantly ""bottlenecked by refinery configurations and infrastructure logistics, said Ben Hoff, global head of commodity research at Societe Generale. That means that any growth would need to really come from LNG, he said.

But ""given LNG export terminals are multi-year infrastructure undertakings and that currently sanctioned U.S. projects are only expected to double total export capacity by 2030, it is a [physically] impossibility for the E.U. to fulfill the $750 billion pledge primarily through LNG,"" he said. ""The scale and speed required far exceed what is logistically, commercially or infrastructurally feasible within the deal's three-year window.""

The E.U. also ""does not have a centralized procurement mechanism for fossil energy, as energy policy remains largely a national competence under E.U. treaties,"" said Hoff.

""Actual purchasing decisions are made by private firms or national entities, and in practice, market economics override political pledges - even within member states,"" he said.

'Actual purchasing decisions are made by private firms or national entities and in practice, market economics override political pledges...'Ben Hoff, Societe Generale

Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, also believes that the E.U.'s pledge to buy more U.S. energy products would be a ""voluntary alignment,"" acknowledging that it would be a ""little bit hard to enforce.""

Steps to boost E.U. reliance

For its part, the E.U. could back off some of its moves toward the renewable energy sector - wind, solar and hydrogen - and replace that with U.S. oil and natural gas, he said.

Some people, however, have underestimated Trump's ability to push through deals there were previously said to be impossible, said Flynn.

The president has been pushing for a ceasefire deal between Russia and Ukraine, and his efforts have included threatening Russian President Vladimir Putin with losing one of his major export markets, which of course is the E.U.,"" he said. The E.U. has already reduced its reliance on Russian energy imports from about 40% of its natural-gas supplies to 10%, he said.

So another step that can be taken to bring the E.U. closer to its goal is the U.S. potentially filling in for some of that lost supply, Flynn said, adding that U.S. exports of LNG to Europe have climbed to record highs. The U.S. was the largest supplier of LNG to Europe in 2023, according to the EIA.

In a statement on the U.S.-E.U. trade deal, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the E.U. will ""replace Russian gas and oil with significant purchases of U.S. LNG, oil and nuclear fuels.""

Flynn highlighted the mention of that shift to U.S. nuclear fuels, which has the potential to make a significant impact. Nuclear power plants generated nearly 23% of total electricity produced in the E.U. in 2023, according to E.U. data. Russia, meanwhile, is among the world's biggest producers of nuclear fuel.

""If there are plans to more rapidly expand Europe's nuclear power capacity by utilizing U.S.-based companies, and the power-plant construction, operation, long-term fuel fulfillment contracts, and future reactor services (some of which can be decades long) are all included in that $750 [billion] 'headline number,'"" then there could be a case made that the ""pulled forward dollar-amount of future operations could boost the value of the deal,"" Tyler Richey, co-editor at Sevens Report Research, told MarketWatch.

However, that scenario would require some ""financial engineering"" to achieve the $750 billion, which would ""leave the realistic dollar amount of the deal carrying an asterisk based on the three-year timeline mentioned,"" said Richey.

Last week, the court issued a landmark ruling that climate harm violates international law.
The court also said they should prevent harm to marginalized communities such as Indigenous peoples and emphasized their role in combating climate change.
While not binding, its decisions are significant because they interpret international law and clarify states’ legal responsibilities.
For example, “Indigenous nations and First Nations within Canada now have stronger legal backbones to take cases against Canada,” she said.","As global inaction over the climate crisis has mounted and Pacific islands nations have watched in frustration as their calls for decisive action have gone unheeded, a growing number of them, led by Vanuatu, have turned to the courts. If policymakers won’t act, they hoped, perhaps the courts would.

And so island nations in the South Pacific region of Melanesia, where Indigenous communities have had to flee their traditional lands due to landslides and rising seas, filed a case that was ultimately joined by more than 130 countries. Together, they urged the International Court of Justice to decide whether nation-states have a legal obligation to address climate change, and whether those harmed by a warming world have a right to reparations.

Justices considered testimony in Indigenous Pacific languages, heard arguments from Indigenous attorneys, and learned how Indigenous traditions are being harmed by the typhoons, rising seas, and other extreme weather events worsened by the burning of fossil fuels.

Last week, the court issued a landmark ruling that climate harm violates international law. The seismic decision, although advisory, opens the door for countries like Vanuatu to seek reparations from some of the world’s biggest polluters, and it is widely expected to shape current — and future — climate lawsuits as early as this week.

“What the court has done has come in and made it crystal clear that affected frontline nations and communities that have been devastated by climate harm — harm that can be traced to the conduct of specific countries and corporations — those communities, those nations, they absolutely have the right to redress and reparations,” said Joie Chowdhury, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law.

The court’s decision, handed down Wednesday, said that all nations have a legal obligation to limit greenhouse gas emissions and failing to do so, through the support of fossil fuel production, could violate international law. The justices didn’t disclose how much major polluters might owe, and said the level of reparations would be determined on a case-by-case basis. But Chowdhury said she expects the ruling to immediately influence ongoing climate litigation worldwide, and prompt new lawsuits. “There are litigators all over the world that are looking to this case and will absolutely bring it into the courtroom,” she said.

Kelly Matheson, deputy director of global strategy for Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit law firm representing youth in climate litigation, said the organization is already incorporating the language of the advisory opinion into an amicus brief that it plans to file in a case in Latin America this fall. She also expects the ruling to feature heavily in La Rose v. His Majesty the King, a Canadian climate case youth plaintiffs brought against the Canadian government scheduled for trial next year, as well as a climate case pending before the African Court of Human and Peoples’ Rights.

Government attorneys also are studying the decision to determine whether their countries can sue. Malik Amin Aslam Khan, former minister of the environment in Pakistan, said the ruling “opens up a legally grounded pathway for claiming climate damages and demanding reparations for countries like Pakistan, which has continuously been one of the world’s worst climate sufferers and has credibly recorded climate damage costs crossing $40 billion in the past decade alone.”

Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s minister of climate change, said Vanuatu plans to immediately push for a resolution at the United Nations General Assembly to implement the advisory opinion. The government also plans to use the ruling to advocate for better climate financing for the Pacific and better regional and domestic policies to address the climate crisis.

“For the first time in history, the ICJ has spoken directly about the biggest threat facing humanity, which is climate change,” Regenvanu said during a press conference at The Hague last week. ”It’s very important now, as the world goes forward, that we make sure our actions align with what was decided or what came out today from the court.”

The ruling builds upon a growing consensus in international law that states have a legal obligation to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Last year, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea ruled that the 169 countries that have signed the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea — a list that includes China and India, but not the U.S. — must reduce emissions. It was another victory led by Pacific island nations as well as island nations in the Caribbean and West Indies.

Earlier this month, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, a regional court for Latin and South America, ruled that a healthy climate is a human right and governments should limit emissions. The court also said they should prevent harm to marginalized communities such as Indigenous peoples and emphasized their role in combating climate change.

“Indigenous peoples play an essential role in the preservation and sustainable management of these ecosystems because their ancestral knowledge and their close relationship with nature proved essential for the conservation of biodiversity and the mitigation of climate change,” the court wrote. “Therefore, states should listen to them and facilitate their continuing participation in decision-making.”

Matheson said that when Sheila Watt-Cloutier, an Indigenous Inuk woman who then chaired the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, brought a climate case to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights wo decades ago, it dismissed her claims within two pages. Several years later, Palau brought a similar case before the ICJ to no avail.

“For the law to be moving at this speed — to go from dismissals and no consideration of the impact that climate change has on human rights 20 years ago, when the first case was filed, to now you have opinions from all but one of the highest courts in the world — is amazing,” she said, noting that an African court is expected to weigh in soon.

While the ICJ ruling did not expound on the rights of Indigenous peoples and focused on the responsibilities of nation-states, it did clarify a question that has long troubled leaders of countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati that are losing land to rising seas: What happens to their borders if their islands disappear? On that note, the ICJ said any recognized borders should remain unchanged, which is important to ensure they continue to have a political voice on the international stage and control over their waters. “That presumption of statehood and sovereignty is a critical bit,” said Johanna Gusman, a senior attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law.

The case was initiated six years ago by a group of law students in Vanuatu and led by the government of Vanuatu and the Melanesian Spearhead Group, which represents several nations in that region of the Pacific and the Indigenous people of New Caledonia.

“By affirming the science, the ICJ has mandated countries to urgently phase out fossil fuels because they are no longer tenable for small island state communities in the Pacific, and for young people and for future generations,” Vishal Prasad, director of Pacific Islands, Students Fighting Climate Change, said during a press conference at The Hague. “This opinion is a lifeline and an opportunity to protect all that we hold dear, and all that we love.”

The United Nations established the International Court of Justice in the wake of World War II to help the global community address conflicts and concerns peacefully and judicially. It has heard cases on issues ranging from nuclear testing to fishing rights to the status of entire territories, such as Western Sahara. While not binding, its decisions are significant because they interpret international law and clarify states’ legal responsibilities. In this case, the court reviewed several treaties, including the 2015 Paris Agreement climate accord, and concluded that under those treaties and under customary international law, all nations have a legal obligation to limit emissions and may owe compensation to countries that are harmed.

There are limits to who can bring cases before the ICJ, which only hears cases brought by nation-states and not, for example, Indigenous political entities such as First Nations in Canada. Gusman said that Indigenous peoples may instead use the language of the cases in domestic disputes or through other U.N. venues. For example, “Indigenous nations and First Nations within Canada now have stronger legal backbones to take cases against Canada,” she said.

The court’s ruling will also be dulled somewhat in the United States, which has long rejected the ICJ’s authority and under President Donald J. Trump has been retreating even further from climate action. The U.S. and China are two major polluters whose rejection of the ICJ’s jurisdiction could prevent a country like Vanuatu from suing them directly over their emissions.

Korey Silverman-Roati, a senior fellow at the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said the ruling is a seminal moment for climate litigation but that the effects in the U.S. will be muted because U.S. courts don’t traditionally recognize the ICJ’s authority. “I don’t think we can expect that the direct language of the ruling will impact cases in the U.S.,” he said. He thinks the advisory opinion will likely instead influence other countries whose judicial systems give more weight to the ICJ, and influence the U.S. through the ruling’s use in international negotiations.

Already, the ruling is expected to figure heavily at this year’s Conference of the Parties, or COP, in November in Brazil. Last year, negotiations fell apart in the waning minute to the disappointment of Pacific island nations and many climate advocates who criticized the amount of money pledged by U.N. member states as woefully insufficient.

“The advisory opinion will be an essential tool that we in the Global South will use at the next meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, the U.N.’s climate change and biodiversity conferences, and everywhere to advocate for climate justice,” said Ilan Kiloe, acting director general of the Melanesian Spearhead Group. He said Pacific peoples have already suffered forced relocations due to climate change. “We have already lost much of what defines us as Pacific Islanders.”

“Whenever we do hit these kinds of milestones it is important,” he said. “[But] there is still a lot of work to do to improve Allegheny County air.”

While reaching the 1997 and 2006 goals are an advancement, Campbell said it will take a long time before the county reaches even 2024’s clean air standards, because the EPA needs to look at each area individually to determine whether or not it passes.

The mayors for the City of Clairton, Liberty, Lincoln, Port Vue and Glassport boroughs could not be reached for comment.

Last week, EPA also granted approval for the county’s Maintenance Plan that covers not only the 1997 and 2006 standards but also the 2012 PM2.5 standards.

“This maintenance plan helps to assure that the county will continue to meet these standards and provides a framework to assure attainment decades into the future,” said Geoff Rabinowitz, the deputy director of the Bureau of Environmental Health for the Allegheny County Health Department, in a statement to TribLive.

Rabinowitz said that while the Allegheny County Health Department also submitted a request to have county-wide attainment for 2012 PM2.5 standard, “there is still more hard work to do.”

Guest: John B. Anderson is the author of “Gulf Coast Demise?","If you are fortunate to be able to spend some valuable vacation time on the Texas Gulf Coast, as your toes dig into the wet sand and you inhale the salty air, take a moment to realize the United States Gulf Coast is undergoing a catastrophic transformation.

It makes no difference if you call it the Gulf of America or Mexico this sea is dealing with the collapse of vital ecosystems and the retreat of coastlines that once defined the region's natural resilience. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the Rio Grande Delta and the Mississippi River Delta. Once vibrant and ecologically rich, the Rio Grande Delta has vanished. In South Louisiana, ongoing land loss is so severe that scientists predict the Mississippi River Delta could be virtually gone by 2050.

This erosion crisis spans the entire Gulf Coast. Barrier islands are being stripped away, peninsulas are fragmenting, and the chenier plains—unique ridges formed by alternating mud and sand deposits—are eroding faster than ever. The region's delicate wetlands and seagrass meadows, crucial for biodiversity and coastal protection, are disappearing at alarming rates. Estuarine systems, including the Gulf’s largest estuaries, are nearing ecological collapse, with bayhead deltas poised for rapid landward retreat within decades.

These alarming developments represent a historic reversal. For millennia, natural sedimentation from rivers maintained a dynamic but stable coastal environment. However, human intervention, especially the construction of levees, canals, and dams, has disrupted these sediment flows. Compounding the damage is a six-fold increase in sea-level rise during the modern era, driven by climate change. This dual assault has stripped the coast of its natural defenses.

Meanwhile, warming ocean temperatures are intensifying storms. Hurricanes that once developed slowly now explode into powerful systems just before landfall, leaving communities with little time to prepare. The Gulf states, however, remain largely unprepared, often prioritizing short-term development over long-term sustainability.

In ""Gulf Coast Demise? Climate Change, Conservation, and Saving the American Sea,"" John B. Anderson offers a sobering account of this unfolding disaster. Combining decades of research with a passionate plea for conservation, Anderson documents the Gulf’s collapse and urges immediate action. His message is clear: without coordinated federal, state, and local efforts to restore natural sediment delivery and mitigate climate impacts, the American Gulf Coast as we know it will disappear, along with the communities, economies, and ecosystems that depend on it.

T1 Energy’s contract to purchase hyper-pure American polysilicon would likely be advantaged by any potential tariffs or import restrictions that result from this case. T1 Energy also believes the Section 232 investigation will result in strengthening U.S. energy security and boosting American advanced manufacturing.

In alignment with its strategy to build a domestic solar supply chain, T1 also plans to file in support of tariffs under the recently filed Solar 4 anti-dumping and countervailing duty case (“AD/CVD”) covering certain imports from Indonesia, Laos and India. T1 expects to benefit from potential tariffs under this case, which will support the Company’s efforts to build a vertically integrated supply chain including the G2_Austin solar cell manufacturing facility. As a Texas-based, NYSE listed, U.S. solar manufacturing leader, T1 has and will continue to actively advocate for strong trade policy, enforcement and remedies that promote the strategic development of the U.S. solar value chain. T1 believes these two trade actions are consistent with the Trump Administration’s efforts to safeguard and prioritize American manufacturing.

“It is time to bring back American manufacturing. We’re doing that at T1 Energy.

Tariffs, shifting trade policies, and the lingering shadow of a potential recession have forced automakers to rethink their financial strategies. Ford Motor Co.'s recent $3 billion unsecured credit line, announced on July 28, 2025, is a textbook example of strategic financial preparedness. This move, coupled with broader industry trends, underscores how long-term resilience in cyclical sectors hinges on proactive liquidity management, policy agility, and innovation.

Ford's $3 Billion Credit Line: A Playbook for Resilience

Ford's credit agreement, administered by JPMorgan Chase, offers a $3 billion line of credit available until July 28, 2026, with drawn funds maturing by December 31, 2028. The terms are striking in their foresight:

- Liquidity Covenant: Ford must maintain at least $4 billion in domestic cash or equivalents, ensuring financial flexibility even during downturns.

- Unsecured Structure: By avoiding asset collateral, Ford preserves its working capital for high-impact projects like the Marshall, Michigan, battery plant.

- No Material Adverse Change Clauses: This shields the company from arbitrary restrictions on borrowing during economic stress.

The Marshall plant, a $3 billion investment in LFP battery production, is central to Ford's electrification strategy. It relies heavily on the Inflation Reduction Act's 45X tax credits, which could generate $900 million annually in incentives. Without these credits, Ford estimates a 77% loss on its investment. The company's lobbying efforts to preserve these incentives highlight a critical lesson for investors: policy risk is now a core component of financial strategy in cyclical sectors.

Industry-Wide Trends: AI, Automation, and Tariff Mitigation

Ford's approach mirrors broader industry strategies. General Motors, for instance, has partnered with Nvidia to integrate AI into vehicle production, while Toyota leverages Microsoft's Azure OpenAI to streamline design processes. These investments aim to offset tariff-driven costs—GM anticipates $5 billion in 2025, Toyota a 21% net income drop. Ford's $2.5 billion tariff burden is similarly met with AI-powered robotics, such as the Boston Dynamics robot dog deployed in a Spanish plant, which detects maintenance issues before they escalate.

Automakers are also turning to aggressive financial incentives. Ford's “Zero-Zero-Zero” summer sale (zero down payment, 0% interest, zero payments for 90 days) is a direct response to average monthly new car payments reaching $756 in Q2 2025. Meanwhile, Tesla's focus on battery innovation (e.g., the 4680 cell) has reduced production costs by 50%, offering a stark contrast to Ford's supply chain optimization strategy.

Strategic Financial Preparedness: A Comparative Lens

Ford's strategy aligns with its peers but diverges in execution. While GM's cost-cutting initiatives have yielded $2–4 billion in efficiency gains, Ford's emphasis on dividend sustainability (TTM yield of 7.99%) reflects a different risk appetite. Tesla's technology-driven approach, meanwhile, prioritizes long-term margins over immediate operational adjustments.

The Marshall plant's reliance on tax credits, however, introduces a unique vulnerability. Ford's ability to navigate political headwinds—such as the initial House bill threatening Chinese-licensed LFP technology—demonstrates the importance of dual-layer resilience: financial liquidity and policy advocacy. This duality is increasingly critical in sectors where government incentives define market viability.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risk and Reward

For investors, Ford's credit line and industry peers' strategies offer two key takeaways:

1. Liquidity as a Competitive Edge: In cyclical sectors, companies with robust liquidity (like Ford's $4 billion covenant) are better positioned to weather downturns and seize opportunities.

2. Policy-Linked Exposure: Automakers with high reliance on tax credits (Ford, GM) face elevated risks if subsidies are scaled back. Diversified exposure across companies with hybrid strategies (e.g., Tesla's tech-driven margins) may mitigate this.

Ford's stock, currently trading at a 15% discount to its 52-week high, reflects market skepticism about EV adoption and policy risks. However, its $3 billion credit line and Marshall plant represent a calculated bet on long-term electrification. For risk-tolerant investors, this aligns with a broader trend of sector consolidation, where only financially agile players will thrive.

The California Air Resources Board will modify part of its Advanced Clean Trucks law so manufacturers can transfer zero-emission vehicle credits between states that also adopted the regulation.

The move was described as a nod to commitments made in the Clean Truck Partnership deal California forged with truck manufacturers as part of the state’s emissions reduction efforts.

The move arrives as many of the 13 states that rubber-stamped California’s rigorous plan to advance zero-emission vehicles and ban sales of new diesel and gas vehicles have halted their plans. The reasons include pushback from local business leaders and politicians, as well as the Trump administration’s aggressive push to rout such programs.

But CARB Chair Liane Randolph said the federal backlash against her state’s emissions goals won’t stall its progress.

“California’s commitment to cleaner trucks has created an ecosystem of programs and incentives that will continue to drive progress despite the federal administration’s unlawful actions challenging our state’s efforts to reduce emissions and deploy to clean transportation technologies,” Randolph said in a July 24 announcement.

CARB noted the amendments to the ACT plan along with some companion modifications to the state’s Zero-Emission Powertrain Certification Requirements were minor changes for stakeholders “with no significant cost or emissions impact.”

The changes will give manufacturers a “pooling option” to transfer surplus zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) and near-zero emission vehicle (NZEV) credits generated between states that adopted the ACT regulation. CARB also will allow manufacturers to offset a portion of deficits generated in the Classes 7-8 tractor group with Class 2b-3 or Classes 4-8 group ZEV credits for each model year. This change will give manufacturers greater flexibility and “account for fluctuations in ZEV and NZEV sales across states and vehicle classes,” CARB noted.

The amendments also:

Adjust the minimum all-electric range requirement for NZEV in later years

Give manufacturers more flexibility for how they retire credits

Change communication protocols for ZEV connector criteria to certify zero-emission powertrains

Randolph said the amendments “provide manufacturers with flexibility, and we look forward to continued collaboration with manufacturers in efforts to reduce emissions, protect public health and ensure global competitiveness as the rest of the world shifts to zero-emission technologies.”

The states following CARB’s lead are Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Most have struggled to meet individual deadlines they’d set to achieve goals set in the CARB regulations due to slow growth in the nascent alternative fuel vehicle industry, including the cost of EV trucks, customer aversion and inadequate charging infrastructure.

In Washington, the state’s Department of Ecology was asked by Washington Trucking Associations to amend its CARB-configured Clean Vehicle Program Rules. The group represents 500 member companies from small family-run companies to major fleets across the agriculture, forestry, construction, port drayage and general freight markets.

“Still on the books in Washington is the state’s transportation carbon neutral goal by 2050,” Sheri Call, WTA president and CEO, told Transport Topics. “There’s no doubt this will continue to be a push for Washington state. We are trying to offer reasonable solutions that steer us away from EVs as the only answer to get there, and instead adopt an immediate solution to encourage bio and renewable fuels paired with latest diesel technology as a more realistic scenario for heavy trucks.”

In June, WTA in a letter told state leaders that the commercial trucking sector cannot successfully operate ZEVs in Washington due to issues such as high costs and shifts in technology evolution.",https://www.ttnews.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_media_1200x630/public/2025-07/ACT-trucks-1200.jpg,N,,2025-07-29 00:13:27.506071

The SAF proposal could not have come at a better time for Michigan farmers.
Much like ethanol did in years past, tax incentives for sustainable aviation fuel are a powerful way to drive investment into rural communities — unlocking broad economic gains.","In Michigan, we know how to get things done — especially when we work together. That’s why I’m proud to be part of a bipartisan, bicameral coalition advancing a new path forward for our farmers, economy and environment.

Recently, I introduced legislation with state Sens. Sam Singh, R- East Lansing, and Joe Bellino, R- Monroe, to support the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in our state. These measures, otherwise known as House Bills 4424-25 and Senate Bills 235-36, offer a practical, forward-looking approach to strengthening rural Michigan while helping our state lead in clean energy innovation.

As chair of the House Agriculture Committee, a longtime dairy farmer and lifelong supporter of Michigan’s farm families, I believe this effort represents a smart, balanced approach to the future. We’re not choosing between clean energy and rural prosperity; we’re showing how the two can work together. And, we’re not forcing change from the top down, we’re building it from the ground up, with Michigan-grown solutions.

The SAF proposal could not have come at a better time for Michigan farmers. Shrinking margins, rising costs and uncertainty about the future are taking a huge toll on rural families, and this legislation could offer needed relief for all of Michigan’s farming communities.

The simple truth is that things are changing, whether we like it or not. Clean energy standards are fast approaching. Markets are shifting. And in agriculture, we feel that uncertainty every day. One change in federal policy or a single press conference can send ripple effects through the entire system. Our farmers are watching, waiting and wondering what the future holds. This legislation offers them something solid to stand on, and a new opportunity to grow.

SAF is a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel, capable of reducing emissions by up to 80%. And the best part is, it can be made from crops grown in Michigan. With the right incentives in place, our farmers can be at the center of this emerging industry: supplying corn, soybeans and other feedstocks that help power planes taking off from Michigan’s airports.

But this isn’t only about cleaner fuel, It’s about rural jobs and long-term economic resilience.

SAF production means more opportunities in towns that have seen too many family farms and small businesses disappear. It means consistent demand for what our farmers already produce, new construction jobs to build biorefineries and new careers in bio-manufacturing and logistics. It also offers a way to build that opportunity while also cutting emissions and strengthening the state's energy independence.

This legislation shows what’s possible when we put politics aside. It’s backed by Democrats and Republicans, agriculture leaders and energy advocates, urban interests and rural communities. That kind of cooperation is rare these days, but it’s exactly what Michigan needs more of.

I won’t pretend this is the answer to every challenge we face. But it’s a strong step forward. It sends a message to our farmers that we have their backs; to our communities, that we’re investing in their future; and to the country, that Michigan is ready to lead.

Much like ethanol did in years past, tax incentives for sustainable aviation fuel are a powerful way to drive investment into rural communities — unlocking broad economic gains. This strategy supports President Donald Trump’s vision of strengthening U.S. energy independence and growing American jobs. Moving SAF forward means building long-term prosperity throughout the agricultural supply chain.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/09/19/PDTN/75296660007-gunrightsmarch-mich-capitol-14.JPG?crop=2997,1686,x1,y56&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-28 20:59:13.020846

Additional $1 million contribution backs fleet charging infrastructure and operations and supports The Nature Conservancy (TNC) mission of transitioning to a clean, low-emission fleet

Initiative advances decades-long partnership between Honda and The Nature Conservancy

TORRANCE, Calif., July 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Acura is providing 75 of its all-electric ZDX performance SUVs, one of the best-selling premium EVs in America in 2025, to The Nature Conservancy (TNC) to help advance the nonprofit organization's critical conservation work and support its goal to transition to a cleaner, lower-emission fleet. This largest-ever vehicle donation by the premium performance brand builds on a long-standing collaboration between TNC and Honda, rooted in shared environmental values.

In addition to providing the fleet of electric vehicles, the Honda family of companies in the U.S., which includes Acura, is contributing $1 million to support the charging infrastructure and operation of the Acura ZDX fleet – reinforcing its commitment to the success of this initiative and the TNC goal to reduce operational emissions and align with its commitment to protecting the planet. The Acura ZDX electric vehicles­ will be delivered through Acura dealers nationwide to support local TNC teams across the country as they conduct fieldwork, engage with local communities and undertake conservation in remote and rural areas.

""We're proud to partner with The Nature Conservancy and Acura dealers across America to help advance sustainability by contributing to a lower-emissions future,"" said Mike Langel, assistant vice president of Acura National Sales. ""The Acura ZDX fleet will support The Nature Conservancy's important fieldwork, enabling more efficient travel to conservation sites while reducing the environmental impact of transportation.""

""We are incredibly grateful to Acura for this donation,"" said Daniel Salzer, Director of Sustainability for The Nature Conservancy. ""The donation of these vehicles has significantly accelerated our efforts to electrify our fleet, reducing our carbon footprint, and setting a powerful example of climate leadership.""

Honda and TNC have a longstanding partnership that began with the Ohio chapter of TNC over 30 years ago.

In 2023, Honda and the Honda USA Foundation contributed $625,000 to support TNC programs across 10 states, amplifying a Honda goal to build a sustainable future through the company's strategic Corporate Social Responsibility Environment pillar.

In 2020, Honda donated 90 acres of land to TNC in Ohio to help protect the springs and streams that combine to form the headwaters of Big Darby Creek. Honda has also supported local TNC chapters including Alabama, California, and Indiana.

Over 30 years ago, Honda and TNC collaborated for the first time to preserve the Big Darby Creek watershed in Ohio. Since then, Honda has contributed more than $1 million to protect the headwaters of the Big Darby Creek – one of the Midwest's most biologically diverse aquatic systems and one of the healthiest tributaries to the Scioto River, which provides drinking water for tens of thousands of Ohioans.

About the Honda Commitment to the Environment

Honda is transforming its operations to realize its global goal of zero environmental impact by 2050, including decarbonization for all products and corporate activities, the use of 100% carbon-free energy; and the pursuit of resource circulation, the use of 100% sustainable materials by reprocessing products back to raw materials and reusing those materials in the creation of new products. Toward this goal, Honda will strive to make battery-electric and fuel cell-electric vehicles represent 100% of auto sales globally by 2040, while also beginning electrification of Honda powersports and power equipment product lineups.

To reduce the environmental impact of its business operations, Honda is offsetting CO2 emissions from its North American manufacturing operations through long-term virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for carbon-free wind and solar power that cover more than 80% of the electricity Honda uses in North America. Honda also supports its suppliers and independent dealerships across North America in their decarbonization efforts through the Honda Green Excellence Academy and Honda Environmental Leadership Program, respectively.

This significant milestone marks a collaborative effort between EPA, the Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to improve air quality for the communities within Liberty, Lincoln, Port Vue, Glassport boroughs, and the City of Clairton to redesignate a nonattainment area to attainment, the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires EPA to determine the state has met all applicable requirements for that National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).

Fine particulate pollution, known as PM2.5, can originate directly from sources or form secondarily through atmospheric chemical reactions involving precursor pollutants. EPA's decision reflects the successful implementation of strategies to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and volatile organic

compounds (VOCs), which contribute to PM2.5 formation.

EPA’s final rule details how the Liberty-Clairton Area meets the CAA requirements for redesignation, including a maintenance plan outlining sustained practices for continued compliance.

What You Need to Know About Allegheny County’s Maintenance Plan Approval

In addition, EPA has approved the Commonwealth’s plan to maintain air quality standards in the Allegheny County Area for the 2012 annual PM2.5 standard through 2035.

This plan encompasses all municipalities within Allegheny County and includes provisions for local controls should the 2012 annual PM2.5 standard be violated. This action does not redesignate the Allegheny County Area to attainment for the 2012 annual PM2.5 NAAQS.

We know: This is all VERY technical. The bottom line? This is truly positive news for the residents of the Liberty-Clairton airshed and indeed, all of Allegheny County.

The EPA's designation of attainment for the Liberty-Clairton area for PM2.5 standards is a testament to the decades of hard work, advocacy, and a commitment to cleaner air from countless individuals and organizations like GASP and so many others.

“We've collectively pushed for stronger regulations, held polluters accountable, and championed solutions to clear our skies,” GASP Executive Director Patrick Campbell said. “But this isn't the finish line; it's just a crucial milestone. The approval of the maintenance plan for Allegheny County is precisely what we need to ensure this progress isn't fleeting.”

Think of it like this: After a long fitness journey, you wouldn’t just go back to your old habits, right? You implement a maintenance plan - a new lifestyle with healthier habits to ensure your progress.

“This maintenance plan is a vital tool, outlining the ongoing strategies and contingency measures that will prevent backsliding and ensure the hard-won air quality improvements we've achieved are sustained for generations to come,” Campbell continued. “We must remain vigilant and committed to its implementation.""

GASP wants to stress that future progress depends on more than just a maintenance plan, we need to ensure that our local regulator - the Allegheny County Health Department - has the staffing and resources it needs to fulfill its duties.

“Right now, ACHD leadership has made it clear that they do not have those resources,” Campbell explained. “This attainment news should be a wakeup call to Allegheny County Council members who have been stalling on a vote to approve fee schedule changes that would ensure this air quality progress continues.”

We also want folks to understand that this type of local progress could be derailed by proposed rollbacks of crucial regulations announced recently by Trump’s EPA. Help us fight these rollbacks and protect the air we have all fought so hard to clean up. Here’s one way to resist.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/f3af33_bda2a17711b04a04a05cc51b9c792e39~mv2.jpeg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_758,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/f3af33_bda2a17711b04a04a05cc51b9c792e39~mv2.jpeg",N,,2025-07-28 20:59:09.495443

Framed as a centrist, fiscally responsible, and tech-forward alternative to the entrenched two-party system, the party's potential policies could reshape tax incentives and market dynamics. For investors, the implications span green energy, R&D-driven industries, and corporate tax arbitrage—sectors poised to benefit from Musk's vision of a streamlined, innovation-centric economy.

Fiscal Conservatism and Green Energy: A Synergistic Opportunity

The America Party's emphasis on deficit reduction and fiscally conservative governance may seem at odds with green energy's capital-intensive nature. However, Musk's proposed policies suggest a nuanced approach. The party is expected to advocate for clean-energy tax credits and R&D incentives to spur innovation in sustainable technologies. This aligns with Musk's broader business interests, particularly Tesla's reliance on government incentives for EV adoption and renewable energy infrastructure.

For example, the party's potential support for expanding tax credits for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy projects could revive stalled initiatives under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Musk has criticized for phasing out EV credits. If enacted, such policies could directly benefit companies like Tesla (TSLA), NextEra Energy (NEE), and First Solar (FSLR). Investors should monitor the party's ability to influence legislative outcomes, particularly in the 2026 midterm elections, where control of key Senate and House districts may determine the fate of these incentives.

R&D-Driven Industries: A Tech-Friendly Tax Code

Musk's America Party is projected to champion pro-business tax reforms, including lower corporate tax rates and accelerated depreciation for R&D investments. This mirrors the 2025 House Republican Tax Bill's provisions, which extended full expensing for domestic R&D and bonus depreciation for capital investments. By reducing the upfront cost of innovation, such policies could incentivize tech companies to scale R&D efforts in artificial intelligence, battery storage, and advanced manufacturing.

Investors in R&D-heavy sectors—such as semiconductors (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD), biotechnology (e.g., Moderna, CRISPR Therapeutics), and clean tech—stand to gain from a tax environment that prioritizes innovation. However, the success of these reforms hinges on the America Party's ability to counteract the entrenched fiscal policies of both major parties.

Corporate Tax Arbitrage: A Low-Regulation, High-Growth Strategy

The party's focus on “tech-driven, low-regulation” governance could create opportunities for corporate tax arbitrage. By advocating for reduced corporate tax rates and streamlined compliance, the America Party may attract businesses seeking to relocate or expand operations in the U.S. This mirrors the 2025 House Republican Tax Bill's extension of favorable international tax rates (e.g., GILTI and FDII frameworks), which aim to enhance global competitiveness.

For investors, this could translate into sector rotation toward industries that thrive in a low-tax, high-innovation environment. Sectors like aerospace (e.g., Boeing, Lockheed Martin) and software-as-a-service (e.g., Microsoft, Salesforce) are prime candidates. However, risks remain: the America Party's unproven electoral viability and potential resistance from traditional GOP and Democratic factions could limit its influence.

Navigating the Risks: A Balanced Approach for Investors

While the America Party's platform presents compelling opportunities, investors must weigh the uncertainties. Key risks include:

1. Legal and Structural Hurdles: Registering the party with the FEC and securing ballot access in 50 states is a costly, time-consuming process. Musk's $350 billion fortune may mitigate these challenges, but political resistance from both major parties could complicate matters.

2. Policy Overlap with Existing Platforms: The party's emphasis on fiscal conservatism overlaps with Republican priorities, yet its anti-Trump stance and pro-bitcoin positions may alienate traditional GOP voters. This could fragment the potential coalition needed for electoral success.

3. Market Volatility: Speculative bets on the party's success could drive short-term volatility in green energy and tech stocks. Investors should consider hedging strategies, such as sector ETFs or options, to manage exposure.

Strategic Investment Recommendations

Green Energy and R&D Sectors: Position portfolios to benefit from potential tax incentives by overweighting companies with strong government-contract pipelines and R&D capabilities.

Corporate Tax Arbitrage: Monitor the America Party's progress in 2026 elections and adjust allocations toward industries likely to gain from reduced compliance costs.

Diversification: Balance high-risk, high-reward bets with defensive assets (e.g., utilities, healthcare) to mitigate sector-specific downturns.

Elon Musk's America Party represents a high-stakes political experiment with the potential to redefine tax policy and market dynamics. For investors, the key lies in aligning strategies with the party's likely areas of influence while remaining agile in the face of uncertainty. As the 2026 elections approach, the interplay between fiscal conservatism, technological innovation, and corporate governance will shape the next chapter of U.S. economic policy—and with it, a new frontier of investment opportunities.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-28 20:59:05.106466

Amanda Byers and Molly Sanford are just two of those grappling with the financial strain of skyrocketing electricity costs.

""This month, my bill is $371; that’s almost a quarter of my rent,"" said Byers expressing her disbelief at the high costs. ""I just don’t comprehend how my bill is that high.""

Byers noted that her AES Indiana bill has increased by more than $140 over the last year, forcing her family to rely on a food pantry to meet their grocery needs. ""You can’t save,"" she added, reflecting the difficult choices many are compelled to make.

Sanford echoed similar concerns, revealing that her electricity bill is now significantly higher than it was last year. “What was it?” she asked, checking her records. “Oh, half that.”

They are not alone in their struggles. Data from the Citizens Action Coalition, an environmental advocacy group, shows that Hoosiers are facing an average increase of $28 per month in electricity costs compared to the previous year. This 17.5% hike is nearly double last year’s record increase of 9.3% and marks the largest surge in two decades.

For AES customers, the increase is nearly $17 per month, translating to nearly $204 annually.

Kerwin Olson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, expressed concern for everyday residents battling these rate hikes.

“It’s very rare that state regulators hear from ratepayers. They hear from the utilities every single day,” he said.

Olson urged Hoosiers to speak up to the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission to ensure voices like Amanda’s and Molly’s are heard.

“What else could we possibly do?” Sanford asked. “We own a small home and are pretty thoughtful about the air and lights. What can we do on our end to improve this situation?”

Releasing the ATA’s submission to Treasury’s Economic Reform Roundtable consultation, ATA Chair Mark Parry said the case for a unified national approach was compelling.

“Fuel excise revenue is forecast to decline from 5.2 per cent of government revenue in 2008–09 to just 3.5 per cent by 2028–29,” Parry said. “We need a national EV charging system to prevent a patchwork of inconsistent state charges.”

“The last thing national trucking businesses need is different road user charges with different record keeping requirements across jurisdictions,” he said.

The ATA has recommended that the federal government finalise the structure of a national EV charge now, but delay its introduction until electric vehicles make up at least 30 per cent of new light vehicle sales – and eventually heavy vehicles.

“Right now, we need more EVs on the road to cut emissions and reduce our reliance on imported fuel. But we also need certainty about how these vehicles will contribute to road funding,” Parry said.

Environmental advocates, elected leaders and workers at the Environmental Protection Agency gathered at Federal Plaza downtown Monday to push back against President Donald Trump’s reported efforts to repeal a key federal determination that allows the EPA to help combat climate change.

Environmental Law & Policy Center senior policy advocate Susan Mudd said Trump’s reported plans to rescind the “endangerment finding” means the EPA would be abandoning its job to protect Americans and the environment.

“It’s time to ramp up efforts to reduce the air pollution stemming from coal- and natural gas-fired power plants and vehicle tailpipes that are leading to all this damage — not time to put heads in the sand, tie EPA’s hands behind its back and exacerbate the problems,” Mudd said.

The federal government’s “endangerment finding,” in place under the Clean Air Act since 2009, allows the EPA to set limits on greenhouse gas emissions from cars, factories and other sources due to their negative impact on public health. The Trump administration is expected to announce plans to rescind the finding within days, according to reports.

“The Trump Administration will not sacrifice national prosperity, energy security, and the freedom of our people for an agenda that throttles our industries, our mobility, and our consumer choice while benefiting adversaries overseas,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a March news release, when the administration first announced it would formally reconsider the determination.

Loreen Targos, executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 704 union, said the “endangerment finding” has allowed the EPA to regulate man-made contributors of climate change, including carbon dioxide and methane emissions.

“The rate of climate change is accelerating beyond what scientists have said is safe for the species alive on this earth, including humanity,” Targos said. “I see the rate of extreme storms that are supposed to be 1,000-year floods happening every year, the intensity of hurricanes and how they’ve changed in these ways that even our strongest predictions didn’t predict.”

Targos, a physical scientist who has worked at the EPA for 10 years, said she has seen “terror and trauma” put on EPA employees in the past several months under the current administration.

The local EPA office has lost more than 200 workers since Trump returned to office, according to Nicole Cantello, president of AFGE Local 704, which represents about 1,000 EPA employees in the Midwest. Even more might potentially leave the EPA under the latest round of a deferred resignation program being offered to workers, Cantello said.

In February, Chicago-area EPA workers rallied against the Trump administration’s mass layoffs of federal workers, as part of its initial efforts to cut government spending and reduce the size of the federal workforce.

The loss of workers at the agency limits environmental protection in the region, according to Cantello.

“A lot of things are falling through the cracks,” Cantello said. “For instance, air enforcement or water enforcement, where you try to stop people from polluting — so many of those inspectors have left, and also the lawyers that prosecute those cases.”

Earlier this month, about 140 EPA workers across the country, including some in Chicago, were placed on administrative leave after signing a letter criticizing how, in their view, the Trump administration has undermined the agency’s mission.

U.S. Rep. Bill Foster (D-Illinois) noted formerly serving with Zeldin in Congress back when Zeldin served as a representative for New York. Foster and fellow U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Illinois) made remarks during Monday’s news conference at Federal Plaza, warning of the dangers of rescinding the “endangerment finding” on the health of people in the U.S. and the broader world.

“This is not a small deal because this has been the basis of a tremendous amount of greenhouse gas mitigation that we have accomplished in the last 15 years since that finding was in place,” Foster said. “The danger of it being reversed is something that will cause the rest of the world, once again, to shake their heads in dismay at what’s become of this country.”

Environmental Health Programs Director for the Chicago-based Respiratory Health Association Brian Urbaszewski said a repeal of the EPA’s “endangerment finding” could lead to more power plants that run on coal, along with more diesel and gasoline engines in cars, undermining health, in addition to undermining the economic benefits and technological advancements of solar and wind energy.

“It’s ridiculous to see that the federal government is trying to essentially take us back a century to where we’re going to be pushing more fossil fuels, which we know are deadly,” Urbaszewski said. “Hopefully, the science will win out in the end.”",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-28 20:01:14.326605

The Advantages of Smaller EVs Over Larger Models The rise of larger EVs presents a wide range of challenges.
Expanding charging infrastructure is also key to easing consumer concerns about range limitations often associated with smaller EVs.","The electric vehicle (EV) market is showing steady growth in many parts of the world. In 2023, nearly one in five cars sold worldwide was electric, with China, Europe and the United States accounting for 95% of those sales. In 2025, Europe’s average electric car market share is expected to reach 25%, a trend driven by increased manufacturer competition, declining battery costs and ongoing policy support for clean technologies. To meet decarbonization goals, specifically to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C by 2050 (ITDP), both electrification of vehicles and shifting passengers to more sustainable modes will need to happen in tandem.

Switching to electric cars and buses is a vital part of decarbonizing transportation. But as EV adoption grows, a concerning trend has emerged: the dominance of larger consumer models such as SUVs and pickups1 . While these still represent a major improvement over fossil fuel-powered vehicles, they bring a new set of challenges.

If left unchecked, this trend risks undermining many of the environmental, social and equity benefits of electrification by straining energy systems, increasing demand for scarce minerals and hindering efforts to deliver a green, fair and inclusive transition to cleaner, renewable energy sources.

Examining these trends offers a critical look at the growing challenge — and an opportunity to lead with smarter, more sustainable solutions.

A Growing Global Trend: Electric Cars Are Getting Larger

In 2023, two-thirds of battery-electric models on the major EV markets were SUVs, pickups or large cars — a dramatic increase from just one-third in 2017. In Europe, fewer than 40% of the battery electric vehicles (BEVs) were small and medium cars, compared with just 25% in the U.S. and 50% in China. This trend mirrors the broader rise of larger internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles across Europe, where more than half of ICE vehicle sales in 2023 were SUVs. Since 2011, sales of small cars in Europe have dropped by 50%, while SUV sales have tripled.

A mix of factors is driving this trend.

Buyers often associate larger vehicles and SUVs with greater safety, space and versatility, making them the preferred choice for their primary vehicles — even though smaller EV models are often better suited for urban environments and short-distance trips.

The preference for larger vehicles is further driven by the availability of electric models that cater to this demand. Projections suggest that only about one-quarter of new EV models expected through 2028 will be small or medium-sized cars.

In some cases, government policies and incentives are structured in ways that favor larger vehicles. In some U.S. cities, for example, tax credits of up to $7,500 are often more advantageous for electric SUVs. In the EU, fleetwide carbon dioxide emission targets allow car manufacturers to offset the emissions of larger, higher-emitting vehicles by producing smaller, cleaner models. This flexible compliance system was designed to lower compliance costs for carmakers while providing emissions leeway for heavier vehicles.

The Advantages of Smaller EVs Over Larger Models

The rise of larger EVs presents a wide range of challenges. They can consume up to 20% more energy than smaller EVs, placing greater demand on electricity demand and grid infrastructure. They require more critical minerals, such as lithium and cobalt, to produce larger batteries, which increase lifecycle emissions (the total amount of greenhouse gases released over the vehicle’s entire lifespan). More concerningly, larger vehicles pose greater safety risks for pedestrians, cyclists and other vulnerable road users, particularly in dense urban areas.

Smaller EVs offer several significant advantages that can help address some of the downsides associated with larger models:

More efficient for urban mobility

Smaller EVs take up less space, making navigation and parking easier in dense urban environments. When supported by adequate charging infrastructure, they can be effectively integrated into car-sharing services, offering a convenient and attractive mobility option.

This is particularly well suited to many European cities, which are typically compact and densely populated. Historic city centers, narrow streets and mixed-use zoning — where residential, commercial and public spaces are closely integrated — naturally discourage the use of larger vehicles. With the average daily travel distance in European countries at just 12.4 kilometers per person, smaller EVs are a better fit for urban commuting, leisure and short-distance travel. Even the smallest electric models, such as compact family cars, typically have a minimum driving range of 135 kilometers.

Less demanding on the environment

Smaller EVs consume less energy and require fewer critical minerals for battery production, helping to lower lifecycle emissions and reduce pressure on supply chains. According to an analysis by Transport & Environment, prioritizing smaller EVs in Europe could reduce demand for critical minterals by 25%. Similarly, a report by the International Energy Agency shows that targeted measures to curb the demand for large vehicles could cut global mineral demand for EV batteries by 18% to 20% by 2050.

Better for safety

In cities designed for people — and not just cars — promoting smaller vehicles can help align road design with broader urban sustainability goals. Studies show that larger vehicles, due to their greater mass and higher front ends, increase the risk of fatal pedestrian accidents by 45%. One European study found that increasing a vehicle’s mass by 300 kilograms raises the risk of fatal injury for vulnerable road users, including cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians, by 30%.

How to Sustainably Expand EVs

Sustainably expanding EV adoption depends in part on consumer choices — but effective policy plays an even more important role. Well-designed incentives can help guide buyers toward smaller EVs instead of SUVs or pickup trucks.

Curbing the trend toward bigger cars

Some policymakers are already taking steps to counter the rise in vehicle sizes. France has introduced weight-based taxes for ICE and plug-in hybrid vehicles over 1,600 kilograms, while the city of Paris has tripled parking fees for SUVs. In Norway, EV purchase taxes are based on vehicle weight and emissions, making larger, high-emission models significantly more expensive.

Designing cities for compact urban mobility

Ongoing policy innovations reflect a growing commitment to prioritize sustainable urban mobility, with a focus on smaller EVs. Across Europe, more than 320 cities have introduced low-emission zones that restrict the use of large, high-polluting vehicles in city centers.

However, switching to smaller EVs alone won't solve the broader challenges of car dependence. While compact EVs reduce energy use and could cut critical mineral demand, they don't address congestion, urban sprawl or the induced demand created by more private vehicles on the road. In cities, sustainable urban mobility will require a broader shift toward prioritizing public transport, cycling and walking. Smaller EVs have an important role to play in general car use, but they need to complement — not replace — efforts to reduce overall car reliance.

A market shift toward affordable, smaller EVs

Chinese automakers are rapidly expanding their presence in Europe. BYD, for example, has announced plans to build an EV manufacturing plant in Hungary and is introducing budget-friendly and subcompact models like the BYD Seagull and Wuling Bingo, both priced under €10,000. In response, European automakers including Volkswagen, Renault and Stellantis are rolling out smaller, more affordable EVs, with new models expected to launch under €25,000. These companies also plan to ramp up local production as supply chains in the region continue to strengthen.

Driving Uptake Through Incentives and Awareness

Governments can accelerate the adoption of smaller EVs through targeted financial incentives such as subsidies and favorable financing terms, making them a more attractive option for consumers. Expanding charging infrastructure is also key to easing consumer concerns about range limitations often associated with smaller EVs. At the same time, raising public awareness about the economic, environmental and social benefits of compact EVs, particularly in urban settings, is essential to support long-term behavior change.

The growing shift toward larger vehicles is not just a matter of consumer preference — it also represents a missed opportunity to align Europe’s urban mobility with its sustainability and decarbonization goals. By prioritizing smaller, more affordable EVs and promoting a systems approach, European cities — and other cities around the world — can create cleaner, safer and more livable urban environments.

The Republican megabill that President Donald Trump signed into law this month eliminates a federal tax credit for residential solar power projects years ahead of schedule, cutting them off at the end of 2025.

In New York, some companies that install solar power systems are seeing a sudden surge in demand as consumers rush to act — but are preparing for it to be short-lived.

“A lot of people are sort of almost panic buying, in a way,” said T.R. Ludwig, the CEO of Brooklyn SolarWorks.

The tax credit enables homeowners that install a solar power system to recoup a percentage of the cost. Legislation signed by then-President Joe Biden — the so-called Inflation Reduction Act — increased the credit to 30% and mandated it be available through 2032, before phasing out.

But the sweeping tax and spending package that President Trump signed into law at the beginning of July bumped up the tax credit’s expiration date by several years, ending it for residential homes at the end of this December.

Ludwig told Spectrum News that while his business is bustling now as homeowners look to take advantage of the credit before it expires, he is getting ready for a potential slow down come January. He said he is trying to find ways to rein in costs, emphasizing he hopes to avoid laying off any of his 80 employees.

“We’ve worked really hard over the past ten years to build an awesome team, and so it will be super painful if we do have to cut back the team. But you know, that may be a reality,” he said.

The Republican-crafted federal changes came just months after the New York Public Service Commission redirected hundreds of millions of dollars away from a state-level solar incentive program. A commission spokesperson said the program already helped the state meet a key solar energy goal of six gigawatts ahead of schedule and under budget, freeing up funding for other affordability efforts.

In a statement, spokesman James Denn said, “With these changes we will be able to redirect ratepayer funds to other crucial policy matters, including critically needed energy affordability programs, and provide funds to incentivize 500 megawatts of additional solar projects that directly benefit low-income customers above our statewide goals.”

Now, with just months left until the federal solar tax credits go away, New York solar industry advocates are calling for the state to help fill the void by re-evaluating its solar initiatives and weighing other options, such as permitting reform.

“Right now, there’s a lot of anxiety in our industry,” said Noah Ginsburg, executive director of the New York Solar Energy Industries Association.

“Unfortunately, we have seen some companies lay off staff, some companies belt-tightening, thinking about just what’s coming. And with reduced federal support, unfortunately, that means reduced project development, reduced investment,” he added.

A spokesperson for Gov. Kathy Hochul, in a statement, touted New York’s efforts to build out the renewable energy sector and blasted the GOP-crafted federal law.

“The White House, aided by our state’s Republican delegation, is intent on taking us backwards at a time when energy affordability is a top priority and demand is rising. We are looking into all the impacts, but as the governor has said, we will not be able to backfill all the cuts coming out of Washington,” Ken Lovett, Hochul’s senior communications advisor on energy and environment, said in the statement.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/solar-design-options-tilt-rack_(3)_Cropped,N,,2025-07-28 20:01:49.684535

All of this capacity came from new onshore projects. Total installations for 2025 are forecast at 8.1 GW, including onshore, offshore and repowering. Turbine orders in the first half of 2025 fell by 50% year on year to their lowest level since 2020. This was attributed to tariffs and uncertainty over future policy.

Demand, particularly for safe harbour orders, is expected to recover later in the year following the passing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).

Wood Mackenzie notes a downward revision of 430 MW in the outlook for onshore wind additions between 2025 and 2029. This reflects permitting issues, tariff risks and the scheduled end of tax credits. A late surge in orders is expected in 2029–2030 as developers move to secure incentives before tax credits expire. Western states are projected to add 9.4 GW of new capacity by 2029.

For offshore wind, where most projects are already in construction, the forecast remains steady at 5.9 GW of new capacity by 2029. However, no new projects are expected to reach a final investment decision during President Trump’s current term, which could reduce offshore activity in the 2030s.

Despite current uncertainty, Wood Mackenzie forecasts average annual installations of 8.9 GW for the next five years. By the end of 2029, total additional capacity is expected to reach 44 GW, including 33 GW onshore, 6 GW offshore and 5.4 GW from repowering. Cumulative installed capacity is projected to reach 197 GW.

The OBBBA, enacted on 4 July 2025, alters tax credit eligibility from “placed in service” to “start of construction”, allowing a 12‑month period to begin projects and still qualify for a four‑year safe harbour. This change is likely to drive safe harbour equipment purchases for projects targeting 2029–2030.

Wood Mackenzie’s analysis indicates that the expiry of tax credits would increase the levelised cost of energy by around 25% without subsidies, while tariffs could raise it by up to 10%.",https://www.windtech-international.com/images/logo/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-29 00:12:21.416966

Zeldin has focused his tenure at the EPA rolling back environmental rules, slashing staff and advancing President Donald Trump’s Unleashing America’s Energy agenda.

Zeldin will announce the repeal of what is known as the ""endangerment finding,"" according to a report in E&E News, a publication of Politico.

Governor Mike Braun, Attorney General Todd Rokita and U.S. Rep. Jim Baird, are expected join Zeldin for the announcement at Kenworth of Indianapolis off East 30th Street.

What is the endangerment finding?

Greenhouse gases weren’t always classified as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

Concerns about motor vehicles emissions rising throughout the early 2000s led to a petition where 19 organizations called upon the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA rejected the petition, arguing that the gases weren’t considered air pollutants subject to the Clean Air Act.

Litigation ensued. And in 2007, the Supreme Court categorized greenhouse gases as “without a doubt” air pollutants.

In 2009, the endangerment finding gave the EPA authority to regulate six greenhouse gases — including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — as threats to human health. That move contributed to regulations on emissions from cars, trucks, power plants and the oil and gas industry.

What happens if it’s rolled back

Repealing the endangerment finding would be a step backward and is not supported by science, said Gabe Filippelli, a biogeochemist and professor of Earth sciences at Indiana University.

“One could argue that it is just another attempt to prop up the dirtiest of businesses we still have in the U.S., which includes coal burning power plants,” Filippelli said.

Climate changes poses a real danger for Hoosiers, and revoking these rules is a case of businesses winning and communities losing, he said. The EPA balances economic needs with environmental protection, but the two issues are not at odds.

“We need business and electricity,” Filippelli said, “but not at the expense of people’s health.”

On July 28, 2025, the firm announced a strategic joint venture with Savion Equity, LLC, a subsidiary of Shell plc, to form Tango Holdings, LLC. This partnership, which will manage 496 megawatts (MW) of solar projects across four states, represents a bold step in Ares' long-term diversification strategy. By leveraging its infrastructure investing expertise and Shell's operational scale, Ares is not only expanding its renewable energy footprint but also capitalizing on a structural shift in global energy markets.

A Strategic Partnership with Tangible Scale

Tango Holdings is structured with Ares holding an 80% stake through its Ares Infrastructure Opportunities fund, while Savion retains 20% ownership. The venture includes ownership of five solar projects: the Martin County Solar Project, the Kiowa County Solar Project, and three additional facilities currently under construction in Ohio, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Indiana. These projects, with a combined capacity of 496 MW, are poised to contribute to the U.S. grid's renewable energy supply at a time when demand for clean power is surging.

Savion, Shell's renewable energy arm, brings technical and operational expertise to the table, while Ares provides the capital and infrastructure investing know-how. This division of labor is a masterstroke: Savion, which manages 3,049 MW of solar and storage assets nationwide, will serve as the managing member of Tango, and Shell Renewable Asset Management International will oversee asset operations. The partnership allows Ares to scale its renewable portfolio without shouldering operational risks, a critical advantage in the capital-intensive energy sector.

Diversification Through Renewable Energy Momentum

Ares' infrastructure portfolio has long emphasized stable cash flow and long-term value creation. As of March 2025, the firm's Infrastructure Opportunities team had deployed $11 billion across 270 assets, with a growing emphasis on climate infrastructure. The Tango joint venture builds on this foundation by adding 496 MW of solar capacity—enough to power 100,000 homes annually—to Ares' existing renewable holdings.

This move aligns with a broader trend in Ares' strategy. Over the past year, the firm has acquired 4.0 gigawatts (GW) of U.S. power generation assets across nine states, including a 1 GW solar and storage portfolio from ENGIE North America. These acquisitions, combined with a €2 billion stake in Plenitude, an Italian energy provider, underscore Ares' commitment to diversifying its infrastructure portfolio into high-growth sectors. The solar venture with Shell further solidifies this focus, tapping into a market projected to grow at a 12% compound annual rate through 2030.

Capitalizing on Long-Term Tailwinds

The U.S. energy transition is driven by three tailwinds that Ares is uniquely positioned to exploit:

1. Regulatory Momentum: The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 has unlocked $370 billion in clean energy incentives, including tax credits for solar and storage projects. Tango's solar assets will benefit directly from these subsidies, enhancing their cash flow profiles.

2. Corporate Demand: Major corporations, including Microsoft and Amazon, have pledged to achieve 100% renewable energy use by 2030, creating a robust market for solar power.

3. Energy Security: Geopolitical instability has heightened the urgency for domestic energy production. Solar projects like those managed by Tango reduce reliance on imported fuels, aligning with national priorities.

Ares' Infrastructure Debt team, which manages $11 billion in assets, has also been expanding its reach. Recent hires, such as Jon Plavnick and Spencer Ivey, reflect the firm's intent to deepen its infrastructure financing capabilities. This dual focus on debt and equity investments allows Ares to capture value across the capital stack, from project development to long-term asset management.

Risks and Rewards

While the venture is promising, investors should consider potential risks. Solar projects face challenges such as permitting delays, supply chain bottlenecks, and fluctuating EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) costs. However, Ares' track record in infrastructure investing—its 270+ assets under management across 15 years—suggests it can navigate these hurdles. Additionally, Shell's involvement provides a layer of operational stability, reducing the risk of underperformance.

Investment Implications

For investors, the Tango joint venture represents a high-conviction play on the energy transition. Ares' ability to scale its renewable portfolio while maintaining disciplined capital allocation positions it as a leader in the infrastructure space. The firm's 80% ownership stake in Tango ensures it will capture a significant share of the venture's returns, which are expected to materialize over the next five to seven years as projects reach full capacity.

Given the long-term nature of infrastructure investing, Ares' shares (ARES) may not react immediately to the venture's announcement. However, the firm's consistent deployment of capital—$21 billion deployed since 2010—and its focus on assets with durable cash flows make it an attractive holding for patient investors. Those seeking exposure to the energy transition might consider Ares as a core component of a diversified infrastructure portfolio, particularly alongside complementary plays in energy storage and grid modernization.

Conclusion

Ares Management's partnership with Shell's Savion subsidiary is more than a strategic move—it's a calculated bet on the future of energy. By combining Ares' infrastructure expertise with Shell's renewable energy capabilities, Tango Holdings is poised to become a key player in the U.S. solar market. As the energy transition accelerates, Ares is not just adapting to change; it's shaping it. For investors with a long-term horizon, this venture offers a compelling opportunity to capitalize on the renewable revolution.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-28 19:04:25.567056

Von der Leyen suggested that the only real concession from the Americans was that Trump would not impose 30% tariffs he had threatened.
Von der Leyen and Trump shook hands and commended each other on the deal.
Von der Leyen hailed Trump as a “tough negotiator and dealmaker.” “And fair,” Trump interjected.
“President Trump just unlocked one of the biggest economies in the world,” he said in a statement.","It took just 75 minutes for President Trump to get what he wanted out of the European Union.

That’s how long he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen were away from the cameras.

When they returned, Trump was triumphant. Europe agreed to buy $750 billion in American energy products, invest $600 billion in new money in the US and purchase additional US military equipment, according to the terms of the preliminary agreement.

Tariffs on many American exports will drop to zero. Duties on most European goods coming into the US rise to 15%.

“I think it’s the biggest deal ever made,” Trump proclaimed.

The stated terms of the tariff deal appeared to be remarkably lopsided in favor of the US. Von der Leyen suggested that the only real concession from the Americans was that Trump would not impose 30% tariffs he had threatened.

The 27-member bloc is America’s biggest trading partner if taken together, with total trade hitting $1.97 trillion last year. The US trade deficit for goods was $235 billion.

The deal avoids a trade war between two economies that account for about 44% of the world’s gross domestic product — less than a week before steep “Liberation Day” levies were set to bite.

“I think we both wanted to make a deal,” the president said. “It’s going to bring us closer together. I think this deal will bring us very close together.”

Before announcing the agreement, both Trump and von der Leyen put the odds at making a deal at 50-50. The European leader had flown to Scotland to meet Trump at his Turnberry golf course, where the president spent the morning playing with son Eric.

“The starting point was an imbalance — a surplus on our side and a deficit on the US side,” the EU boss said when asked about the concessions Trump made. “And we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic.”

The sides also agreed to have zero-for-zero tariff rates on “a number of strategic products” such as aircraft and component parts, certain chemicals, certain generics, semiconductor equipment, specific agriculture products, natural resources and critical raw materials, according to von der Leyen.

Part of the arrangement also involved a European agreement to “purchase a vast amount of military equipment” from the US, though Trump noted, “We don’t know what that number is” yet.

Von der Leyen and Trump shook hands and commended each other on the deal.

European negotiators had sought to score a 10% tariff from the US, mirroring Trump’s baseline rate against foreign countries and the preliminary trade deal he inked with the United Kingdom in May.

One of the goals for Europe was to bring down US tariffs on automobile exports. Trump imposed a 27.5% rate on autos in April. The president predicted that American auto manufacturers and farmers would be among the happiest constituencies with the deal.

“I think maybe cars would be the one that would go the biggest, and the second would be agriculture, the farmers,” he said.

Before announcing the deal, Trump signaled that “pharmaceuticals won’t be part” of the deal he was negotiating because his administration is planning a more aggressive approach to reshore manufacturing in that sector. Pharmaceuticals are Europe’s largest export to the US. Trump threatened 200% tariffs on those products last month.

Trump also clarified that his steel and aluminum tariff policy is “staying the way it is,” meaning it would remain at the 50% worldwide rate that he announced in June.

The EU boss signaled plans to have a quota system on steel and aluminum, but didn’t elaborate.

Von der Leyen hailed Trump as a “tough negotiator and dealmaker.”

“And fair,” Trump interjected.

The EU boss also characterized negotiations with the US president as “very difficult” and acknowledged the visible tension between the two before they reached the agreement.

Republican lawmakers back home quickly heralded Trump’s deal with the Europeans as a significant victory.

“Another historic trade deal, another big win for America. President Trump is winning nonstop!” Rep. Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa) cheered.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who was part of Trump’s delegation, billed the deal as a significant breakthrough.

“President Trump just unlocked one of the biggest economies in the world,” he said in a statement. “The European Union is going to open its [$]20 Trillion dollar market and completely accept our auto and industrial standards for the first time ever.”

Stephen Miran, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, wagged his finger at traditional economists who doubted Trump could pull off 15% tariffs on the EU without significant retaliation.

“Wrong. You owe an apology to [the president]. Another huge failure for elite consensus,” he posted on X.

Rep. Michael Rulli (R-Ohio) hailed the preliminary trade deal as a “boost to the Ohio Valley economy.”

“With $750 billion in U.S. energy exports heading to Europe by 2028, our region stands to benefit directly from the new demand for American oil, natural gas, and coal,” Rulli told The Post.

“With the elimination of EU tariffs on U.S. industrial goods, the deal opens new markets for our producers, expands production, and cuts bureaucratic red tape, enabling businesses across the Ohio Valley to export and compete on a global scale,” he added. “This agreement unapologetically puts America First.”

Trump emphasized during his gaggle with reporters Sunday that he has no intention of delaying the Aug. 1 deadline before his customized “Liberation Day” tariffs take effect. The president previously moved that deadline twice.

So far, Trump has cut preliminary tariff deals with the UK, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines. The president teased that his team recently locked down another deal, but didn’t specify which country.

He also has a variety of tariffs in place now, such as a 25% rate on automobiles, aluminum and steel, as well as 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico that don’t comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He’s also recently mused about jacking up tariffs on the US’ two neighbors.

Trump has also reached a tariff truce with China and given Beijing an Aug. 12 deadline to cut a broader deal.

Earlier this month, he gave Moscow an ultimatum to cut a peace deal with neighboring Ukraine within 50 days or face 100% secondary tariffs on Russian energy — meaning levies imposed on countries that import from Russia.",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/108837231.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-07-28 19:03:51.526454

In contrast to strong global figures, the U.S. market is faltering.
Data from Cox Automotive shows that EV sales in the U.S. fell by 6.3% in the second quarter compared to Q2 2024, totaling 310,839 units.
Meanwhile, BYD reported a 16% increase in global deliveries and a 46% jump in battery-electric sales, overtaking Tesla in global BEV market share for the quarter.
At the same time, firms tied to Chinese or European supply chains might just continue to benefit from sustained global growth.","Tesla CEO Elon Musk has warned that the end of U.S. government support for electric vehicles could lead to “a few rough quarters,” following the automaker’s steepest revenue and delivery decline in more than a decade. Tesla is now relying on a long-promised affordable model and its autonomous ride-hailing roadmap to regain momentum, but immediate growth prospects look dim in the U.S. market.

The caution comes as global EV sales continue to rise. According to Rho Motion, 9.1 million EVs were sold worldwide in the first half of 2025, up 28% YoY. Not surprisingly, China led, with 5.5 million units, followed by Europe with 2 million. By contrast, North America added just 900,000 units, a modest 3% gain over last year, as reported by Electrek.

In contrast to strong global figures, the U.S. market is faltering. Data from Cox Automotive shows that EV sales in the U.S. fell by 6.3% in the second quarter compared to Q2 2024, totaling 310,839 units. This marked only the third quarterly year-on-year decline since EVs gained mainstream traction. Incentives remained high, averaging $8,500 per vehicle in June (nearly 15% of sticker price), but failed to spark additional demand.

Tesla’s global deliveries dropped to 384,122 vehicles in Q2, down 13.5% YoY, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, BYD reported a 16% increase in global deliveries and a 46% jump in battery-electric sales, overtaking Tesla in global BEV market share for the quarter.

General Motors delivered 46,280 EVs in Q2, more than doubling its volume from a year ago, and is now the second-largest EV seller in the U.S. Ford also increased sales but has slowed EV investment under the weight of cost pressures and revised capital priorities.

The U.S. policy environment is shifting rapidly. The “Big, Beautiful Bill”, signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month, eliminates the $7,500 federal EV tax credit as of October 1. It also ends credits for used EVs and home charger installations. Analysts expect a short-term Q3 bump from consumers rushing to claim benefits before the deadline, followed by a deeper Q4 slump, according to Reuters.

Infrastructure gaps are compounding demand risks. As of midyear, fewer than 400 fast-charging ports had been completed under the federal government’s $7.5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, far short of targets. Reuters notes that this shortfall could dampen adoption, especially outside metro areas.

Globally, momentum remains strong. China now accounts for more than 60% of global new energy vehicle output, aided by vertically integrated supply chains and steady model releases. In Europe, Chinese brands are gaining share despite new tariffs, offering low-cost BEVs that undercut traditional automakers.

For the energy sector, this divergence could bode ill. Utilities banking on rising EV-related electricity demand may need to revise projections downward. Battery producers that scaled up U.S. production could face excess capacity if demand softens. At the same time, firms tied to Chinese or European supply chains might just continue to benefit from sustained global growth.

Q3 may deliver a temporary lift in U.S. volumes, but this is now a fairly fragile game. Tesla’s ability to reposition with a lower-cost model, or make good on its robotaxi promises, will be the key thing to watch for observers looking to predict U.S. trajectory. Globally, EVs are increasingly embedded in the mainstream. But for now, the U.S. isn’t taking the lead. Instead, it’s barely managing to keep pace.

As AI (artificial intelligence) uses and bitcoin mining accelerate, their soaring energy demands and carbon footprint raise urgent concerns, not just about sustainability, but growing health concerns for those living in proximity to the data centers. This is beginning to highlight the need for greener technologies and policies to mitigate data center environmental impact on both the land and the living beings of rural areas.

This is the dilemma facing Colorado as it weighs whether to jump into the next economic “mining boom.” Are the trade-offs worth it?

In Part I, last Friday, Ark Valley Voice began to explore the reasons why rural America may rightfully worry about the growth of data centers. These included energy demand that is beginning to rely more and more on fossil-fuel-produced energy, the nebulous economic benefits said to come with data centers, massive pumping of precious groundwater, and finally, the very real but still unproven health impacts of exposure to industrial noise on humans and animals.

Energy and “Economic Mirage”

Data centers use massive amounts of energy, and that demand is already set to increase exponentially. Much like the historic mining days of the country, while these operations began with individual crypto “miners”, the industry is now dominated by multi-billion dollar companies with server farms the size of small towns.

The newest data centers coming online in the next year are said to require 20 times the amount of energy as those online today.

The typical bitcoin mining or AI data mining center is usually sited in a very rural area. Either within a massive windowless building or as individual metal boxes (think shipping container-type, like the image above). They house thousands upon thousands of computers that seem to run day and night.

While some states have been cautious in their approach to data centers, other states, primarily Republican-led or controlled, are going “gung-ho” into cryptocurrency mining. The cryptocurrency industry is actively attempting to influence state legislators in some states not to block their development. In others, they focus on exempting bitcoin miners from local zoning and noise ordinances. This past May, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed a “Bitcoin Rights” bill. It actually protects cryptocurrency companies from any future attempts to ban the industry in that state.

Would this be profits over people?

Not to be outdone, Texas is stepping into the AI and cryptocurrency field with both feet. It isn’t a difficult leap, given the state already has giant fossil-fuel-powered energy plants, a lax regulatory environment, and politicians who are already ultra-friendly with cryptocurrency.

According to a Time magazine in-depth report on the growth of data centers in Texas, that energy demand is increasingly being met by states reopening, or delaying the closure of coal-fired plants and natural-gas powered plants. So at a time when the country had been moving forward toward clean-energy solutions, the next generation of computing is relying more and more on fossil-fuel-produced energy.

Here in Colorado, with Governor Jared Polis’s “Roadmap to 100% Renewable Energy by 2040”, one might think that Colorado would cast a dim eye on the prospect of actually soliciting these massive data centers. But only recently, the governor was heard to raise the topic, noting that Colorado needs its share of this economic pie.

Colorado lawmakers responded with SB25-280 that, should it pass, would set up a 20-year tax incentive program designed to put the state on the map for large-scale data center development. It would offer sales and income tax credits to incentivize investments in data centers and upgrades to electric transmission infrastructure, beginning in 2026. A nonpartisan fiscal analysis estimates the tax breaks would initially cost the state about $17 million a year.

For areas of the state such as Pueblo, where the shutdown of Xcel Energy’s coal-fired Comanche Generating Station is leading them to a real tax revenue debacle, the prospect of attracting data centers may be seen as an economic lifeline. As reported in late April by Colorado Newsline: “To help the state meet its greenhouse gas emissions targets, Comanche’s final remaining 750-megawatt generating unit is now scheduled to be closed 40 years ahead of schedule in 2031, with a local tax revenue loss estimated at $25 million a year”.

Economic Realities at What Cost to the Environment?

In nearly every case, the rural areas in states where data centers have been pitched and built, were approached with a sales pitch of economic windfall and prosperity. While this message is often the route used by corporations to entice communities to cooperate, this has proved to be a mirage.

In Granbury, Texas, county leaders say “the owners promised local jobs and said that they would mostly use standard energy that would otherwise go unused. ” This, as it turns out, was massively untrue.

The economic realities of massive data centers are beginning to sink in, even in Texas. In June, 2024, Texas Governor Dan Patrick tweeted that Texans “will ultimately pay the price” for the growth of crypto and AI computing centers. He added they “produce very few jobs compared to the incredible demands they place on our [energy] grid.”

Among the environmental concerns is the impact of these crypto and AI data mining centers on groundwater. The 24/7 operations require massive amounts of water to keep the computers cool. Which makes locating them in Western states such as Colorado, Arizona, Utah, and California — all in a 20-plus year drought — somewhat ridiculous.

According to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE):

“The exact amount of water consumed by individual data centers is difficult to determine because there is very little data publicly available for research and analysis. Moreover, that water demand can be controversial, especially because of the negative impact that data centers can have on the communities in which they are built.

In The Dalles, Oregon, for example, a lengthy legal battle ultimately revealed that Google data centers in the region consumed more than 355 million gal. of water in 2021 — an amount that had tripled since 2016 — representing more than one-quarter of the town’s annual water consumption, according to the February 22, 2023, article “Google’s water use is soaring in The Dalles, records show, with two more data centers to come” on The Oregonian’s OregonLive website.

Collectively, data centers rank in the top 10 of “water-consuming industrial or commercial industries” in the U.S., according to a study led by Landon Marston, Ph.D., P.E., M.ASCE, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech. That study — “The environmental footprint of data centers in the United States,” published in May 2021 in the journal Environmental Research Letters — also noted that the data center industry “directly or indirectly draws water from 90 percent of U.S. watersheds.”

What is worse, according to a February 2022 Virginia Tech media advisory titled “Researcher explores how proliferating data centers affect water supply in the United States.”, it is estimated that 20 percent of those data centers “draw water from moderately to highly stressed watersheds in the western U.S.”

Wouldn’t it be considered critical, then, that data centers be required to use water as efficiently and productively as possible? Fresh water is a finite resource. Groundwater is a depleting resource. This is something not often acknowledged by data center operators.

Then, There are the Health Impacts

Again, there are analogies to the health impacts of the 19th century mining boom, when arsenic and heavy metals flooded streams and rivers, when massive piles of sludge built up near mines and toxic substances were spread far and wide in the rush to extract the gold, silver, copper, tin and lead.

These days, rural residents and local medical professionals living and working near these data mining centers say they are beset with health problems in numbers and percentages that don’t appear to be naturally occurring in sparsely populated areas. One example: In Granbury, Texas there are reports of high noise levels that appear to be causing cardiovascular damage, resulting in earaches, headaches, anxiety, deafness, vertigo, and nausea. People who live in the country for the rural lifestyle and quiet country life say their lives have been turned into an incessant nightmare of noise by data mining centers.

“Sonic damage is real,” noted an ENT doctor in Granbury, in a conversation with Time. His patients have clocked 72 decibel sound levels in bedrooms in the middle of the night, from area data mining center noise. “These people here, they’re good country folks, and bitcoin, to them, is almost a foreign, alien thing. The noise is detrimental to their health and anxiety.”

German cardiologist Dr. Thomas Munzel, a leader in the growing scientific research field of urban and industrial noise impacts on humans, agreed in an interview in Time. He calls a 70-90 decibel level of night noise “torture.” In one study, he exposed young, healthy students to a night level of noise at 63 decibels, and found that their vascular function diminished after just one single night. In another study, he found that nightly noise pollution can lead directly to heart failure and molecular changes in the brain.

It’s not just people, say some of those impacted; it’s animals as well. It is a known fact that many animals are known to be more sensitive to sounds, odors, vibrations, and other environmental impacts.

In that same small Texas community, dogs began going bald, developed extreme anxiety, and seizures. Animals began to run in circles. Others began hyperventilating for hours on end. Are these reactions due to the nearby data mining center? There is little scientific research on any of this — yet.

Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions study, natural gas is responsible for 61 percent of the power sector’s emissions reductions since 2005.

It offers a comprehensive analysis of the hidden tradeoffs involved in large-scale renewable energy deployment.","A report released in June by the Center of the American Experiment (CAE) details the myriad environmental and ecological downsides of the push to transform the American energy sector via the widespread adoption of “renewable” technologies such as wind and solar.

In Shattered Green Dreams: The Environmental Costs of Wind and Solar, CAE demonstrates the many tradeoffs that will be made if policymakers at the federal and state level pursue a transition away from energy generation from fossil fuels such as natural gas, oil, and coal in favor of these “renewable” sources.

“Every form of energy generation comes with its own set of challenges and benefits,” the report explains. “All renewable and hydrocarbon energy sources — wind and solar, hydropower, coal, natural gas, and nuclear — have environmental impacts. The mining of raw materials, manufacturing, and construction, the landscape footprints and ecological impacts of utility-scale wind and solar projects, and repowering and recycling costs must be considered. The negative impacts of wind and solar on the environment are too often overlooked. A wide variety and large quantity of minerals are used in solar panels, wind turbines, battery storage, transmission lines, and more. The U.S. currently sources most of its minerals from foreign countries that do not adhere to modern environmental or worker health and safety standards, which exacerbates environmental impacts that could be managed with domestic mining.”

One main problem the CAE report points out is the low energy density of wind and solar. In electricity generation, low energy density refers to a fuel or energy source that contains relatively little usable energy per unit of volume or mass. This means that more of the fuel or resource is needed—and more space and infrastructure is required—to generate the same amount of electricity as a high-energy-density source. As the CAE report points out, the land use footprint of wind and solar is “disproportionally large.”

According to CAE, “wind turbines and solar panels need at least 10 times as much land per unit of power produced as coal- or natural gas-fired power plants. To generate the same amount of electricity as a 1 GW nuclear plant, which occupies approximately 1.3 square miles, one would need between 45 and 75 square miles of solar panels or between 260 and 3,360 square miles of wind turbines. The latter is larger than the combined areas of Delaware and Rhode Island. If the U.S. relied entirely on wind turbines for electricity, it would need about twice the size of the state of California [to generate enough electricity to satisfy American needs.]”

Further, the shorter lifespans of these “renewable” technologies are compounding disposal challenges, leading to further environmental degradation. “Repowering and replacing wind turbines occurred at a median age of 10 years in 2021, motivated by financial reasons like requalifying for the federal Production Tax Credit,” CAE points out. “Only about 10 percent of solar panels are recycled today due to cost effectiveness, with U.S. solar panel waste expected to reach between seven and 10 million tons by 2050. Wind turbine blades, made of fiberglass or carbon fiber, are challenging and uneconomic to recycle, with 2.2 million tons likely to enter landfills by 2050. Wind turbines, solar panels, and batteries must also be disposed of or recycled correctly to avoid exposure to hazardous chemicals like lithium, silicon tetrafluoride, selenium, sulfur hexafluoride, lead, and cadmium.”

Another issue with the growing footprint of wind and solar farms is their detrimental impact on surrounding wildlife, of which there is mounting evidence. “The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration acknowledges that offshore wind poses risks to whales through exposure to noise, strikes from vessels, entanglement in marine debris, and changes to habitat,” the report notes. “Birds and bats, including some vulnerable species, are susceptible to collision with wind turbine blades as well as habitat loss, fragmentation, and displacement. Solar panels also cause bird and bat collisions in part due to the ‘lake effect,’ where reflective panels resemble bodies of water from afar.”

Despite the vaunting of wind and solar technology from certain circles, it is important to remember that much of the reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the United States is due to technological advances from the fossil fuel industry. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) latest annual U.S. Energy-Related Carbon Dioxide Emissions study, natural gas is responsible for 61 percent of the power sector’s emissions reductions since 2005.

Another study from researchers at Miami University in Ohio, published in the peer-reviewed journal Energy Economics in May, found that between 2007 and 2019, the fracking-induced shale boom was responsible for an average annual per capita reduction in CO2 emissions in the United States of 10.5 percent, as well as a 7.5 percent reduction in annual total GHG emissions.

“We find that the shale gas boom has played a pivotal role in reshaping the U.S. energy landscape, resulting in a greener economy,” the researchers conclude.

In January, the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory found the GHG-emission intensity of the country’s energy profile had decreased by 32 percent between 2017 and 2020.

“Energy policy should be driven by facts, not by surface-level assumptions,” the report concludes. “All forms of energy entail environmental impacts. An honest accounting of the negative impacts of wind, solar, and battery storage shows that they are far less than the unqualified good that proponents suggest. The material intensity, land use demands, and lifecycle challenges of wind and solar must be acknowledged by policymakers. Similarly, the scalability, reliability, and small land use footprints of coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear are substantial benefits.”

The oil and natural gas deposits found throughout the United States are abundant, affordable, and environmentally safe. Moreover, they can ensure the United States is the world’s largest energy producer well beyond the 21st century. Therefore, policymakers should refrain from placing unnecessary burdens on the natural gas and oil industries which positively impact state economies and are committed to safe, environmentally responsible extraction. Further, policymakers should take the environmental, ecological, and cost concerns raised by CAE’s report into account when debating on whether to promote wind and solar sources of energy. Finally, they should consult the Heartland Institute Policy Study, “How States Can Push Back Against the Destructive Expansion of Industrial Solar Power,” for a guide to prevent large-scale solar development in their home states.

The following documents provide more information about renewable energy, fossil fuels, and ESG.

Shattered Green Dreams: The Environmental Costs of Wind and Solar This report from the Center of the American Experiment warns that the environmental costs of wind, solar, and battery storage are routinely underestimated in public policy discussions, while the benefits of conventional energy sources such as nuclear, natural gas, oil, and coal are increasingly ignored. It offers a comprehensive analysis of the hidden tradeoffs involved in large-scale renewable energy deployment. Contrary to popular perception, the report argues that wind and solar power are not environmentally benign, and their widespread adoption entails significant ecological and material costs.

How States Can Push Back Against the Destructive Expansion of Industrial Solar Power

This Heartland Institute Policy Study summarizes the myriad problems associated with industrial solar expansion—and the reliance upon solar energy more generally—and concludes with a set of concrete solutions policymakers should consider to protect their states.

Clearing the Air: Honest Truths about Green Energy

This report from the American Consumer Institute details many of the environmental impacts associated with the so-called green energy forms being heavily promoted. The life cycles of all three—the wind turbine, solar panel, and EV battery—involve significant environmental consequences that should not be overlooked and need to be part of the discussion when implementing energy policies.

The 100 Percent Renewable Energy Myth

This Policy Brief from the Institute for Energy Research argues that a countrywide 100 percent renewable plan would put the U.S. economy in jeopardy. The brief investigates the intermittency, land requirements, capacity factors, and cost of transition and construction materials that limit the ability of the U.S. to adapt to 100 percent renewable energy.

How the Green New Deal’s Renewable Energy Mining Would Harm Humans and the Environment

In this Heartland Institute Policy Brief, Paul Driessen, senior policy advisor with the Committee For a Constructive Tomorrow, argues expanding mining on the scale needed to meet the renewable energy requirements contained in the Green New Deal and other proposed renewable energy mandates would cause unimaginable harm to the environment, wildlife, and humans.

Stein has vetoed? - WUNC,"Colin Campbell, www.wunc.org, colin-campbell",,,,,https://www.wunc.org/politics/2025-07-28/veto-tracker-legislature-override-stein-vetoed,"On nine of the 14 bills, at least one House Democrat voted in favor of the controversial legislation initially.
Rep. Carla Cunningham was the lone Democrat to support the House bill, but she – and all her fellow Democrats – opposed the Senate bill.
He says it would allow for more puppy mills, but 17 House Democrats voted yes on the combined bill.
Stein says the power shift is unconstitutional and weakens school accountability, but eight House Democrats voted yes.
LGBTQ restrictions and school library regulations (House Bill 805): This bill began as a bipartisan House measure to create consent regulations for pornographic websites.","Both the N.C. House and Senate have scheduled override votes Tuesday on the 14 vetoes issued by the governor over the past month.

Senate Republicans have a veto-proof majority, and Senate leader Phil Berger voiced confidence last week that he’ll have his caucus present for successful override votes this week. Seven of the vetoed bills began in the Senate and therefore will get their first override vote from that chamber, before going to the House for a final vote.

The House is where things will get interesting, as Republicans are one vote short of a veto-proof majority this year. Whether Speaker Destin Hall succeeds in overriding vetoes will depend on whether at least one Democrat crosses party lines – or if there are enough absences to get the required three-fifths majority of members present and voting.

On nine of the 14 bills, at least one House Democrat voted in favor of the controversial legislation initially. To successfully block them from becoming law, Stein will need to convince multiple Democrats to change their minds on legislation they’d previously voted for. That’s happened in the past under former Gov. Roy Cooper.

If Democrats stay together, Hall will need to wait for absences. He can keep the bills on the calendar through a technique known as the “veto garage,” and then call for a vote at any point when enough Democrats are absent. That could happen anytime between this week and when the two-year session concludes at the end of 2026.

Here’s a full list of the vetoed bills on the agenda this week, and which (if any) Democrats supported them:

Concealed handgun permits (Senate Bill 50): Stein and Democrats are strongly opposed to this proposed repeal of the state’s requirement for permits and background checks for people who want to carry a concealed gun in public. Two House Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing the bill – Reps. William Brisson and Ted Davis – creating an additional challenge for the GOP on an override vote.

Immigration enforcement mandates (Senate Bill 153 and House Bill 318): These bills would require North Carolina law enforcement agencies to align more closely with federal immigration enforcement agencies. The House bill expands on a previous law requiring sheriffs to comply with ICE detainers, while the Senate bill would allow for lawsuits against communities with immigration “sanctuary” policies and block government benefits to people in the country illegally. Rep. Carla Cunningham was the lone Democrat to support the House bill, but she – and all her fellow Democrats – opposed the Senate bill.

Squatters and pet shops (House Bill 96): Yes, that’s one bill. The governor says he likes the attempt to make it easier to evict squatters from private homes, but he opposes a last-minute addition that would ban local restrictions on pet shops. He says it would allow for more puppy mills, but 17 House Democrats voted yes on the combined bill.

Duke Energy’s carbon reduction mandate (Senate Bill 266): Stein says the bill that would eliminate an interim carbon dioxide emissions reduction goal for Duke Energy would make power bills increase. Eleven House Democrats, however, joined Republicans in reaching the opposite conclusion and voted for the legislation.

Charter school oversight (Senate Bill 254): This one would shift some oversight responsibilities for charter schools from the State Board of Education (mostly appointed by the governor) to the Charter School Review Board (mostly appointed by the legislature). Stein says the power shift is unconstitutional and weakens school accountability, but eight House Democrats voted yes.

Guns in private schools (House Bill 193): Rep. Shelly Willingham, D-Edgecombe, was the only Democrat who voted to allow trained staff and volunteers to carry concealed weapons on private school property with permission from school administrators.

Expanding the state auditor’s powers (House Bill 549): Willingham was also the only Democratic “yes” vote on a measure that will allow the state auditor to access the records of any private business or nonprofit that receives state or federal funds. Stein says that change could harm the state’s business recruitment efforts.

Banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs and policies (Senate Bills 558 – higher education, Senate Bill 227 – K-12 schools and House Bill 171 – state government): The trio of bills would ban all DEI programs and policies from public education and state agencies, but the legislation passed without a single vote from Democrats.

Enacting “donor privacy” measures (Senate Bill 416): This bill would ban government agencies from collecting or releasing information about donors to nonprofit organizations, but Stein says it would result in more dark money influencing politics. Three Democrats – Reps. Willingham, Charles Smith and Carla Cunningham – voted in favor of the measure.

LGBTQ restrictions and school library regulations (House Bill 805): This bill began as a bipartisan House measure to create consent regulations for pornographic websites. But the Senate added a variety of controversial provisions: Allowing lawsuits against medical providers over gender transitions, changing the definition of biological sex in state law to exclude gender identity, and requiring schools to provide parents with a list of school library books with an option to ban their children from checking out specific titles. Only one Democrat voted for the bill: Rep.

Federal environmental regulators have announced a plan to clean up toxic chemicals at a former Sherwin-Williams site in Gibbsboro, New Jersey.

For decades, the paint manufacturer dumped burnt paints and solvents, which contaminated local waterways, groundwater and soil — including on residential properties — with arsenic, lead and other metals.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency added the property to the federal National Priorities List in 2008, making it eligible for funding and cleanup under the Superfund program. The site includes three Camden County locations in Gibbsboro and Voorhees, where Sherwin-Williams manufactured, dumped and burned paint and related compounds.

The agency’s latest remediation proposal includes injecting organic materials and nutrients into the ground to spur the growth of naturally occurring bacteria to break down toxic chemicals.

“We are already addressing much of the source of the contamination in this groundwater and this plan moves us one step closer to a full cleanup,” said EPA Regional Administrator Mike Martucci in a statement. “Cleaning up sites like this provides great health and economic benefits to communities and Superfund cleanups are at the core of EPA’s work to provide clean air, land and water for everyone.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sherwin-Williams-Hilliards-Creek-Superfund-site-new-jersey-file.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 19:03:25.898432

Earlier this year, Kia’s electric van was caught charging at a station in Indiana.
The PV5 Passenger model was spotted by Automotive Validation Engineer Chris Higa (@Chrisediting) while testing in Arizona.
View this post on Instagram A post shared by KindelAuto (@kindelauto) There’s no denying that’s Kia’s electric van, but it doesn’t necessarily confirm it will launch in the US.","The PV5 is already available in several markets, but will Kia launch it in the US? After Kia’s electric van was spotted testing in the US again, a US debut could be in the works.

Is Kia’s electric van coming to the US?

Kia launched the PV5, the first dedicated electric van from its new Platform Beyond vehicle (PBV) business, in South Korea and Europe earlier this year, promising it will roll out in “other global markets” in 2026.

Will that include the US? Earlier this year, Kia’s electric van was caught charging at a station in Indiana. Photos and a video sent to Electrek by Alex Nguyen confirmed it was, in fact, the PV5.

Kia has yet to say if it will sell the PV5 in the US, likely due to the Trump Administration’s new auto tariffs. All electric vans, or PBVs, including the PV5, will be built at Kia’s Hwaseong plant in South Korea, which means they will face a stiff 25% tariff as imports.

Following another sighting, a US debut cannot be ruled out. The PV5 Passenger model was spotted by Automotive Validation Engineer Chris Higa (@Chrisediting) while testing in Arizona.

There’s no denying that’s Kia’s electric van, but it doesn’t necessarily confirm it will launch in the US. But it could make sense.

Despite record first-half sales in the US, Kia’s EV sales have fallen significantly. Sales of the EV9 and EV6 are nearly 50% less than in the first half of 2024.

To be fair, part of it is due to the new model year changeover, but Kia is also doubling down on the US market by boosting local production. Earlier this year, Kia said the EV6 and EV9 are now in full-scale production at its West Point, GA, facility.

The PV5 Passenger (shown above) is available in Europe with two battery pack options: 51.5 kWh or 71.2 kWh, rated with WLTP ranges of 179 miles and 249 miles, respectively. The Cargo variant has the same battery options but offers a WLTP range of either 181 miles or 247 miles.

During its PV5 Tech Day event last week, Kia revealed plans for seven PV5 body types, including an Open Bed (similar to a pickup), a Light Camper, and even a luxury “Prime” passenger model.

Kia is set to begin deliveries of the PV5 Passenger and Cargo Long variants in South Korea next month, followed by Europe and other global markets, starting in Q4 2025. As for a US launch, we will have to wait for the official word from Kia.

Knoblauch,,,,,https://earthjustice.org/article/how-maryland-is-taking-climate-action-into-its-own-hands-while-cutting-energy-bills,"For Marylanders and others around the country facing skyrocketing energy prices and increasingly extreme weather, Maryland’s new clean energy law shows a better path forward.

We won’t stop until we electrify everything and deliver the 100% clean energy future that we all deserve.
Transitioning to clean energy shouldn’t just mean more wind turbines and solar panels for a select few.
Everyone has a right to healthier air, a more stable climate, and good jobs driven by clean energy.","With rising energy costs and increasingly extreme weather events, who wouldn’t want an $80 rebate on their electric bill right now? Even better, how about new protections to help prevent future bill increases and temper the climate crisis?

That’s the promise of Maryland’s new Next Generation Energy Act, a sweeping clean energy and affordability package whose passage earlier this year comes after smart, sustained legal advocacy by Earthjustice.

The new law includes provisions to prevent Marylanders from paying for unnecessary gas pipelines, utility lobbying, and the infrastructure for big data centers in their energy bills, all while growing clean energy storage in the state. It’s also the latest big win in Earthjustice’s Right To Zero (RTZ) campaign — a state-by-state advocacy effort to electrify vehicles and buildings and run them all on 100% clean energy, no matter who’s in federal office.

For Marylanders and others around the country facing skyrocketing energy prices and increasingly extreme weather, Maryland’s new clean energy law shows a better path forward. But to ensure this must-pass legislation offered the best possible outcome for utility customers and the climate when it was first introduced, it needed an advocate. One who could look at the elaborate web of cords that is state energy policy and know how to untangle them.

Earthjustice knew just the right person for the job.

An Advocate Who’s Been on the Inside

As a legal advisor to the nation’s top energy regulators, Earthjustice attorney Susan Stevens Miller has seen firsthand how decisionmakers determine how we all power our lives — and whether it’s with clean or dirty energy.

For almost two decades, Miller worked on some of the energy sector’s most complex challenges while serving in the General Counsel’s Office at the Maryland Public Service Commission and at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Her job involved everything from keeping energy reliable and affordable to cleaning up massive messes like the Enron energy scandal.

In the late 1990s, a new challenge arose, this time around the public’s growing push to switch to clean energy to tackle climate change.

While Miller was excited about a clean energy transition, most energy utilities and the agencies who regulated them — including her employers — weren’t on board. Eventually, Miller joined Earthjustice and its new Right To Zero campaign. Key venues for this state-based clean energy transition work are public utility commissions (like the one that Miller worked for in Maryland), which are tasked with making sure energy is safe, reliable, and affordable for the public.

As one of Earthjustice’s first RTZ hires, it wasn’t long before Miller once again began shaping energy policy. Only this time, she was advocating directly for the people. One day, she might be convincing energy regulators that they have the authority to force utilities to clean up their power supply. The next day, she’s urging lawmakers to pass legislation that give those regulators even more authority to act. In addition, Miller also often works with various stakeholders on behalf of the governor to determine how Maryland can best achieve its electric car and truck goals.

“This multi-pronged approach ensures that all the key players are involved,” says Miller. “It’s vital to our success and can be replicated in any state.”

A Winning Strategy

While the Trump administration is doing everything it can to stymie the clean energy transition, Earthjustice’s Right To Zero campaign is making clean energy progress in the states while also beating back Trump’s federal attacks. We won’t stop until we electrify everything and deliver the 100% clean energy future that we all deserve. We know the health of our planet — and every living thing that calls it home — depends on our success.

In California, where RTZ began in 2017, we’ve scored several wins that are transforming the energy sector and serving as the North Star for our growing zero emissions work. This includes legislation to shift California’s energy grid entirely off fossil fuels by 2045, as well as new rules to electrify public transit buses, cars, and boats. Most recently, we pushed California to pass groundbreaking legislationthat will lower utility bills and help the state plan for an electric future for homes and buildings.

Around the country, we’re pushing other states to supercharge their own clean energy transitions. In New York, for example, we’re utilizing the state’s cutting edge climate law to protect a NYC policy that cleans up climate pollution by electrifying large buildings. And in Colorado, utility giant Xcel Energy will spend over $252 million over the next four years on beneficial electrification programs as a result of our ongoing litigation efforts.

Building on this success, Earthjustice’s Midwest office launched its RTZ campaign in 2025 and is focusing first on advancing clean transportation in Illinois. Our work has included supporting advocacy for the state to adopt emissions standards that drive vehicle electrification and efforts to curb air pollution from freight activity.

Energy for Everyone

One of the keys to successfully pushing for clean energy policies across the country and in different political climates, says Miller, is to make sure that they provide multiple benefits to multiple people. Transitioning to clean energy shouldn’t just mean more wind turbines and solar panels for a select few. Everyone has a right to healthier air, a more stable climate, and good jobs driven by clean energy.

“Receiving the benefits of clean energy shouldn’t depend on where a person lives,” says Miller. “Ultimately, this growing multi-state effort is designed to ensure that no one is left behind.”",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/maryland-state-house-spartana-photography.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 19:03:02.180044

The deal led to a jump in share prices for some liquefied natural gas companies, although overall market reaction from the energy sector was muted.

Even though $750 billion is a big promise — it’s unclear how much the EU-U.S. energy relationship is really changing.

Europe’s promise to buy $250 billion dollars in U.S. energy every year for the next three years is more of a renewal of vows than a first date. The U.S. and EU got serious about energy after the invasion of Ukraine, said Matthew Zaragoza-Watkins at the University of California, Davis.

“When sanctions were imposed on Russian imports of natural gas and coal, the U.S., as a swing or sort of high-cost supplier of bituminous coal, stepped up and started exporting a lot more bituminous coal to Europe, essentially filling a lot of the void that was left over,” said Zaragoza-Watkins. “The same is true in LNG.”

So $250 billion a year, which more than doubles the size of existing U.S. energy exports to Europe.

“It's not feasible,” said Gregory Brew, a senior analyst at Eurasia Group.

Too much, too soon. But even if it’s exaggerated, Brew said, the announcement does solidify a growing energy relationship — especially around natural gas.

“LNG exporters are confident this is a sign to them that they're going to continue to get access to this market, that it's not going to be disrupted by tariffs or other potential trade disputes,” said Brew.

U.S. liquefied natural gas export capacity is expected to roughly double in the next five years according to S&P Global Commodity Insights — in part driven by European demand. So, this commitment from Europe could help some of those pending projects get financing.

“It does signify maybe a more firm commitment for EU member nations to actually purchase longer term supply,” said Tom Seng at Texas Christian University. “They've really been more in the short-term marketplace.”

This also means employment opportunities down the road.

“From a job creation standpoint, you're still looking largely at Louisiana and Texas,” Seng said.

“By establishing a streamlined permitting process, rolling back costly regulations and restoring certainty to federal leasing, this legislation ushers in a new era of American energy dominance,” TIPRO President Ed Longanecker said from Austin. “As the epicenter of oil and natural gas, many of these changes will directly impact Texas’ operators and the expansion of energy infrastructure projects to meet growing demand.

“TIPRO applauds the leadership of elected officials in Washington, D.C., who support the oil and natural gas industry and are taking action to advance consequential policy.”

Longanecker said Congress will now turn its attention to reforming the nation’s complicated and outdated permitting system.

“Although comprehensive permitting reform remains elusive, there are bipartisan discussions taking place about trying to find a compromise on this important issue,” he said. “TIPRO has engaged with various stakeholders and members of the Texas Congressional Delegation to encourage action on this strategic imperative.

“Without it, America’s energy sector, particularly oil and natural gas, cannot operate at the pace or scale needed to meet domestic needs, support allies abroad or ensure long-term affordability for consumers.”

For too long, Longanecker said, federal infrastructure approvals have languished in bureaucratic limbo with critical energy projects being delayed by years due to duplicative reviews, inconsistent agency coordination and open-ended legal challenges.

“Take pipelines for example,” he said. “These are the arteries of our energy system, carrying oil and natural gas to homes, businesses, refineries and ports.

“Yet under current law a single pipeline project can face five or more years of environmental analysis before a shovel even hits the ground. LNG export terminals, essential for providing our allies in Europe and Asia with alternatives to Russian or Iranian gas, face similar delays.”

Longanecker said these bottlenecks don’t just stifle job creation and investment, they cede market share to competitors like Qatar and Russia who can move faster.

“Permitting paralysis has real-world consequences,” he said. “American families feel it at the gas pump.

“Manufacturers see it in elevated energy costs and communities watch opportunity pass them as they wait for the economic benefits of infrastructure development including jobs, tax revenue and improved local services.”

In addition the coming AI revolution with the need to power massive data centers across the country will further drive the need for American natural gas, Longanecker said.

“When domestic production is throttled, imports from less regulated producers fill the gap, increasing global emissions and undermining U.S. environmental standards,” he said. “Reform doesn’t mean eliminating oversight.

“It means making it smarter. It means setting clear deadlines for environmental reviews, designating a lead agency for coordination and limiting frivolous lawsuits that aim to block rather than improve projects.”

Longanecker said these changes would bring needed predictability to a sector that plans capital projects years in advance and must navigate complex technical, legal and financial challenges.

“For the oil and natural gas industry, comprehensive permitting reform is not a ‘nice to have,’ it is mission critical,” he said. “It unlocks investment, accelerates innovation, strengthens national security and ensures that the United States remains a reliable energy partner to the world.

“At a time when energy reliability and affordability are top concerns for working Americans, Congress must deliver on this long-overdue reform.

Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around $3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics — dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing — such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries — and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.

Ironically, in doing so, these record sales have started to overload service centers. According to a new survey by CDK Global, EV service times were up over the same period in 2023.

In good news for Tesla Model S, Model Y and Model 3 owners though, the study claims they were more likely to have issues resolved in just one visit compared with owners of other EVs.

Turns Out Tesla Services Actually Are Quicker

While most dealerships recommend that a new electric vehicle only needs a service visit after one year, 85% of owners polled had visited their dealer at some point within the first 12 months. This, despite the simpler systems of EVs requiring less maintenance versus internal-combustion counterparts. Of this figure, less than half – 40% – could get a same-day appointment. That’s far from panic-inducing, but it’s interesting to note that this is still a sharp rise over the 28% recorded in 2023. Moreover, 14% of those polled had to wait up to three days for an appointment with their official dealership, compared to 9% last year.

Now, more good news for the Tesla owners out there. An encouraging 71% of owners polled stated that the issue with their vehicle was resolved on the first visit, compared with ‘just’ 65% of non-Tesla EV owners. Of that figure, 52% claimed that the issue was resolved in two visits, but almost a fifth (21%) stated it took up to five visits for the problem to be rectified. Moreover, non-Tesla owners found that they waited longer for their EVs to be serviced than Tesla owners, though it should be noted that EV services still take longer on average than an ICE model.

It’s Not All Bad News Though…

If that all reads like doom and gloom for non-Tesla owners, it really shouldn’t. Just 13% of the owners polled, for example, claimed that they had to pay in-full for their service, with the majority stating the costs were covered by warranty (all the more impressive when you consider that only 16% of these were recall issues). Furthermore, over half of non-Tesla owners (53%) found that their service costs were less than that of the world’s most famous EV brand. It was also found that mobile service and pickup/delivery programs were more readily available last year compared with 2023.

Though a significant amount of CDK’s 2025 EV Ownership Study was dedicated to EV servicing and maintenance, owners were also quizzed on charging protocol and motivating factors behind their purchase, among other subjects.

SABIC Innovative Plastics in Posey County ranks sixth for most toxic releases in the state. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, the company has violated clean air laws for the past three years — emitting too many chemicals like volatile organic compounds, which can make it difficult to breathe and some can cause cancer.

While SABIC releases about 4 million pounds of toxic chemicals every year, medical device manufacturer Cook Group Inc. in Monroe County releases only a handful. But the chemical it emits — ethylene oxide — is so toxic that residents nearby have some of the highest risk for cancer from air pollution in the state.

The Trump administration invited facilities across the country to apply for exemptions to air pollution rules. Companies had to explain why technology to comply with the Biden-era rules isn't available and how complying would threaten national security.

Advocates said these regulations are already a compromise between the EPA and industry — so it's unlikely the technology to reduce pollution under the rules isn't available.

In a statement, Cook said it still intends to comply with the rule despite getting the exemption.

""A majority of commercial sterilizing companies requested an extension because the supply chain for the needed materials and monitoring equipment was uncertain. For example, some technologies required for these changes are from a single-source supplier, which means there's only one company providing this technology.

By going online and taking the ""Habitat Connectivity Pledge,” Caldie believes Bloomington residents can inspire one another to participate in the conservation of the environment.","Early this July, Bloomington’s Geographic Information’s Department released an interactive Habitat Connectivity Map. Along with the city’s Habitat Connectivity Plan, the interactive map seeks to promote environmental conservation through bio-diversity.

The map functions around three main “priority greenspace areas”, defined by The Habitat Connectivity Plan as areas “contributing to plant and animal habitat, ecological diversity, healthy air, soil, water, reductions in energy use, and climate change mitigation.”

The three main priority greenspaces in Bloomington are Griffy Lake, Clear Creek, and Jackson Creek. Around these areas, the map aims to highlight nearby geological features like Potential Corridor Links, which are areas that provide connection for organisms to priority greenspace areas. According to Environmental Commission Vice Chair Matt Caldie, corridors are key in the conservation of the enviroment.

“When we as a city develop land, we fragment the habitat for area plants and animals,” Caldie said, “Some creatures – like maybe a hawk – can make it past our roads and buildings to another area of habitat, but other creatures – such as a grasshopper – might have to stay where they are. Corridors are essentially landscape features that allow for the movement of organisms between areas of habitat.”

Individuals can mark existing or new habitat corridors, as well as native and invasive species in the area by making a pledge signaled by a diamond on the map. Users are able to add areas as specific as their backyard as greenspaces in the connected environment.

The map, which can be found on their website , lets individuals mark their own participation, but also seeks to inspire by showing other contributions by members of the community. This element excites the Environmental Commission:the ability for citizens to visualize their community interacting with the local area.

“The map may help encourage folks to take action in environmental stewardship and even see the contributions in their own neighborhoods,” Senior Environmental Planner Rachael Johnson said in an interview.

“As residents add their pledges to the map, we hope to see the diamonds representing the pledges start to look like bridges between those priority greenspaces,” Caldie added.

By going online and taking the ""Habitat Connectivity Pledge,” Caldie believes Bloomington residents can inspire one another to participate in the conservation of the environment.

“Sometimes it feels like individuals can’t do much for the environment, but with a map full of participants, it becomes clear that we can accomplish a lot collectively,” he said. “So I hope it serves as a motivator, because as people see the environmental stewardship of others, it may empower them to do more and to share that energy (and the map) with friends, neighbors, or coworkers.”",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/ids/287fff22-b0dc-4726-a231-817a3e4b8365.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-07-28 17:05:38.620653

A Duke University analysis released Monday says North Carolina households could pay up to $23 billion more for energy bills through 2050 if lawmakers scrap the state’s near‑term climate target.

""What we are finding fairly consistently is the increase in vulnerability and growth in risk to fluctuating gas prices that would really hit ratepayers quite directly in their electricity bills, both from household levels to commercial levels,"" said Jackson Ewing, co-author of the study and director of energy and climate policy at the Nicholas Institute of Energy, Environment & Sustainability at Duke University.

The finding lands just as the General Assembly prepares to vote on whether to overturn Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of Senate Bill 266.

The measure, passed by Republican majorities in June and vetoed by the Democratic governor on July 2, would erase a 70% carbon‑reduction goal set for 2030, allow Duke Energy bill customers in advance for power plants not yet built, and shift more fuel‑price risk onto residential ratepayers.

What the new research says

Economists at Duke’s Nicholas Institute modeled what happens if utilities lean more heavily on natural‑gas plants after the 70% benchmark disappears. Under gas‑price scenarios they consider plausible, total fuel spending would rise by as much as $23 billion over the next quarter‑century, or roughly $13 billion in today’s dollars.

The study comes on the heels of two other studies:

- BW Research, in a report last week for clean‑energy nonprofits, projects that slower growth in solar, wind and battery projects would mean about 50,700 fewer power‑sector jobs each year between 2030 and 2035 and $47.2 billion in lost investment.

- North Carolina State University researchers, in a June brief, found that increased gas use could expose customers to similar long‑term price shocks.

“This study reaffirms the cost risks to North Carolina households, expenses that are risk‑free to the utilities and passed directly on to customer bills,” said Will Scott, Southeast climate and energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund.

The cost impact debate

Opponents argue the bill shifts risk from shareholders to families and could leave residents paying for unfinished projects, pointing to South Carolina’s abandoned VC Summer nuclear plant, which saddled customers with $9 billion in charges when construction collapsed. Stein has said the measure “shifts the cost of electricity from large industrial users onto the backs of regular people.”

Latonia Holbrooks, a ratepayer and mother of three in Charlotte, said Monday that the bill is bad for the environment and that Duke Energy's financial burden should not land on ratepayers' shoulders. ""I don't know why they think we can afford to pay for their costs, because I can barely afford to pay the electric bill already,"" Holbrooks said.

Republican sponsors see it differently. Rep. Dean Arp, R‑Union, calls SB 266 “written in a way to explicitly save ratepayers dollars.” Senate leader Phil Berger, R‑Rockingham, has pegged potential savings at $15 billion and accused Stein of blocking “affordable power” to advance climate priorities. The conservative John Locke Foundation says the bill strikes a sensible balance between environmental goals and economic growth.

Duke Energy, which supplies power to most of the state, supports the legislation. Lobbyist Ryan Minto told lawmakers last month that the company is “committed to powering our state’s continued success while keeping costs as low as possible for our customers.”

How SB 266 would work

- Repeals the 70% emissions‑reduction target while leaving a 2050 carbon‑neutral mandate intact.

- Authorizes construction work in progress (CWIP), allowing Duke to charge customers for new gas or nuclear plants before those facilities come online.

- Revises the fuel‑cost recovery formula in a way critics say would push a larger share of volatility onto residential bills.

What happens next

Republicans hold the three‑fifths supermajorities needed to override the veto, but absences or defections could change the outcome.

If the veto is overturned, Duke Energy could revisit its long‑term resource plan later this year, potentially extending coal‑plant retirements and adding gas capacity.

While “grid modernization” does not have a universally accepted definition, the report’s authors said they considered it to include legislative and regulatory actions addressing:

smart grid and advanced metering infrastructure,

utility business model reform,

regulatory reform,

utility rate reform,

energy storage,

microgrids, and

demand response.

Because 2025 is an odd year, every state had a bill session this past spring. Almost 300 bills that lawmakers introduced were related to grid modernization, the report noted. The most common state action related to grid action during Q2 2025 involved energy storage deployment (77), followed by overall utility business model reforms (37), smart-grid technology deployment (35), interconnection rules (34) and performance-based regulation (38), according to the report.

“This quarter, there was widespread effort to apply technologies to overcome grid issues,” said Vincent Potter, project manager at NCCETC. “Policymakers ordered utilities to integrate – or at least consider – alternative and emerging technologies like energy storage, grid-enhancing technologies, and non-wires alternatives when planning for their transmission and distribution systems.”

State policy developments

According to the report, Virginia’s mandate requiring Dominion Energy to develop a 450 MW virtual power plant pilot was the most notable policy development for grid modernization made during Q2 2025. The bill, which was signed into law by Gov. Glenn Youngkin in May, requires the State Corporation Commission to begin developing a permanent program after the pilot ends.

Other notable policy developments included:

New Jersey regulators launching new energy storage incentive program;

State agencies in Maine and Virginia releasing performance-based regulation studies;

Connecticut and Maryland regulators proposing distribution system planning rules; and

The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission declining to pursue implementation of its advanced rate design.

Grid modernization trends

State lawmakers implemented rules governing microgrid deployment, the report said. For example, Oregon lawmakers passed legislation to allow municipalities, businesses and communities to build, own and operate microgrids. West Virginia signed a bill into law to ease restrictions on microgrid development in hopes to attract more data centers to the state.

Several states also passed bills to mandate energy storage procurement. New Jersey, for example, passed a bill ordering the Board of Public Utilities to offer incentives for 1,000 MW of transmission-connected energy storage, which currently awaits the governor’s signature. Hawaii signed a bill into law ordering the Public Utilities Commission to develop tariffs for various distributed generation programs, which must include riders for energy storage.

States also passed legislation for integrating technology requirements into planning processes for distribution and transmission systems, the report said. For example, Maine’s governor signed two bills into law to align regulatory reviews of grid-enhancing technologies with integrated resource planning and to use utility grid plans when procuring energy storage or considering advanced transmission technologies.

NCCETC is a public service center administered by the College of Engineering at North Carolina State University, with a mission to advance a sustainable energy economy by educating, demonstrating and providing support for clean energy technologies, practices, and policies.

Calumet Shreveport clarified where challenges to certain US Environmental Protection Agency actions under the Clean Air Act must be filed. The Court split the difference between competing interpretations of the act’s venue provision, holding that EPA’s decision denying small-refinery exemptions under the renewable fuel standard program must be reviewed in the DC Circuit, rather than in regional courts such as the Fifth Circuit, because the action was “nationwide in scope or effect.”

At the same time, the Court rejected broader readings that would have sent any decision related to the renewable fuel standard (RFS) to the DC Circuit. And, in a decision issued simultaneously in another case before the Court, the Court reaffirmed that EPA’s approval of state implementation plans (SIPs) is a regional issue properly reviewed in local circuits.

The decision resolves a split among the circuits and provides some guidance regarding the Clean Air Act’s (CAA’s) venue rules, but significant questions remain about how lower courts will apply the decision under different circumstances.

CAA VENUE FRAMEWORK

The CAA contains a provision governing judicial review of EPA actions under the act. Challenges must be brought in the DC Circuit if the EPA action is “nationally applicable.” Challenges generally must be brought in the appropriate regional court if the action is “locally or regionally applicable.” But there is a third clause that often creates confusion: even if an action is not nationally applicable, it must still be reviewed in the DC Circuit if it is “based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.”

EPA V. CALUMET SHREVEPORT

Calumet involved consolidated challenges to EPA’s decision denying a large set of small-refinery exemptions under 42 USC § 7545(o)(9), which allows certain eligible refiners to avoid complying with the RFS program’s requirements to blend volumes of renewable fuel into refined petroleum fuels.

Those small-refinery exemptions would have applied to individual refineries, which are located across the country, including in states within the jurisdiction of the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Yet, EPA issued one decision document for all refineries collectively, basing its reasoning on nationwide considerations including macroeconomic factors that affect the ability of refiners to pass on their costs.

The refiners challenged the EPA’s small-refinery exemption decision in various regional circuit courts. After the US government argued that the DC Circuit was the appropriate venue, most of the regional circuits agreed and transferred, but the Fifth Circuit kept the petitions filed there and ruled in favor of the refiners on the merits. The government and biofuels intervenors petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari.

SUPREME COURT’S REASONING

In an opinion written by Justice Thomas, the 7-2 majority of the Court held that EPA’s denial of the small-refinery exemptions must be reviewed in the DC Circuit due to the decision being “based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.”

The Court first held that for an EPA action to be “based on” a determination of nationwide scope and effect, such an issue must “lie[] at the core of the agency action” and “form[] the primary explanation for and driver of EPA’s action.”

Applying that standard, the Court closely examined EPA’s rationale for its decision. EPA explained it had denied the small-refinery exemption petitions largely based on its understanding of national market dynamics—namely how renewable identification numbers, the compliance credits under the RFS, function in a national fuel marketplace. The Court found that decision was fundamentally based on broad economic assumptions with nationwide consequences and as such held that venue was proper in the DC Circuit.

However, the Court rejected that more aggressive interpretations would have effectively routed any decision related to the RFS program to the DC Circuit. For example, the Court was not persuaded that the fact that the RFS program establishes a nationwide standard for blending renewable fuel into gasoline and diesel fuel was enough to make all decisions regarding small-refinery exemptions or other aspects of the program “nationwide” in “scope or effect.”

In a separate case argued the same day, Oklahoma v. EPA, the Court unanimously held that challenges to approval of a SIP under the CAA belonged in the Tenth Circuit. The Court noted that SIPs involve state-level environmental planning and are implemented locally.

THE DISSENT

Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Roberts, argued in dissent that the majority’s “reasoning-based” test could prove unworkable in practice. The dissenters expressed concern that agencies often advance multiple or ambiguous justifications for their decisions and contended that it would be difficult and inefficient for litigants to divine not just what the EPA did, but why it did it to determine where they can sue.

IMPLICATIONS

The ruling in Calumet offers a middle-ground reading of the CAA’s venue rules, interpreting “nationwide scope and effect” in such a way that will send some challenges to EPA actions to the DC Circuit even if those decisions are not “nationally applicable,” while preserving regional courts’ authority over more locally focused EPA decisions.

The ruling leaves significant wiggle room for lower courts to interpret whether a certain agency action is nationwide in scope. In particular, lower courts will need to closely parse EPA’s justifications for its actions to determine whether an issue of nationwide scope or effect is “at the core of the agency action.” That standard could prove difficult to apply and result in variance among district courts, particularly where both EPA and petitioners challenging EPA rules will seek to characterize EPA actions in a manner consistent with their preferred venue.

Notably, the decision does not necessarily resolve even the question of the appropriate venue for challenges to small-refinery exemption decisions under the RFS program going forward. As the Court majority acknowledged, the proper venue could be different for another small-refinery exemption decision—for example, an EPA decision that relied heavily on refinery-specific factors or local economic conditions might be properly challenged in a regional circuit.",https://www.morganlewis.com/-/media/images/tiles/energy-environmental/1430300354_largetile.jpg?rev=11a89205f09141528f3a2578e35d096f&hash=DF351184D361D9F0BB58E8B6AAA18FE0,N,,2025-07-28 17:03:43.660390

Competition in the electric vehicle space has become increasingly fierce as major auto makers release lines of electric vehicles alongside their gas-powered cars, including Ford and Porsche.","Orange County resident Michael Buday has one eye on the calendar as he makes plans to purchase a used Tesla. He has two months left to take advantage of a federal tax credit that could save him thousands of dollars if he buys an electric vehicle.

The federal government will stop paying a $7,500 incentive for new electric vehicles and a $4,000 credit for used ones on Sept. 30. It’s an abrupt reversal by the Trump administration of Biden-era efforts to address climate change emissions from gasoline cars. The details are laid out in the “Big Beautiful Bill” that passed this month.

The tax credits have been available for cars that plug in but also have a gas tank, such as the Toyota Rav4 Prime and the Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid.

Transportation is the largest contributor to climate change both in California and nationally, and experts say it must get much cleaner to preserve a recognizable climate. About 1 in 4 cars sold in California is fully electric or plug-in hybrid, according to the California Energy Commission.

The elimination of the credits is expected to further stunt EV sales that have already slowed amid plateauing interest in California and steep auto tariffs. Industry analysts and auto dealers predict they’ll see a spike in interest in electric vehicles while people can still get the credits.

Buday, who is looking to buy his second Tesla after purchasing a Model 3 two years ago, said he wants to stay ahead of the curve.

“People tend to not pay attention until it’s getting close to a deadline,” Buday said. “There’s hundreds and hundreds of Teslas even within 60 miles for sale, but I think once people catch on to the fact that these credits are going away, there may be a rush to snap them up.”

The tax credits can be applied to most electric vehicles for sale, including the SUVs and trucks on display at Camino Real Chevrolet in Monterey Park. Dealership president Robb Hernandez said he hasn’t yet seen a significant jump in EV sales yet. Manufacturers are estimating an increase over the coming weeks, he said.

About 20% of the dealership’s total sales come from its electric offerings, Hernandez said, including the popular Chevy Blazer and Equinox. Competition in the electric vehicle space has become increasingly fierce as major auto makers release lines of electric vehicles alongside their gas-powered cars, including Ford and Porsche. Electric-only companies including Rivian and Lucid further crowd the field of competitors.

Hernandez is bracing for a drop-off in sales at his dealership with the expiration of the tax credits but said he’s confident in Chevrolet’s foothold in California.

“We’re kind of anticipating there will be a surge, and then possibly after the expiration of the EV credits, there might be a lull,” Hernandez said. “Hopefully it will all even out.”

Tesla is using the credits’ expiration to try to motivate potential customers, with marketing emails that say, “Order soon to get your $7,500.”

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in an earnings call this month that the elimination of the credits could hurt his company’s sales and lead to “a few rough quarters.”

The electric vehicle leader has been turning its attention to robotics and autonomous driving technology as vehicle sales falter. Tesla reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive sales last quarter.

The news that the credits are expiring may also be drowned out by the overall price volatility consumers are dealing with.

“Most people in this economy are reading the news and struggling to make purchase decisions based on all these moving targets,” said Dominick Miserandino, a consumer behavior expert and chief executive of Retail Tech Media Nexus.

“The average person is just trying to make sense of it all,” he said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9626220/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+170/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F49%2Fa7%2Fcd0ff6b648d19fd8020ca8df2f82%2Fev-car-alarm-clock-3x2.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 18:02:44.679633

“Safe and strategic deployment of energy storage will help drive economic development and reduce costs for New Yorkers.” Administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), through its Bulk Energy Storage Program, this competitive solicitation seeks to advance a range of energy storage technologies and timely progress toward procuring 3 GW of bulk energy storage over the three solicitations.
“NYSERDA’s Bulk Energy Storage Program provides an opportunity to more than double the current amount of energy storage that has been deployed, contracted, and awarded statewide.
New York’s 6-GW Energy Storage Roadmap also authorizes funds for NYSERDA to support 200 MW of new residential-scale energy storage and 1,500 MW of new commercial and community-scale energy.
Additionally, at least 35% of the benefits of these new energy storage projects will be allocated to disadvantaged communities.","New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has launched New York’s first bulk energy storage request for proposals (RFP), intended to procure 1 GW of bulk energy storage as part of New York’s 6-GW energy storage roadmap.

“Today’s action is another example of New York’s ongoing commitment to strengthening our grid, ensuring the state continues to have a more affordable and reliable electricity system now and well into the future,” Gov. Hochul said. “Safe and strategic deployment of energy storage will help drive economic development and reduce costs for New Yorkers.”

Administered by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), through its Bulk Energy Storage Program, this competitive solicitation seeks to advance a range of energy storage technologies and timely progress toward procuring 3 GW of bulk energy storage over the three solicitations. Any NYSERDA-supported energy storage projects are contractually required to meet the new storage safety codes adopted last week into Uniform Code by the State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council, which reflect the work and recommendations from the New York State Inter-Agency Fire Safety Working Group (FSWG). While the newly adopted code will not take effect until January 1, 2026, NYSERDA has already integrated these recommendations into its residential, retail and bulk energy storage programs to ensure facilities are sited safely, that first responders have the necessary training, and that all sites have comprehensive emergency response plans.

“NYSERDA’s Bulk Energy Storage Program provides an opportunity to more than double the current amount of energy storage that has been deployed, contracted, and awarded statewide. This solicitation will further advance New York’s focus on grid reliability, peak reduction and affordability while meeting the demand for more storage to be safely installed across our state,” said Doreen M. Harris, NYSERDA President and CEO.

NYSERDA’s Bulk Energy Storage Program employs a novel Index Storage Credit (ISC) incentive, as established in the New York Public Service Commission (PSC) Order, modeled in part after the Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) and Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Credit (OREC) utilized in other NYSERDA programs. The ISC is a market-based mechanism that gives project owners greater revenue certainty while incentivizing them to participate in wholesale energy and capacity markets. ISCs will be created based on a project’s operational availability, and will represent 1 MWh of energy storage capacity that is operational and available to discharge on a given day; projects will be credited and compensated based on the operational availability they achieve in each month over the course of the 15- to 25-year contracts.

Entities interested in responding to this solicitation must complete an initial qualifying step for proposers to demonstrate program eligibility. Step One Eligibility Applications are due to NYSERDA by 3 p.m. ET on September 4, 2025. Once proposals are deemed eligible by NYSERDA, proposers will be invited to submit a “Step Two” bid proposal for project evaluation.

As noted above, NYSERDA supports robust safety measures for all projects and, as a result, will not pay for ISCs until the awarded and contracted projects are permitted, installed and operating and have passed their peer review process and quality assurance inspection — both key milestones to ensure that all projects are designed and constructed with New York’s best-in-class safety standards. In addition, all project proposers must include a comprehensive safety and security plan detailing how they will adhere to the Bulk Energy Storage Program Manual requirements.

Also, associated with this solicitation, NY Green Bank (NYGB), a division of NYSERDA and a specialized investment fund dedicated to bridging financial gaps in clean energy and renewable infrastructure markets in New York State, is prepared to support project developers and investors with a range of financing options in order to advance energy storage. Entities interested in applying for this financing can submit an application to NYGB RFP No. 1.

NYSERDA’s siting team also works closely with local governments to provide tailored education, technical assistance and model local laws. Through its clean energy siting resources, the siting team empowers communities with the tools and knowledge to make informed decisions and manage responsible clean energy development in host communities.

New York’s 6-GW Energy Storage Roadmap also authorizes funds for NYSERDA to support 200 MW of new residential-scale energy storage and 1,500 MW of new commercial and community-scale energy. Additionally, at least 35% of the benefits of these new energy storage projects will be allocated to disadvantaged communities.

“We can’t afford to let soaring electricity bills undermine public support for renewable energy,” Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement applauding Mills for signing the bill.
Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, a local trade association, called the law “penny wise and pound foolish” and “incredibly bad news” for Maine’s solar industry.
“But one of the primary ways that can happen is by having more renewable energy on the grid in Maine and I’m very concerned that by creating an atmosphere in Maine where the Maine legislature has conveyed that renewable energy investment is not welcome here, or can not be relied on here, we have set ourselves up to not enjoy the incredible stabilizing effect that renewable energy has on energy costs.
When Warren introduced her bill in May, she said having the tariff rate tied to volatile natural gas and fossil fuel markets ultimately led to “unexpectedly high returns” for renewable energy developers.","It would be hard to argue that Maine’s solar incentive program hasn’t been successful in spurring the development of small-scale solar projects. Since it was established in 2019, the program, formally called Net Energy Billing, has helped bring hundreds of arrays and more than 1 gigawatt of solar power onto the grid — far exceeding the program’s 750 megawatt goal.

Where community support for the program wanes is on the issue of costs, with critics arguing that NEB has become a raw deal for Maine ratepayers who have subsidized solar development to the tune of more than $200 million annually.

Enter L.D. 1777, a bill that the Maine Legislature passed with bipartisan support last month and that Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed into law on June 27. The administration and other proponents of the measure, including lead sponsor Rep. Sophia Warren, D-Scarborough, say overhauling the NEB program is necessary to better protect ratepayers amid rising energy prices.

“We can’t afford to let soaring electricity bills undermine public support for renewable energy,” Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement applauding Mills for signing the bill. “This new law is a responsible, forward-looking reform that ensures we can continue growing clean energy while protecting Mainers from rising electricity bills.”

But solar energy advocates and developers warn that the law, which retroactively impacts projects that have already been built or are already under construction, threatens to put Maine’s growing renewable energy sector on ice.

Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, a local trade association, called the law “penny wise and pound foolish” and “incredibly bad news” for Maine’s solar industry.

“The cost of electricity, the numbers on folks’ utility bills, we need to take those incredibly seriously and look for the many ways that those costs can be lowered,” she told The Maine Monitor.

“But one of the primary ways that can happen is by having more renewable energy on the grid in Maine and I’m very concerned that by creating an atmosphere in Maine where the Maine legislature has conveyed that renewable energy investment is not welcome here, or can not be relied on here, we have set ourselves up to not enjoy the incredible stabilizing effect that renewable energy has on energy costs. That’s incredibly disappointing.”

Among other things, the law tasks the Public Utility Commission with establishing a new credit payment structure for non-residential customers in NEB’s tariff rate program. Instead of the current structure, where rates are tied to standard utility electricity rates, they would be capped and increase at 2.25 percent annually.

When Warren introduced her bill in May, she said having the tariff rate tied to volatile natural gas and fossil fuel markets ultimately led to “unexpectedly high returns” for renewable energy developers.

“In many cases, these rates now exceed what is required for project viability and are placing an unnecessary burden on nonparticipating ratepayers,” she wrote in written testimony to her colleagues in the House.

The law also makes changes to the NEB credit program, imposing new monthly per-kilowatt fees on community solar projects ranging in size from 1 to 5 megawatts beginning next year, with larger arrays paying more to local utilities. A 1 megawatt array would pay $2,800 per month, while a 5 megawatt project would pay $30,000. The new fees do not impact projects smaller than 1 megawatt, such as household rooftop arrays.

The changes are expected to slash overall payments to existing community solar farms by approximately 20% and save Maine ratepayers approximately $61 million annually over the next 16 years, according to the state’s Office of the Public Advocate.

Across the board, members of MREA in the solar development space have voiced to Donoghue that L.D. 1777 will significantly impact their current projects in Maine and their future relationship with the state.

“They are likely or have already directly communicated to me that they are no longer going to look to build projects in Maine because they perceive it as too risky from a regulatory perspective,” she said.

Nexamp, a member of MREA that has dozens of community solar projects across Maine, called the law’s retroactive policy changes “a breach of economic trust” that will “permanently damage Maine’s reputation as a climate leader.”

The adoption of L.D. 1777 came as Republicans in Congress were putting the final touches on President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful” budget bill, which includes numerous provisions meant to stymie the nation’s buildout of renewable energy.

The federal act, which Trump signed into law days after L.D. 1777 received Mills’ signature, rapidly phases out Biden administration-era tax credits for wind and solar projects and terminates tax credits for home energy efficiency upgrades, including rooftop solar, electric heat pumps and insulation, at the end of 2025.

Together, the federal act and the new state law leave Maine’s clean energy sector in a precarious place, according to Donoghue and Kate Daniel, Northeast regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access, a national trade group.

“I do find that it’s been a little frustrating to hear state policymakers in Maine criticizing these federal actions when they really don’t need the help of DC to kill solar programs in the state of Maine,” Daniel said, stressing that uncertainty in the Maine market will drive clean energy investors to do business elsewhere.

As for Maine’s new, more aggressive target of achieving 100% clean electricity by 2040, Donoghue worries that the state now finds itself with limited options to get there.

“We’re going to be exceptionally challenged to meet those goals,” she said, adding that the combination of L.D. 1777 and Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” Act adds “insult to injury.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/07/Green_Energy_Transmission_69268_1df515-1753733064.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-07-28 18:02:54.205648

By then, the Detroit automaker predicted a tariff impact of $4 billion to $5 billion — which was reaffirmed on Tuesday’s report.","General Motors’ second-quarter results “looked fine on paper,” but deeper analysis reveals troubling margin erosion in its core North American operations, worsened by tariffs and a return to losses in its EV segment, according to a new research note from Bernstein.

The analyst Daniel Roeska raised his price target on GM shares to $41 from $36 on Monday, citing improved clarity on future tariffs.

However, he maintained an Underperform rating, warning that “normalized earnings may not return anytime soon.”

General Motors‘ shares closed 0.1% higher on Monday. After reporting its financial results, the stock fell by about 10% before recovering in the following sessions as major Wall Street firms commented on the second-quarter earnings.

“GM’s Q2/25 came in above consensus—adjusted EPS of $2.53 was 8% higher than the Street, and revenue beat by nearly $2 billion,” Roeska wrote. “But GMNA missed EBIT expectations by 7.5%, and margins fell 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter.”

While General Motors reiterated its full-year guidance and resumed share buybacks, Bernstein warned that hitting both EBIT and free cash flow targets will require more than favorable currency moves or isolated gains in its international operations.

“The core GMNA business is eroding under $1.1 billion in tariffs,” Roeska noted, adding that “BEVs return to cash burn mode.”

GM’s North American EBIT-adjusted margin fell to 6.1% in Q2 from 10.9% a year earlier, while adjusted automotive free cash flow plunged 46.6% to $2.83 billion.

“The FY25 targets now hinge on cost and capex cuts—not on top-line strength,” Bernstein said.

“The bigger issue? The market still sees this as transitory. But with no real relief on tariffs and BEV incentives rolling off in Q3, the margin story could get worse before it gets better.”

Despite the caution, Bernstein raised its 2026 earnings forecast, citing greater visibility into tariff impacts. Still, the firm concluded: “A decent print, but it gets harder from here.”

Deutsche Bank, Barclays, and Bank of America lowered last week their price target on the Detroit automaker while Citi and Wells Fargo increased it to $61 and $38, respectively.

GM reaffirmed its full year financial guidance despite uncertainty around US tariffs.

Yu lowered the firm’s price target on GM from $55 to $53, which implies a 8.4% upside potential on the stock, based on Tuesday’s close.

GM‘s automotive cash flow registered a sharp drop of nearly 40% year over year to $4.65 billion.

The automotive debt raised by $1.7 billion in the first half of 2025 to $17.2 billion, with liquidity falling from $35.5 billion to $34.7 billion in the first six months of the year.

General Motors lowered its 2025 financial guidance earlier this year, as it aimed for an adjusted EBIT of between $10—$12.5 billion, down from $13.7—15.7 billion.

The Trump administration has long promised to walk back a number of Biden administration policies aimed at climate change targets, including those designed to boost electric vehicle adoption. In light of the changing policy climate, BloombergNEF has lowered both its near- and long-term outlooks for EV sales in the United States for the first time ever, while the rest of the world’s numbers continue to climb.

BloombergNEF cut 14 million battery-powered cars from its sales projections through 2030 thanks to changing policies in the United States, which are removing supports from the EV industry as well as pressures to lower emissions. On the very first day of this term, Trump ordered the elimination of EV subsidies, and his administration is now loosening national fuel-economy standards, doing away with EV tax credits, and blocking California’s state-level emissions limits.

“President Donald Trump’s efforts to unravel policies supporting electric vehicles threatens to turn the US into a laggard for years to come,” reports Bloomberg.

As a result, the makers of EV batteries for U.S. markets are scrambling to find new buyers, and they’re increasingly turning to energy storage as a lifeline. Major companies like General Motors and LG are fast-tracking energy storage battery projects as they look to capitalize on a surge of demand on energy grids driven by data centers.

The proliferation of artificial intelligence is placing unprecedented stress on energy grids, and along with it, unprecedented opportunity for battery storage. In 2024, Tesla’s energy storage revenue jumped 67 percent last year to $4 billion, making it an increasingly central part of the EV company’s portfolio.

And now GM has signed a “non-binding memorandum of understanding” with Redwood Energy to sell new and used EV batteries to a recycling firm for reuse in energy storage projects used as a sort of power bank for data centers. These batteries hold onto electricity and excess energy produced by wind and solar when production outpaces demand, which it then feeds back into the grid – or into a connected data center – as needed.

“The market for grid-scale batteries and backup power isn’t just expanding, it’s becoming essential infrastructure,” Kurt Kelty, GM's vice president of batteries, propulsion, and sustainability, said in a recent statement. “Electricity demand is climbing, and it’s only going to accelerate. To meet that challenge, the U.S. needs energy storage solutions that can be deployed quickly, economically, and made right here at home. GM batteries can play an integral role. We’re not just making better cars — we’re shaping the future of energy resilience.”

In addition to newly manufactured batteries, used EV batteries have potential for new life in energy storage applications. EV batteries are retired when their range drops below a certain threshold, but they still have a lot of life in them that can be used in other applications, according to a recent report released by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NDRC).

“There’s definitely some potential in the utility sector, especially in terms of grid back-up storage … even though [old EV batteries] have lost, say, 20% of their original capacity… when you’re talking about grid storage that can still be a perfectly usable battery for several more years,” says Jordan Brinn, the report’s author.

And even totally used-up batteries can be repurposed for energy storage needs. According to Brinn, 95 percent of the minerals in a dead EV battery can be reused to produce new batteries either for EVs or energy storage systems. Either way, this provides a critical new sector for EV makers, who can sell off new and used products to recycling centers as EV sales continue to slump within a discouraging policy environment.

“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in the release.
The theory is that social responsibility is good for business, but some conservatives consider the approach “woke.” “We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers,” Uthmeier said.

In a press release, Uthmeier said his office has issued subpoenas to CDP (formerly the Climate Disclosure Project) and the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), neither of which immediately responded to Florida Phoenix’s requests for comment.

“Radical climate activists have hijacked corporate governance and weaponized it against the free market,” Uthmeier said in the release. “Florida will not sit back while international pressure groups shake down American companies to fund their ESG grift.”

“ESG” is an acronym for environmental, social, and corporate governance, criteria sometimes used in gauging whether to invest in a company. The theory is that social responsibility is good for business, but some conservatives consider the approach “woke.”

“We’re using every tool of the law to stop the Climate Cartel from exploiting businesses and misleading consumers,” Uthmeier said.

CDP is an international nonprofit the operates an independent environmental disclosure system that allows companies, capital markets, cities, states, and regions “to manage their environmental impacts,” according to CDP’s website. The organization boasts that 1,000 cities, states, and regions have disclosed environmental information.

SBTi, an acronym for science-based target initiatives, is a company that develops standards, tools, and guidance for companies to set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what is needed to reach net-zero by 2050. SBTi was co-founded by CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, We Mean Business Coalition, the World Resources Institute (WRI), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF).

According to the SBTi 2023 Monitoring Report “any profits generated by SBTi Services Limited will be gifted to the charity.”

The AG’s press release says Uthmeier’s investigation will examine “deceptive trade practices” and potential antitrust violations, including whether coordination between CDP, financial institutions, and investment services constitutes unlawful market manipulation; and whether CDP’s efforts to pressure or punish companies that don’t participate is anticompetitive.

Considering potential career paths, she became interested in landscape architecture, which “really is the foundation for many communities,” Askew said.

The profession blends environmental science, architecture and urban design to help build neighborhoods centered around nature.

Askew, who graduated from Norview High School, quickly made the connection to use landscape architecture to revitalize neighborhoods, including in Coronado.

“That really inspired me to create these spaces in underserved communities,” she said. “It’s so important to have green spaces for children, for adults, for everyone.”

Askew is a rising sophomore at North Carolina A&T State University, majoring in landscape architecture and recently won a $2,500 scholarship from the Raleigh-based Whitley Law Firm.

Named after Sandi Fuqua, a former member of Whitley who died in 2020, the award recognizes a student “who exemplifies deep commitment to their community while pursuing their educational and professional goals,” according to the law firm.

“Influenced by how the lack of green spaces impacted her community, she seeks to create spaces of resilience and joy, with a passion for inclusive and restorative design,” the law firm stated in a news release.

Askew isn’t waiting until she returns to school to get started. Home in Norfolk for the summer, Askew began brainstorming a design to reinvigorate a largely abandoned community site, the Coronado School.

The school was built in 1960 for Black elementary students, as the Norfolk school system resisted racial integration.

Just a decade before, the neighborhood had been home to only white residents. Black families started buying homes in Coronado in 1954, sparking violence and intimidation tactics from white neighbors, including fire bombings of Black homes, according to research by the University of Virginia’s Environmental Justice Policy Clinic. White families started leaving in favor of newer suburban communities in Chesapeake and Virginia Beach, part of a larger mid-20th century phenomenon known as “white flight.”

In the 1980s, the Coronado School was used to support pregnant teenagers and young mothers, before closing in 2008 because of declining enrollment and funding.

The building now sits empty, next to a large expanse of lawn and an old basketball court. Earlier this year, the city asked real estate firms to submit ideas for redeveloping the site.

Askew sees the spot as an opportunity, partially inspired by a Chicago-based initiative called PopCourts, which turns vacant lots or courts into vibrant plots mixing functional space with community artwork.

Her initial sketch, called “Reclaiming Coronado,” envisions a community garden, playground, bike rack, trees and a renovated basketball court. The design also includes nods to the area’s history, such as an informational plaque.

“It is in the center of a Black neighborhood,” she said. “And I do believe, with the rich history of this land and of this school, I believe we should embrace that history.”

Askew’s proposal is currently theoretical, not associated with any official city planning.

But Zuri’s father, Mark Askew Sr., said he’d love to see her ideas become reality.

He also grew up in Coronado and recalls the basketball court being “packed all of the time,” along with people riding bicycles and playing football.

With the city considering what to do with the land, “I think she's right on time with the opportunity to maybe take this forward,” he said.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c276a4a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+677/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2Fbf%2F982b68f14b2c9f9efb8c98b486f9%2Fimg-2584.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 17:04:55.425376

In her new role, she will lead the implementation of the MI Healthy Climate Plan, which focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing energy efficiency, and expanding renewable energy sources. Carreon begins the position next month.

Bill proposes FEMA basement repair coverage

A new bill introduced in the U.S. House would make basements eligible for FEMA repairs. Currently, basements are only covered if they include a bedroom, and FEMA typically does not cover mold or mildew mitigation after flooding events.

Flooded basements have long impacted Detroit residents. Donna Givens Davidson, president and CEO of the Eastside Community Network, says this bill is a step toward justice for communities that have endured decades of aging infrastructure.

“This bill brings us closer to addressing the cumulative impacts of racist public policy over the years in places like the east side of Detroit, where senior citizens, where low-income people, are already living in homes they cannot afford to repair,” Givens Davidson said.

Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Detroit introduced the bipartisan-supported bill. If passed, the bill would expand eligibility and coverage under FEMA’s Group Insurance Policy.

Detroit rental compliance reminder

The City of Detroit has issued a notice inviting Detroit landlords to check if their homes have a certificate of compliance. Property owners can apply online for inspections and to obtain a certificate.

Last year, the City Council passed a law streamlining the inspection process for rental homes to improve safety and simplify the process.

All rental homes must pass an inspection and obtain a certificate of compliance. This year, the inspections will focus on the most severe safety issues.

For questions related to rental property inspections, residents can call 313-628-2451.",https://wdet.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/EGLE-Image-DetroitRiverTesting1_673323_7-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 17:03:55.539823

Companies that mine metallurgical coal are in line to receive a 2.5% tax credit.

The bill slashes Medicaid, food benefits for lower-income Americans. It also erased many of the subsidies for clean energy enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden in 2022.

Making 'met' coal cheaper, mostly for other countries

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also adds a subsidy for a specific type of coal – metallurgical, or ""met"" coal, used in steelmaking. The bill reclassified metallurgical coal as a ""critical mineral,"" making it eligible for a tax credit that had gone mainly to materials used in clean energy.

Metallurgical coal is used to make steel in a blast furnace, and is a significant greenhouse gas polluter: Globally, steel accounts for around 10% of planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

However, most steel made in the U.S. does not use coal; it comes from scrap metal and iron ore melted in electric-powered furnaces. So about 70% of the 70 million tons of metallurgical coal produced in the U.S. – primarily from Appalachian states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Kentucky – is shipped overseas.

The top destinations for U.S. met coal are India, Brazil, Japan, the Netherlands and China.

""It's going to make iron and steel produced outside of the U.S. cheaper,"" said Hilary Lewis, steel director at the environmental nonprofit Industrious Labs. While Trump has imposed 50 percent tariffs on steel from other countries, the effect of this tax credit will counteract that tariff.

""That steel, it will be even cheaper,"" she said.

But Ben Beakes, president of the Metallurgical Coal Producers Association, said even though met coal is mostly exported, it remains important to the domestic economy.

""Twenty-five percent (of it) is used right here in America in our steel mills in order to make steel. So it still is a huge component of our infrastructure and the rebuilding of our country,"" Beakes said.

Pennsylvania produces approximately 5 million tons of metallurgical coal annually, mostly going to domestic steelmakers, such as U.S. Steel, according to Rachel Gleason, executive director of the Pennsylvania Coal Alliance.

""The majority of Pennsylvania-produced met coal is used domestically, and the majority stays in Pennsylvania, with…about three million tons of Pennsylvania-produced met coal goes to U.S. Steel,"" Gleason said in an email.

Promoting met coal, while phasing out renewable energy credits

Met coal produced between 2026 and 2029 will now be eligible for the Advanced Manufacturing Production Tax Credit, (or 45X), created by the Inflation Reduction Act. In addition, the new law phases out tax credits for other critical minerals typically used in renewable energy by 2033. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, those tax credits were permanent. Lewis called it ironic that the tax credit will now be used for coal mining.

""This was supposed to reduce climate pollution. Instead, Trump is now going to use this rule to increase climate pollution by subsidizing coal use for steelmaking,"" Lewis said.

Using coal to produce steel also has local pollution impacts. A recent report from Industrious Labs found the process adds $13 billion in public health costs in the U.S. and is responsible for hundreds of premature deaths around the country every year.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5e94d71/2147483647/strip/true/crop/620x326+0+44/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwesa%2Ffiles%2F201903%2Fclairton_coke_works.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 17:03:17.200672

Because one you look at the numbers, the tiny pittance given to EV buyers is a drop in the bucket compared to the boatloads of cash the government gives the oil industry.

It's been 100 years. If gasoline cars need to be subsidized for a century, the maybe we can do the same for EV.

In fact, we can easily pay for the EV tax break by cutting back on one of the many many handouts we give to the oil barons.

Either the gasoline industry can stand on its own two feet or not. The government needs to stop propping this market up and stop shelling out extra cash to people who don't need it.

I agree... Maybe they should do the Oil industry next.

How about states and cities stop giving big tax breaks to companies that choose their city/state.

There are so many industries that can stand on its own. But gets government handouts.

If you read 26 USC Section 30D(e), you'll see that there are increasing requirements for US and US-friendly battery and critical mineral requirements. These requirements were designed to increase US factories of batteries, which is actually what is needed.

If the goal of the EV tax credit was to merely support EVs, then the 26 USC Section 30D(e) language would not be part of the law.

So, you're right that EVs shouldn't be supported, you're missing the very strong argument that US batteries do need lots of support.

The form of subsidy should change to benefit more working class people. Instead of giving discounts on cars build free charging stations.

I lived in a town with free charging stations and the POS used leafs held together with duct tape were usually the ones taking advantage.

Clean air and a reduction in greenhouse gases benefits us all so instead of saying ""no incentive"" target the incentives differently.

This coverage is made possible through a partnership between BPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.

The “One, Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) rolls back clean energy tax credits that middle- and low-income families, as well as businesses, have used in WNC to boost energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades.

Among the terminated tax incentives is the residential clean energy credit, which helped homeowners offset the cost of solar panels, geothermal heat pumps, solar water heaters and other renewable energy home modifications.

Among other repeals, the OBBBA is rolling back:

Rooftop solar credits, ending Dec. 31, 2025

Home energy efficiency credits, ending Dec. 31, 2025

Commercial efficiency deductions, ending June 30, 2026

New energy-efficient home credits, ending June 30, 2026

Across the Appalachian solar industry, some are worried about energy resilience in the face of disasters and ever-increasing utility bills — and that fewer tax benefits might put clean energy out of reach for all but the richest.

Solar meant disaster resilience during Helene

Immediately after Helene hammered Western North Carolina, most of the region was under a complete electrical blackout. Sundance Power Systems, a small solar company, responded by partnering with other organizations to bring light to impacted households in the form of microgrids.

“We loaded solar panels and batteries up in the back of our ’97 Chevy, and we went around and started providing power to people that didn’t have it,” Dave Hollister, CEO of Sundance Power Systems, said. “That continued for months, and it’s still continuing.”

They’re planning to install solar panels at the Fairview Volunteer Fire Department this month.

Elsewhere in the mountains, areas where distributed and residential solar had pre-existed the storm seemed to fare well, leading many to wonder whether they had a potential to prepare the region for the next storm.

The residential clean energy credit offsets up to 30% of the upfront cost of installing energy upgrades like rooftop solar panels. The residential energy efficiency credit did the same for home improvements like heat pumps and better-sealed windows, and home energy efficiency audits.

Both allowed homeowners to get more quickly to the point where they were saving money on utility bills rather than spending. In 2023, after the Biden administration passed increased tax credits into law in the Inflation Reduction Act, solar adoption jumped nationwide; North Carolina IRS data shows over 62,490 households used the energy efficiency credit, while 26,470 households used the clean energy credit. And they helped the industry, too.

“Tax credits were part of the business model here in North Carolina,” Hollister said. “And you know it’s been an important part of giving folks the ability to choose renewable energy as their preferred energy source.” Without it, he fears renewable energy will be left to the rich, and business will go down in more rural communities like the many he works with.

The tax credit often disproportionately benefitted wealthy families, for whom the tax write-off made a bigger difference simply because their taxes were bigger to begin with. Nonetheless, additional provisions in the IRA, like the “direct pay” tax credit system, allowed nonprofits and governments to take on costs of clean energy installation at the community level, where they had previously been dominated by for-profit companies. Direct Pay has not been rolled back by the Trump administration as yet. Some entities, like Mountain BizWorks, a nonprofit lender in Western North Carolina, can still take advantage of that to fund new clean energy projects.

Mountain BizWorks, a local nonprofit lender that helps small businesses clear financial hurdles, said that businesses in Western North Carolina historically lack access to the kind of capital that can make renewable energy investments pay off quickly.

“It definitely adds a bit of urgency, and would encourage folks to, if they’ve been thinking about pursuing some of those projects, to act now,” said Eric Burton, who works for BizWorks as the nonprofit’s director of energy and climate lending. Commercial tax credits extend through 2027 rather than 2025, but it’s still a tight timeline.

Impacts will also vary state-to-state and region to region, depending on state law.

Trouble on the horizon for residents’ utility bills

Bonnie Angermeier, a senior legislative associate with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said this was an outcome she’d feared since the election. “We know that in the wake of Hurricane Helene having energy sources that, you know, were not impacted was such a critical component for survival for so many folks,” she said.

Larger, utility-scale clean energy projects will have until 2027 before their own tax credit winds down.

Angermeier is worried that the overall impact will actually be to increase energy burden on rural customers who are already paying more than the average American. It could even impact people who don’t have solar energy at home and are just connected to the grid, thanks to lower average incomes, older housing stock, and what some advocates say is lack of investment in energy efficiency.

“Of the companies that we’ve talked to throughout Appalachia, many of them, their average customer makes between $50-$60,000,” she said. “So these are not really wealthy families. These are low-to-middle income hard-working families that are able to take advantage of residential solar to bring down their bill.”

The White House has said the repeals are a part of responding to the country’s increasing energy needs.

“The One, Big, Beautiful Bill will turbocharge energy production by streamlining operations for maximum efficiency and expanding domestic production capacity, which will deliver further relief to American families and businesses,” said White House assistant press secretary Taylor Rogers in an email.

How to take advantage of energy efficiency incentives while you still can

The clean energy tax credit covers up to 30% of costs for installing new clean energy infrastructure in your home, and the energy efficiency credit coversup to 30% of costs for home improvements like energy-efficient HVAC systems, heat pumps and home energy audits.

Mayor Mike Duggan today joined with Detroit Economic Growth Corporation (DEGC) officials, City Council President Mary Sheffield, and startup ecosystem leaders announced the launch the first-of-its-kind Detroit Startup Fund. More than 200 members of Detroit’s tech community gathered at Newlab at Michigan Central to celebrate the announcement.

The $700,000 initiative will distribute grants to Detroit-based tech startups over the next year in its first round. The goal of the program is to create jobs, fuel innovation that improves life for Detroiters, and retain talent. The announcement was held at New Lab, which is now home to more than 140 startup companies.

“Detroit always has been a city of innovators willing to take risk to create something new. The Detroit Startup Fund is one of the ways we are making Detroit the easiest and most supportive city anywhere to start and grow innovative new companies,” said Mayor Mike Duggan. “Because we already have so much talent here in Detroit, the Startup Fund also creates another reason for that talent to stay here and be part of something special.”

Grant Eligibility and Applications

The Detroit Startup Fund will award a total of 26 grants across two rounds in the next year. Those include 20 seed grants of $15,000 each and six scale grants of $50,000 each to Detroit-based startups. The fund’s first 13 grant winners will be announced in late 2025 and a second round will open in early 2026.

Applications for Round One grants open today at detroitmi.gov/startup and will close on August 25. Applications require detailed business plans and clear deployment strategies for grant funds.

To be eligible for the Detroit Startup Fund, businesses must meet the following four criteria:

Detroit-based startup or founder building in Detroit that has been established no more than 10 years

Scalable, venture backable company with a product or service that has potential for civic use, improves quality of life for Detroit residents, and/or enhances the delivery of city services or operations

Commitment to becoming certified with the City as a Detroit-based business

Commitment to sharing progress and outcome data with DEGC and City of Detroit

Additionally, $50,000 scale grant recipients must raise at least $250,000 and have already secured $100,000 in external investment over the past 18 months. Grant funding may be used for product development, hiring or retaining staff, testing, piloting, customer acquisition, go-to-market activities, and a number of other applications to fuel startup growth.

Detroit’s Startup Economy

Startup Genome’s 2022 Global Startup Ecosystem Report ranked Detroit the world’s #1 emerging startup hub. This momentum builds on record levels of investment and development within Detroit’s growing tech community. From Newlab at Michigan Central and TechTown, to the University of Michigan Center for Innovation and the new precision medicine center at Bedrock’s Gratiot site, billions of dollars are being invested in the infrastructure needed to power the future of Detroit’s economy.

While high-growth industries in mobility, advanced manufacturing, clean energy, artificial intelligence, and health innovation are poised to generate high-quality jobs, Michigan startups often face challenges accessing early-stage capital critical to scaling.

“Detroit has a rich legacy of driving innovation and economic mobility. This fund will give founders the capital and visibility needed to grow and create high-quality jobs right here at home,” said Justin Onwenu, the City of Detroit’s first Director of Entrepreneurship and Economic Opportunity. “By lowering barriers and expanding access, we’re driving economic mobility for years to come.”

The fund builds on City and DEGC’s efforts to supercharge Detroit’s tech ecosystem and spur further economic investment.

“This program will create a ripple effect across our local economy,” said Kevin Johnson, President and CEO of the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation. “Every startup that stays in or comes to Detroit because of this new Detroit Startup Fund will drive growth – hiring locally, sourcing from Detroit vendors, and inspiring other entrepreneurs to follow suit.”

Funding was made possible through the City’s general fund budget approved by the Mayor and City Council.

“City Council is proud to be a partner in driving tremendous business growth, investment, and opportunity in our city,” said City Council President Mary Sheffield. “This $700,000 investment is a bold step toward creating a more inclusive and equitable economy that centers Detroiters. By opening doors for our entrepreneurs, we are investing directly in the talent, resilience, and creativity of our people. These kinds of resources help grow our population, retain our homegrown talent, and strengthen the local economy. When we invest in Detroiters, we invest in the future of our city.”

Local leaders in the tech and entrepreneurship space have celebrated this new effort.

“This fund isn’t just about money. It’s about validation and creating pathways for startups that traditional funding sources often overlooked,” said Black Tech Saturdays Co-Founder and Johnnie Turnage. “Detroit and Michigan have incredible talent, but we’ve often lacked the early-stage support that helps startups create jobs. This fund is a monumental step in helping change that.”",https://detroitmi.gov/themes/custom/detroitminew/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-28 16:04:34.799084

Current U.S. Nuclear Capacity

Not shown on this map are the nearly 100 gigawatts (GW) of existing nuclear energy capacity generated by 94 nuclear reactors in 54 power plants across 28 states. Nuclear energy has accounted for about 20 percent of annual U.S. electricity generation since the late 1980s. This existing capacity makes the United States the country with the largest commercial nuclear power generation fleet in the world.

In the last decade, nuclear power has been facing financial challenges, resulting in 13 reactor closures (over 10 GW of capacity) since 2012. There are now efforts underway to recommission some of these reactors where possible. Scheduled to be operational by the end of 2025, the restart of the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan would be the first U.S. commercial nuclear reactor to be shuttered and restarted.

Federal Efforts to Accelerate Nuclear Deployment

Estimates project the United States will need an additional 200 GW of nuclear capacity to keep pace with power demand growth while reducing electric sector emissions. The Trump administration named nuclear energy as a key domestic energy resource in its Day 1 executive order, “Unleashing American Energy.” Similarly, Secretary for the Department of Energy Chris Wright called for an “unleashing of commercial nuclear power in the United States.”

In May 2025, the administration issued four executive orders aimed at revitalizing the U.S. nuclear sector:

Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security (EO 14299): Aims to accelerate the use of advanced nuclear technologies to support military operations, national defense infrastructure, and critical government energy needs; calls for increasing exports of U.S. nuclear technology, expanding domestic fuel recycling capacity, and establishing categorical exclusions under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for construction of nuclear reactors on federal sites.

Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) (EO 14300):

Seeks to overhaul the NRC by streamlining licensing processes, reducing bureaucracy, accelerating approval of reactor designs, and considering the economic and national security benefits when licensing nuclear reactors; sets a target of quadrupling U.S. nuclear energy capacity to a total of 400 gigawatts (GW) by 2050.

Reforming Nuclear Reactor Testing at the Department of Energy (DOE) (EO 14301):

Directs the DOE to expedite the review, approval, and deployment of reactors at the DOE and national lab sites and to create a pilot program for reactor construction and operation outside the National Laboratories.

Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base (EO 14302):

Calls for initiatives promoting workforce development, expanding domestic fuel supply, evaluating management of spent nuclear fuel, restarting shuttered plants, supporting advanced reactor deployment, and enhancing spent fuel management; sets a target for 10 new large reactors and 5 gigawatts (GW) of power uprates to be under construction by 2030 to support AI data centers and U.S. economic competitiveness.

Public Funding

Sources of public funding for existing and proposed nuclear reactor projects have included:

Loan Program Office: Provides loans and loan guarantees to help deploy innovative clean energy.

Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program: Intended to speed the demonstration of advanced reactors through cost-shared partnerships with U.S. industry.

Advanced Nuclear Energy Licensing Cost-Shared Grant Program: Designed to offset fees associated with licensing advanced reactors and facilities.

Civil Nuclear Credit Program: Funding to support the continued operation of existing U.S. nuclear reactors with demonstrated risk of closure due to economic reasons.

Federal Tax Credits: The zero-emission nuclear power production credit (45U) supports continued operation of existing nuclear reactors, and the technology-neutral clean electricity production tax credit (45Y) and investment tax credit (48E) support new and re-commissioned nuclear energy projects.

Data Dictionary

Headquartered in Houston, Texas, and founded in 1996, Cheniere Energy Inc LNG is the largest LNG producer in the U.S. and second largest globally. It operates two major liquefaction-export complexes (Sabine Pass LNG Terminal, Louisiana, and Corpus Christi LNG Terminal, Texas). Together, these two complexes give Cheniere an operational LNG capacity of 45 MTPA. There is an additional 10 million tonnes per annum, MTPA, capacity under construction.

The company has evolved significantly in the last fifteen years: Before 2010, Cheniere focused on importing LNG imports using regassification assets (before the advent of shale-derived energy). However, it soon pivoted towards liquefaction and export of gas, with the first export from Sabine Pass in 2016. Since 2020, Cheniere has been a major long-term supplier of LNG to Europe and Asia, becoming an increasingly important component of international energy security, particularly in the context of broader geopolitical turmoil. In 2023, the Corpus Christi complex began construction, and around 77% of this was completed by the end of 2024. Bechtel is the company's most critical construction partner, having played a contracted role in the building of both Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi complexes.

Cheniere's principal revenue stream is derived from long-term infrastructure contracts, although a small proportion is based on spot market merchant marketing of LNG commodities. The liquefaction services find customers in utilities companies, traders, and sovereign buyers, which reserve export capacity through sales and purchase agreements, SPAs. The fixed liquefaction fee (c. $2.84/ million British thermal units, MMBtu) is paid irrespective of LNG delivery, with the variable fee (cited as 115% of Henry Hub reference price) covers fuel and shipping costs.

Cheniere acquires gas from upstream suppliers such as Tourmaline, before liquefying and selling it under long-term SPAs or on the spot market. This spot market revenue generation causes full exposure to price spreads between U.S. and international gas markets but can create upside through arbitrage. Finally, Cheniere has begun to charter LNG vessels to ensure interoperability and insurance across the LNG industry. It subleases these to create revenue (c. $322 million in 2024).

The company has a different ownership structure and organisation compared to many other companies. Cheniere Energy Inc. owns all underlying LNG assets through wholly owned subsidiaries, whilst Cheniere Energy Partners, which Cheniere Energy Inc. owns at a Master Limited (100% general partner interest, 48.6% limited partner interest, and 100% of the distribution rights). The other LP percentage points are owned by investment companies such as Blackstone, but these do not withdraw operational and accounting control from Cheniere. Beyond the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi LNG complexes, Cheniere owns other assets, namely Cheniere Marketing (the spot market subsidiary of Cheniere, trading and managing cargoes for the spot market), the Cheniere Creole Trail Pipeline (94 miles of feed gas pipeline to Sabine Pass), and Cheniere Corpus Christi Pipeline (21 miles of feed gas pipeline to Corpus Christi).

Revenue drivers

The core business of Cheniere Energy is through LNG liquefaction. This is done through long-term SPAs (sales and purchase agreements), and account for around 90% of the company's revenue. By long-term Cheniere runs 10-20 year contracts that will be paid whether the cargo is lifted or not. The fee is structured with a fixed liquefaction aspect (typically between $2.00 - $3.50/MMBtu), and a variable fee which is set at 115% of Henry Hub (the gas nucleus for east America and a reference price used for spot pricing). This fee covers fuel and shipping costs. The high contracted volume means a steady, predictable revenue and limits the company to volatile spot prices. Moreover, it can assist with project finance acquisition, reduces earnings risk. The company has increased its average price per MMBtu over time, and this increases revenue and EBITDA per unit, thus improving Cheniere's profitability through time.

Cheniere's buyers are large international utilities companies, oil majors, and national energy companies (e.g. Shell, Equinor), and these are required to produce letters of credit to assist with forensic credit assessments to ensure low default risk, improving the reliability of the counterparties. Importantly, there is low risk for revenue disruption since take-or-pay contracts obligate customers to pay the fixed fee regardless of LNG collection. Since the Henry Hub price has no effect on Cheniere's EBITDA (used solely for feed gas, fuel, and shipping), volatility of this commodity does not impact EBITDA for long-term contracted volumes (though spot market revenue - 10% of total - is still exposed to this).

In the context of spot and short-term sales via Cheniere Marketing, up to 10% of revenue can be generated this way, though this is highly variable and cyclical. Essentially, the company sells off uncontracted LNG cargoes, generated through excess production, flexible volumes, and commissioning volumes. Such revenue comprises the LNG sale price minus the Henry Hub price, shipping costs, and liquefaction cost. Therefore, revenue here is sensitive to global LNG spreads, freight rates, and cargo destination arbitrage, thus causing high EBITDA variability and sensitivity to global spread markets.

Finally, the company generates a small proportion of revenue (2% to 4%) through LNG vessel sublease revenue. Here, Cheniere charters specific ships and subleases these to third parties for a profit. The drivers of such revenue include spot and contract LNG shipping rates, the management capabilities of the fleet, and the requirement of flexible destinations and timings. Although not a contributor to core earnings, this revenue can be more substantial during periods of tight global vessel availability.

The global LNG trade landscape has been increasingly shaped by policy-driven volatility, including climate regulation, export permit regimes, and in the US, broadly different presidential views towards the energy transition. As a result, Cheniere has had to insulate itself from external fluctuations in the global economic and political environment. Cheniere supports an LNG demand that is spread over more than 40 countries, including major markets in Asia and Europe, thus making the company more resilient to national policy shifts. A large part of this insulatory effect (one I believe will become even more important in the coming years and months) is the free on board contract structure. Cheniere delivers LNG to a terminal, but takes no responsibility for shipping, customs, and risks associated with the destination geography; the company is significantly distanced from sanctions, freight cost volatility, and trade barriers.

Financial highlights

In the first quarter of 2025, revenue came in at $5,444 million, compared to a Q1 of 2024, which was $4,253 million. Similarly, there was an increase in the consolidated adjusted EBITDA from $1,773 million to $1,872 million. This increase reflects the increased export of LNG from 602 TBtu to 609 TBtu from Q124 to Q125. The company has repurchased 1.6 million shares for around $350 million. Cheniere has also funded $325 million of complex Corpus Christi complex Stage 3 growth. The company, which is in significant debt (around $22.8 billion), repaid $300 million. Many of these actions fell under the company's 20/20 Vision' Capital Allocation plan:

? $4.9 billion debt reduction

? $4.5 billion shares repurchased

? $4.820/shares declared

? $4.4 billion total growth Capex funded

These targets are ambitious, though progress is being made towards all of them, suggesting they may be achievable.

Debt is spread across Cheniere Energy, Cheniere Energy Partners, and Cheniere Corpus Christi Holdings. The company also holds around $2.9 billion in cash, of which roughly $0.4 billion is restricted. This leaves a net debt position of approximately $19.9 billion. At the Cheniere Energy level, the company carries senior unsecured notes maturing in 2028 and 2034, carrying interest rates of 4.625% and 5.65%, respectively. It also maintains a revolving credit facility maturing in 2026. At the Cheniere Energy Partners level, which governs Sabine Pass, Cheniere has long-dated unsecured notes maturing in 2029 and 2031 and a separate revolver maturing in 2028. Meanwhile, at CCH, which funds and operates the Corpus Christi complex, the company has structured debt including 2039 notes, a $3.3 billion term loan linked to the completion of Stage 3, and a $1.5 billion working capital facility due in 2027.

Based on the 10-Q for 2025 Q1, Cheniere can deliver around 2,464 TBtu/year (616 x 4). With an annualised EBITDA of $5.2 billion, the margin per MMBtu will be $2.11 ($5,200,000,000/2,464,000,000 MMBtu). This represents only a high-level estimation of Cheniere's operating profitability per exported unit of LNG.

Most importantly, I believe, is the recent upgrade by Fitch Ratings of Cheniere from BBB to BBB- which will have positive implications for the company, unlocking lower costs of borrowing, as well as increasing its access to potential debt investors.

Under the current configuration of six trains at Sabine Pass and the first three at Corpus Christi, Cheniere expects to generate between $5.3 and $5.7 billion in adjusted EBITDA on an annualised basis.

Risks and Opportunities

Starting with risks: the assets and infrastructure which Cheniere owns are concentrated in the U.S. Gulf. This means the company is highly susceptible to regional weather events and infrastructure bottlenecks/damages. As climate change increases the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events (particularly hurricanes), Cheniere may face a greater likelihood of infrastructure damage as a result of its Gulf Coast base of operations. Similarly, regional pipeline or gas infrastructure congestion can have a simultaneous negative impact on both the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi. This lack of geographical diversification creates a substantial risk for the company.

A further risk which Cheniere faces is the reliance on US-based natural gas (i.e. Henry Hub), thus exposing the company to dislocation between these prices and global LNG benchmarks. Cheniere's sales and purchase agreements are primarily linked to 115% of Henry Hub, such that disproportionate spikes can decrease the economic feasibility of spot market deals. Other companies use indexed trading prices, making them less vulnerable to US-specific gas markets.

The aging of regassification assets which still generate revenue may be another risk, since it is functionally redundant and has low utility. The unclear plans for its future may hinder Cheniere's adaptability to new scenarios. This is amplified by its lack of synergy with LNG exports - the core business model of the company. Maintaining a rapidly depreciating asset, and increasingly high potential for early termination due to low utilisation could be a significant hit for Cheniere. Interestingly, however, its low importance relative to the core model may minimise this risk, though it is recommended that this is taken into consideration, since other LNG producers don't typically carry this type of legacy regas asset on the balance sheet. Connected to this may be the age of integral assets to the company. Sabine Pass began exports in 2016, and is thus entering the middle of its useful lifetime. Expansion or updates to this site offer risks in terms of ease of integration, as well as potential complications with FERC re-approval for such actions. Other companies (for example NextDecade and QatarEnergy's expansion plans) are constructing infrastructure on greenfield sites, typically less susceptible to such risks. This could lead to eventual loss of market leadership to more dynamic companies (a pattern that has been seen across industries).

Another risk arises from potential misalignment of interest between Cheniere Energy Partners CQP and Cheniere Energy LNG in the decisions made regarding Sabine Pass. CQP is a publicly traded master limited partnership, and this form of ownership structure is unlike most other international LNG players, which own their assets directly or through 100%-owned subsidiaries. For Cheniere, this can complicate cash flows but more importantly, this could affect the expansion or dividend policy, something potentially compounded by the aging, brownfield nature of the Sabine Pass site.

A final risk comes from further LNG infrastructure in the Americas, such as Shell's LNG Canada in British Columbia serving Asia, and St. Lawrence River LNG projects in Quebec serving Europe. That's in addition to Argentina LNG, a joint venture between YPF and Eni.

Now to opportunities: a first opportunity is the novel agreement between Cheniere and JERA, an energy major of Japan. This is a first of its kind agreement, since Cheniere has previously been absent from Japan's energy market. JERA plans to contract around 1 MTPA across the Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi complex from around 2030 under a 20-year agreement. This will expand Cheniere's access into the Asia-Pacific markets, where there is growing demand for LNG, whilst also boosting the company's revenue resilience through the large SPA.

A second opportunity for Cheniere is the recent final investment decision for two more trains at the Corpus Christi complexes. It is predicted that these will expand the capacity of the site by a further 5 MTPA and raise the forecasted platform capacity to 60-63 MTPA by mid to late 2030s. This is through both direct and indirect support, since 20% of the increased capacity is stated to arise from debottlenecking effects, whilst 3 MTPA will come from the trains themselves. These trains will generate incremental EBITDA through contribution to long-term fixed fee revenue. The project supports a structured use of $25 billion of capital through 2030, which will cover the expansion alongside debt repayment, dividends, and share purchases. Personally, I believe this suggests discipline from management since repayment is balanced against the expansion itself. A risk with this expansion, however, is the capital risk and timeline slippage that occurs with a necessarily large investment such as this. The company forecasts EBITDA of $6.7 to $7.3 billion and distributable cash flow of $3.9 to $4.3 billion annually.

A third opportunity of growing revenue for Cheniere will likely come from a new 15-year gas supply deal with Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) for 0.85 MTPA. This agreement has a direct correlation to favourable Henry Hub - JKM spreads. The agreement essentially has secured gas supply from a creditworthy source outside of the US, diversifying from typical energy sources (HH). This will increase supply optionality, improving insurance effects particularly in a world with an unstable U.S. economy. This also will broaden the LNG marketing aspect of the company's revenue stream by tying volumes to JKM prices, potentially facilitating price leverage, important where JKM often outpaces HH.

The respected hedge funds D.E. Shaw & Co and Two Sigma Investments are owners of Cheniere Energy, as per the most recent 13F filings. Famed value investor Dimensional Fund Advisors is also a shareholder, owning just under 1% of the Cheniere Energy.

Valuation & Peers

Venture Global (VG) is Cheniere Energy's closest peer in that it is also a US LNG exporter owning liquefaction facilities. Cheniere Energy trades on a trailing P/E of 17, while Venture Global trades on a trailing P/E of 33. VG's higher P/E is likely due to its aggressive growth plans at its Plaquemines project with commercial operation date of Phase I expected to be 2026 and commercial operation date of Phase II in 2027.

In terms of next 12 months EV/EBITDA, according to LSEG estimates, Cheniere Energy and Venture Global trade on similar multiples of just under 11x.

As a point of reference, other large cap stocks in the Oil and Gas Storage and Transportation sector, such as Williams (WMB), ONEOK (OKE), and Kinder Morgan (KMI) trade in a 10-12x range for next 12 months EV/EBITDA, according to LSEG estimates, though these three companies are more exposed pipeline services.

It is worth noting however, that Venture Global has various customer arbitrations are ongoing with initial rulings anticipated in the second half of this year. There is the potential that Venture Global could pay significant damages if found in breach of contract. In my opinion, given Cheniere Energy's longer track record and I believe greater inherent stability and lower risk, it should trade at a slight EV/EBITDA premium to Venture Global. With the LNG demand pull from the rest of the world, there's no reason Cheniere could not trade at the 12x multiple that Williams enjoys.

NextDecade Corp (NEXT) is another pure play US LNG exporter, however it is still in the construction stage, so doesn't have any revenue or earnings to compare.

S&P 500 inclusion?

As of 30 June 2025, Cheniere Energy is the seventh largest energy company by float adjusted market capitalization in the MSCI USA index, a rules driven index many institutional investors use as a benchmark. Cheniere Energy is ahead of S&P 500 constituents Marathan Petroleum (MPC), Oneok (OKE), and Phillips 66 (PSX) in the MSCI USA.

However, for an unknown reason, the S&P 500 index committee has still not included Cheniere in the most famous index, which is widely tracked by exchange traded funds. Perhaps, once Hess Corp (HES) gets delisted if it does get acquired by Chevron (CVX), then the S&P committee will replace Hess with Cheniere, which will create a lot of buying in Cheniere Energy's stock.

Conclusion

Although Cheniere Energy is a little exposed to the spreads between natural gas prices in the United States and Europe and Asia, its robust long term contracts and solid history of good operating performance mean that the company is a very robust energy infrastructure play in the era of America's energy dominance. Export growth will lead to revenue growth and earnings growth. With the demise of the Russian natural gas giant Gazprom's supply contracts to Europe, Cheniere Energy is stepping in to help fill to that massive void and become a world class supplier to global energy markets.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 18:04:51.547332

Armada has raised $131 million in strategic funding from investors including Pinegrove, Veriten, Glade Brook, and Microsoft’s M12, coinciding with the launch of Leviathan, a megawatt-scale ruggedized data center module for edge AI deployment.

Leviathan delivers 10x more compute than previous Armada products, is powered by the Armada Edge Platform, and can be rapidly deployed in remote, energy-rich environments using solar, nuclear, or stranded natural gas.

The launch supports Armada’s mission to strengthen U.S. AI and energy dominance by enabling fast, flexible, sovereign infrastructure at the edge, competing with China’s global AI ambitions.

PRESS RELEASE — Armada, the hyperscaler for the edge, has announced a $131 million strategic funding round with new strategic investors including Pinegrove, Veriten, and Glade Brook as well as participation from existing investors including Founders Fund, Lux Capital, Shield Capital, 8090 Industries, M12 (Microsoft’s Venture Fund), Overmatch, Silent Ventures, Felicis, and Marlinspike. This latest investment round coincides with the launch of Leviathan, a first-of-its-kind ruggedized MDC designed for fast, flexible deployment, enabling megawatt-scale computing power in the world’s most contested and communications-challenged areas. With Leviathan, Armada is taking a major step to advance American leadership in energy and AI through an alternative approach that enables distributed AI training and inference. Leviathan joins the Galleon product line and offers 10x more compute power than Armada’s next-largest form factor.

“American energy and AI dominance hinges on one thing: moving massive compute to the edge — fast — where data and low-cost power live,” said Dan Wright, Co-Founder and CEO of Armada. “Leviathan, the newest member of our Galleon product line, does exactly that. Each unit delivers megawatt-scale performance in a fraction of the time and much more flexibly than traditional data centers, due to their ability to rapidly adapt to changes in AI chips and cooling, and co-locate with all available land and energy, regardless of its form or location. This latest product launch and funding further accelerate our mission to bridge the digital divide and ensure that the world runs on the American AI stack.”

Leviathan, the larger counterpart to Armada’s Triton data center in the Galleon product line, has ten times the amount of compute capacity at megawatt scale. Powered by the Armada Edge Platform (AEP), Leviathan delivers autonomous compute and real-world AI with speed, resilience, and reliability. Leviathan is adaptable to customer requirements, designed for scalability with the ability to relocate between locations and markets as customer requirements evolve. Deployable in remote, mission-critical environments, Leviathan can be co-located with stranded natural gas, solar, nuclear, or other alternative energy sources. It can be operational in weeks, eliminating traditional data centers’ long timelines and site limitations. As China ramps up efforts to export its AI stack and races to control the compute and energy supply chains of the future, the U.S. and its allies must move faster. Leviathan gives America the infrastructure advantage — modular, sovereign, and ready to deploy — so the U.S. can lead not just in AI development, but in the physical systems that power it. Leviathan enables AI-era dominance by delivering rapid compute power without the heavy infrastructure demands of traditional data centers.

“From day one, we backed Armada because they saw what others missed: America’s AI leadership hinges on owning the entire stack — from power and silicon to software — and being able to deploy it anywhere,” said Trae’ Stephens, Partner at Founders Fund and early Armada backer. “Leviathan drives that vision forward, expanding the Galleon lineup from suitcase-sized edge nodes for lightweight analytics and inference to megawatt-scale modules that can train and serve frontier models in the harshest environments. With a Galleon for every workload, Armada keeps U.S. and allied AI efforts a step ahead.”

The launch advances Armada’s broader vision for distributed, sovereign AI infrastructure, as outlined in a recent white paper detailing the need to tightly couple energy and compute to sustain U.S. leadership in the global AI race. Armada is partnering with organizations such as Fidelis New Energy and Bakken Energy to deploy Leviathans in strategic locations across the U.S. and allied territories — including North Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, and Louisiana — where surplus power can be converted into high-density compute.

“Leviathan embodies our belief that hardware should behave like software: deployable, upgradeable, and governed entirely by code,” said Pradeep Nair, Founding CTO of Armada. “Paired with the turnkey Armada Edge Platform and its growing Marketplace of AI models and applications, Leviathan’s liquid-cooled, energy-agnostic modules deliver megawatt-scale training and inference in weeks — bridging the digital divide by bringing AI straight to the edge, where data and power already live.”

NRECA and its member co-ops have been strong advocates for improving FEMA while keeping the agency intact.
The FEMA reform bill would greatly reduce the amount of time it takes for co-ops to receive reimbursements from the agency.
As the FEMA reform bill continues through the process, NRECA will work to make it even better for co-ops, Mitchell said.
“But the solution is not to tear FEMA down—it’s to work across the aisle to build FEMA up.","NRECA is supporting a new bipartisan bill that would streamline the Federal Emergency Management Agency and speed up delivery of crucial disaster relief funds to electric cooperatives hit hard by hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and other catastrophes.

The Fixing Emergency Management for Americans (FEMA) Act of 2025 would keep in place FEMA’s essential Public Assistance program, which provides money to co-ops to restore power and rebuild their systems after natural disasters. Without those funds, NRECA says, rebuilding would take much longer and raise costs sharply for rural communities.

NRECA and its member co-ops have been strong advocates for improving FEMA while keeping the agency intact.

The FEMA reform bill would greatly reduce the amount of time it takes for co-ops to receive reimbursements from the agency.

Specifically, it would direct the FEMA administrator to reimburse a co-op for emergency work no later than 120 days after it submits a request. The president would first need to determine that at least 90% of estimated costs are eligible for reimbursement, said Will Mitchell, a NRECA legislative affairs director who lobbies Congress on FEMA issues.

For longer-term projects to rebuild or replace infrastructure, the bill would require FEMA to review within 90 days a co-op’s cost estimate of the work that needs to be done, Mitchell said. After that, the agency would have 30 days to disburse the funds for the project.

“That would be a huge change in the timeline,” Mitchell said. “Right now, most co-ops are waiting years for reimbursement.”

Another big improvement, he said, is that co-ops would be allowed to build stronger, more resilient systems in the aftermath of disasters rather than being forced by the agency to build everything back exactly as it was before.

NRECA CEO Jim Matheson called FEMA “a crucial partner” in efforts to restore power after disaster strikes. The legislation would remove FEMA from the Department of Homeland Security and return it to its former status as an independent agency that reports directly to the president.

“Reforming FEMA into a stronger, more responsive agency will help strengthen rural resilience, protect taxpayer dollars and ensure essential services are restored as quickly as possible after a disaster,” Matheson said.

Sponsors from the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee introduced the legislation on July 23—the day the House adjourned for its summer recess. The committee is expected to have hearings on the bill after Congress returns to the nation’s capital in September. The panel will then vote on whether to send it to the full House for consideration.

If passed by the House, the legislation would still need to be approved by the Senate and signed into law by President Donald Trump.

As the FEMA reform bill continues through the process, NRECA will work to make it even better for co-ops, Mitchell said.

Specifically, he said, NRECA will lobby for a provision to make co-ops eligible to be reimbursed for the interest they must pay on loans to rebuild their systems while they wait to receive disaster funds from FEMA.

In most cases, not-for-profit co-ops have no choice but to pass those interest costs on to their consumer-members, many of whom live in rural communities with high poverty rates.

Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves, R-Mo., one of the lead sponsors of the bill, said “the American people need an emergency management system that works quickly and effectively, not one that makes disaster recovery more difficult.”

“This bill does more than any recent reforms to cut through the bureaucracy, streamline programs, provide flexibility, and return FEMA to its core purpose of empowering the states to lead and coordinating the federal response when it’s needed,” Graves said.

Rep. Greg Stanton of Arizona, the senior Democrat on the panel’s Economic Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management Subcommittee, said the bill would strengthen FEMA’s mission “to help Americans in their darkest hour.”

“The agency isn’t perfect, and its job is getting harder as disasters grow more frequent and more severe,” said Stanton, who is co-sponsoring the bill. “But the solution is not to tear FEMA down—it’s to work across the aisle to build FEMA up. This bipartisan bill takes commonsense steps to streamline the agency and make sure communities get disaster assistance quickly, efficiently and fairly.”

The new rates could accelerate the adoption of heat pumps in Massachusetts and boost progress toward the state’s climate goals, proponents say.
“We want to spread awareness of how helpful and commonsense this is,” Amanda Sachs, policy associate with electrification nonprofit Rewiring America, said during a webinar this week on seasonal heat pump rates.
That, say climate advocates, is where seasonal heat pump rates come in.
Massachusetts has already taken steps to start closing that gap with discounted electricity prices for homes using heat pumps.","Massachusetts regulators are considering a plan to make heat pumps an obvious financial choice for most residents.

The state Department of Public Utilities is mulling a proposal to heavily discount electricity rates in the winter months for households with heat pumps, a move that could cut energy bills for more than 80% of residents who switch over to the efficient, electric appliance from fossil-fueled or electric resistance heating. For many of those households, the savings would amount to hundreds or even thousands of dollars each winter.

Massachusetts utilities already plan to lower prices for heat pump users starting this winter, but the proposal under consideration would mandate even deeper discounts in future years. The new rates could accelerate the adoption of heat pumps in Massachusetts and boost progress toward the state’s climate goals, proponents say.

And with President Donald Trump’s megabill eliminating federal tax credits at the end of this year for homeowners who install heat pumps, the approach is a timely demonstration of how states can drive heat pump adoption in the absence of federal support.

“We want to spread awareness of how helpful and commonsense this is,” Amanda Sachs, policy associate with electrification nonprofit Rewiring America, said during a webinar this week on seasonal heat pump rates. “Massachusetts is offering more than a pilot; it’s offering a playbook.”

In Massachusetts and other states with ambitious climate goals, transitioning residents from fossil-fueled heating to heat pumps — which can both warm and cool buildings — is a major strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the cost of buying and operating a heat pump has held back widespread adoption, particularly in areas like New England, where cold winters and high electricity prices collide.

“If we don’t figure out the affordability issues, we diminish the likelihood that we will reach our climate goals in Massachusetts,” said Jolette Westbrook, director and senior attorney for regulatory solutions at the Environmental Defense Fund.

Today, nearly 80% of Massachusetts homes are heated with natural gas, heating oil, or propane, and many of the remaining households use inefficient electric resistance heating. Slightly more than 90,000 homes in the state installed heat pumps using incentives from energy-efficiency program Mass Save between 2021 and September 2024. The actual total, including homes that did not use Mass Save programs, is likely higher. Still, the annual adoption rate will have to double in order for Massachusetts to meet its goal of deploying heat pumps in 500,000 homes between 2020 and 2030.

That, say climate advocates, is where seasonal heat pump rates come in.

Making heat pump operation affordable

Under current default electric rates, roughly three in four Massachusetts homes switching from natural-gas heating to heat pumps would end up with higher energy bills, according to an analysis released this week by climate think tank Switchbox. Indeed, 30% of households making that move would see their total cost for a winter heating season go up more than $1,000, the report finds.

“You hear that heat pumps can’t compete with natural gas, because gas is cheaper. That bit of conventional wisdom is true,” said Switchbox’s executive director, Juan-Pablo Velez.

Massachusetts has already taken steps to start closing that gap with discounted electricity prices for homes using heat pumps. Regulators approved the lower rates proposed by two of the state’s investor-owned electric utilities, Unitil and National Grid, in June 2024 and February 2025, respectively; the third, Eversource, submitted its own proposed rates in April, and they are widely expected to be approved.

The planned discounts range from 4 cents to 7 cents per kilowatt-hour on the delivery portion of the bill — which pays for poles, wires, and other infrastructure — rather than the supply portion that pays for the electricity itself. The lower rate will apply to all of a home’s electricity usage during the winter heating season. Utilities will automatically sign up households that received incentives for heat pump installations through Mass Save, the state’s energy-efficiency program, and homeowners can also reach out to their power provider to enroll in the rate.",https://www.greenenergyconsumers.org/themes/ecane/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-28 20:01:10.515444

PJM isn’t the only U.S. regional grid operator struggling to get new power plants, solar and wind farms, and grid-scale batteries connected.
That’s the first such increase in the past four auctions, and a fraction of PJM’s roughly 180 GW of generation capacity.
The main reason coal plants are closing is that they are increasingly unable to compete in energy markets against cheaper gas-fired power plants, renewable energy, and batteries.
PJM noted last week that 1.1 GW of power plants have withdrawn their retirement plans since last year’s auction.","The country’s biggest power market is caught in a trap of its own making — and the more than 65 million people from the mid-Atlantic coast to the Great Lakes who rely on it for electricity will pay the price.

Last week, PJM Interconnection announced a new record in its annual capacity auction, the means by which the grid operator secures the resources it needs to maintain a reliable transmission grid across 13 states and Washington, D.C. Prices increased to $16.1 billion, up from last year’s already record-setting $14.7 billion and an eightfold increase compared to $2.2 billion for the 2023 auction.

Prices would have spiked even further if not for a cap instituted as part of a settlement agreement with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) reached in April. Even so, PJM estimates that residential customers could see utility bills rise by up to 5% in the years to come, or more than $100 in annual household costs — rate hikes that will occur on top of bill increases just now starting to hit customers as the result of last year’s auction.

These spiraling costs have galvanized both Republican and Democratic governors of states served by PJM to demand immediate reforms. ​“With billions of ratepayer dollars and the stability of our grid at stake, it is critical that PJM take concerted, effective action to restore state and stakeholder confidence,” governors from Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Virginia wrote in a July letter to the grid operator.

But it’s unclear whether PJM can quickly solve the problems that are driving up costs. That’s because the core issue — barely any new generation capacity has been able to connect to the grid — will take years to resolve.

“You have a massive technical problem, which is the challenge to fix this broken interconnection queue and bring new resources online in a time of global uncertainty with tariffs, inflation, and supply chain issues that are slowing the construction and development of new generation resources,” Jon Gordon, a director at clean-energy trade group Advanced Energy United, said in a webinar last week dissecting the grid operator’s current predicament.

PJM isn’t the only U.S. regional grid operator struggling to get new power plants, solar and wind farms, and grid-scale batteries connected. But it has one of the worst track records, with projects taking an average of more than five years to move through the steps required to plug into the grid. Advanced Energy United gave PJM a D- score for its interconnection processes in a 2024 survey, the lowest of any U.S. grid operator.

The consequence has been a paltry amount of new generation and battery storage. PJM reported last week that about 2.7 gigawatts of new generation and ​“uprates” — existing projects that have augmented their capacity — had been added to its available pool of resources since its last auction. That’s the first such increase in the past four auctions, and a fraction of PJM’s roughly 180 GW of generation capacity.

Nor is PJM winning high marks for its efforts to fix its interconnection backlog. Critics say the grid operator has stalled on reforms that others have undertaken, including changes mandated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Last week, FERC ordered PJM to rework ​“conceptual proposals” that it said fail to meet federally mandated deadlines for implementing interconnection reforms.

In 2022, PJM froze the process for new projects seeking interconnection to deal with a backlog stretching back to the late 2010s. That backlog won’t be cleared until the end of 2026, leaving hundreds of gigawatts of prospective new supply in limbo.

“The market can’t work until the interconnection queue delay is fixed,” Clara Summers, campaign manager for the Citizens Utility Board, an Illinois-based utility customer watchdog group, said during last week’s webinar. An April study from research firm Synapse Energy Economics found that comprehensive interconnection reforms at PJM could save customers an average of $505 per year in utility bills and cut commercial and industrial electricity costs by 23% through 2040.

PJM noted in last week’s press release that it has processed more than 60% of the backlog in its interconnection queue. It also highlighted that more than 46 GW of ​“already-approved resources have yet to be built,” with many projects ​“navigating challenges outside PJM’s scope, such as permitting timelines, supply chain constraints and evolving project economics.”

Gordon pointed out that PJM’s interconnection bottlenecks have put energy developers in a very tough position. Nearly 95% of the grid operator’s backlog consists of solar, wind, and battery projects, and ​“many of those projects came into the queue pre-COVID,” he said.

Since then, interest rates have gone up dramatically, equipment costs have risen, and the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have undone federal incentives and policies supporting clean energy growth. ​“Whatever those developers were thinking about those projects back then, the economics, everything has completely changed,” he said.

Booming demand makes matters worse

The forecasted demand for electricity on PJM’s grid has also increased enormously in the past four years. The AI bubble has driven up PJM’s projected load growth by 5.5 GW from last year’s auction, largely due to new plans for data centers in the region.

But PJM may not be applying the proper amount of skepticism to calculating future demand growth from data centers, said Abe Silverman, an attorney, energy consultant, and research scholar at Johns Hopkins University.

Many data center developers are seeking interconnection in multiple states for duplicative project proposals, he noted. Other U.S. grid operators are ​“doing a much better job trying to get a handle on the data center load growth,” including winnowing out speculative or duplicative requests, he said during last week’s webinar.

Without such safeguards, PJM runs the risk of overestimating the amount of new generation it will need to meet future demand, which will drive up prices, Silverman said. ​“If you believe the PJM load forecast, we need to add five nuclear units’ worth of generation to the market every year between now and 2030. And that’s just an enormous challenge, both financially and logistically.”

In the face of these issues, PJM has largely emphasized the need to keep fossil-fueled power plants online and has blamed state clean-energy policies for driving coal-fired power plants to close prematurely.

That argument has been echoed by Todd Snitchler, CEO and president of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group representing power plant operators with a preponderance of fossil-gas power plants in their portfolios.

“In recent years, a combination of state and federal policy shifts and poor market signals led to the premature retirement of essential generation,” Snitchler said in a statement after this month’s auction. ​“Now, as demand grows and supply tightens, we can’t ignore the consequences of past decisions, and we must accept that reliability comes at a cost.”

About 34 GW of coal capacity have retired across PJM since 2013, according to federal data. PJM’s independent market monitor forecast last year that as much as 58 gigawatts of generation will be retired by 2030.

But Citizens Utility Board has emphasized that those retirements are happening in both Republican-led states without clean-energy and climate mandates, including Ohio and West Virginia, as well as in Democrat-led states such as Maryland and New Jersey, indicating that state policies aren’t the chief driver. The main reason coal plants are closing is that they are increasingly unable to compete in energy markets against cheaper gas-fired power plants, renewable energy, and batteries.

Growing power demand is starting to slow the pace of closures. PJM noted last week that 1.1 GW of power plants have withdrawn their retirement plans since last year’s auction. PJM has also forced fossil-fueled power plants in Maryland that were set to close this year to remain open to maintain grid reliability.

The Trump administration may cite PJM’s growing capacity problems to justify using emergency federal powers to require aging fossil-fueled power plants to remain running. The Department of Energy has already used those powers to demand that a coal plant in Michigan stay open, as well as an oil- and gas-fired power plant in Pennsylvania — a move that PJM has publicly supported and that climate and consumer advocates are challenging.

At the same time, PJM has yet to advance near-term options for bringing power online quickly, Summers said. PJM’s proposal to reuse the grid connections left open at retiring plants for new resources, such as batteries, is still awaiting FERC approval, she said.

In February, FERC approved PJM’s plans to revamp another process known as ​“surplus interconnection service,” which allows existing projects to add new technologies to boost their grid value — for example, adding batteries to wind and solar farms. But the changes have not yet led to new capacity being brought into the market, Summers said.

Meanwhile, PJM’s attempt to fast-track new gas-fired generation won’t help in the near term, Summers said. In May, the grid operator announced 51 new projects selected through its Reliability Resource Initiative, which allows projects not already in the interconnection queue to propose additional resources to meet capacity needs. But most of the 9.4 GW of capacity secured through that process — and all of the newly built gas-fired power plant capacity — isn’t scheduled to be online until 2030 or later.

That’s not surprising. Major manufacturers have reported multiyear backlogs for gas turbines, restricting developers’ ability to add more capacity beyond what’s already in the works. These bottlenecks are likely to hamper similar fast-track efforts being undertaken by grid operators Midcontinent Independent System Operator and Southwest Power Pool.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-2197309766.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=ac596878efe437074ac489623ddf81ce,N,,2025-07-28 17:05:27.083341

The project is a historic landmark, representing the largest single-phase project finance ever witnessed in the history of the global energy sector.

This is Venture Global’s third major liquefied natural gas (LNG) development following Calcasieu Pass and Plaquemines LNG, the CP2 LNG project is in process. When commissioned, CP2 will have a production capacity of 28 million tonnes per year (MTPA). Venture Global is cemented as a world energy leader by this. Venture Global has 43.5 MTPA contracted LNG capacity with its other two projects.

CP2 Phase 1

CP2 Phase 1 is now fully financed through long-term purchase and sales agreements (SPAs) from European, Asian, and other international customers, which emphasizes the terminal’s strategic importance to global energy security.

“Project CP2 is the most advanced project ever presented to FID in our company’s history,” commented Venture Global CEO Mike Sabel. “We are proud to have capitalized on FID on our third greenfield LNG project within a span of fewer than six years,” stated Sabel. “This achievement is a testament to more than $80 billion in executed capital markets transactions and the hard work of our team. With CP2, we are well-positioned to start delivering reliable American LNG to international partners as early as 2027.”

What makes the project noteworthy is not only its scale but the faith in funding it. All $15.1 billion was raised using debt, without any outside injection of equity. It was backed by a limited number of foreign banks, which together committed more than $34 billion in pledges. More than double the minimum asked for.

July 28, 2025

BILLINGS, Mont. – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a proposed plan to mitigate health risks at the Billings PCE Superfund site. This proposal recommends installing mitigation systems in homes and businesses within the site boundaries to reduce exposure to harmful chemical vapors.

“This proposed plan is a major first step in the Superfund process to reduce health risks and clean up contamination,” said EPA Regional Administrator Cyrus Western. “It demonstrates EPA’s commitment to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, delivering direct benefits for those who live, work and go to school in the Billings area.”

The proposed systems consist of pipes and a fan that channel vapors from a building’s basement to the outside. These systems remove chemical vapors from indoor air and beneath building foundations, significantly reducing health risks associated with chemicals such as PCE. EPA’s proposed plan will provide protection for people while EPA does a longer study of the site and develops a plan to remove or contain the contamination in the soil and groundwater.

Under the proposal, EPA will be responsible for the equipment, installation and maintenance of the systems. Building owners will cover the electricity cost, comparable to running a 75-watt lightbulb continuously.

A public meeting is scheduled for August 27, 2025, at 5:30 p.m. at the Billings Public Library. The comment period is open today through September 26, 2025.

Following a public comment period, EPA will write a response to comments, questions and issues raised by the community and release a final plan called an Interim Record of Decision.

Background

The Billings PCE Superfund site covers 1,100 acres and runs through several neighborhoods east of downtown Billings. The site was contaminated in the past with PCE and other chemicals from dry cleaners and industrial sources. The chemicals from these businesses are in the soil and groundwater in parts of the city. Chemical vapors can build up under building foundations and possibly let small amounts of vapors into the indoor air. The mitigation systems vents these vapors outside the building, reducing the risk to people inside.",https://www.epa.gov/sites/all/themes/epa/img/epa-news-releases-og.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 15:00:18.137929

Mass production of 2170 battery cells began on 14 July, and Panasonic targets an annual production capacity of approximately 32 gigawatt hours (GWh).
That plant currently produces around 41GWh of battery cells per year and employs more than 4,000 workers.
It has shipped over 11bn battery cells to date.
Globally, the company produces 70 battery cells every second, which amounts to more than six million cells each day.","Panasonic has officially launched its new cylindrical lithium-ion battery production facility in De Soto, Kansas.

The factory spans 4.7 million square feet, making it one of the largest gigafactories currently operating in North America. Mass production of 2170 battery cells began on 14 July, and Panasonic targets an annual production capacity of approximately 32 gigawatt hours (GWh).

The Kansas site represents one of the largest single capital investments in the 107-year history of the company.

It also stands as the most substantial economic development project ever undertaken in the State of Kansas. Built on 300 acres — a footprint larger than 225 American football fields — the facility cost $4bn to construct and is projected to support up to 4,000 direct jobs.

A dual-region model for scaled production

The Kansas factory is a cornerstone in Panasonic Energy’s dual-region manufacturing model.

It complements the company's existing Nevada facility, which has been in operation since 2017. That plant currently produces around 41GWh of battery cells per year and employs more than 4,000 workers. It has shipped over 11bn battery cells to date.

With Kansas now in operation, Panasonic's North American production will approach 73GWh annually once full capacity is reached.

The additional volume supports a growing pipeline of demand from electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, who are increasing capacity to match policy direction and customer demand.

Kazuo Tadanobu, Chief Executive Officer of Panasonic Energy, says: “The opening of our Kansas Factory marks a major milestone in our journey to scale advanced battery production in the United States.

“This achievement would not have been possible without the strong support of our local partners and the State of Kansas. Together, we are accelerating the shift to electrification, reinforcing regional supply chains, and nurturing the next generation of battery talent.”

Productivity gains and cell improvements

The Kansas facility incorporates labour-saving production lines designed to deliver around 20% higher productivity compared to the Nevada site. The company plans to introduce cells with improved materials, targeting a five per cent increase in cell capacity.

Panasonic’s lithium-ion cells have a volumetric energy density of 800 watt-hours per litre (Wh/L). These cells have powered approximately 3.7 million EVs, with around 19bn units shipped globally as of March 2025.

The firm continues to maintain a clean safety record, with no vehicle recalls attributed to its battery products.

Market readiness and regional economic uplift

The De Soto facility enters the market as manufacturers look to ramp up EV output to align with state-level emissions mandates and global regulatory timelines.

While there is no US-wide requirement for phasing out petrol-based vehicles, states such as California have committed to banning internal combustion engine vehicle sales from 2035.

Panasonic is leveraging its 30-year experience in lithium-ion cell manufacturing to position itself as a key supplier for automotive original equipment manufacturers.

Globally, the company produces 70 battery cells every second, which amounts to more than six million cells each day.

Once at full capacity, the Kansas plant’s output could supply batteries for approximately 500,000 EVs annually. The economic benefits of the site extend beyond direct employment.

Panasonic estimates the total employment impact at around 8,000 jobs, factoring in roles across supply chains and service providers.

The company is also investing in long-term academic and industrial collaboration. It has partnered with the University of Kansas to support workforce development and advance battery technology research. Panasonic views this as a route to sustained economic contribution in De Soto and the broader region, while also playing a role in strengthening US-based manufacturing capabilities.

Physically, the scale of the facility is substantial. Three passenger aircraft could be lined up nose-to-tail within the factory’s central area, and walking every square foot would take close to 13 days. The dimensions of the building reflect the scale of Panasonic’s ambition for the region and the EV sector.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/fe71fa3d62528e2dcbe15cf936cc1f95:1bb7be22c52cb31b80e5d5e0e47889bd/panasonic-s-newly-opened-gigafactory-in-de-soto-kansas.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 15:00:05.286269

Environmental groups gathered over the weekend to mark the 15th anniversary of an oil spill into the Kalamazoo River. The message they delivered is this: That oil spill 15 years ago was a warning about what could happen if an oil pipeline that runs through the Great Lakes is not shut down.

Tented booths were set up to represent different groups that responded to what happened 15 years ago when Enbridge’s Line 6b burst. One-point-two million gallons of oil was recovered from that tar sands oil spill along more than 35 miles of the Kalamazoo River and one of its tributaries near Marshall, Michigan.

A report from the Federal On-Scene Coordinator extensively details the event and the damage, but residents say there was also a toll on them that is incalculable.

The Michigan Climate Action Network organized the event at the Historic Bridge Park near Battle Creek. That site was chosen because it was part of the long stretch of contaminated shoreline.

Denise Keele is the Executive Director of that group. She says no one has forgotten the damage caused by Line 6b. That’s why they worry about Line 5.

“The message remains the same: to shut down Line 5 and no oil tunnel. We are here today on the 15th anniversary of the Kalamazoo River oil spill so that history does not repeat itself. We should learn from our mistakes.”

Keele added the other mistake is perpetuating the use of fossil fuels that’s causing disruption of the Earth’s climate.

Local residents say they’ve paid a price because of the oil spill 15 years ago.

“The massive Enbridge oil spill into our Kalamazoo River was so toxic that when we went that day to see it firsthand, we quickly left, feeling ill from the smell. We knew it must never happen again,” said Iris Potter with the group Kalamazoo Remembers.

She said Michigan should learn from that experience as the state reviews permit applications from Enbridge for a proposed tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac to house a new segment of the 72-year-old the Line 5 pipeline.

“So now, just envision that in the Straits and beyond. A spill happens when you least expect it and quickly the beauty is gone. Believe me,” Potter said to the crowd and an online audience watching the speeches.

Nichole Keway Biber is the Mid-Michigan Organizer of Michigan Clean Water Action. She’s also a citizen of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. She noted that today Line 5 is more than 30 years older than Line 6b was when it ruptured.

“The many places that 645-mile-long pipeline crosses over waters is close by to the Great Lakes, beyond just the absurdity of that four-mile-stretch beneath the Straits. That’s all a threat. That pipeline is over 70-years-old,” Biber said.

Some of the environmental groups’ leaders spoke to those gathered at the event. Sean McBrearty is Coordinator of the Oil and Water Don’t Mix campaign. He talked about the Kalamazoo River oil spill and its legacy.

“This was entirely man-made. And it was only as big as it became because the negligence of the people who know, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the federal government are asking us to trust the Great Lakes with.”

He said that devastating Line 6b oil spill -one of the largest inland oil spills in the U.S.- spurred a movement.

“A movement that says never again are we going to let major corporations like Enbridge spill oil into our rivers. A movement that says we’re going to protect our Great Lakes. And make sure the same company responsible for this oil spill does not strike again, this time with a larger pipeline running more oil in the heart of the Great Lakes.”

Right now, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) is taking comments from the public on permit applications submitted by Enbridge. The company wants to tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac to house a new segment of Line 5. The current pipeline sits on the lakebed of the Straits that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.

Beth Wallace is the Great Lakes climate and energy director for the National Wildlife Federation. She said EGLE is falling short in its responsibilities. It should be reviewing what kind of environmental damage could be caused by tunneling under the Straits of Mackinac in addition to the impacts where the tunnel construction begins and ends above ground.

“Our own state agencies, the ones that were stuck here sucking oil out of the river, seem to be playing right into the hands (of Enbridge), refusing to properly assess risk for a pipeline that poses a disaster for 20 percent of the world’s (accessible) fresh water,” Wallace told the crowd.

She questioned whether the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy was fulfilling its obligations under the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act to review whether the drilling of the tunnel itself would have environmental impacts.

“Who are the decisions really serving? They’re not the people of Michigan. They’re not the tribes who have stewarded these waters for generations, and not the millions that rely on the Great Lakes.”

In a previous Michigan Public news story, EGLE said that during its review of the Enbridge Line 5 tunnel proposal, the top priority has been protecting the Straits of Mackinac and surrounding wetlands from adverse environmental impacts. The tunnel would hold a pipeline that carries petroleum products through an environmentally sensitive area, replacing the line that runs along the bottom of the straits.

EGLE added that The Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act is used primarily for construction projects on the bottomlands of the lake.

When asked what the groups were willing to do to stop Line 5 and the proposed tunnel, Wallace said if EGLE does not do its job fully, the National Wildlife Federation will take the agency to court.

Nichole Keway Biber with the Michigan Clean Water Action and member of the Little Traverse Band of Odawa responded to the question this way.

“Our indigenous people and our nations and our allies aren’t going to let this happen. We cannot. We cannot. So, if they want us to be up there camping out, and bring our drums, and bring our medicine, we’re ready to do that,” she said to cheers and applause of several of those gathered.

When asked for a comment regarding the concerns of the environmental groups, Enbridge responded:

“Enbridge’s commitment to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities continues to drive our work behind building the Great Lakes Tunnel, and locating a new, replacement section of the Line 5 pipeline inside the protection of the tunnel, deep under the lakebed.

We support and welcome the public comment process now underway. Public and stakeholder input is essential to the process and we look forward to hearing feedback and answering questions.”

EGLE is taking comments about the construction of the proposed tunnel and any concerns about environmental damage caused by it are being taken online or through the mail until August 29. You can learn more about the permits and leave comments here. Or you can submit comments by mail to:

EGLE, GDO-WRD

P.O. Box 30458

Lansing, Michigan 48909-7958

or by email to egleenbridge-public-comments@michigan.gov

Before that deadline, EGLE will hold a virtual and informal question and answer session on August 12 at 6:00 p.m. In a notice, EGLE said questions should be related to the proposed project and the permit application review.

A formal public hearing will also be online. It will be held on August 19 at 6:00 p.m. You can register for that meeting here.

Enbridge is among Michigan Public’s corporate supporters.

Organisers of a pro-Palestine rally have offered to delay their march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge after the New South Wales government said it would not support the protest. On Monday, the Sydney-based Palestine Action Group announced it wanted its rally to walk across the bridge to the US consulate this Sunday.

Scores of Palestinians have died of starvation in recent weeks. On Monday Palestinians in Gaza reacted with wariness after Israel began a limited, daily pause in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza to allow what Benjamin Netanyahu described as a “minimal” amount of aid into the territory.

The IRIS Program has evolved over time; its database was made publicly available in 1988 and there are now opportunities for public input into the IRIS process.
Critique of the IRIS Program is just one facet — there has been a long-standing assault on ORD’s assessment policies and assumptions used in ORD evaluations.
The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs.
A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws.","On July 18, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled out the “reorganization plan” for its Office of Research and Development (ORD). The stated goal of the plan is to reduce budget expenditures, improve “science,” and have EPA’s research activities better support the work of the media offices, including the Office of Water (OW), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), and Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). The EPA press release refers to the effort as a continuation of “comprehensive restructuring” that includes a reduction in force (RIF) for the ORD and a subsequent savings of hundreds of millions of dollars. The release also announced the creation of a new EPA office, the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES), with a mission to “prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,” but provided no further information on the new office.

To Administration supporters, this is the latest chapter in the long overdue reorganization of federal programs to help reduce costs and trim back the “administrative state.” To detractors, it is yet another broad attack on regulatory programs in general, especially those at EPA, and specifically targets the scientific work of EPA and its research office. ORD personnel reorganization was among the many ORD-specific recommendations outlined in the Project 2025 document. Critics of the Administration’s efforts to cut EPA’s budget and staffing see the reorganization of ORD and its associated staff cuts as part of the larger attempt to reduce protections of the environment and health at EPA and other government agencies — as part of the agenda to “gut” EPA programs generally, even if some program offices (including OCSPP) gain positions.

ORD’s work, especially its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), has been controversial for many years and the subject of intense industry and trade group criticism. Established in 1985 and revised periodically, the IRIS Program is an attempt at a uniform, agency-wide database of human health assessments for chemicals found in the environment that serves as the basis for regulatory actions across EPA. The goal is that each EPA program be consistent in its assessments and able to act according to the specific legislative requirements driving the work of the respective EPA offices. The IRIS Program has evolved over time; its database was made publicly available in 1988 and there are now opportunities for public input into the IRIS process. At its best, the IRIS Program is hailed by supporters as being an essential part of bridge-building between different forms of environmental science and the various offices of EPA.

IRIS critics, however, have claimed for years that the program is overly conservative in its assessment assumptions, biased in its selection of information evaluated, and secretive in avoiding public scrutiny of its underlying work and assumptions. A January 27, 2025, letter organized by the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and signed by over 80 organizations affected by the work of the IRIS Program asserts:

IRIS has often fallen short of scientific standards required of EPA and is out of step with global health agencies and regulators. IRIS fails to adequately incorporate high quality and relevant science and does not consistently utilize a “weight of the scientific evidence” approach. Also, the process IRIS uses to prioritize and select chemicals for assessment lacks transparency.

For years, ORD has been subject to legislation introduced in Congress in response to the assertion of critics, most recently the “No IRIS” Act introduced in the House and Senate in February 2025 (H.R. 1415 and S. 623, respectively). The IRIS Program has been reviewed by the General Accountability Office (GAO) at various times over the years and found to indeed have program deficiencies (e.g., timeliness, lack of guidance) cited by critics as evidence of its ineffectiveness. EPA has implemented actions to satisfy the recommendations made by GAO, but some stakeholders remain very critical.

Critique of the IRIS Program is just one facet — there has been a long-standing assault on ORD’s assessment policies and assumptions used in ORD evaluations. In February 2025, partly in response to this sustained assault, EPA employees and supporters created Stand Up for Science. This grassroots movement turned non-profit organization has hosted rallies, created policy goals, and garnered media attention. Of note, the Stand Up for Science website hosts the public Declaration of Dissent, signed by EPA staff and members of the public, and invites visitors to add their name to the Declaration. The Declaration itself is addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and highlights five main concerns. Concern number four is “Dismantling the Office of Research and Development.” The Declaration states that the proposed ORD reorganization will make “EPA science more vulnerable to political interference,” and cites the proposed budget cuts for 2026 as leaving “ORD unable to meet the science needs of the EPA and its partners” and in a place that “will threaten the health of all Americans.”

What any reorganization of ORD or reform of science activities and policies will have to confront is the requirement for a scientific basis at the heart of any regulatory decision. Regardless of presidential priorities or allocated budgets, much of EPA’s work will remain dependent on the underlying science supporting whatever regulatory conclusions are proposed. Those programmatic conclusions will then be subject to public review and comment as part of the fundamental regulatory development process. In the end, even if ORD, as a separate program office, is taken off the EPA organization chart, the need to coordinate science policies and review procedures across EPA programs will remain. The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs. A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws. That centralized science function was developed over time to reduce, and ideally eliminate, inconsistent science and avoid overlapping, unsupported, or inadequate requirements.

After the reorganization and budget allocations are settled, it is not clear what procedures or administrators will fill those needed functions of integration, coordination, and consistency. Debates, especially high-profile controversies, are often more about the derivative outcomes of an assessment masking as debates than about the underlying data and evaluation procedures. Reorganizing the pieces on the chess board will not resolve or avoid such debates in the future.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15432_3114.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 15:00:21.948442

Before diving deep, let’s get the jargon out of the way: Alpitronic makes the physical chargers themselves. It supplies this equipment to large networks like Electrify America, which then operate and maintain the stations. Some players, like Tesla and ChargePoint, take a more vertical approach by building and running their own equipment.

Alpitronic is focused on what it does best, building the stalls. It is already the backbone of Europe's charging ecosystem, powering some of the continent’s largest charging networks, including Ionity and Fastned.

Now, it has quietly become America’s second-largest charging hardware supplier behind Tesla, according to data from charging analytics firm Paren that was provided to InsideEVs.

Alpitronic dispensers are projected to account for 12% of U.S. public fast-charging stations deployed in 2025, second only to Tesla (36%) and ahead of ChargePoint (9%) and BTC Power (8%). Again, these numbers are for the hardware suppliers themselves, not the larger networks.

Its market share was zero last year, so that’s an impressive achievement.

Over the past 12 months, Alpitronic has inked deals with a growing roster of American partners in quick succession. That includes Ionna, Walmart, Mercedes-Benz High Power Charging, Electrify America, BP Pulse and Greenlane, which is developing a charging network for commercial truck fleets.

So, why are so many charging networks racing to deploy Alpitronic hardware? What makes these stalls stand out from a Tesla Supercharger or a ChargePoint station? And how did this company grow so fast in such a short time?

How Alpitronic Quickly Grew In The U.S.

“When they got into the fast charging hardware business, they started working with many European companies,” Loren McDonald, the chief analyst at Paren, told InsideEVs.

Its proven track record in Europe, along with cutting-edge tech and reliability, has now turned the company into America’s de facto charger supplier other than Tesla. It opened its U.S. headquarters in Charlotte in 2023 and also has a local production facility in Wisconsin.

Alpitronic’s European customers urged it to enter the U.S. “They literally came to the U.S. with orders in hand,” he added.

If you’ve driven an EV in Europe, or the Southern U.S. in places such as Charlotte or the Texas triangle, you’ve probably used one of the Alpitronic stalls.

Their sleek rectangular dispensers feature dual cables suspended from the top and a large screen on the side. They support both the Tesla-style North American Charging System (NACS) plug and the Combined Charging System (CCS) plug while delivering up to 400 kilowatts of power. That far exceeds what most EVs in the U.S. can even accept today, though newer models such as the Lucid Gravity are capable of charging at 400 kW.

The screens display key charging statistics such as speed and cost. They even show the charging curve that EV nerds love to monitor. Following in the footsteps of some Chinese automakers and charge-point operators, it even has plans to deploy megawatt chargers in Europe in the second half of this year.

Now, Alpitronic is supercharging America’s charger deployment and reliability with the kind of momentum Tesla once carried alone.

“The U.S. is one of our most strategic markets globally, and we’re investing accordingly in local support, production capacity and service infrastructure to match that demand,” Mike Doucleff, the President of Alpitronic Americas, told InsideEVs.

In September 2023, Alpitronic opened its U.S. headquarters in Charlotte and installed a bunch of 400 kW stations at the site, drawing eyeballs from the EV charging community, as YouTube channel Out Of Spec Bits first reported.

But Ionna catapulted the company into the spotlight. Ionna is the newly-formed EV charging consortium supported by eight major automakers in the U.S., including General Motors, Stellantis, Toyota and Hyundai. The consortium is building a premium gas station-like experience for EVs. Ionna’s “Rechargeries” features amenities like cafes, Wi-Fi, and workspaces. They exclusively use Alpitronic HYC 400 chargers.

Ionna Rechargery: Apex, North Carolina

Ionna is expanding at warp speed, too. It was formed in February 2024. After launching its first “rechargery” early this year in Apex, North Carolina, it already has 200+ stalls operational as of July, with 400 more under construction.

Alpitronic is now helping all these networks stitch together a more reliable and fast charging service—just as it did in Europe, where reliable and widespread public charging has helped accelerate EV adoption.

What Makes Its Chargers Unique?

EV charging isn’t as frictionless as refueling your gas car, but it’s getting there.

For years, EV drivers ran into frustrating issues such as broken stations, damaged cables, payment failures and buggy software. Extreme heat or frigid winters made matters worse. I’ve run into broken Electrify America and EVGo stations at least half a dozen times within the past 12 months, although both those networks have significantly improved more recently. And charging keeps improving rapidly overall.

Tesla Superchargers avoid most of these issues thanks to the company’s vertical integration and quick fixes—Tesla designs, manufactures and operates its own chargers. It has its own proprietary software running through them.

Even though Alpitronic is only a supplier and isn’t vertically integrated in the same way as Tesla, it’s leaning on technology and software to avoid downtime for its chargers. Fixing problems quickly or before they even occur is a focus for the company.

Just like the modern software-defined vehicle, Alpitronic’s chargers are software-defined, too.

“Every charger is connected to our backend (in addition to the operator's backend), enabling remote diagnostics, real-time monitoring, and over-the-air updates,” Doucleff said. “Many issues can even be resolved remotely without rolling a truck,” he added.

Remote diagnostics pinpoint the faulty part, allowing technicians to get to the location with the right replacement. That means fixes are usually quick, and defective components are returned for “root cause analysis, not patched on site.”

Alpitronic EV Chargers

Additionally, charging losses occur during high-voltage electricity transmission, starting from the moment the current flows from the charger through the cables to the EV’s battery pack. Alpitronic’s silicon carbide power modules help mitigate these losses.

“Compared to traditional silicon-based systems, silicon carbide allows our chargers to deliver higher power in a smaller footprint, generate less heat, and operate more quietly,” Doucleff said.

Alpitronic claims its HYC 400 chargers operate at 97.5% efficiency. So nearly all the energy you're billed for makes it into your car. That’s not always the case with other chargers, where a chunk of electricity vanishes into heat or gets lost in transmission, meaning you pay for power your battery never sees.

That's not to be mistaken for EV efficiency. EVs are far more efficient than gas cars, which convert less than a quarter of the fuel into actual propulsion. The rest disappears in combustion, drivetrain and transmission losses. EVs convert more than 90% of the battery energy into helping you move.

Can Alpitronic Continue To Grow Amid The EV Hostility?

Even though BloombergNEF has lowered its U.S. EV adoption forecast from 48% by 2030 to just 27% by the end of the decade, charging providers are preparing for the long term.

Plus, new players such as Mercedes-Benz High Power Charging and Walmart are increasingly focused on a charging experience that matches their brand identity, McDonald said.

If the owner of an EQS sedan or a BMW i7 gets a Temu-grade charging experience, that may end up hurting the brands. EV drivers may stop visiting Walmart if the chargers in the parking lot are broken. There's increasingly a financial case for improving America’s charging network.

Walmart has started using Alpitronic dispensers in its parking lots.

Still, Alpitronic said it was too early to disclose the total number of chargers it has sold or deployed in the U.S. It also declined to mention its uptime figures—the percentage of time when the chargers are functioning as intended and are not out of order.

“While we’re not disclosing exact numbers at this stage, I can say that we are moving from dozens of deployed units to hundreds of deployed units to thousands in a very short time—and this growth is just the beginning,” Doucleff said.

Its global charging network is already bigger than Tesla’s. As per publicly disclosed figures, the Texas automaker has deployed over 70,000 Superchargers worldwide. Alpitronic is well ahead with more than 86,000 stalls in use—most of which are in Europe.

Now that it’s backed by some of America’s largest charging networks, its reliable fast chargers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, and they might just be what helps the EV industry grow organically as federal support for EVs vanishes.

Like Hartford, East Hartford has high rates of poverty and childhood asthma.","Hartford Public Schools are one step closer to getting a fleet of electric school buses.

At their monthly Board of Directors’ meeting on July 25, Connecticut Green Bank officials unanimously approved a $1 million loan to the Hartford Board of Education and Autumn Transportation, the bus contractor of Hartford Public School system, to acquire 25 new electric buses by 2030.

In addition to this loan, Autumn Transportation was awarded a $9.7 million grant through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean School Bus Program and $837,000 in funding through the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP), according to CT Green Bank’s Senior Manager for Clean Transportation, Kevin Moss.

“First and foremost, this is an opportunity to unlock close to $10 million in investment in Hartford, which I think is really exciting in a moment where I think federal investment is really uncertain,” Moss said. “Furthermore, I think that this is just a great chance to get to get some momentum going with Hartford public schools with school bus electrification.”

Hartford is recognized as a low-income community and also meets the state’s environmental justice criteria for the 2030 electric school deployment goals. Almost 79% of students in Hartford Public Schools qualify for free or reduced-price meals.

Hartford also has environmental factors Green Bank officials hope this loan will help address: 16.8% of children in Hartford have asthma, which is more than twice the national average of 6.5%. In Connecticut, 12.3% of kids have asthma.

“You can see that reflected in air quality data there as well, related to nitrogen oxide and diesel particulate matter,” Moss said.

When comparing nitrogen dioxide and diesel particulate matter in the air with other places in the state, Hartford ranks in the 96th and 80th percentiles, respectively.

“We see a really strong public health and community impact opportunity with this investment,” Moss said. He later said, “We see the opportunity to do a lot of good with this 25-bus deployment.”

Autumn Transportation may be open to future collaboration with the Green Bank. According to Moss, officials have expressed interest in working with the Green Bank to further expand its electric bus fleet in the future.

“We hope this is just the first step in terms of working with both Autumn and the Hartford public schools,” he said.

The East Hartford Public School District officials have also struck an agreement with the Green Bank for funding to expand their own electric bus fleet.

Dattco, the school bus company that is contracted with the East Hartford Public School District, received a $400,000 grant from the EPA Clean School Bus Program to acquire two electric school buses. On top of that, Dattco has secured $80,000 in supplemental funds from DEEP for this program.

The Green Bank unanimously voted to enter a $1 million contract with Dattco where Dattco will make “mortgage-style payments” over a five-year period to pay back the loan, according to Moss.

Like Hartford, East Hartford has high rates of poverty and childhood asthma. Around 60% of students qualify for free or reduced-price meals in East Hartford, and nearly 20% of children in the area have asthma, according to Moss. When compared to the rest of the state, East Hartford falls within the 89th percentile for nitrogen dioxide in the air and the 70th percentile for diesel particulate matter.

“I think this is an example of us trying to make our electric school bus investments in an area, in a community where it will hopefully make the most difference,” Moss said.

Moss hopes that the agreement with East Hartford could be a launching point for agreements in other school districts in the state.

“We really see this as a great opportunity to begin working with Dattco… they’re one of the largest bus operators in Connecticut,” Moss said. “We just see them as a really key stakeholder to begin partnering with.”

What's happening?

India has experienced the earliest monsoon season in 16 years. Temperatures in May felt as hot as 118 degrees Fahrenheit. As a result, Goa's Forest Development Corporation has assessed that cashew yields in the coastal state have dropped 50% year over year. Mango yields are also down 30% compared to last year, which was in turn down 40% from the year prior.

While early monsoons have led to flood conditions that have caused fungal infections and fruit fly infestations in crops, other regions have simultaneously been dried out and burned after an ensuing heat wave.

Other crops in India, such as onions, tomatoes, rice, lemons, and oranges, have also suffered significant losses because of erratic weather patterns.

Why are farming yields important?

""Our cost has increased but yields are down. The income has fallen drastically. We don't know how we will recover it,"" said farmer Shivram Bandekar, per The Goan.

Increasing atmospheric pollution is leading to all manner of increasingly destructive weather patterns, including floods and droughts like the ones seen by Indian farmers. The economic costs to farmers are a major challenge, as are the rising grocery prices that end up being passed on to consumers.

This financial pressure and food insecurity can lead to climate migration, adding infrastructure and supply stressors to neighboring countries.

What's being done about farming yields in India?

Attacking the root cause of these weather swings and lowered agricultural yields means bringing down atmospheric pollution. Some of the best individual actions one can take include switching to an electric vehicle, using a heat pump at home, adopting a plant-based diet, and upgrading to solar power.

In the near term, permaculture practices can offer farmers some degree of resilience against wild swings in temperature and precipitation. Goan farmers are actively petitioning the government for this type of support.

PHMSA’s Overhaul Signals a New Era in Pipeline and LNG Safety Oversight

The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is shifting from wide-reaching inspections to a more targeted, data-informed regulatory strategy. This new approach prioritizes oversight where safety risks are highest, marking a meaningful change in how the agency monitors and enforces pipeline safety standards.

Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy emphasized that the goal is public safety, saying “PHMSA regulations should be used to ensure the safe transportation of energy products — not as a tool to drive fossil fuels out of business. Our new transparent, data-driven approach to enforcement will pinpoint key areas of concern, keep communities safe, and refocus PHMSA on its core mission – improving pipeline safety.""

The enforcement focus now centers on five key areas: managing control rooms and detecting leaks, preventing infrastructure damage, analyzing incident trends, addressing high-risk geographic zones, and scrutinizing corporate transactions and due diligence related to pipeline assets.

This strategy builds on several rulemakings introduced after major pipeline incidents. PHMSA will concentrate compliance checks on requirements such as rupture mitigation valves, verifying pipeline material and operating pressures, and enhancing standards for underground natural gas storage. These updates reflect the agency’s commitment to learning from past failures.

Acting Administrator Ben Kochman stressed that PHMSA's enforcement efforts remain rigorous. “We won’t hesitate to use every enforcement tool at our disposal when those standards aren’t met.”

Louisiana Named Home Base for LNG Safety Research and Coordination

In parallel with its regulatory overhaul, PHMSA has finalized the creation of the National Center of Excellence for LNG Safety, a new research and training hub located at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Backed by a 20-year lease agreement, the Center will lead efforts in LNG safety innovation, regulatory coordination, and workforce training. Lake Charles was selected due to its strategic relevance to the U.S. LNG supply chain and proximity to key infrastructure.

The facility was developed in response to directives from the PIPES Act of 2020, which aimed to strengthen U.S. leadership in safe LNG operations through institutional expertise and stakeholder collaboration. With support from federal and academic partners, the Center will coordinate efforts across agencies and with international partners to confront emerging safety challenges.

Senator John Kennedy underscored the national security and economic significance of LNG production, framing the Center as a long-term investment in safe energy expansion. “LNG production is one of the most critical ways our nation can unleash our energy dominance and protect our national security, and Louisiana is leading the way. I’m proud to see the U.S. Department of Transportation take this major step forward in building our National Center of Excellence for LNG Safety in Lake Charles. This Center will be a game changer for our region and be the tip of the spear for LNG innovation, operations, and safety in the U.S.”",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250723-113849-4a5-quinten-de-graaf-L4gN0aeaPY4-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:42:21.181064

This alert summarizes the key changes under the OBBBA relevant to private equity sponsors and their investors, as well as some of the notable proposals that did not make it into the final version of the bill signed into law.[1]

Business Tax Provisions

Business Interest Deductions Under Section 163(j)

Section 163(j) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (Code), which was introduced under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), generally limits the allowable deduction for business interest expense to 30% of a taxpayer’s “adjusted taxable income” (ATI). Under the TCJA, ATI was calculated to approximate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as determined for income tax purposes (EBITDA). However, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021, ATI was determined after taking depreciation and amortization deductions as determined for income tax purposes into account (approximating EBIT), which changed ATI and, therefore, further limited interest deductibility. The negative impact of the limitation was especially pronounced for portfolio companies that benefited from stepped-up basis resulting from an acquisition and other portfolio companies with significant depreciation and amortization deductions, although some strategies were developed to limit the impact.

The OBBBA reinstates, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the previous method under the TCJA approximating EBITDA, which should result in a greater allowance for current business interest deductions.

The bill, however, largely closes the door on a popular workaround to Section 163(j) whereby taxpayers could capitalize business interest into other assets under different Code sections (e.g., Section 263(a), 263A or 266) and recover the resulting increase in tax basis as depreciation, amortization or cost of goods sold, as applicable, without being subject to the limitations under Section 163(j). Under the OBBBA, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, capitalized business interest is generally treated as business interest subject to Section 163(j).[2] Sponsors who have historically relied on this workaround to Section 163(j) may need to reevaluate how interest deductions are taken into account for the 2024 and 2025 taxable years and whether different planning strategies should be implemented for structuring future investments.

The return to an interest expense limitation for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, based on tax equivalent of EBITDA also eliminates the benefit of structuring transactions as acquisitions of partnership interests as a tool to increase the limitation.

100% Bonus Depreciation Made Permanent and New Expensing for ‘Qualified Production Property’

Section 168(k), as enacted under the TCJA, permitted an up to 100% deduction for the cost of certain depreciable property, including property that had a recovery period of 20 years or less and was placed in service prior to January 1, 2027. Before the enactment of the OBBBA, the TCJA bonus depreciation was 40% of the cost of the property for the current year and was scheduled to be 20% of the cost of the property for 2026 and to be 0% thereafter. The OBBBA makes the 100% expensing allowed under Section 168(k) permanent for qualifying property acquired after January 19, 2025.

The OBBBA also enacts new Section 168(n), which temporarily expands the 100% expensing allowed under Section 168(k) to “qualified production property,” a new category of property that includes nonresidential real property placed in service in the U.S. used in a “qualified production activity.” A “qualified production activity” under the bill includes manufacturing, production (limited to agricultural and chemical production) or refining of “qualified personal property” (generally, tangible personal property, excluding food or beverage prepared in the same building as a retail establishment in which such property is sold).

The new expensing for qualified production property is a significant expansion of the bonus depreciation rules, which under the TCJA did not apply to real property. Capital intensive businesses, such as chemical plants, large-scale agricultural processors (e.g., grain-milling and meatpacking), auto, food and beverage, high-tech (e.g., semiconductors[3]) and other manufacturers, are expected to benefit from the new category of production property, which is a positive development for private equity funds with existing portfolio companies in these categories or strategies targeting these industries. It is important to note, however, that in order to qualify as qualified production property, the property must both (1) begin construction after January 19, 2025, and before January 1, 2029, and (2) be placed in service before January 1, 2031.

Permanent Deduction for R&E Expenses

The TCJA significantly altered the rules for deducting research and experimental (R&E) expenses under Section 174 by requiring taxpayers to capitalize and amortize such expenses over five years, or 15 years for foreign expenses. The OBBBA partially reverts to pre-TCJA law and allows taxpayers to deduct, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, domestic R&E expenses in the year incurred or to make an election to capitalize and amortize such expenses over a five-year period. However, foreign R&E expenses, which were deductible in the year incurred under pre-TCJA law, must still be capitalized and amortized over 15 years under the OBBBA consistent with the TCJA.

In addition to reviving the current expensing of domestic R&E expenses for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, the OBBBA allows certain eligible small businesses (generally, any business with $31 million or less average annual gross receipts during the preceding three taxable years) to expense, on amended returns, R&E expenses for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2021. All other taxpayers that are amortizing R&E expenses incurred in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2021, and before January 1, 2025, may elect to accelerate the remaining unamortized amounts over a one- or two-year period.

The revival of the expensing rules under the TCJA for domestic R&E expenses, including retroactive expensing for qualifying small businesses and accelerated expensing for all other taxpayers, are welcome developments and may help existing life sciences and other portfolio companies that spend significant amounts on R&E to defray high upfront costs often associated with multiyear research programs and make such companies more attractive for potential buyers. Qualifying small businesses seeking to amend past-year returns may also qualify for refunds of taxes paid in those years, creating additional liquidity for these companies.

Increased Qualified Small Business Stock Flexibility

Under Section 1202, noncorporate taxpayers holding qualified small business stock (QSBS) in a domestic corporation are eligible for exemption from capital gains upon a disposition of such stock. Generally, prior to the OBBBA, in order to qualify as QSBS, the corporation issuing the stock could not have gross assets exceeding $50 million at the time the stock is issued, and the taxpayer was required to hold the stock for more than five years before being eligible for the exemption, which depending on the issuance date of the stock, was equal to 50%, 75% or 100% of the capital gain realized from the disposition of the stock, subject to a cap.

The OBBBA eliminates the flat more than five-year holding period, and instead, for stock acquired after July 4, 2025, allows a 50% deduction for a sale of QSBS held for at least three years, 75% for a sale of QSBS held for at least four years and 100% for a sale of QSBS held for five years or more, with an increased cap on the exemption amount (generally, increased from the greater of $10 million or 10 times the taxpayer’s tax basis in the QSBS, to the greater of $15 million or 10 times the taxpayer’s tax basis in the QSBS), adjusted for inflation on an annual basis beginning in 2027. In addition, the gross assets limit for the corporate issuer of QSBS is raised from $50 million to $75 million.

These changes, together, increase the number of companies that are able to issue QSBS, and are expected to drive additional investment in these businesses by providing an increasingly valuable tax benefit (and planning tool) for private funds investing in early-stage and smaller companies, although such changes will also necessitate careful tracking of when shares of QSBS were issued for follow-on investments in existing qualified small businesses after the effective date to plan for the applicable limitations. The differentiation among QSBS of the same issuer may also result in planning opportunities at disposition time, including in cases of partial rollovers.

For further discussion, please see our July 16 client alert.

Permanent Section 199A Deduction

Under Section 199A, first introduced as part of the TCJA, certain noncorporate taxpayers enjoy a deduction for up to 20% of “qualified business income” derived from certain “qualified trades and businesses.” The deduction generally applies to individuals and certain trusts and estates that, subject to applicable thresholds, earn income from sole proprietorships carried on by an individual taxpayer or, relevant for private equity investors, pass-through operating businesses (i.e., businesses conducted by partnerships and disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

For funds that invest in pass-through operating businesses, the Section 199A deduction is a valuable tax benefit for qualifying individuals (as well as certain trusts and estates) that participate in such investments unblocked (i.e., without the use of a corporate blocker between the investor and operating business) — namely, such investors may be entitled to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income generated by the operating business and flowing up to the investor.

Pre-OBBBA, Section 199A was set to expire at the end of the year, and the OBBBA expands and makes permanent this valuable tax benefit (although it does not increase the deduction to 23% as was contemplated in earlier versions of the bill).

Clean and Renewable Energy Incentives

The OBBBA has received considerable attention for its impact on the Biden-era clean and renewable energy tax credit framework established under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While the OBBBA preserves the availability of certain clean energy incentives, it also accelerates the phaseout of others. In particular, the OBBBA shortens the window for new wind and solar projects to qualify for the federal tax incentives. The bill also introduces new Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) restrictions on project ownership, supply chains and tax credit buyers, and codifies long-term policy shifts that will impact renewable energy developers, tax equity investors, tax credit purchasers, lenders and manufacturers.

The OBBBA preserves a significant portion of the IRA’s clean energy tax architecture, but imposes key limitations and new diligence obligations for developers, investors, lenders and credit buyers.

For discussion of the key renewable energy tax changes under the OBBBA and its impact on renewable energy developers, tax equity investors, tax credit purchasers, lenders and manufacturers, please see our July 11 client alert.

International Tax Provisions

Although outside the scope of this summary, the OBBBA made a number of changes or clarifications to the international tax regime, including: (1) making permanent current deduction rates for foreign-derived intangible income (FDDI, renamed “foreign-derived deduction eligible income”) and global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI, renamed “net CFC tested income”) that were scheduled to decrease[4]; (2) repealing a scheduled increase in rates that apply under the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT); (3) clarifying certain provisions under the GILTI regime to ensure the rules better incentivize onshore manufacturing as originally intended by the TCJA; and (4) enhancing benefits of inventory sourcing in the U.S., among other clarifications and refinements. In another welcome change, the OBBBA modifies certain attribution rules that had been in effect under the TCJA and that had previously greatly expanded the reach of the U.S. “controlled foreign corporation” regime.

All in all, the overall goal of the changes appears to be prioritizing U.S. investment and manufacturing. U.S. private equity funds making foreign investments and U.S. portfolio companies with foreign subsidiaries and sales outside the U.S. should carefully evaluate the impact of the revised rules when evaluating new investments.

Notable Proposals Not Included in the Final OBBBA

Carried Interest

The favorable capital gains treatment for “carried interest” (i.e., the share of profits of a partnership received by private equity fund sponsors) remains intact. Nevertheless, Section 1061, enacted as part of the TCJA and which generally requires a three-year holding period for carried interests issued to fund managers in order to receive the favorable capital gains treatment, still applies and will continue to be relevant for private equity fund sponsors.

‘Revenge Tax’

The so-called “revenge tax” under proposed Section 899, which we previously covered in two separate alerts on June 16 (covering the version of the bill passed in the House, with a focus on relevant considerations for private funds) and June 18 (covering the version of the bill passed in the Senate), notably was left out of the final version of the bill signed into law by President Trump. Proposed Section 899, generally, would have imposed an additional tax, increasing 5% each year up to a cap of 20%, on certain U.S. source income earned by non-U.S. persons resident in “discriminatory” non-U.S. countries that impose an “unfair foreign tax."" It was expected that most European Union member states, Australia, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom, among others, would be considered to be discriminatory foreign jurisdictions.

However, proposed Section 899 was not included in the final version of the OBBBA, which is an overwhelmingly positive result for private equity funds with non-U.S. investors.

[1] Previous client alerts as part of our broader coverage of the OBBBA covered: on June 16 and June 18, proposed Section 899, left out of the final version of the bill and which would have, as proposed, imposed an additional 5-20% tax on certain types of income earned by non-U.S. individuals and entities in countries imposing an “unfair foreign tax” under the proposed legislation; on July 11, key energy provisions under the OBBBA, including the impact on developers, tax equity investors, tax credit purchasers, lenders and manufacturers in the broader tax credit market; on July 16, changes applicable to the rules for qualified small business stock, designed to further encourage investment in U.S.-based earlier-stage companies; and most recently, on July 18, the application of the OBBBA to REITs.

[2] In addition, under the OBBBA, a taxpayer’s allowable business interest deduction applies first to reduce the taxpayer’s aggregate capitalized business interest, and any remainder reduces any noncapitalized business interest. This is a departure from pre-OBBBA law under the TCJA, which applied Section 163(j) after application of provisions that subject interest expense to disallowance, deferral, capitalization or other limitations under other Code sections.

[3] The OBBBA also increases the current advanced manufacturing investment tax credit (also known as the “semiconductor credit” or the “CHIPS credit”), enacted under Section 48D as part of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, available to eligible taxpayers (generally, any taxpayer other than a foreign entity of concern, i.e., any foreign entity that is owned, controlled or subject to the jurisdiction of a government from a designated “covered nation”, such as China, Russia, Iran or North Korea) for qualified investments in new buildings, facilities and other depreciable tangible property integral to the operation of a facility to manufacture semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment from 25% to 35% for property placed in service after December 31, 2025.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16204_3837.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:26:40.386358

Yet another team of researchers has warned of the potential for economic and environmental harm from Senate Bill 266, the ""Ratepayer Risks Act"" passed by the N.C. General Assembly and vetoed by Gov. Josh Stein.

The new analysis from researchers at Duke University's Nicholas Institute affirms an earlier study from a N.C. State University research team, which found that S266 could saddle North Carolina families with an additional $23 billion in electricity costs due to increased purchases of expensive fossil fuels.

Primarily due to the act’s repeal of some clean energy tax credits, a forecast, published by energy policy research organization Energy Innovation Policy & Technology, predicts that Texas is expected to experience a:

54-gigawatt decline in capacity from solar power by 2035

23-gigawatt decline in capacity from wind power by 2035

3.1-gigawatt decline in capacity from battery-stored power by 2035

2.5-gigawatt increase in capacity from natural gas by 2035

The legislation “will reduce additions of new, cost-effective electricity capacity in Texas, raising power prices for consumers and decreasing the state’s GDP and job growth in the coming years,” the forecast says.

The forecast also reports that the loss of sources of low-cost renewable energy and the resulting hike in natural gas prices could bump up electric bills in Texas. The forecast envisions a 23 percent to 54 percent hike in electric rates for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Texas.

Household energy bills are expected to increase by $220 per year by 2030 and by $480 per year by 2035, according to the forecast.

Energy Innovation Policy & Technology expects job growth and economic growth to also take a hit under the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""

The nonprofit organization foresees annual losses of $5.9 billion in Texas economic output (as measured by GDP) by 2030 and $10 billion by 2035. In tandem with the impact on GDP, Texas is projected to lose 42,000 jobs by 2030 and 94,000 jobs by 2035 due to the law’s provisions, according to the organization.

The White House believes the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" will promote, not harm, U.S. energy production. The law encourages the growth of traditional sources of power such as oil, natural gas, coal and hydropower.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a historic piece of legislation that will restore energy independence and make life more affordable for American families by reversing disastrous Biden-era policies that constricted domestic energy production,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a news release.

Promoters of renewable energy offer an opposing viewpoint.

“The bill makes steep cuts to solar energy and places new restrictions on energy tax credits that will slow the deployment of residential and utility-scale solar while undermining the growth of U.S. manufacturing,” says the Solar Energy Industries Association.

Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, complained that the legislation limits energy production, boosts prices for U.S. businesses and families, and jeopardizes the reliability of the country’s power grid.

DETROIT, July 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- DTE Energy today announced it is donating $800,000 to United Way for Southeastern Michigan to help Michiganders across the state stay safe during Michigan's extreme summer weather. The donation will provide relief to elderly, unemployed, underemployed, and disabled customers across Michigan who are struggling to pay their energy bills and have qualified for energy assistance in the current year.

""Many Michigan families face genuine financial hardships and are struggling to pay their bills. This donation will help us support Michiganders accessing the help they need to pay their energy bills,"" said Jeff Miles, vice president of Community Impact, United Way for Southeastern Michigan. ""While MEAP recently expanded assistance amounts and eligibility requirements, this donation helps address current gaps and keep families enrolled now.""

According to United Way, the need for support has increased 72% from the last program year, resulting in a funding shortfall. This donation will provide immediate support to bridge that gap.

At the end of last year, thanks to the advocacy of organizations like United Way and a coalition of other human service nonprofits, the Michigan legislature passed an energy assistance expansion which Governor Whitmer signed into law. The new law increases the funding available for low-income families under the Michigan Energy Assistance Program (MEAP) and modifies the eligibility criteria to allow it to serve more of those in need. This additional funding will be available for new applicants on October 1, at the beginning of the State's fiscal year. Until then, the new dollars being invested by United Way and DTE will help fill a resource gap to provide much-needed support for current enrollees.

""DTE's strong partnership with United Way of more than 40 years continues to be a lifeline for Michigan families – especially in the summer, when rising temperatures can lead to unexpected energy costs,"" said Evette Griffie, vice president of Customer and Community Engagement, DTE. ""This donation isn't just about meeting the needs of today, it connects families to the right programs that can prevent these crises in the future.""

More than 5,000 residents were enrolled in LSP during the 2024-2025 program year, and DTE anticipates potentially greater need through the remainder of this year. This donation is expected to support 6,400 customers this program year. Visit unitedwaysem.org/utility-assistance for more information about the program or to enroll.

""We're grateful for this critical support from our partners at DTE, which will allow us to help families not just get through tough times, but stay on solid ground,"" added Miles. ""As household budgets are seeing increased pressure, we will continue to work with community partners to help more families move from crisis to stability and from stability to prosperity.""

Over the past five years, DTE has connected customers to more than $660 million in financial aid. The company works closely with federal, state and agency partners to advocate for new approaches to quickly get help to customers in need. DTE also served as a strong advocate for the recently passed legislation that will increase funding for energy assistance and reduce access barriers, opening the doors of support to additional Michiganders in need.

""DTE works every day to connect customers to energy assistance – we are doing everything in our power to ensure customers are never without the energy they need. Our work doesn't end here. We will continue to advocate for the most vulnerable so they can receive the support and resources they deserve,"" said Griffie.

Businesses canceled, closed, and scaled back more than $22 billion worth of new factories and clean energy projects in the first half of 2025 after cancelling another $6.7 billion in June alone, according to E2’s latest monthly analysis of clean energy projects tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker.

The latest wave of cancellations — affecting five battery, storage, and electric vehicle factories in Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, New York, and Oregon — follows growing uncertainty among businesses as Congress was making the final push to effectively end federal clean energy tax credits. More than 5,000 jobs were lost to the cancellations and scales backs in June, bringing the total number of jobs lost to abandoned projects in 2025 to 16,500.

“These cancellations aren’t just numbers on a balance book,” states Michael Timberlake, E2 communications director. “They’re jobs, paychecks, and opportunities in communities that were counting on these clean energy projects to drive economic growth. And now they’re gone.”

June cancellations

June’s cancellations were led by major automakers scaling back electric vehicle production investments. General Motors cancelled a $4.3 billion plan to expand its Orion plant in Michigan to build new electric pickups and instead shift its investments there to build 8-cylinder gas vehicles. Additionally, Toyota scaled back a $2.2 billion plan to retool a manufacturing plant in Indiana that was going to build a new three-row electric SUV, consolidating production to its Georgetown, Kentucky plant instead.

Through June, 62 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72 percent of all jobs and 81 percent of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

June additions

Amid the cancellations and rising uncertainty, businesses in June announced more than $2.1 billion in investments for new hydrogen, EV, and grid and transmission equipment factories across five states — including a $1.8 billion investment by Element Resources to build North America’s largest hydrogen production facility in California.

Separately, Howard Industries announced more than $236 million to expand its electrical and transmission manufacturing operations in Mississippi that is expected to create at least 450 permanent jobs.

“We’ve shown that electricity markets are vulnerable to both geopolitical shocks and climate variability.","Geopolitical shocks are much more likely to trigger price bubbles in the British and European electricity markets than extreme weather events – and they are predictable, new academic research concludes.

Dr Elisabetta Pellini and Dr Peter Cincinelli from Bayes Business School and the University of Bergarmo analysed pricing data in 12 European wholesale ‘day-ahead’ electricity markets.

They identified two distinct sudden and extreme price bubbles between 2006 and 2024. One was triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. However, electricity prices had also risen significantly above their underlying value – the definition of a bubble – six months earlier. In October 2021 Russian president Vladimir Putin ordered Gazprom to prioritise natural gas supplies to the domestic market over European customers.

Both events significantly reduced supplies of natural gas – which is critical for electricity generation, especially when demand peaks.

Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and droughts, exacerbated the surge in pricing by reducing renewable and nuclear power output, increasing reliance on gas. However, the study suggests that their impact is relatively short term – sometimes just days – compared to unexpected geopolitical developments.

Dr Pellini is a lecturer in quantitative methods and econometrics at Bayes Business School (part of City St George’s, University of London) and Dr Cincinelli is associate professor in banking and finance at the Department of Management of the University of Bergamo.

The study’s key findings include:

A one-point rise in the geopolitical risk index increased the chance of a price bubble by 8.23%.

A one-degree increase in air temperature raised the probability by 0.15% as people turned on air conditioning.

However, stronger wind (1 m/s increase) reduced bubble probability by 2.28%, as it boosts wind power output.

More rainfall also reduced the likelihood of bubbles, as it supports hydro and nuclear power.

Surprisingly, there is no significant link between changes in industrial production and bubble formation.

Dr Pellini said that governments and industry partners should see their findings as added incentive to drive market reforms and the transition to sustainable energy.

“We’ve shown that electricity markets are vulnerable to both geopolitical shocks and climate variability. Governments can protect customers and avoid damaging instability in vital energy supplies by accelerating the transition to renewable energy – including investment in grid infrastructure and energy storage. Our work shows that the EU should press on with its planned electricity market reforms aimed at improving market flexibility and cross-border electricity trading.

“Countries can reduce their vulnerability to disruptions by promoting energy efficiency and rolling out smart meters and dynamic pricing to manage demand more effectively. However, it’s clear that we’re still going to be using carbon fuels for many years so governments should also be diversifying gas supplies.”

We can forecast bubbles

Dr Cincinelli said: “Our study has some very definite implications for European governments, regulators and all involved in the energy markets. The statistical model used in the study accurately predicted periods when bubbles occurred, suggesting it could serve as an early warning tool in the future. The big impact of geopolitical shocks should remind us that even with an ever-greater share of our energy needs being supplied by renewables, new risks emerge. Much of the global supply of minerals essential for the renewables infrastructure is in China and in developing countries such as Chad.

“Europe also needs to expand its clean energy manufacturing production, which at present is largely outsourced. That poses fresh challenges given the lack of skilled labour and the aging population in most European nations.”

The UK, France and Germany have the highest mean geopolitical risk, with values of 0.99, 0.53 and 0.44, respectively. By contrast, Portugal has the lowest, 0.02 – but like other southern European states it has a high risk related to extreme heat.

Some countries experienced longer-lasting bubbles than others. For instance, Italy and the Netherlands saw bubbles for 50 and 44 weeks, respectively, while Sweden had only nine weeks. This reflects differences in how electricity is generated. Countries relying more on natural gas were more vulnerable, while those with strong hydro or nuclear sectors were less affected.",https://www.bayes.citystgeorges.ac.uk/__data/assets/image/0005/898916/electricity-screens-thumb.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 16:04:48.105638

A national push to standardize and scale clean energy job training is beginning to show results. This push is coming from both nationwide associations (as part of their organizational goals) and dedicated industry professionals (as part of their own personal mission).

Registered Apprenticeships on the rise

We’ll start with the associations. According to a new report released July 28, the Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), IWSI America, and a network of collaborators have helped grow the number of Registered Apprenticeships (RA) in clean energy from just 15 to over 1,000 in two years — a 65-fold increase.

The report, Expansion of Registered Apprenticeship Programs in Clean Energy, details the impact of the Apprenticeships in Clean Energy (ACE) Network, a federally funded initiative designed to support the creation of industry-aligned RA programs across the country. The effort comes as clean energy jobs — now employing nearly 3.5 million Americans — continue to grow at twice the rate of the overall U.S. labor market.

“Clean energy companies need a pathway to hire and retain thousands of skilled employees, and Registered Apprenticeships perfectly fit the bill,” said Susan Biszewski-Eber, senior manager of apprenticeship programs at IREC. “We look forward to expanding our efforts to develop even more apprenticeship opportunities in clean energy sectors like solar and storage, home energy performance, EVs, and many more.”

The ACE Network, which received funding from the U.S. Department of Labor through June 2025, provides free technical assistance to help employers and training organizations launch Registered Apprenticeship programs. In just two years, the network has:

Supported the registration of over 1,000 apprentices

Provided direct assistance to more than 200 employers

Developed three National Guideline Standards (NGS) for occupations including Construction Craft Laborer, Weatherization Technician, and Energy Auditor

Piloted innovative new RA models for heat pump installation and clean energy digital media roles

IWSI America, which served as the lead technical assistance provider, leveraged international best practices to help employers navigate RA registration and compliance. “Together, we’re cultivating a pipeline of skilled talent that fuels innovation and long-term resilience in the fast-evolving clean energy economy,” said Nicholas Wyman, CEO of IWSI America.

Amicus tackles O&M training

Operations and maintenance (O&M) in solar and energy storage is a crucial area of focus right now. 1) Installers are looking to expand services beyond new installations, 2) existing projects are plagued by workmanship, underperformance and safety issues, 3) there is a general lack of O&M technicians and adequate training programs for said technicians.

Amanda Bybee is on a mission to change that. Bybee is the CEO of Amicus O&M Cooperative, a network of vetted solar and battery operations and maintenance providers with standardized tools, templates, and training programs. Bybee and Amicus have worked with SEIA and ACP to create the first-ever ANSI standard for solar technician training and certification.

ANSI/SEIA 301-2025, the Solar and Energy Storage Operations and Maintenance Technician Training American National Standard, educates technical professionals on maintaining solar and storage systems to maximize performance, longevity, and safety. It also provides specifications for scheduled maintenance, system monitoring, safety checks, and record keeping, ensuring more reliable systems that enhance the resilience of the electric grid.

SEIA will launch its new professional and company certification programs in November 2025, which will provide a pathway for industry-wide recognition of compliance with the ANSI/SEIA standards. For individuals, the certification requires passing an exam to demonstrate understanding of the standard.

Hear Bybee talk about that framework and the consensus-building effort in this interview with Omnidian:

Workforce headwinds remain

Despite the momentum, the IREC report highlights several structural challenges that could hamper further scale. Chief among them: the lack of Department of Labor recognition for Solar Installer as an official occupation. And I can’t image that will change any time soon under the current anti-solar administration. Other barriers include intermediary restrictions on the RAPIDS database and inconsistent RA approval processes across state lines. To address these issues, the IREC report recommends streamlining federal and state-level RA processes, expanding NGS coverage to emerging clean energy roles, and providing long-term support for sector-specific apprenticeship intermediaries.

Their argument makes clear that the President cannot unilaterally bypass the Congress—and thereby the will of the American people—and withhold appropriated funds based on his own priorities or policy preferences. It also underscores that under the United States Constitution, Congress has the exclusive power to appropriate funds and to make laws governing their use.

The unlawful freezing of more than $425 billion in congressionally authorized funding has not only trampled on the legislative process but has inflicted irreparable damage on communities across the country—blocking critical investments that families, businesses, and local governments rely on. Frozen funds include support allotted to local law enforcement, education programs, food assistance, broadband and power grid investments, emergency response and preparedness, science and research, and much more. A comprehensive tracker, as of June 3rd, is available HERE.

The amicus brief was led by Task Force Chair Joe Neguse and Ranking Member Jamie Raskin, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee Rosa DeLauro. It was filed in the matter of New York v. Trump, a case filed by 22 Democratic Attorneys General before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

See what they had to say below:

“By illegally freezing funding authorized by the Congress, President Trump and his administration have undermined the rule of law and the will of the American people—harming American families, businesses, local law enforcement, and many others,” said Assistant Democratic Leader Joe Neguse. “But House Democrats are fighting back—and today, we’re calling on the courts to block this blatantly unlawful order.”

“Trump’s scheme to unilaterally withhold billions of dollars of federal funding supporting crucial programs is in direct defiance of federal law and plainly violates Congressional power over the purse,” said House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Jamie Raskin. “The reason there are now more than 200 federal injunctions and restraining orders issued against the Trump Administration is because it keeps trying to usurp Congressional appropriations powers, defunding federal programs in education, community safety, violence prevention, disaster relief, and more. House Democrats will keep defending our essential and primary spending power against Trump’s astounding lawlessness and ignorance of the Constitution.""

“Instead of addressing the cost-of-living crisis, since his first day in office, President Trump has been played like a fiddle by unelected bureaucrat Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought into stealing funds promised to Americans,” said House Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro. “This is not complicated: Democrats and Republicans in Congress passed, and the President signed into law, billions in investments in critical infrastructure and support for middle class and working class families and small businesses, and those promises must be delivered. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, and nowhere does it give the President any unilateral power to either temporarily or permanently impound—steal—funds appropriated by Congress. American taxpayers, veterans, farmers, and communities across this country are owed these investments. The American people did not elect President Trump to steal from them, and House Democrats will continue to fight this theft each and every day. That is why I am proud to join my Democratic colleagues in this amicus brief to stand up for Congress’s constitutional role in funding decisions and for all of our constituents across the country.”

Background on the Litigation and Rapid Response Task Force

Since assuming office, Donald Trump has relentlessly assaulted the rule of law, threatening the American way of life and unleashing unprecedented levels of rising costs, chaos, and corruption. In direct response to this, the Litigation and Rapid Response Task Force was established to develop comprehensive legislative, oversight, and legal strategies—to vindicate the Constitution and the rights of the people. The group first took the unprecedented step of filing a trial court amicus brief(link is external) to defend American consumers from predatory lenders and bad actors. They were successful in this case after a federal judge blocked efforts to dismantle the CFPB, citing the group’s argument multiple times throughout the 112-page ruling(link is external). Since then, they’ve filed 13 amicus briefs in direct response to unlawful actions from the executive, including the illegal imposition of tariffs, attacks on the constitutional principle of birthright citizenship, and the dismantling of key federal agencies.

LONDON, July 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- RheEnergise, a pioneering energy storage company, today announced the launch of its North American fundraising campaign on Republic, a leading platform for private investing. The campaign offers individual investors the opportunity to benefit from the company's growth as it scales deployment of its proprietary High-Density Hydro® energy storage systems across the United States and Canada.

The missing, vital piece of the energy system puzzle: RheEnergise's High-Density Hydro, an economical, long-duration energy storage solution, which stores abundant, ultra-low-cost daytime energy and releases it back to consumers when demand and prices rise. HD Hydro delivers affordable energy during mornings and evenings when it's needed most. The solution offers multiple benefits: it keeps energy prices low, delivers attractive returns for project owners, supports grid reliability, and accelerates the clean energy transition — making clean, affordable energy widely available.

""Our High-Density Hydro technology is a game-changer,"" said Stephen Crosher, CEO of RheEnergise. ""It delivers the scale and flexibility the market desperately needs—between 20 and 100 megawatts per project, with up to 20 hours of storage. A typical 40 megawatt, 10 hour project would provide 32,000 typical US homes constantly for around 10 hours. With round-trip efficiencies exceeding 80%, it's probably the most effective, scalable solution on the market. This fundraising campaign allows us to bring together many more everyday investors alongside the 4,000 from Europe, on our mission to revolutionize energy across North America.""

Unlike conventional pumped hydro, RheEnergise's technology uses a proprietary fluid 2.5x denser than water, enabling projects to be built on small hills rather than mountains and closer to where energy is needed. This creates broader site availability and lower costs, making the technology well suited for both urban and remote applications.

The opportunities for HD Hydro are vast. Here are three example states:

California: ~21,000 potential sites.

New York: ~6,500 potential sites.

Texas: ~6,250 potential sites.

Just 500 projects in any state would provide ~250GWh of long-duration energy storage. To put this into perspective that is more than enough to power the entirety of New York City for the day.

Funds raised through Republic will help accelerate RheEnergise's expansion in North America, including project development, technology deployment, and strategic partnerships.

""This is a pivotal moment,"" added Crosher. ""With the demand for energy, grid pressures mounting and renewable adoption continuing to increase, North America needs scalable, proven, long-duration storage solutions. RheEnergise is here to meet that need.""

This collaborative effort is expanding Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs across the clean energy sector, supporting one of the fastest-growing industries in the U.S. economy.

Clean energy jobs now employ nearly 3.5 million Americans and are growing at twice the rate of overall U.S. job growth. Yet the rapid evolution of this sector has exposed a critical gap: a shortage of standardized, scalable and industry-aligned workforce training.

Enter the ACE Network, led by IREC and supported by IWSI and eight other partner organizations. The ACE Network provides technical assistance and vetted resources to help employers, training providers and other organizations start or join Registered Apprenticeship programs. This initiative was supported by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) funding through June 2025. The ACE Network will continue to provide free technical assistance to support Registered Apprenticeships in clean energy and build on the achievements that are documented in this report.

Key accomplishments of the ACE Network have included:

Growing the number of Registered Apprentices from just 15 to over 1,000 in two years.

Providing technical assistance to more than 200 employers.

Developing three National Guideline Standards (NGS) that provide models for apprenticeship programs in-demand occupations in clean energy, such as Construction Craft Laborer, Weatherization Technician, and Energy Auditor.

“Clean energy companies need a pathway to hire and retain thousands of skilled employees, and Registered Apprenticeships perfectly fit the bill,” said Susan Biszewski-Eber, senior manager of apprenticeship programs at IREC. “We have been so thrilled to join IWSI and other partners to support more than a thousand new apprenticeships at dozens of energy companies. In the future, we look forward to expanding our efforts to develop even more apprenticeship opportunities in clean energy sectors like solar and storage, home energy performance, EVs and many more.”

IWSI America served as the primary provider of technical assistance and registration support, drawing on global best practices to help employers navigate RA systems and launch sustainable programs. A full list of partner organizations can be found on the program website.

Despite the program’s momentum, the report also revealed structural barriers, including the non-recognition of Solar Installer as an official occupation by DOL, lack of intermediary access to the RAPIDS tracking database, and slow or inconsistent RA program approval processes across states.

To address these issues, the report outlines a series of policy recommendations to streamline apprenticeship registration, increase flexibility, and expand NGS for emerging clean energy roles. It also underscores the need for continued investment in sector-specific apprenticeship intermediaries to ensure long-term workforce success.

They claim “limited pipeline capacity” constrains natural gas supply while failing to account for ongoing infrastructure projects in the state.
Yet, despite record exports, Americans enjoy among the lowest residential natural gas prices in the world.
The memo’s driving critique is natural gas prices are volatile and may increase based on hypothetical, worst-case scenario projections.","North Carolina was once again named the best state for business in America, according to CNBC’s recently released 2025 rankings. This is the Tarheel state’s sixth year in a row to rank among the top three states. To fuel North Carolina’s continued economic growth, the state needs an affordable and sustainable energy mix that includes natural gas.

Natural gas supports some of the state’s most integral industries, from agriculture to health care and transportation. It generates over 40% of the state’s electricity, and the demand is projected to rise with AI and manufacturing growth. Furthermore, the switch from coal to gas power generation has contributed to a 41% decline in CO2 emissions from the power sector since 2005. For the state to continue its economic momentum, an increased supply of natural gas is key.

Despite the economic growth it is fueling, there is still criticism. A recently released memo by three North Carolina State University professors paints an exceedingly negative and inaccurate picture of the role natural gas plays in the state.

The memo examines natural gas prices based on the highest possible projections from the North Carolina Utilities Commission’s Carbon Plan Docket and crafts a worst-case scenario to advocate against increased natural gas use. The authors base their conclusions around the removal of the interim carbon emissions reduction target that was enacted in 2021. SB 266, recently vetoed by Gov. Josh Stein and awaiting a potential veto override vote in the legislature, would remove this interim target.

Overall, the memo argues selective, erroneous, and inaccurate claims. The professors choose hypothetical points as to why natural gas prices could increase. They claim “limited pipeline capacity” constrains natural gas supply while failing to account for ongoing infrastructure projects in the state. There are currently two interstate projects and several intrastate projects ongoing that will increase supply.

They also erroneously claim that “rising U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) exports” could impact supply and thus prices. Yet, despite record exports, Americans enjoy among the lowest residential natural gas prices in the world. Since the inception of the US LNG export industry, growth in natural gas production has outpaced LNG export growth nearly three-fold.

They also argue “supply disruption” from natural disasters such as hurricanes could negatively impact the market. In fact, the natural gas system was intentionally developed to help ensure reliability. During Hurricane Helene, most underground pipelines remained intact, helping deliver reliable service when it was needed most. Furthermore, natural disasters can impact any energy source, not just natural gas, as the memo falsely presents.

The memo’s driving critique is natural gas prices are volatile and may increase based on hypothetical, worst-case scenario projections. Yet this point wholly misses the mark and ignores the facts on the ground.

Regular fluctuations in energy demand and supply occur every day. Natural gas provides a reliable backbone to our state, helping families and businesses keep the lights on. Its ability to start up quickly to meet fluctuating demand also supports the state’s portfolio of renewable energy sources. North Carolina’s proximity to natural gas reserves in the Appalachian basins will ensure it continues to be an accessible and affordable resource.

Without question, North Carolina is leading the US in economic growth and development. The state continues to attract new businesses and residents. Lawmakers must focus on the facts of our growing economy and ensure access to natural gas, thus providing a reliable and sustainable energy mix to fuel North Carolina’s economic success for years to come.",https://www.carolinajournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-06-115508-768x482.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:05:33.585497

Tesla, the undisputed leader in battery-powered cars, reported a challenging second quarter with revenues dipping to $19.9 billion, an 11% decline from the previous year, as per details outlined in its earnings call. This shortfall missed Wall Street expectations, compounded by a net income of $1.2 billion, down 16%, according to data referenced in a recent CNBC analysis. Elon Musk’s company cited production hiccups and intensifying competition from legacy automakers, yet it doubled down on ambitious plans for robotaxis and full self-driving technology, signaling a pivot toward software-driven revenue streams.

Meanwhile, General Motors, the Detroit giant, showcased resilience in its Q2 results, posting revenues of $47.1 billion—albeit a slight year-over-year dip—while maintaining its full-year guidance amid market share gains in EVs. GM’s net income stood at $1.9 billion, also down from last year, but executives emphasized their “North Star” strategy of EVs, claiming the No. 2 spot in U.S. EV sales behind Tesla, as detailed in a CNBC report. Unlike Tesla’s heavy reliance on premium models, GM is leveraging its vast manufacturing footprint to push affordable options like the Chevrolet Bolt, aiming for profitability in EVs by mid-decade.

Earnings Metrics Under the Microscope: Profitability Pressures and Strategic Shifts

A deeper dive into the numbers reveals Tesla’s gross margins squeezed to 17%, a 71-basis-point drop, reflecting higher costs in ramping up Cybertruck production and regulatory credits that once buoyed profits. Posts on X, formerly Twitter, from industry observers noted Tesla’s adjusted EBITDA at $3.4 billion, a 7% decline, underscoring the volatility of its high-growth model. In contrast, GM’s approach appears more measured, with executives touting an “inherent advantage” in scaling EVs through existing supply chains, even as Wall Street analysts like those at Morgan Stanley questioned how GM could achieve EV profitability when Tesla struggles, as highlighted in a Yahoo Finance piece.

This tale of two earnings underscores broader industry dynamics: Tesla’s valuation, hovering around $332 per share post-earnings, is buoyed by hype around AI and autonomy, but stripped of that, its metrics as a pure automaker might warrant a lower multiple, per sentiment echoed in X discussions. GM, on the other hand, is chasing $50 billion in EV revenue by 2025, a bold target from its current $3 billion, building on capacity for 1 million U.S. EVs, according to historical projections shared on X.

Market Positioning and Future Trajectories: Robotaxis vs. Mass-Market Push

Looking ahead, Tesla’s robotaxi ambitions face regulatory hurdles, particularly in markets like San Francisco, where employee-monitored deployments are planned, as reported in a TechCrunch article. This contrasts with GM’s Cruise unit, which has encountered its own setbacks but benefits from GM’s integrated operations. Analysts point to Tesla’s full self-driving software potentially generating $3 billion annually by year’s end, per optimistic X posts, yet GM’s focus on hybrids as a bridge to full electrification could provide stability amid softening EV demand.

The divergence extends to innovation strategies. A Tesla veteran emphasized reviewing real products over mock-ups for staying innovative, as noted in another TechCrunch insight, a philosophy that could help Tesla navigate its current slump. For GM, the path involves balancing legacy internal-combustion profits with EV investments, with CEO Mary Barra facing scrutiny on margins, as per the aforementioned Morgan Stanley challenge.

The donation of the ZDX SUVs is part of a broader commitment by Acura and Honda to support environmental sustainability. The vehicles will be distributed through Acura dealers across the U.S., assisting local TNC teams in their fieldwork and community engagement activities. This effort aligns with TNC's mission to reduce operational emissions while promoting conservation.

""We're proud to partner with The Nature Conservancy and Acura dealers across America to help advance sustainability by contributing to a lower-emissions future,"" said Mike Langel, assistant vice president of Acura National Sales. ""The Acura ZDX fleet will support The Nature Conservancy's important fieldwork, enabling more efficient travel to conservation sites while reducing the environmental impact of transportation.""

Honda's partnership with TNC began over 30 years ago with the Ohio chapter. Since then, Honda has supported various TNC programs across multiple states, including Alabama, California, and Indiana. In 2023 alone, Honda and the Honda USA Foundation contributed $625,000 towards TNC initiatives in 10 states.

""We are incredibly grateful to Acura for this donation,"" said Daniel Salzer, Director of Sustainability for The Nature Conservancy. ""The donation of these vehicles has significantly accelerated our efforts to electrify our fleet, reducing our carbon footprint, and setting a powerful example of climate leadership.""

This bipartisan bill seeks to give small businesses in South Texas, New York, and across the country greater representation during the rule-making process at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The bill recently was reported favorably out of U.S. House Financial Services Committee (watch a video of Congressman Gonzalez’s remarks in committee HERE)(link is external).

Among other objectives, the SEC is primarily responsible for enacting rules that both protect investors and help businesses raise the capital they need to grow and create jobs.

However, there is currently no dedicated office within the SEC that represents small business interests during the rulemaking process. This bill would correct that by establishing Offices of Small Business within each of the SEC’s rulemaking divisions—making the SEC more responsive and accessible to small businesses and entrepreneurs.

“Small businesses are the backbone of every community across the country and it’s time federal regulators, like the Securities and Exchange Commission, take their concerns and ideas seriously,” said Congressman Gonzalez. “Day after day, year after year, I hear from small business owners in South Texas about the challenges they face in complying with rules and regulations that are designed with only the biggest businesses in mind. Businesses of all sizes are confronting rising prices due to tariffs and a national worker shortage, and our small businesses are especially feeling the pinch. I am proud to work with my colleague, Congressman Garbarino, on a bipartisan bill that will give our small businesses a greater voice in Washington.”

“If we want more small businesses to grow, succeed, and access capital here at home, we need rules that support innovation and open doors for investment. I was proud to partner with Congressman Gonzalez on this commonsense bill to make sure small businesses have a real voice in SEC policymaking, and I am glad to see it moving forward,” said Congressman Garbarino.

Congressman Gonzalez has previously announced actions on behalf of South Texas small businesses to alleviate the worker shortage, boost our local economy, and find commonsense solutions in response to the Administration’s mass deportation policies. Read more about this HERE.

Washington, D.C. — Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, and Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur (D-OH-09), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to issue a legal decision on whether President Trump’s Department of Energy (DOE) violated key appropriations laws in shifting hundreds of millions of dollars provided for research and development of clean energy sources in the full-year continuing resolution (CR) President Trump signed into law in March and steering those funds to energy sources it favors.

Specifically, Murray and Kaptur requested that GAO look into whether DOE’s spending decisions in fiscal year 2025 violate the Purpose Statute, which dictates that appropriations only be used for the purposes for which the appropriations were provided unless otherwise provided for by law, and the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds in advance of or in excess of an appropriation made by Congress.

According to recent analysis and internal reporting, the Department of Energy’s spending decision will likely result in the layoffs of more than 3,000 national lab scientists and staff—and will prevent over 50 university awards, over 30 industry awards, over 20 non-profit awards, and several local government awards from being issued.

In making the request, Senator Murray and Congresswoman Kaptur said in a statement:

“In shifting these funds, President Trump is not only defying the law—he is raising working families’ energy bills and undermining America’s energy independence. Shortchanging these energy sources of the future hands an advantage to our global rivals while jacking up Americans’ energy costs. This decision is hurting our national labs, starving our universities of resources to conduct cutting-edge research, and undercutting businesses, local governments, and communities across the country. We are asking GAO to look into whether this decision violates key appropriations laws, and we again call on the Department of Energy to restore the funding levels that were signed into law by President Trump himself.”

In their letter, Murray and Kaptur write: “We are writing to request that GAO issue a legal decision regarding the Department Energy’s (DOE) use of funds in fiscal year (FY) 2025. Specifically, we would like GAO to address whether DOE’s use of funds in several accounts complies with the Purpose Statute and the Antideficiency Act. …. We are concerned that DOE’s actions may not comply with either statute.”

In fiscal year 2024, Congress provided $137 million for the Department of Energy to support wind energy initiatives and provided $318 million to support solar energy. The fiscal year 2025 full-year CR that House Republicans wrote and President Trump signed into law continued these fiscal year 2024 funding levels. But in a spend plan made public earlier this month, the Trump administration revealed it is steering hundreds of millions of dollars designated by Congress to support wind and solar energy to other, favored industries—jeopardizing critical progress and ceding ground on key energy solutions of the future—among other harmful cuts. Instead of funding wind energy initiatives at $137 million, the administration is funding them at $29.8 million (a 78% cut), and instead of funding solar initiatives at $318 million, it is funding them at $41.9 million (an 87% cut).

The full letter is available HERE and below:

Dear Mr. Dodaro:

We are writing to request that GAO issue a legal decision regarding the Department Energy’s (DOE) use of funds in fiscal year (FY) 2025. Specifically, we would like GAO to address whether DOE’s use of funds in several accounts complies with the Purpose Statute and the Antideficiency Act.

For FY 2024, Congress appropriated funds to DOE with direction that the funds be spent in accordance with a table in the explanatory statement accompanying the appropriations act, making the amounts in the table legally binding on DOE. The continuing resolution for FY 2025 maintained this requirement for most DOE appropriations.

DOE’s budget justification for FY 2026 includes a table which shows the FY 2024 and 2025 “enacted” funding levels for various DOE accounts, with subaccounts that correspond to the subaccounts in the FY 2024 explanatory statement. However, the amounts in the “FY 2025 Enacted” column of DOE’s table do not match the amounts Congress provided in the FY 2024 explanatory statement. Specifically, DOE’s table contains deviations in subaccount allocations for the following accounts: “Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,” “Nuclear Energy,” “Fossil Energy,” “Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning,” “Non-Defense Environmental Cleanup,” and “Science.” This suggests that DOE’s FY 2025 spending may not be aligned with the congressionally approved spending levels set out in the FY 2024 explanatory statement.

The Purpose Statute provides that “Appropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.” GAO decisions apply the Purpose Statute through a three-part framework: (1) the obligation must bear a reasonable and logical relationship to the appropriation; (2) the obligation must not be prohibited by other law; and (3) the obligation must not be otherwise provided for. Where Congress has directed the expenditure of funds for a particular purpose, the agency may not use the funds for some other purpose, absent statutory authority to do so. Furthermore, the Antideficiency Act prohibits the obligation of funds in excess of available appropriations. GAO decisions describe a nexus between Purpose Statute violations and the Antideficiency Act. We are concerned that DOE’s actions may not comply with either statute.

Therefore, we request that GAO provide a legal decision determining whether DOE’s FY 2025 spending in the identified accounts is in accordance with the FY 2024 explanatory statement, as continued by the full year continuing resolution for FY 2025, and whether DOE has violated the Purpose Statute and the Antideficiency Act.

Sincerely,

NORTHWEST ASIAN WEEKLY

President Trump may be celebrating the passage of his “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” but in Washington state, alarm bells are ringing. In a high-stakes meeting at Seattle City Light’s Denny Substation on July 25, Sen. Patty Murray didn’t hold back. Calling the newly passed federal spending law “devastating,” she and a panel of Washington energy leaders warned that billions in clean energy investments—and tens of thousands of local jobs—are on the chopping block after Congress repealed key climate tax credits in what she dubbed the “big ugly bill.”

“I want to do this today so we can all understand, see what’s going on, and help raise voices to fight back,” she said.

The discussion was attended by Washington State Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn, Seattle City Light CEO Dawn Lindell, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 77 Political Director Christine Reid, Climate Solutions Executive Director Gregg Small, and Western Solar General Manager Brandon Provalenko.

“A terrible step backward”

Murray, vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, opened the morning forum with a candid assessment about the new law.

“It is going to increase the cost of health care, energy, and set us back in our fight against climate change,” she said. “Before this bill, the typical Washington household could save anywhere from $390 to $900 on their annual energy bill because of clean-energy tax credits. Those are gone. So energy prices for families are going to go up.”

Independent projections confirm the Trump administration’s rollback will likely raise electricity costs for Washington state households by $115 per year by 2029, on top of broader, inflationary pressures. Puget Sound Solar has warned that without the residential rooftop solar tax credit, the local solar install market could shrink by as much as 60%.

Murray also called out the joint effort by the Department of Energy and the Trump administration to reroute funds away from solar and wind, signaling a new pathway to favor fossil fuel projects. Legal experts warn this could be in violation of Congressionally authorized budget bills and is expected to initiate lawsuits.

A sudden policy shift

The session followed Congress’ July 4 approval of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law by Trump. The new law rolls back key parts of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), especially the clean energy tax credits that experts say helped attract nearly $1 billion in private investment to Washington state. That funding had put Washington on the leading edge of the country’s clean energy transition.

Now, many of those incentives are being phased out or scrapped entirely. For example, solar and wind projects won’t be eligible for the popular Section 48E and 45Y tax credits if construction hasn’t started by July 2026. And for homeowners? Credits for rooftop solar panels and home energy upgrades are being cut off even sooner—by the end of 2025.

Republicans have pushed hard for this rollback. In a letter signed by 38 GOP House members, they argued that the IRA’s energy subsidies were hurting taxpayers, driving up energy prices, and putting the power grid at risk. “These subsidies prop up unreliable energy sources,” the letter said, “while displacing dependable, proven energy like coal and natural gas.”

But back in Washington state, officials are sounding the alarm. According to a recent state report, $8.7 billion in clean energy investments across 27 projects could now be in jeopardy. That also puts around 21,800 jobs at risk by 2030. Grid experts warn that this sudden change could freeze solar and wind development, just as demand for electricity—from EVs, a growing population, and massive data centers—is soaring.

Real-world impacts: “Jobs and innovation on the line”

Nguyễn pointed out that impacts are already being felt, particularly in economically vulnerable and rural communities. “We are seeing projects get frozen, we’re seeing jobs get lost,” he said.

“I’ve already gone around Washington state talking to local communities, talking to economic development groups, and the first thing they’ll say is we need more housing and we need more energy. So when you don’t have enough energy to create enough supply for manufacturing, to create enough supply for housing, you lose these jobs and you lose these resources. So this has a multiplier effect that impacts us in Washington state and ironically, it happens generally in rural communities that probably need this help the most.”

Nguyễn said, “The people who aren’t able to be at this table, the people who aren’t able to raise their voices, those are the ones that are going to be most impacted by these terrible, terrible policies that happen at the federal level right now. And it’s going to impact our jobs. It’s going to make your electricity more expensive. And candidly, it could make us more at risk for brownouts or blackouts with our infrastructure being weakened as well.”

Lindell explained that the utility must double its energy supply in the next nine years to keep pace with demand.

“The clean energy tax credits in the IRAnflation Reduction Act were integral for us and our customers. With their elimination, we’re losing 30% of the capital cost leverage for new resources— – every new megawatt will cost more,” she said, projecting a 10-20% hike in procurement costs that will be passed on to customers through rate increases.

Reid outlined the ripple effect on the skilled labor supply.

“Apprenticeships are the backbone of building our workforce. When projects are canceled, so are training and job opportunities. Our members in Seattle alone are seeing layoffs and projects halted. This doesn’t just affect jobs today, it slows the innovation and system reliability our state depends on.”

Provalenko said Bellingham-based Western Solar is already laying off staff.

“We’ve gone from installing one megawatt in 2015 to six megawatts this year— – most of that could evaporate. The innovation hub we’ve built in Washington state for solar and battery technology is at risk. With this abrupt cliff, some companies will survive, but many won’t,” he said.

A surge in demand intersects with policy uncertainty

Clean energy and grid specialists say the timing couldn’t be worse. Small said that nationwide, 93% of new grid power additions in 2024 were solar, wind, or battery storage. Citing Energy Innovation, he warned,: “The impact of this bill could decrease electric capacity by 18GW in Washington— – equivalent to two times Seattle’s energy demand. Increased demand and cutbacks in supply mean higher prices, greater blackout risk, and slower job growth.”

Seattle City Light, which reports that it has been greenhouse gas neutral since 2005, is striving for carbon neutrality by 2030 and 100% renewable power by 2045, per the Clean Energy Transformation Act.

“Now is not the time to put our head in the sand. We are already behind in addressing the Earth’s warming and the impact on our communities,” Lindell said.

Divisions remain in Congress as litigation nears

While the Trump administration insists the new law restores “market discipline” by restricting subsidies for “unreliable” green energy and prioritizes energy security, state officials and Democratic lawmakers are preparing for both legal and legislative challenges. Murray repeatedly urged state and local stakeholders to keep “fighting back” and educating the public and Congress on the real-world stakes.

“Everything in Congress can be undone by a vote. But it’s an uphill fight,” she acknowledged, calling for renewed public engagement and bipartisan efforts to restore lost clean energy tax credits.

Nguyễn also said that support for clean energy persists even among some Republicans, with several signing letters backing affected technologies despite their party’s votes. “Washington has always led on aggressive decarbonization. Our challenge now is to not just survive, but to show what strategic leadership looks like going forward.”

Unknown future for Washington’s clean economy

Roundtable participants left the discussion with a warning: Uunless Congress acts immediately, Washington stands to lose billions in clean energy investments, with ripple effects statewide—for utility rates, job opportunities, energy reliability, innovation, and the climate.

Murray closed with a call to action: “Our prices are going to go up; speak out. We’re going to keep working hard, but people need to know what’s happening. There’s a lot of work ahead. We can’t give up on this.”",https://nwasianweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Patty-Murray_3891_Featured.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:03:58.619401

The Instituto Socioambiental report analysed the potential effect of the bill on 75 federal infrastructure projects launched in Amazon states in 2023.","RIO DE JANEIRO - As Brazil prepares to host the COP30 climate summit in the Amazon city of Belém in November, President Luís Inácio Lula da Silva is under pressure to veto a measure that could have a huge impact on the world's largest tropical rainforest.

The bill, according to critics, would dismantle the environmental licensing process in Brazil, home to the biggest share of the Amazon rainforest.

Dubbed the ""devastation bill"" by those who see it as Brazil's worst setback in environmental law since the country's democratic turn four decades ago, the legislation was passed in the Senate earlier this year and in the Lower House last week.

Environmentalists criticize Lula for not doing enough to stop the bill from moving forward and not challenging the powerful agribusiness caucus.

Leading ministers have supported the measure as well, despite vocal opposition from Environment Minister Marina Silva.

The conservative majority in Congress has enough seats to overturn a presidential veto, and the bill is likely to go before Brazil's Supreme Court, where its legality can be questioned, as legal experts and Brazil's Ministry of Environment deem it unconstitutional.

Here's what you need to know:

How does the bill alter Brazil's environmental licensing?

The bill loosens several permitting requirements.

For example, under the proposed rules, medium-impact projects would be automatically approved through a ""self-licensing process"" - a benefit previously limited to low-impact activities.

Companies would have to fill out an on-line form and declare their commitments to meet environmental requirements.

A 2021 analysis from Indigenous rights group Instituto Socioambiental and the Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) concluded that, if the changes were to occur, 86% of the mining projects waiting for a go-ahead in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil's mining powerhouse, could be allowed to self-license.

The bill also creates a ""special environmental licence"" for projects deemed ""strategic,"" regardless of any potentially adverse environmental impact, allowing them to benefit from a one-year deadline for approval.

The deadline could speed up contentious projects that may have been debated for years or even decades.

Government agencies specialising in Indigenous and African-descent populations would weigh in on impact-risk assessments only if projects affect fully recognised territories.

Licensing for obtaining environmental permits in other categories of protected areas would be allowed to proceed without consultation with the environmental agencies that manage them.

A report issued in April by Instituto Socioambiental said 3,000 protected areas could be affected, including more than 30% of Indigenous territories, and 80% of ""quilombola"" African-descent territories, many of which have been waiting decades to be fully recognised.

Who is backing the bill, and who is opposing it?

The bill has harnessed huge support in Brazil's Congress, backed by the dominant agribusiness caucus and mining sector.

Lula has been criticized by environmentalists for not making any public statement against the bill nor any visible efforts to keep it from moving forward, and the Mines and Energy, Transportation and Agriculture ministers have shown support for it.

Environment Minister Marina Silva, on the other hand, has described the bill as a major setback that ""severs"" and ""buries"" environmental licensing in Brazil.

Which projects could benefit from the bill?

The Instituto Socioambiental report analysed the potential effect of the bill on 75 federal infrastructure projects launched in Amazon states in 2023.

It concluded the bill would lift protections on more than 18 million hectares (44.5 million acres) of forests safeguarded by existing rules, an area about the size of Uruguay.

The bill could help unlock controversial projects in the vast rainforest and other natural areas such as the state-run oil firm Petrobras' bid to drill for oil in the mouth of the Amazon river, which environmentalists say could unleash an oil rush in the region.

The proposed permitting rules could also speed up the repaving of the BR-319, an 885-km (550-mile) road across one of the best preserved tracts of Brazil's Amazon, and the Ferrogrão railway, 976-km (606-mile) rail system backed by international traders to transport grains through the forest for exports.

All backed by Lula, these projects that have faced licensing and legal hurdles for years are expected to allow access to untouched Amazon areas and drive deforestation if given the go-ahead.",https://ddc514qh7t05d.cloudfront.net/dA/73705c666861383b4ef4c1eb0586d574/1200w/Jpeg,N,,2025-07-28 14:04:28.002174

Under the direction of Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy, the FTA will now allow grant recipients to request changes to their proposals, enabling a shift from zero-emission to low-emission technologies if desired.

The change follows feedback from transit agencies and public officials regarding the technical and financial challenges of implementing zero-emission transit solutions. According to the USDOT, the revised policy is intended to provide agencies with greater flexibility to choose technologies that align with their operational needs and budgets.

Secretary Duffy said:

I’m proud to provide our transit operators the flexibility to use all sources of American Energy to power our transit infrastructure and focus on building safe and reliable buses for American commuters.

Grant recipients who wish to revise their projects from zero-emission to low-emission technology, or who want to seek reconsideration of previously denied requests, are encouraged to contact their FTA Regional Office.

Requests must be submitted in writing, outlining the proposed changes and the rationale for the adjustment. The FTA will review all submissions in accordance with its standard processes.

Marc Molinaro, Senior Advisor at the FTA said:

The purpose of these grants is to help fund reliable mobility for Americans and meet public demand, not force ideology on American manufacturers and public transportation providers at the expense of the American people – they deserve transportation that works. FTA grant recipients asked for this flexibility and Secretary Duffy delivered.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.
On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.","URBANA, Ill. — Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics – dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries – and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

As rural America faces economic uncertainty and climate pressures, I believe homegrown renewable energy offers a practical path forward. Wind and solar aren’t just fueling the grid; they’re helping keep farms and rural towns alive.",https://www.morningagclips.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/7413870976_e1d39ea82d_k.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:06:27.284066

These initiatives are designed to accelerate Australia’s renewable energy transition and support diverse clean energy projects across the country.
CEFC’s CEO, Ian Learmonth, emphasised the organisation’s role in positioning Australia as a global leader in clean energy innovation and investment.
The organisation said it increased investments in hydrogen, bioenergy, and energy efficiency projects, which are expanding the scope of Australia’s renewable energy transition.
These initiatives are diversifying the country’s clean energy portfolio and positioning Australia as a leader in the development of next-generation technologies.","Among these investments is CEFC’s largest single commitment since its establishment: up to AU$1.92 billion allocated for the construction of the HumeLink transmission project.

The HumeLink will involve the construction of 365 kilometers of new 500 kV high-voltage transmission infrastructure connecting Wagga Wagga, Bannaby, and Maragle in New South Wales.

This project is expected to unlock the full capacity of the expanded Snowy Hydro Scheme, better known as Snowy 2.0, which includes a 2GW pumped hydro energy storage project with a storage duration of 175 hours, providing additional grid stability for Australia’s energy network.

CEFC’s investments in renewable energy technologies

The CEFC’s investments span various renewable energy technologies, including large-scale solar, wind, and battery energy storage system (BESS) projects.

Notable among these is its involvement in an AU$1.4 billion finance raise for Neoen secured in December 2024. The capital raise will support Neoen’s existing 66MW Parkes, 36MW Griffith, and 28MW Dubbo solar PV plants in New South Wales, alongside the 157MW Kaban Green Power Hub in Queensland, which comprises wind generation.

Additionally, the CEFC has invested in other technologies via its Rewiring the Nation (RTN) Fund, the Household Energy Upgrades Fund (HEUF), and the Powering Australia Technology Fund (PATF).

These initiatives are designed to accelerate Australia’s renewable energy transition and support diverse clean energy projects across the country.

Since its inception, the CEFC has made lifetime commitments of AU$18.3 billion and claims to have helped drive AU$85.3 billion in clean energy project investments.

CEFC’s CEO, Ian Learmonth, emphasised the organisation’s role in positioning Australia as a global leader in clean energy innovation and investment.

“While the economy-shaping impact of our larger-scale transactions is clear, the full story of CEFC investment activity this year demonstrates that we are delivering for taxpayers, with direct and immediate benefit in homes and small businesses, for vehicle owners and on farms,” Learmonth said.

“By providing access to discounted CEFC finance, we are paving the way for an increasing number of Australians to cut their individual carbon footprint in their everyday activities – and tapping into growing consumer sentiment in favour of measures to address climate change.”

The CEFC’s record-breaking year also reflects its commitment to emerging technologies.

The organisation said it increased investments in hydrogen, bioenergy, and energy efficiency projects, which are expanding the scope of Australia’s renewable energy transition.

States with the lowest average gas prices include Mississippi ($2.66), Oklahoma ($2.67), and Louisiana ($2.73).
Conversely, California ($4.42), Hawaii ($4.42), and Washington ($4.34) reported the highest average prices.","BALTIMORE, MD—After a brief respite, the national average price of gasoline has edged back up, rising 0.9 cents in the past week to $3.10 per gallon, GasBuddy reported Monday. The slight increase comes as energy markets react to a new trade agreement between the United States and the European Union, which has pushed oil prices higher.

Despite the recent uptick, the national average remains down 6.5 cents from a month ago and is 37.5 cents per gallon lower than a year ago. The average price of diesel also increased, rising 1.6 cents in the last week to $3.709 per gallon.

“It’s been another relatively quiet week for average gas prices, with most states seeing modest or slight declines, while a handful of price cycling states experienced the most noticeable fluctuations,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. He noted that oil prices continue to hover in the mid-to-upper $60s.

De Haan added that with gasoline demand beginning to ease as August approaches, prices could gradually decline toward Labor Day. However, he cautioned that hurricane activity, which typically picks up this time of year, could disrupt supply and shift the outlook.

Oil prices saw an optimistic turn after the U.S. and E.U. reached a trade agreement over the weekend, leading to increased demand growth projections. In early Monday trading, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was up $1.30 to $66.46 per barrel, while Brent crude oil gained $1.33 to $69.77 per barrel. Easing trade tensions are expected to stimulate economic activity and global energy demand.

Concerns about other trade deals persist, with the U.S. likely to extend an agreement with China. However, ongoing efforts by OPEC+ to boost oil supply are expected to limit significant price gains. An OPEC+ committee is meeting Monday to review market dynamics ahead of an Aug. 3 meeting to determine September’s production levels.

“Oil prices continue to hold up, benefiting from a trade deal between the U.S. and Europe and President Trump saying the time for Russian President Putin to reach a ceasefire with Ukraine would be shortened to 10-12 days. This supported concerns of potential Russian supply disruptions,” said Giovanni Staunovo, a UBS commodities analyst, in an email.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending July 18, U.S. oil inventories fell by 3.2 million barrels and are about 9% below the seasonal average. Gasoline inventories also decreased by 1.7 million barrels but remain slightly above the five-year seasonal average. Distillate inventories, however, rose by 2.9 million barrels but are still about 19% below the five-year seasonal average.

The most common U.S. gas price encountered by motorists remained unchanged at $2.99 per gallon. The median U.S. gas price stands at $2.99 per gallon, up 1 cent from last week.

States with the lowest average gas prices include Mississippi ($2.66), Oklahoma ($2.67), and Louisiana ($2.73). Conversely, California ($4.42), Hawaii ($4.42), and Washington ($4.34) reported the highest average prices. Ohio saw the biggest weekly increase at 12.0 cents, while Indiana experienced the largest decline at 9.8 cents.

Sustainable Energy Association – “BC Hydro’s 2025 call for power is another big step toward a clean-energy future.","BC Hydro has launched a new call for power for 2025 to secure new sources of affordable, clean or renewable electricity that will support British Columbia’s expanding economy and create thousands of skilled jobs.

“B.C. will be the economic engine of Canada’s new economy, and that engine will be powered by abundant clean electricity,” said Premier David Eby. “By boosting our clean-energy supply in partnership with First Nations, we are supporting growing communities and industries while creating thousands of good-paying jobs and making life more affordable. This is just one way we are securing our future in the face of escalating threats from President Trump.”

As part of the 2025 call for power, BC Hydro has issued a request for proposals (RFP) to acquire up to 5,000 gigawatt-hours annually of electricity from large, clean or renewable projects in partnership with First Nations and independent power producers. This is the equivalent of powering 500,000 homes in British Columbia.

In 2024, BC Hydro completed its first call for power in 15 years, which resulted in 10 new renewable-energy projects with First Nations asset ownership between 49% and 51%. These projects are expected to generate up to $6 billion in private investment, with up to $3 billion under First Nations ownership, and create approximately 2,000 jobs annually during construction. The projects will also deliver power at prices 40% lower than BC Hydro’s last clean-power process in 2010, after adjusting for inflation.

The 2025 call for power represents the next phase of B.C.’s renewable-energy expansion strategy – deepening First Nations partnerships, unlocking investment and accelerating progress toward the province’s economic and climate goals.

“This is our moment to build the clean-energy future British Columbians deserve,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Energy and Climate Solutions. “We’re doubling down on renewable power, expanding our grid and supporting First Nations leadership in energy development, all while helping communities and businesses access the clean electricity they need to grow.”

The RFP eligibility requirements include:

generate clean or renewable energy;

have capacity greater or equal to 40 megawatts;

have a minimum of 25% equity ownership held by First Nations; and

be operational by Oct. 1, 2033.

BC Hydro plans to award electricity purchase agreements to selected projects in early 2026.

“Through collaboration with government, First Nations and the clean-energy sector, BC Hydro is making significant investments and seeking new partnerships to secure B.C.’s clean-energy future,” said Chris O’Riley, president and CEO, BC Hydro. “This call for power is a key step in expanding our electricity system to meet growing demand while ensuring security, sustainability and affordability.”

The 2025 call for power is part of the Clean Power Action Plan, which aims to boost grid resilience, expand grid capacity and support B.C.’s transition to a clean economy.

BC Hydro will issue calls for power every two years, alongside delivering $36 billion in infrastructure investments through its 10-year capital plan, enhancing grid reliability and supporting growth in every region of the province.

Quick Facts:

When the Site C hydroelectric dam comes into full operation in 2025, it will generate enough electricity for 500,000 homes and increase BC Hydro’s total supply by 8%.

BC Hydro is investing more than $700 million over the next three years in energy-efficiency tools, technology and programs, which is expected to result in 2,000 gigawatt-hours per year of electricity savings, or enough to power 200,000 homes.

As EV markets evolve, Slate’s gamble on simplicity could either redefine affordability or highlight the perils of under-delivering on expectations.","In the competitive arena of electric vehicles, a Michigan-based startup named Slate Auto is carving out a niche with a radically minimalist approach, backed by none other than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Unveiled earlier this year, Slate aims to disrupt the market by offering a bare-bones electric pickup truck priced in the mid-$20,000 range, a figure that undercuts many rivals and targets budget-conscious consumers weary of high-end EV premiums. According to a recent report from Yahoo Finance, the company’s strategy hinges on stripping away non-essential features—like stereos, power windows, and even air conditioning in base models—while allowing buyers to add them as paid upgrades, potentially revolutionizing how affordability is achieved in the EV sector.

This model draws inspiration from no-frills industries, such as budget airlines, where core functionality comes cheap, and amenities cost extra. Slate’s executives argue that this modular design not only slashes production costs but also empowers customization, appealing to a demographic that includes fleet operators and urban commuters. As detailed in a timeline published by TechCrunch, the startup emerged from stealth in April 2025 after securing $111 million in Series A funding, with Bezos’ investment arm playing a pivotal role alongside other venture capitalists.

Strategic Backing and Rapid Expansion in Detroit’s Shadow

Bezos’ involvement isn’t merely financial; it signals confidence in Slate’s potential to challenge established players like Tesla and Rivian, especially as EV adoption faces headwinds from fluctuating incentives and supply chain issues. Posts on X (formerly Twitter) from industry observers highlight growing buzz, with users noting Slate’s “shapeshifting design” that could render pricier trucks obsolete, echoing sentiments that position it as a domestic counter to cheap Chinese imports. The company’s headquarters in suburban Detroit, as reported by Automotive News, has ballooned to 250 employees, with aggressive hiring underway to support manufacturing ambitions in Indiana by late 2026.

This expansion unfolds in the heart of traditional automaking territory, where Slate’s low-cost ethos contrasts sharply with the Big Three’s focus on feature-laden trucks. A prototype spotting covered by TechCrunch revealed a compact, utilitarian vehicle with crank windows and minimal tech, emphasizing durability over luxury. Insiders suggest this could appeal to markets underserved by current EVs, particularly in rural areas where range anxiety and charging infrastructure remain barriers.

Affordability Gambit Amid Market Volatility

Slate’s pricing strategy—starting under $20,000 for the most basic version—comes at a time when federal tax credits are in flux, potentially expiring and driving up effective costs for competitors. Drawing from a GMToday account of the truck’s debut at a Detroit summit, the vehicle boasts a “petite” footprint ideal for city driving, with optional add-ons like audio systems positioned as upsell opportunities to boost margins. This à la carte model, as analyzed in recent Reuters coverage mirrored on Investing.com, bets that consumers will prioritize entry-level access and personalize later, a tactic that could yield higher lifetime value per customer.

However, challenges loom: scaling production without compromising quality, navigating regulatory hurdles for autonomous features, and competing against subsidized imports. X posts from automotive enthusiasts underscore skepticism, with some questioning if the bare-bones approach sacrifices safety or appeal, yet others praise it as a fresh take on sustainability. Bezos’ track record with disruptive ventures, from Amazon’s logistics to past EV bets like Rivian, lends credibility, but Slate must prove its model in a market where Tesla’s dominance and GM’s production ramp-up create intense pressure.

Innovation Through Minimalism: A Blueprint for the Future?

At its core, Slate Auto represents a philosophical shift in EV design, prioritizing accessibility over excess. By leveraging modular assembly lines, as hinted in Business and Leadership analyses of Bezos’ investment patterns, the startup could achieve economies of scale faster than bloated competitors. Early prototypes, spotted and dissected in tech media, feature innovative battery tech promising 200-mile ranges on budget configurations, addressing a key pain point for cost-sensitive buyers.

Industry insiders view this as a test case for democratizing EVs, especially as global demand surges amid climate goals. If successful, Slate might inspire a wave of minimalist vehicles, reshaping manufacturing norms. Yet, with production slated for 2026, the coming months will be critical for refining prototypes and securing partnerships, potentially with Amazon for fleet integration. As EV markets evolve, Slate’s gamble on simplicity could either redefine affordability or highlight the perils of under-delivering on expectations.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/xai-tmp-imgen-636e1a9b-d647-4d3f-8ad5-0f85ba84575c.jpeg,N,,2025-07-28 13:27:44.193757

Summary of the Argument

If the climate is changing, then the Nation should decide how to address it. See City of New York v. Chevron Corp., 993 F.3d 81, 91 (2d Cir. 2021) (“[T]he question before us is whether a nuisance suit seeking to recover damages for the harms caused by global greenhouse gas emissions may proceed under New York law. Our answer is simple: no.”) (New York). The plaintiffs/appellants see things differently, but for the reasons discussed below, they are wrong.

No matter how they try to mask their aims, the plaintiffs/appellants want to misuse the settled laws of nuisance and misrepresentation against the defendants in these cases to set nationwide climate policy, all in violation of federal law and sound tort principles. And until rebuffed by the two Maryland trial courts giving rise to this appeal, the plaintiffs/appellants plowed forward despite U.S. Supreme Court precedent to the contrary. But while local governments continue to willfully ignore the U.S. Supreme Court and, by extension, the Constitution, the law in this area is clear: Congress displaced local attempts to address nationwide climate issues in the Clean Air Act (CAA). See American Electric Power v. Connecticut, 564 U.S. 410, 422–23 (2011) (AEP). As the Nation decides how to address changes in the global climate, its choices—including deciding as a Nation not to act—will have nationwide effects. This Court should reaffirm the lower court decisions (at E.1–34, E.1374–1391) that prevent these plaintiffs/appellants in one state from trying to set climate policy for the Country, using only a set of boilerplate allegations. Regardless of one’s political views about it, regulating the global climate is improper for local tort law.

At bottom, the plaintiffs/appellants say that the defendants “knew” that their fossil fuels were altering the climate, only to conceal the truth from consumers in Maryland and elsewhere, and they further claim that the defendants’ conduct led to an increase in greenhouse gases, which in turn raised temperatures throughout the Nation. Nonetheless, the trial courts properly refused to let the cases go to trial on such unprecedented misrepresentation and nuisance theories.

This Court should affirm the trial courts for at least two reasons. First, the trial courts rightly recognized that federal law preempts all state law, Maryland’s common law included, on the claims that the defendants’ air pollution contributed to climate change. The trial courts held, consistent with AEP, 564 U.S. at 422–23, that the Clean Air Act preempts judge-made federal common law causes of action for that sort of alleged injury. E.18–19; E.1384–86. Second, the trial courts rightly rejected the unprecedented and unmoored tort theories of nuisance and misrepresentation (or “failure to warn,” “trespass” etc.—the gravamen of each claim in each case sounds in misunderstood theories of nuisance and fraud) that do not meet the basic requirement that the defendants must have made a material misstatement or omission on which the plaintiffs actually and justifiably relied to their detriment and somehow invaded their properties too. See E.13–14; E.1383 (folding misrepresentation claims into the preemption analysis). In each case, the widespread production of information about global warming means that no one—in law—could hold the defendants responsible when none of the defendants’ marketing materials were directed to Maryland consumers (let alone read by them) or made any claims about global warming.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Maryland_Supreme_Court-e1420565068363.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 13:27:06.132959

July 28, 2025 – The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) today commended the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for taking enforcement action against Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) for failing to comply with the CSB’s Accidental Release Reporting Rule—a critical requirement under Section 112(r) of the federal Clean Air Act. The action follows a serious natural gas release on June 8, 2023, in San Jose, California, that seriously injured a PG&E employee.

Under the Reporting Rule, owners and operators of facilities that experience an accidental release resulting in a fatality, serious injury, or substantial property damage must report the incident to the CSB. The Clean Air Act gives EPA the authority to enforce a failure to report an accidental release to the CSB under the rule.

Despite being advised by the CSB that the company was required to report the release, PG&E failed to submit a report to the CSB following the June 2023 incident. As provided by the Clean Air Act, the CSB referred the matter to EPA for enforcement.

“This matter underscores the importance of timely and accurate reporting to the CSB,” said CSB Chairperson Steve Owens. “When companies fail to report serious chemical releases like this, they impede the CSB’s ability to carry out the agency’s core mission to conduct independent investigations of these incidents and help prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.”

“Americans have a right to know about accidental releases of dangerous substances and their impacts,” said Deputy Assistant Administrator Cecil Rodrigues for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “This settlement clearly signals that EPA will hold companies accountable for not providing CSB with essential information and the potential for loss of life, injury, or property damage.”

This settlement marks the first-ever enforcement action resolved under the CSB’s Accidental Release Reporting Rule. As part of the resolution, PG&E will pay a civil penalty of $45,273 and was required to submit the required report to the CSB earlier this year.

This action further strengthens the collaboration between the CSB and EPA in the shared goal of reducing the frequency and severity of chemical accidents across the United States. “The CSB greatly appreciates EPA’s efforts in successfully resolving this matter,” Chairperson Owens said. “Most companies willingly comply with the reporting requirement, but, unfortunately, enforcement was necessary in this case.”

The White House published an artificial intelligence “action plan” last week that calls for cutting regulations and the construction of more data centers and energy assets to power them.

To that end, the administration “will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape” by recommending categorical exclusions from certain environmental regulations for data centers and expediting related permitting.

The plan says the United States must prevent the “premature decommissioning” of critical power generation resources and “explore innovative ways to harness existing capacity, such as leveraging extant backup power sources to bolster grid reliability during peak demand.”

Dive Insight:

The document is in line with previous actions by the Trump administration to delay the shuttering of coal plants and promote the use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy by declaring a national energy emergency.

It calls for the prioritization of “reliable, dispatchable power sources” and new technology, nodding specifically to enhanced geothermal, nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.

But it also acknowledges the need to maximize existing resources through enhanced efficiency and transmission, and appears to leave the door open to limiting data centers’ power consumption during “critical grid periods.” And while it calls for building new generation as quickly as possible, it is silent on the role of renewables. The vast majority of new generation coming online now is from solar, and clean energy advocates say it is the cheapest and fastest way to deploy new power to the grid.

The plan received mixed reviews. Conservation groups decried the impact of AI on energy and water resources, while some free market advocates praised the administration’s intentions while questioning its ability to enact unilateral reforms.

Paige Lambermont, a fellow at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, said, “Only so much of this can be done by executive power alone.”

“AI is certainly important but permitting reform should be broad-based, requiring major changes to the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and NEPA, among other laws,” she said in a statement. “Broad-based permitting reform will help our nation to develop critical infrastructure and energy projects and benefit industries and specific projects across the economy, including those related to AI.”

Mitch Jones, the managing director of policy and litigation for Food & Water Watch, an environmental advocacy group, called the Trump plan“nothing more than a thinly-veiled invitation for the fossil fuel” industry to “ramp up their exploitation of our environment and natural resources – all at the expense of everyday people.”

A spokesperson for the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group representing investor-owned utilities, referred to its recently-released annual financial review, which highlighted the significant investments by the electric power sector driven by rising electricity demand.

Dive Brief:

Since 2009, 95 legal cases have been launched globally claiming human rights harms caused by renewable energy projects, according to new research from the Business and Human Rights Resource Center. The BHRRC is an international NGO that promotes corporate accountability and transparency by highlighting companies’ social and environmental impact on communities.

The majority of lawsuits (71%) were against companies mining what the BHRRC calls “transition minerals,” eight minerals that are crucial elements of renewable energy technologies, such as lithium for electric vehicles. The other 29% involved renewable energy projects such as wind (14%), hydropower (12%) and solar projects (4%).

About 77% of these cases have been filed since 2018, aligning with the recent surge of project developments in the energy transition sector, according to a July 1 press release. The region with the largest share of suits —53% — was Latin America and the Caribbean, with 76% of these cases relating to the extraction of transition minerals.

Dive Insight:

The BHRRC’s analysis is based on data from its “Just Transition Litigation Tracking Tool,” which tracks a subset of climate lawsuits related to the renewable energy transition. The tracker includes legal cases brought by groups the BHRCC defines as “rightsholders,” such as Indigenous peoples, communities and workers directly affected by such energy projects. The tracker focuses on civil, constitutional and administrative lawsuits in domestic courts and doesn’t take into account criminal cases against companies or measures taken by regulatory bodies.

The BHRRC also analyzed the lawsuits in terms of how they affected the plaintiffs in matters ranging from land rights to forced labor. About 70% of the tracked cases claimed environmental abuses and 56% of cases related to water pollution, specifically. Forty percent of cases claimed impacts on protected areas such as Indigenous people’s sacred land, while 27% of cases claimed violations of land rights. Forty-eight percent of cases involved a violation of the right to livelihood, including the right to food and to the ownership and control of natural resources.

Almost half of all cases were filed by Indigenous peoples, and 49% of these cases complained of violations of their rights, including, more specifically, the right to “free, prior and informed consent.”

For the majority of cases filed (53%), rightsholders claimed they had not been sufficiently consulted regarding a project.

The BHRRC characterized the lawsuits as seeking to shape the renewable energy transition rather than stop it altogether. But nearly 65% of legal cases in the tracker sought to permanently or temporarily halt the project in question.

Such data demonstrates that failing to partner with affected communities when launching renewable energy projects presents “severe legal risks” for companies and investors, as well as the risk of slowing the energy transition as a whole, according to the BHRRC.

“Our data paints a troubling picture: if companies and investors don’t urgently address disregard for the human rights in the renewable energy value chain, we are likely to see a derailing of the much-needed clean energy transition,” Elodie Abe, senior leader researcher at the BHRRC, said in the press release. “Human rights are not a barrier to progress; they are a precondition for it.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/RDN-t08jIgvZlrAnHTAmOZU9cPWJU69lNw549-gASJM/g:nowe:1:23/c:1022:577/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzMyODQ5MTg1LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-28 16:04:53.999580

This historic milestone—the largest standalone project financing in history—not only underscores the company's dominance in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports but also positions it as a linchpin in the global energy transition. For investors, the move represents a rare confluence of geopolitical necessity, financial innovation, and long-term growth potential.

Strategic Implications: Reinforcing U.S. Energy Security and Global Market Share

The CP2 LNG project, located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana, is a cornerstone of Venture Global's strategy to solidify the U.S. as the world's premier LNG exporter. With a peak production capacity of 28 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), the project is set to deliver reliable U.S. LNG to global markets by 2027. This timing is critical: as Europe diversifies away from Russian gas and Asian markets grapple with energy inflation, demand for U.S. LNG is surging.

The financing's structure—secured without external equity—highlights Venture Global's financial discipline and the confidence of its banking partners. A consortium of over 30 global banks, including industry heavyweights like J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and ING, has committed $34 billion in total. This level of institutional backing signals a de facto endorsement of the project's viability and the enduring relevance of LNG in the energy transition.

Moreover, the project's 43.5 MTPA of contracted capacity across three Louisiana-based facilities (Calcasieu Pass, Plaquemines LNG, and CP2) demonstrates Venture Global's ability to secure long-term sales and purchase agreements (SPAs) with high-profile customers like Eni and SEFE. These partnerships, particularly Eni's first long-term contract with a U.S. LNG producer, are not just commercial wins—they are geopolitical ones, aligning U.S. energy strategy with European and Asian decarbonization goals.

Financial Innovation and Risk Mitigation

The CP2 financing's uniqueness lies in its ability to blend scale with sustainability. Venture Global is integrating Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) at each of its LNG facilities, a move that aligns with global net-zero targets and insulates the project from regulatory headwinds. This forward-thinking approach is mirrored in the project's economic footprint: it will generate over $4 billion in local property taxes and create 7,500 direct construction jobs, with thousands more indirect jobs across 30 states.

For investors, the absence of equity dilution is a key differentiator. By leveraging debt financing, Venture Global preserves shareholder value while maintaining operational flexibility. This model contrasts sharply with traditional equity-heavy LNG projects, which often burden balance sheets and dilute earnings. The company's track record—three greenfield projects reaching final investment decision (FID) in under six years—further validates its ability to execute at scale.

The Bigger Picture: Capital Markets and the Energy Transition

The CP2 project's success is emblematic of a broader shift in capital markets. As the world grapples with energy security and decarbonization, LNG is emerging as a bridge fuel—a reality reflected in the $80 billion in capital markets transactions Venture Global has executed to date. The project's financing also highlights the U.S. energy sector's ability to attract global capital, with over $34 billion in commitments from banks across six continents.

For investors, this signals a pivotal moment: LNG is no longer a niche commodity but a strategic asset class. Venture Global's ability to secure such a massive financing without equity underscores its operational and financial credibility. Meanwhile, its partnerships with European and Asian buyers align with the U.S.'s role as a stabilizing force in global energy markets—a dynamic that is likely to persist for the next decade.

Investment Thesis: A Must-Watch Player in the Energy Transition

Venture Global's CP2 project is more than a financing win—it's a masterclass in aligning corporate strategy with macro trends. The company's vertically integrated approach, combining LNG production, pipeline infrastructure, and carbon capture, positions it to benefit from both near-term energy demand and long-term decarbonization.

For investors, the key question is not whether the project will succeed, but how much upside remains. With 43.5 MTPA of contracted capacity already secured and a pipeline of projects in development, Venture Global is well-positioned to capitalize on the $500 billion global LNG market. Its ability to execute CP2 without dilution, coupled with its strong balance sheet and federal approvals, reduces downside risk while amplifying growth potential.

In a world where energy security and sustainability are inextricably linked, Venture Global's CP2 LNG project is a blueprint for the future. As the largest standalone LNG financing in history, it sets a new standard for the industry—and for investors seeking exposure to a company at the nexus of energy transition and capital markets.

For those who recognize the strategic and financial significance of this milestone, Venture Global is not just a name to watch—it's a force to be reckoned with.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-28 16:06:10.745036

Washington, D.C. | July 28, 2025 — The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), Institute for Workplace Skills and Innovation (IWSI) America, and other partners today announced the release of a 2025 report, Expansion of Registered Apprenticeship Programs in Clean Energy, highlighting the transformative impact of the Apprenticeships in Clean Energy (ACE) Network. This collaborative effort is expanding Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs across the clean energy sector, supporting one of the fastest-growing industries in the U.S. economy.

Clean energy jobs now employ nearly 3.5 million Americans and are growing at twice the rate of overall U.S. job growth. Yet the rapid evolution of this sector has exposed a critical gap: a shortage of standardized, scalable, and industry-aligned workforce training.

Enter the ACE Network, led by IREC and supported by IWSI and eight other partner organizations. The ACE Network provides technical assistance and vetted resources to help employers, training providers, and other organizations start or join Registered Apprenticeship programs. This initiative was supported by U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) funding through June 2025. The ACE Network will continue to provide free technical assistance to support Registered Apprenticeships in clean energy and build on the achievements that are documented in this report.

Key accomplishments of the ACE Network have included:

Growing the number of Registered Apprentices from just 15 to over 1,000 in two years.

Providing technical assistance to more than 200 employers.

Developing three National Guideline Standards (NGS) that provide models for apprenticeship programs in-demand occupations in clean energy, such as Construction Craft Laborer, Weatherization Technician, and Energy Auditor.

Launching innovative RA models in heat pump installation and digital media for clean energy employers.

“Clean energy companies need a pathway to hire and retain thousands of skilled employees, and Registered Apprenticeships perfectly fit the bill,” said Susan Biszewski-Eber, Senior Manager, Apprenticeship Programs at IREC. “We have been so thrilled to join IWSI and other partners to support more than a thousand new apprenticeships at dozens of energy companies. In the future, we look forward to expanding our efforts to develop even more apprenticeship opportunities in clean energy sectors like solar and storage, home energy performance, EVs, and many more.”

IWSI America served as the primary provider of technical assistance and registration support, drawing on global best practices to help employers navigate RA systems and launch sustainable programs. A full list of partner organizations can be found on the program website.

“In close partnership with IREC and its collaborators, IWSI’s mission is to foster cross-sector collaboration and channel the collective momentum toward a more sustainable, low-carbon future,” said Nicholas Wyman, CEO at IWSI America. “Leveraging modern apprenticeship models and data-driven workforce strategies, IWSI equips organizations to not only meet their green workforce development goals but to exceed them. Together, we’re cultivating a pipeline of skilled talent that fuels innovation and long-term resilience in the fast-evolving clean energy economy.”

Despite the program’s momentum, the report also revealed structural barriers, including the non-recognition of Solar Installer as an official occupation by DOL, lack of intermediary access to the RAPIDS tracking database, and slow or inconsistent RA program approval processes across states.

To address these issues, the report outlines a series of policy recommendations to streamline apprenticeship registration, increase flexibility, and expand NGS for emerging clean energy roles. It also underscores the need for continued investment in sector-specific apprenticeship intermediaries to ensure long-term workforce success.

IREC and IWSI America remain committed to supporting the next generation of clean energy professionals and call on industry, education, and government to build on this momentum.

A new study presents a high-resolution emissions mapping framework for megacities, revealing how carbon responsibility has shifted from centralized producers—like power plants and factories—to distributed end-users, such as homes and businesses. Using Shenzhen as a model, researchers integrated Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions across sectors and space, capturing emissions at the street, building, and 1 × 1 km2 district levels. This detailed approach not only uncovers the hidden carbon flows within urban systems but also highlights key areas for policy intervention, enabling cities to design fair and effective carbon mitigation strategies.

Urban areas are home to over half the world's population and emit more than 70% of fossil-fuel-derived carbon dioxide (CO2). Among these, megacities face mounting pressure to balance rapid development with climate goals. However, existing emissions tracking methods often rely on coarse annual citywide totals, obscuring the spatial and sectoral diversity of emissions. Most notably, traditional inventories focus on Scope 1 emissions—direct outputs from within city limits—while neglecting Scope 2 (indirect) emissions from imported electricity, which can be substantial. This limited view hinders effective policymaking. Based on these challenges, there is a pressing need to conduct fine-scale, integrated analyses of urban carbon flows to guide equitable and precise climate actions.

Researchers from the Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School have published a study (DOI: 10.1016/j.ese.2025.100602) on July 12, 2025, in Environmental Science and Ecotechnology, unveiling a novel carbon accounting model for megacities. Focusing on Shenzhen, China, the study combines building simulations, traffic data, industrial data, and land use to map both Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) emissions down to individual structures. The findings reveal a major shift in carbon responsibility from producers to consumers and offer a scalable framework to support low-carbon urban transformations worldwide.

The team developed a high-resolution framework that quantifies and spatially allocates CO₂ emissions by integrating fuel-specific industrial data, building-level electricity usage, and real-time traffic flows. In 2020, Shenzhen's total CO₂ emissions reached 52.0 Tg, with 44.8 Tg (86.3%) from Scope 1 and 7.2 Tg (13.7%) from Scope 2 sources. While power plants and road traffic dominated direct emissions, indirect emissions from electricity use in residential, commercial, and industrial buildings accounted for over 60% of total Scope 2 emissions. Notably, when emissions were reallocated to consumption points, emission hotspots expanded from 0.7% to 12.7% of city area, revealing broader responsibility beyond traditional industrial centers. The study also found that 84.8% of Shenzhen's districts are consumption-led, emphasizing the need for energy efficiency and green buildings. By uncovering disparities in emissions across districts and population densities, the study offers actionable insights for targeting reductions where they are most impactful. This bottom-up approach bridges the gap between macro targets and micro interventions, enabling cities to tailor mitigation strategies with unprecedented precision.

“Our research demonstrates that cities must move beyond total emissions and consider where, how, and by whom emissions are generated and used,” said Prof. Bo Zheng, co-author of the study. “By revealing the hidden carbon flows linked to electricity consumption, especially in high-density districts, our landscape-level framework empowers urban planners and policymakers to design interventions that are both effective and equitable. As more cities adopt similar tools, we can accelerate the path toward climate neutrality.”

This study sets the stage for smarter carbon tracking in megacities worldwide. The landscape-level framework can inform targeted policies, such as installing solar panels on high-consuming buildings, promoting energy-efficient designs, and transitioning to cleaner power sources in production-led zones. Moreover, it supports climate justice by clarifying who bears carbon responsibility in complex urban ecosystems. With broader adoption, especially in cities heavily reliant on imported electricity, this model can help governments and citizens take coordinated, data-informed steps to meet emission reduction goals—transforming not just how we measure urban carbon, but how we act on it.

But, behind the promise of short-term savings lie risks that energy experts say could hurt our state’s grid and economy in the long-term.

SB 266 would reverse the interim carbon emissions reduction target that was established in House Bill 951, delaying, and potentially diminishing the deployment of wind and solar energy. What many don’t realize is that HB 951 didn’t just catalyze the state’s adoption of more renewable energy; it created a pathway to utilize some of the cheapest and most readily available resources to meet the record energy demand that North Carolina will experience over the next decade. Without that interim goal, experts are projecting an energy capacity shortfall of 12 GW as a direct result of delayed renewable energy deployment.

SB 266 would send a very dangerous signal to investors and developers in North Carolina’s renewable energy sector. Since 2021, the interim carbon emission reduction target has created investment certainty for the best tools available to get electrons on the grid quickly and in an affordable manner. Investment certainty is a key factor here because the industry has already invested $15 billion dollars and created over 10,000 in North Carolina according to the American Clean Power Association. This industry is poised for further growth, but according to a study published by BW Research, removing the interim target is estimated to cause a loss of 50,000 future jobs and billions of dollars in investments in the 2030s.

Those numbers may feel intangible, but a wind farm in rural northeastern North Carolina is responsible for a handful of jobs and approximately $1 million in local county tax revenue every year. As the largest taxpayer in the county, a predictable 30-year tax revenue is a game changer for local governments, schools, infrastructure, and emergency services. SB 266 could stall new wind energy projects and put at risk millions in long-term tax revenue that rural, economically distressed communities rely on to fund schools, emergency services, and local infrastructure.

What does any of this have to do with your electricity bill? Because wind and solar are fuel-free resources, their prices are predictable and steady even when the global fuel markets experience volatile price fluctuations. Without wind and solar on the grid, North Carolina customers would be much more vulnerable to extreme fluctuations that we see in fossil fuel markets, especially during extreme weather or times of increased electricity demand.

Just four years ago a bipartisan law enshrined the need to lower carbon emissions in a least cost manner across the state. This law provides investment certainty to utilities and companies looking to meet our energy needs, prioritize environmental and human health, and keep our state on a path to sustainable economic development.

Through the Northwest Ports Clean Air Strategy, the Port of Seattle is committed to phasing out emissions from all seaport-related activities by 2050. This includes emissions from oceangoing vessels, cargo handling equipment, Port buildings, fuel use, and more. Many of the maritime operations of the Port and our tenants still rely on traditional petroleum-based fossil fuels. To transition away from fossil fuels, it is crucial that the maritime sector adopt next-generation fuels. These fuels are especially important where electrification and batteries aren’t feasible, such as activities that involve heavy duty machinery, long-haul trucks, and large vessels. Next-generation fuels will not only help the Port reach its environmental goals, but they’ll keep the Port competitive in a rapidly developing global clean energy economy and drive the creation of clean energy jobs across the region.

Multiple next generation fuels are at various stages of development around the world. One of these fuels is hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe. Molecular hydrogen (H2) can be used as a fuel in a combustion engine, like gasoline and diesel fuel, or in specialized fuel cells to generate electricity through a chemical reaction with oxygen. Either way, the primary byproduct is water vapor. Combustion of hydrogen, however, can create nitrous oxide, a harmful air pollutant that is a common byproduct of the combustion of any fuel. These emissions can be mitigated and would not be generated at all by fuel cells. Not only can hydrogen be used as a fuel directly, but it is also a precursor to other alternative fuels, such as methanol and ammonia.

The Port’s hydrogen work

In pursuit of decarbonization, the Port is exploring a variety of pathways to advance alternative fuels and electrification. Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (SEA) has been involved in the development of sustainable aviation fuels since 2008 and the Port has played a role in the development of the Pacific Northwest to Alaska Green Corridor, which is studying the feasibility of powering cruise ships with green methanol. The Port is also considering including hydrogen as a potential fuel in a future suite of energy options.

As a potential end-user of hydrogen and hydrogen-derived fuels, the Port has an interest in supporting hydrogen fuel production and supply in the region. The Port, along with the Port of Tacoma and The Northwest Seaport Alliance (NWSA), has helped plan and develop the proposal for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub (PNWH2). The Hub is one of seven regional hubs selected in October 2023 and funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to kickstart the U.S. hydrogen economy. The funding for these hubs brings together producers and consumers and adds needed investment to accelerate the research and infrastructure necessary to deploy clean hydrogen at scale. The goal of these hubs is to help bring down the cost of clean hydrogen to $1 per kilogram — a target set by the DOE’s Hydrogen Shot initiative. The PNWH2 Hub consists of eight sites, or “nodes”, that are developing projects to produce, store, transport, and use clean hydrogen. The Port of Seattle does not currently have any active projects but our partners at the NWSA are designing an incentive program to support the purchase and deployment of hydrogen fueled drayage trucks and cargo handling equipment. Since the NWSA operates marine cargo facilities on Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma terminals, these new trucks and equipment would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants across the gateway.

Accessing hydrogen storage in Seattle

In addition to planning and advocating for the PNWH2 Hub, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in collaboration with the Port and Seattle City Light (SCL), conducted a risk assessment of large-scale hydrogen storage. This two-year long study helped the DOE, Port, and SCL understand the risks involved in setting up and operating a large-scale hydrogen storage facility in an urban-industrial setting. The study found that while hydrogen deployment in the region faces natural hazards and comes with risks, there are engineering controls and systems that can be implemented for safe operation. This study also focused on developing effective stakeholder engagement with community members and initiated an ongoing conversation with the Duwamish Valley Port Community Action Team (PCAT) on next-generation fuels.

The Port also recently completed the Seattle Waterfront Clean Energy Strategy in partnership with the NWSA and SCL, creating a shared roadmap to electrify the Seattle waterfront through strategic infrastructure, technology investments, and joint implementation. This strategy identifies the investments needed to meet growing electricity demand as the maritime sector transitions away from fossil fuels. While traditional electrical infrastructure remains the most cost-effective solution, the strategy recommends ongoing evaluation of alternative energy sources, like hydrogen. As technology matures and costs come down, hydrogen fuel cell-based power is expected to play a role in mitigating peak electrical loads and adding resiliency to the system.

The current hydrogen landscape

While it is still expanding and scaling up, hydrogen technology is not new. In fact, California has been developing hydrogen fueling infrastructure since 2004 when the California Hydrogen Highway Network Initiative was established. Currently, California has around 50 public hydrogen fueling stations operating throughout the state, with more planned. These stations are inconspicuous and are strikingly similar to traditional gas stations. Roll out has been slow due to high costs of clean hydrogen fuel compared to fossil gasoline, but this network demonstrates the efficacy of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles in our region.

Nationally and globally, ports are starting to develop and utilize hydrogen fuel infrastructure and equipment. Because hydrogen can power vessels, equipment, and other heavy-duty machinery that batteries cannot, ports are well-positioned to serve as early adopters of hydrogen technology. A hydrogen fuel cell-powered gantry crane began commercial operations at the Port of Los Angeles in 2024, and the Port of Oakland recently received federal funding to demonstrate hydrogen fuel cell cargo handling equipment and a mobile refueler truck. The maritime sector in Europe is also making strides to expand hydrogen production and use. The Port of Rotterdam is establishing themselves as a hydrogen hub for production, import, storage, and use of renewable hydrogen fuel, and Shell will soon construct Europe’s first major renewable hydrogen plant. A Norwegian shipyard is also set to deliver the two largest hydrogen-powered ferries to date in 2026. Meanwhile, a company in South Korea is working on the country’s first hydrogen-powered tug boat, and ports in Japan have demonstrated hydrogen-powered forklifts and gantry cranes. These developments demonstrate growing momentum for hydrogen fuel as an end-use in the maritime sector.

The budding hydrogen industry is making progress but is not without its challenges. The International Energy Agency cites financial hurdles, regulatory uncertainty, and unclear demand signals as some of the reasons hydrogen projects are facing delays. Continued support from public and private institutions will be needed to get this nascent sector off the ground. The Port will continue to leverage its position as a hub for maritime activity in the Pacific Northwest to accelerate the development of the hydrogen ecosystem and hydrogen’s use as a key input into next-generation fuels, like green methanol and ammonia. Supporting these fuels is just one strategy that the Port is deploying to achieve its clean air and climate goals.

The 15% tariff represents an improvement over threatened higher rates but still creates significant friction in transatlantic trade.","The electric vehicle battery sector faces a significant recalibration following the landmark trade agreement reached between the United States and European Union on July 27, 2025. The deal, which establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most goods including electric vehicles and battery components, represents both challenges and opportunities for manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic.

Trade agreement fundamentals

In a high-stakes negotiation at Trump's Turnberry golf resort in Scotland, US President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen finalized terms that will reshape transatlantic commerce. The agreement reduces previous tariff threats of up to 27.5% on European vehicles to a more manageable—though still substantial—15% rate.

While the agreement includes exemptions for aerospace and certain critical raw materials, both electric vehicles and semiconductors—crucial components in modern EV systems—fall under the 15% tariff structure.

Battery industry impact assessment

The new tariff regime arrives at a pivotal moment for the EV battery industry, which was already navigating complex supply chain challenges.

Rico Luman, senior sector economist for transport and logistics at Dutch bank ING, notes that while the 15% rate is ""clearly much better than 27.5%,"" it still represents ""a significant burden"" for automakers” and their battery suppliers, according to CNBC.

For battery manufacturers specifically, the agreement compounds challenges created by another recent trade action: US tariff on Chinese graphite, which raises costs for EV battery makers. This double pressure—tariffs on both Chinese raw materials and European finished products—creates a complex strategic landscape for battery manufacturers.

European response

The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) offered measured acknowledgment of the deal, describing it as ""an important step towards easing the intense uncertainty surrounding transatlantic trade relations."" However, the organization emphasized that ""many elements of the agreement still need to be clarified"" and urged both sides to ""focus on reducing obstacles to vital transatlantic automotive trade,"" according to electrive.

CNBC reports ACEA Director-General Sigrid de Vries expressed particular concern about the ongoing impact: ""Nevertheless, the US will retain higher tariffs on automobiles and automotive parts, and this will continue to have a negative impact not just for industry in the EU but also in the US.""

The Federation of German Industries (BDI) offered stronger criticism, with board member Wolfgang Niedermark calling the deal ""an inadequate compromise"" and warning that a 15% tariff rate ""will have a huge negative impact on Germany's export-oriented industry.""

Strategic adaptations for battery manufacturers

European and Asian battery makers have tried to navigate a US trade landscape that has been evolving since the Biden administration passed the IRA bill and has been under threat of new turbulence since January. To do so, they’ve implemented several strategic pathways:

US battery industry positioning

For US-based battery manufacturers, the agreement presents potential competitive advantages, though challenges remain.

The combination of the 15% tariff on European imports and existing tariffs on Chinese graphite and other battery materials creates a protective environment for domestic production. However, US manufacturers still face higher costs for imported components and raw materials.

Consumer impact

For EV buyers, the tariff situation threatens to increase prices at a critical moment in the industry's growth trajectory.

European luxury EV makers who export vehicles to the US market will likely need to absorb some of the tariff costs to remain competitive.

One more layer of complexity for the industry

As the EV battery sector absorbs the implications of the new EU-US trade agreement, manufacturers face difficult strategic choices. The 15% tariff represents an improvement over threatened higher rates but still creates significant friction in transatlantic trade.

Success in this environment will likely come to companies that can effectively localize production, diversify supply chains, and accelerate technological innovation—all while maintaining the cost competitiveness necessary to support continued EV adoption.

For an industry already navigating rapid technological change and evolving consumer preferences, these trade challenges add another layer of complexity to an already demanding business environment.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt6e44a5690730fe98/68879fdb81d6116050286653/US-EU-trade-deal-2226607319.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-28 14:05:43.240562

The poll results are in (from last week’s edition) and it’s clear what you want: Analysis with a capital A. You also want scoops, a bit of a news roundup, and deals, but far and away you’re looking for analysis. I’ve always sprinkled my thoughts and insights throughout the newsletter, but over the next few weeks and months you’ll see me push further into analysis.

On that note, earnings season is upon us and two stood out to me: GM and Tesla. Both companies are facing pressure from tariffs. And while GM also sells gas-powered vehicles, both are trying to sell EVs in a market that has seen growth slow while facing a future without EV incentives.

How GM and Tesla plan to navigate this (or at least what they’re signaling) is quite different.

GM, which saw tariffs take a $1 billion bite out of its Q2 line, still sees EVs as its “north star.” And while GM certainly trails Tesla in EV sales today, it has a bigger mix of EV models to attract customers — more than a dozen in all. And Chevrolet is now the No. 2 EV brand in the U.S.

And while GM did tout $4 billion of deferred revenue from its advanced driver-assistance system Super Cruise, along with OnStar and other software services that will be recognized over time, the big theme of the call was “flexibility.”

Chair and CEO Mary Barra and CFO Paul Jacobson said the word “flexibility” nine times during the Q2 earnings call. What they mean by flexibility is setting up factories where they can easily assemble EVs and ICE vehicles — and change up the mix based on demand.

Meanwhile, Tesla is betting heavily on the “future,” and for CEO Elon Musk that means autonomy and AI, or as he sometimes calls it, “real-world AI.”

The vast majority (about 74%) of Tesla’s revenue still comes from selling cars, although Q2 results show a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue. But if you listened to the Q2 call, it’s clear that Elon Musk isn’t interested in Tesla being a car company. (He even admitted that the highly anticipated breakthrough cheaper model Tesla is working on is really just a stripped down version of the Model Y.)

Musk wants to make and sell Optimus robots and deploy autonomous vehicles. The problem is that today these products — or future products — are not generating profits, let alone revenue.

Yes, Tesla does bring in revenue from its advanced driver-assistance system known as supervised Full Self-Driving. (This is not an autonomous vehicle and requires human driver engagement.) And yes, the company is charging for robotaxi rides in South Austin, but it is not at scale, nor is it profitable.

Musk acknowledged there would be some rough quarters ahead, but he still believes that ultimately this will be where the bulk of Tesla profits come from.

I think that this transition is going to take far longer than Musk has publicly shared. (Just today, The Information reported the company is far behind on its Optimus robot production goal.) And it seems the company is feeling the pressure to act. For instance, Tesla is reportedly bringing a limited version of its robotaxi service to San Francisco this weekend even though it technically doesn’t have the required permits. (What do you think Tesla’s workaround will be?)

Meanwhile, Tesla is under regulatory and legal pressures that could further undermine its effort to reboot sales and even threaten his future plans around FSD.

Holy Cross’ peak energy demands are the opposite of many utilities, topping out in winter, when the co-op still must supplement its growing clean energy sources with backup from Xcel Energy’s mixed portfolio.
In 2018, renewable energy supplied about 39% of the Holy Cross electricity distribution.
We’re doing really well on our long term plans,” Holy Cross vice president of finance Sam Whelan said.
Recent projects going online for Holy Cross include ownership of 150MW of a 200MW wind farm near Flagler, and 10MW solar farms with battery storage at Parachute and Rifle.","Holy Cross Energy supplied 96% of the electricity used by its 45,000 mountain customers through clean, renewable sources in May, though the Glenwood Springs-based co-op’s leadership says further progress is threatened by U.S. policy changes and global economics.

The co-op, which serves customers in Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield, Mesa and Gunnison counties, also hit 92% renewables in June, and expects to deliver about 85% clean energy throughout 2025, officials said. Holy Cross’ peak energy demands are the opposite of many utilities, topping out in winter, when the co-op still must supplement its growing clean energy sources with backup from Xcel Energy’s mixed portfolio.

In 2018, renewable energy supplied about 39% of the Holy Cross electricity distribution.

“We feel proud of what we’ve accomplished so far. We’re doing really well on our long term plans,” Holy Cross vice president of finance Sam Whelan said. “We also have been very successful in terms of keeping our costs low.” The utility remains in the lowest third of electricity rates across Colorado, Whelan said.

The co-op has plans to build out its renewable portfolio in coming years, with the goal of 100% clean energy by 2030, but that progress could now be a bigger challenge, he added. The budget and policy framework passed by Congress this summer eliminated most development tax credits and electricity production credits that made renewable sources so cheap compared to fossil fuel power. And rapidly-changing tariffs and anti-dumping restrictions make the solar parts supply chain more expensive and too volatile for developers, Whelan said. Third-party developers and financiers often propose generating projects they can then sell or lease to utilities.

Reuters reported recently that solar and wind installations could be 17% and 20% lower than previously forecast over the next decade, at the same time electrical demand is growing from AI data centers and electrification of the economy. The wire service cited sources saying Congressional moves “put at risk $263 billion of wind, solar, and storage facilities and $110 billion of announced manufacturing investment supporting them.”

Holy Cross just closed a request for proposals for a smaller clean energy generation and storage project to further round out its portfolio. Recent projects going online for Holy Cross include ownership of 150MW of a 200MW wind farm near Flagler, and 10MW solar farms with battery storage at Parachute and Rifle. While the next round of renewables may still come in cheaper for the long run than fossil fuel power, the gap has changed, Whelan said.

Projected renewable costs are “certainly higher than what we looked at five years ago, when we issued our last round of requests for proposals,” he said.

Holy Cross is ahead of state-mandated targets for transforming Colorado’s power generation, which historically contributed a large share of climate change-causing greenhouse gases from carbon dioxide. Colorado’s statewide goal for the power sector is an 80% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030, from a 2005 base.

The co-op has won attention from other utilities for innovative education and marketing aimed at smoothing out reliability and usage in its newly-transformed clean energy system. That can include real-time text notices to customers urging them to use more or less power depending on generation and demand levels. On a windy day at Holy Cross’s wind sources, for example, the co-op can offer discounts on electricity if consumers plug in their cars during peak-generation periods and store the energy for later.

“We feel like we’re blessed with some good timing around pricing,” on past projects, Whelan said. “And we hope our experiences and what we’ve learned can help apply to others. And at the same time, we do have a lot of unique circumstances that have helped pave the way for us here.”",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/HolyCrossEnergy_HC_04.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 13:26:46.852319

India's renewable energy sector is experiencing a remarkable resurgence, poised to become a clean energy superpower. Surging wind and solar installations are driven by easing inflation, regulatory deadlines, and ambitious government targets. With substantial clean power capacity already in progress, India is on track to meet its 500 GW non-fossil generation goal by 2030.

Once upon a time, the US was the sole clean energy superpower. Until 2011, it led the world in connecting wind and solar generators to the grid. Then China took over, to a point where its lead now looks unassailable: The People’s Republic added eight times more renewables than the US last year. This year, India is likely to overtake too.

The country connected 22 gigawatts of wind and solar in the first half — a dramatic recovery from a troubling slowdown in 2022 and 2023, and enough at full output to power nearly one-tenth of the grid. Assuming this is maintained through December, that should put India ahead of the 40 GW that the US government expects this year.

It’s also setting the world’s most populous nation on course to hit a target of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s that once seemed implausible: to reach 500 GW of non-fossil generation by 2030. Such a shift will herald the dawn of a new clean energy superpower, and give the world some of its best hopes of averting disastrous climate change.

It’s a remarkable turnaround for a country whose renewable industry looked like a lost cause barely more than a year ago. What happened?

One factor is financing. Easing inflation has allowed the Reserve Bank of India to cut its policy rate by a percentage point since December to the lowest in three years. This reduces the price of renewables, which are particularly exposed to debt costs. Regulatory deadlines have also played a role: A waiver on transmission charges for wind and solar expired at the end of last month, causing developers to rush to complete their builds in time to get the financial benefit.

Live Events

The end of that waiver may cause a wobble for the sector over the next year or so, but the changes will be introduced slowly. Over the balance of the decade there’s now good reason to think the recent pace can be sustained. The rash of projects breaking ground this past year means about 414 GW of clean power is already either operating or under construction, including nuclear and hydroelectric plants. That’s not far off the 500 GW target, and we’ve still got more than five years to go.

Industrialists are counting on it. Solar panel manufacturing has been ramping up to the point where it now runs far in excess of domestic demand, at 91 GW. With lower tariffs into the US than their rivals in China and Southeast Asia, this excess of supply might make local panel makers rare beneficiaries of President Donald Trump’s war on clean energy. That certainly seems to be the assumption of a group of US competitors, who last week sought anti-dumping measures to keep Indian products out of their market.

For many years, India had a skeptical take on the energy transition, arguing since the 1970s that poverty was a more pressing problem than protecting the environment. The difference now is that zero-carbon power is decisively cheaper than the competition. Rising incomes, meanwhile, mean the government needs to also think about the needs of roughly half a billion middle-class citizens, who worry more about where to find a good job in a clean, livable city than the basics of subsistence living.

India is still building coal-fired power plants to make sure those newly-minted urbanites don’t suffer power cuts in the middle of punishing heatwaves, but they’re not necessarily being used. Thanks to milder weather than in recent years and the rising volumes of renewables pushing it off the grid, fossil-fired power generation fell 4% in the first half relative to 2024. That’s the first time it has dropped since the Covid-19 pandemic hit in 2020, and occurred even as electricity generation rose 0.8%. Retirements of old plants mean that fossil-generation capacity has actually declined slightly so far this year.

It’s still possible that emissions from India’s power sector won’t peak until well into the 2030s. Even so, the faster rollout of renewables, combined with declining pollution from China and the rich world, means the global picture is improving faster than you’d realize if you were focused only on the steampunk posturing in Washington.

Renewable power isn’t just cleaner — it’s cheaper, and more suited to the aspirations of the billions in the Global South who want a better, healthier life.

Rich nations like the US can afford the indulgence of a campaign against modern energy, at least until their citizens realize how badly they’re being shortchanged. It’s a fatal myopia, though. For all Trump likes to boast of energy dominance, America is falling behind on the most important energy technologies of the 21st century.

South Korea’s largest company announced Monday that it secured the 22.8 trillion-won chipmaking agreement, which will run through the end of 2033. The plan is for an upcoming plant in Taylor, Texas, to produce Tesla’s next-generation AI6 chip, Tesla chief Elon Musk said on X, confirming a Bloomberg News report.

Samsung’s Seoul-traded shares rose 6.8% to their highest since September, while its suppliers like Soulbrain Co. jumped 16%. A Samsung spokesperson declined to comment, citing confidentiality terms in its contract.

“The strategic importance of this is hard to overstate,” Musk, 54, wrote on X. He described the value of the deal announced by Samsung as “just the bare minimum. Actual output is likely to be several times higher.”

The Tesla chief executive officer and X owner will walk the chip fabrication line himself and has been authorized by Samsung to assist in optimizing production, he said. The AI6 component will form the foundation of Tesla’s driving hardware suite for cars in coming years. Samsung produces the current AI4 system, according to Musk.

The contract win, the first after Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee was cleared of all outstanding legal charges, comes as Samsung has been steadily losing ground in chip manufacturing. The company, which makes its own memory chips and also fabricates semiconductors on behalf of clients, has had difficulty bringing in enough orders to fully use its foundry capacity. It has postponed completion of construction and operational ramp-up of its new Texas fab to 2026.

“Their foundry business has been loss-making and struggling with under-utilization, so this will help a lot,” said Vey-Sern Ling, managing director at Union Bancaire Privee in Singapore. “Tesla’s business may also help them to attract other customers.”

That’s in contrast to leading chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., which still cannot meet all demand. TSMC held a dominant share of 67.6% of the global foundry market in the first quarter this year, according to Taipei-based TrendForce. Samsung’s share slipped to 7.7% from 8.1% in the previous quarter.

Samsung and TSMC are both on pace to deliver the next generation of semiconductor advancement — moving to 2-nanometer fabrication — and the new deal is seen as a signal of confidence for the company’s upcoming fabrication technology.

While the contract may represent a small share of foundry revenue annually, it holds greater value as a catalyst for technological refinement and innovation over the long run, according to Ryu Young-ho, an analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co. It also helps burnish Samsung’s reputation as the strongest TSMC alternative at a time when Intel Corp. is struggling to win over investors skeptical about its long-term strategy and road map.

At Tesla, Musk has said the company’s future will depend on delivering the long-elusive goal of true self-driving technology. Last week, after a disappointing earnings report, he said the automaker will face “a few rough quarters” until it can deliver autonomous vehicles at scale — which he predicted for the second half of 2026 or by the end of the year.

Yet there is still skepticism about that target. Musk’s X posts following the Samsung deal imply that Tesla will adopt two different next-generation chips in short order that are crucial to its automated-driving systems. He wrote that the carmaker will go from currently sourcing AI4 chips from Samsung, to using AI5 chips from TSMC that have just been designed, to then using AI6 chips from Samsung.

The rapid-fire changes risk opening Tesla up to more blowback from car owners who were told in 2016 that all the vehicles the company was making from then on had the hardware necessary to eventually drive autonomously. In early 2023, Musk said on an earnings call that Tesla was going to stop offering retrofits to customers whose cars were equipped with older-generation chips, citing the cost and difficulty of offering upgrades.

Tesla has made some progress in recent months toward competing with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo by starting to offer a driverless taxi service in Austin. But the carmaker has yet to offer rides without any safety staff in its vehicles, and early users posted videos of the robotaxis appearing to violate traffic laws. The suite of features Tesla markets as Full Self-Driving still requires customers to supervise the system at all times.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0db47b0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2Fa7%2F20c62af17aadbcfbf31c57f0c215%2F1x-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:45:22.795262

Enbridge estimates the cost of the facility at US$900m and will retain ownership of the asset.

Under the agreement, Meta will offtake all electricity generated to support the company’s expanding data centre operations in the region.

“We are thrilled to partner with Enbridge to bring new renewable energy to Texas and help support our operations with 100% clean energy,” says Urvi Parekh, Meta’s Head of Global Energy.

The exact duration of the contract has not been disclosed. However, the structure provides long-term revenue certainty for Enbridge while also giving Meta a guaranteed renewable power source in a state that already hosts some of its largest hyperscale campuses.

Enbridge in the data centre space

Enbridge is leveraging its expertise in energy infrastructure to meet growing demands for sustainable power from digital infrastructure clients.

""Clear Fork demonstrates the growing demand for renewable power across North America from blue-chip companies who are involved in technology and data centre operations,” says Matthew Akman, EVP Corporate Strategy & President of Renewable Power at Enbridge.

“Enbridge continues to advance its world-class renewables development portfolio using our financial strength, supply chain reach and construction expertise under a low-risk commercial model that delivers strong competitive returns.”

Harnessing its development capabilities and supply chain expertise, Enbridge continues to grow its renewable energy footprint, evidenced by projects like the 130MW solar initiative in Jim Wells County.

This expansion includes ongoing projects such as the Sequoia Solar development near Abilene, projected to generate 815MW, marking one of the nation’s largest photovoltaic installations.

Tech and renewables in Texas

The joint venture between Meta and Enbridge shows Texas's evolution into a central hub for renewable energy in the data centre sector.

The state’s vast land resources, favourable regulatory environment and abundant solar exposure make it a prime location for such projects.

By participating in power purchase agreements, companies like Meta are directly contributing to the growth of renewable infrastructure, thus balancing their energy consumption with the sustainable production of clean power.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/95565fbbdc422db85cdd3ebcea9569cf:18127b575538bf755011241292c8df76/urvi-parekh-head-of-energy-at-meta.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:45:27.257150

But, behind the promise of short-term savings lie risks that energy experts say could hurt our state’s grid and economy in the long-term.

SB 266 would reverse the interim carbon emissions reduction target that was established in House Bill 951, delaying, and potentially diminishing the deployment of wind and solar energy. What many don’t realize is that HB 951 didn’t just catalyze the state’s adoption of more renewable energy; it created a pathway to utilize some of the cheapest and most readily available resources to meet the record energy demand that North Carolina will experience over the next decade. Without that interim goal, experts are projecting an energy capacity shortfall of 12 GW as a direct result of delayed renewable energy deployment.

SB 266 would send a very dangerous signal to investors and developers in North Carolina’s renewable energy sector. Since 2021, the interim carbon emission reduction target has created investment certainty for the best tools available to get electrons on the grid quickly and in an affordable manner. Investment certainty is a key factor here because the industry has already invested $15 billion dollars and created over 10,000 in North Carolina according to the American Clean Power Association. This industry is poised for further growth, but according to a study published by BW Research, removing the interim target is estimated to cause a loss of 50,000 future jobs and billions of dollars in investments in the 2030s.

Those numbers may feel intangible, but a wind farm in rural northeastern North Carolina is responsible for a handful of jobs and approximately $1 million in local county tax revenue every year. As the largest taxpayer in the county, a predictable 30-year tax revenue is a game changer for local governments, schools, infrastructure, and emergency services. SB 266 could stall new wind energy projects and put at risk millions in long-term tax revenue that rural, economically distressed communities rely on to fund schools, emergency services, and local infrastructure.

What does any of this have to do with your electricity bill? Because wind and solar are fuel-free resources, their prices are predictable and steady even when the global fuel markets experience volatile price fluctuations. Without wind and solar on the grid, North Carolina customers would be much more vulnerable to extreme fluctuations that we see in fossil fuel markets, especially during extreme weather or times of increased electricity demand.

Just four years ago a bipartisan law enshrined the need to lower carbon emissions in a least cost manner across the state. This law provides investment certainty to utilities and companies looking to meet our energy needs, prioritize environmental and human health, and keep our state on a path to sustainable economic development.

WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) announced a settlement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) resolving a violation of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and the 2020 Accidental Release Reporting rule. This is the first time EPA has taken an enforcement action and reached a settlement with a company for violations of the 2020 rule.

On June 8, 2023, an accidental release of natural gas from a PG&E pipeline in San Jose, California, caused a serious injury to a PG&E employee. PG&E failed to report the incident to the CSB. Under the settlement, PG&E will pay a civil penalty of $45,273 for failing to report that incident. PG&E has submitted a report to the CSB containing the required information about the incident.

“Americans have a right to know about accidental releases of dangerous substances and their impacts,” said Deputy Assistant Administrator Cecil Rodrigues for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. “This settlement clearly signals that EPA will hold companies accountable for not providing CSB with essential information, which can lead to the potential for loss of life, injury, or property damage.”

“This matter underscores the importance of timely and accurate reporting to the CSB,” said CSB Chairperson Steve Owens. “When companies fail to report serious chemical releases like this, they impede the CSB’s ability to carry out the agency’s core mission to conduct independent investigations of these incidents and help prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.”

The Accidental Release Reporting rule is part of the chemical accident prevention requirements under section 112(r) of the CAA. The rule requires owners and operators of stationary sources to report accidental releases of regulated or other extremely hazardous substances that result in a fatality, serious injury, or substantial property damage to the CSB. The CAA authorizes EPA to enforce the failure to report an accidental release to the CSB.

Failure to report incidents such as these hinder the CSB’s ability to investigate accidental releases, determine probable causes of those releases, and recommend measures to prevent future occurrences. This settlement further reinforces the partnership between the CSB and EPA in promoting chemical safety and preventing accidental releases.

Reuters reports that this is cutting into diesel usage and denting oil demand from the world’s biggest crude oil importer.

EVs aren’t the only factor in the diesel decline—the rise of LNG-powered heavy trucks and recently, slowing economic growth, have also reduced demand for diesel. But surging sales of EVs are causing analysts to revise previous projections. Consulting firm Sublime China Information (SCI) estimates that sales of new energy trucks rose 175% year-over-year in the first half of this year, representing about a quarter of new truck sales. Battery-electric models, mostly used for short-haul runs around ports, mines and factories, accounted for over 90% of that increase.

SCI analyst Xu Lei told Reuters that the firm has cut its forecast for China’s diesel demand by 1%-2%. Diesel consumption this year is now forecast to fall by 6.3%. A similar decrease was seen last year.

“The surge in electric heavy trucks was a surprise and has become a new factor accelerating China’s oil consumption to peak, most likely this year,” Ye Lin, VP of Rystad Energy, told Reuters. Rystad expects China’s transport sector to use 40% less diesel by 2030, cutting overall consumption by about a quarter compared to 2024 levels.

The bull market for electric trucks is partly due to cheap electricity and government subsidies of up to 95,000 yuan ($13,264) for new vehicles. China’s rapid rollout of charging infrastructure along industrial corridors is another factor.

Our electricity grid is a vast balancing act between supply and demand, with a tightly-guarded and centralized structure created in the early 20th century to manage electricity production, transmission and delivery. This system is dominant not through persistent innovation or transparency, but by maintaining legislated monopoly control, with guaranteed revenue from ratepayers, and perpetuating the vision that excess generation capacity must be built in order for utilities to fund capital investments.

We are using electricity in ever more diverse and unpredictable ways, and our utility monopoly model is increasingly expensive and unreliable as it attempts to adapt to the new realities of electricity demand. Instead of another 100 years of our current system, what if the utilities of the 21st century were more like internet service providers? The utility network is the system’s foundation, like the internet — a platform that creates an ecosystem for innovation. Such a reimagining would create significant opportunities, far exceeding any logistical challenges.

To understand what a 21st-century innovation could look like, we need to cover a few basics about our current system. First, the grid is not a battery. It does not store energy and deliver it to your device when you turn it on or plug it in. It is one massive teeter-totter, near-instantaneously balancing supply and demand (think microseconds). Practically, this means when you turn on your toaster, your local power plant responds.

Second, demand fluctuates significantly each day. According to the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s Operations Displays, on June 17, the minimum electricity demand was roughly 68 GW with a peak at roughly 102 GW. This means that in MISO, 34 GWs of power plants turn on and off on a regular summer day.

Beyond these daily fluctuations, heat waves and other events can cause spikes in demand. The average length of load curtailment to accommodate these spikes lasts 1.7 to 2.5 hours, and these events generally account for less than 1% of the total hours in a year.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

Why is this crucial? Because utilities are required to build infrastructure to accommodate this peak demand. Imagine footing the bill of a $2.4 billion gas peaker plant for it to lie dormant more than 8,700 hours each year, waiting for demand to spike. This is not a hypothetical scenario but, rather a well-worn plan that utilities have and will continue to execute unless we reimagine our energy system.

Gas peaker plants are built to provide a resource that can be called on to meet demand, so we can turn on our lights, cool our homes, query our data centers and manufacture our goods. If we recognize that the goal is not just to push more electrons but to actually accomplish these tasks, we can begin to rethink what our system looks like and explore ways of meeting our needs without buying an expensive asset that lies dormant 99% of the year.

One way to do this is to take advantage of existing battery storage that already interacts with the grid. In Michigan, there are roughly 100,000 electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids on the road. Assuming the average battery capacity of these vehicles is 65 kWh, this means that the storage infrastructure owned and available in Michigan is 6.5 GWh.

When vehicles are plugged into the grid using bi-directional chargers, they can both draw power from or deliver power to the grid. With half of Michigan’s vehicles plugged into bi-directional chargers (assuming 12 hours of charging or connection time) and drawing only 50% of each plugged-in vehicle’s capacity, between 575 MW and 1.6 GWh of capacity could be available to the grid today.

This is a massive resource — a virtual power plant (VPP) — greater than the entire battery capacity cleared in the 2025 MISO auction. This is a resource that already exists in Michigan. A resource that does not require investing billions of dollars in infrastructure and a decade before it can operate. A resource that could be used today.

So, instead of spending $2.4 billion on 1 GW of peaker plants that will remain idle 99% of the year, let’s invest in $4,000 bi-directional EV chargers for the existing 100,000 EVs. The maximum capacity of these EV chargers is 1.15 GW, providing 575 MW of capacity at any given time. And, all of this at a cost of $400 million, a sixth of the cost of a utility proposal.

Or, what if we built a power plant out of new electric vehicles? The Chevy Bolt with the federal tax credit costs roughly $20,000 and a bi-directional charger and installation costs roughly $5,000 and is supported by a $1,000 federal tax credit. This means that for the same cost of a 1-GW gas-peaker plant, we could buy roughly 100,000 EVs, providing an additional 6.5 GWh (assuming 65 kWh each) of total capacity.

These vehicles and chargers could be purchased and installed for customers to use at no cost, provided each customer committed to participating in 20 to 80 hours of peak events each year. This VPP could provide the same required capacity on peak days as a power plant and act as an additional grid asset for a variety of grid services as systems develop. Further, this VPP would provide clean, reliable transportation to Michigan residents year-round.

This type of VPP should be one part of the solution to our growing demands. It provides mechanisms to better utilize existing generation capacity without buying expensive stranded assets with high operating costs, ranging from $14/kW-hour to $63/kW-year, or $14 million to $63 million, in fixed costs each year. Similar services can be delivered now, with comparatively minimal investments, by aggregating existing distributed energy resources.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/L60brKw5UQifGZ1hVfP3OE_Dlam5PNjXe70PqQWDOuI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTc2ODE5NDA4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-28 12:44:11.732946

Only the height of the X-Van differs from the Super Van: The motorhome is slightly taller, even with the pop-up roof folded in. However, the roof tent can be retracted and extended electrically.

Both the X-Van, as a camper van, and the large sedan Super Van are based on Farizon’s SuperVAN platform, which was derived from the Geely Multi-Purpose Architecture (GMA). This platform for light commercial vehicles is designed to enable different wheelbases and superstructures, and markets such as Asia, Australia, South America and Europe were mentioned in addition to China when it was first announced.

Whether the X-Van will also be offered in this country is currently still open. However, the technical data is clear: an LFP battery from Gotion High-Tech should ensure a CLTC range of 460 kilometres, while the electric motor delivers 170 kW and offers a maximum torque of 336 Nm. However, as the WLTP range is generally lower than the CLTC in the Chinese standard test and the real-world range is even lower, the Chinese campervan is unlikely to offer long practical ranges for long holiday trips either.

However, the X-Van supports vehicle-to-load, so it can provide energy from the drive battery for other electrical consumers, for example, for cooking with an electric stove, operating a refrigerator or a hot water heater for the shower.

Farizon is offering a special promotion at the launch: anyone who pays 5,000 yuan this year will receive a “time-limited purchase advantage.” This includes a drone, a camping set, a charging station and a ‘Christmas gift package’ with a total value of around 25,000 yuan.

Incredibly, no lives were lost in the Bemidji storm; but, tragically, more than 120 people are dead in the Texas flood.

We would be remiss not to pause and mourn for the loss of life and to consider the trauma of experiencing such violent weather.

Is this kind of weather something we should begin to expect to happen more often?

Minnesota is getting warmer, especially winter nights in the northern parts of the state. Daily average minimum temperatures during winter (December-February) have increased 7.3 degrees from 1895-2021 in northern Minnesota, 6 degrees in central Minnesota and 4.9 degrees in southern Minnesota.

Minnesota lakes have lost an average of 10 to 14 days of ice cover in the past 50 years, affecting lake and fish health, outdoor recreation opportunities, local governments and business owners.

Minnesota is also experiencing more frequent and intense rainstorms than at any other time on record. The number of 1-inch and 3-inch rains and the size of the heaviest annual rainfall have all increased dramatically.

The strongest measured winds in Minnesota in almost 13 years occurred in the recent Bemidji blowdown.

Over the past century, massive increases in carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gas emissions have caused the temperature on our planet to rise.

The science says that warmer air increases evaporation, which means that our atmosphere contains an increasing amount of water vapor for storms to sweep up and turn into rain or snow.

Transportation is the No. 1 source of greenhouse gases in Minnesota — accounting for about a quarter of our state’s emissions. Clean transportation is one goal of Minnesota’s Climate Action Framework, our state’s plan to reduce climate pollution and prepare our communities for the impacts of climate change.

Reaching this goal has been linked to investments in public transit, support for electric vehicle purchases and federal funds for projects like EV charging infrastructure.

And what is being done about it? Disinvestment!

Many positive strides to combat our climate crisis, thanks to the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law by President Joe Biden, have been crippled by Trump’s budget bill, which was fully supported by our 8th District Congressional Rep. Pete Stauber.

On the transportation front alone, the bill killed several electric vehicle-related tax credits and clean energy credits and ends support for EV charging infrastructure.

It also eliminated penalties for noncompliance with Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards that regulate how far a vehicle must travel on a gallon of fuel.

So, where does Pete Stauber stand on these slashes to environmental protections? Smack dab with the Republicans, voting to roll back clean air protections, to block states’ cleaner car and truck standards, to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency’s methane polluter fee, and to eliminate clean energy incentives to cut taxes for billionaires and polluters and to continue subsidies to the worst of all polluters — oil companies.

And this is only part of the story.

Clearly, the many rapid changes to our weather and climate can be attributed, at least in part, to human activity. We can’t change some things, but human activity can adapt and be a force for positive change.

However, when our politicians put money and short-term business interests before our safety and health, they make it harder for that to happen.

Most of the time, power comes back on quickly, indicating that the transformers were not the problem.
And that can be a problem if large numbers of transformers are damaged at once such as occurred in the recent California wildfires.
Unfortunately, America only produces about 20 percent of the equipment it needs for its electrical power and transmission system.
""Aging grid infrastructure, new renewable-energy generation, expanding electrification, increased EV charging stations, and new data centers all contribute to the rising demand for these machines,"" according to the IEEE Spectrum.","Electric transformers aren't something most people think about unless one attached to the power lines serving their home or business is damaged, resulting in a power outage. Most of the time, power comes back on quickly, indicating that the transformers were not the problem. It takes longer to replace a transformer damaged beyond repair.

And that can be a problem if large numbers of transformers are damaged at once such as occurred in the recent California wildfires. That's because the waiting time for new transformers is now 127 weeks.

In case you don't know, transformers are typically used to bring down voltage. Utilities use high voltages to transfer electricity long distances because it's more efficient. The electricity voltage must then be ""stepped down"" to the level that most homes and businesses use.

It turns out American trade policy is complicating matters for the American grid. The Build America, Buy America provisions of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed under the Biden administration require substantial and, in some cases, 100 percent domestic content for goods and services used in a wide range of federally funded infrastructure projects, including maintenance and expansion of the electrical grid. And, few infrastructure projects move forward without at least some federal contribution. Unfortunately, America only produces about 20 percent of the equipment it needs for its electrical power and transmission system.

Even if the United States were not restricting supply of these goods through Build America, Buy America requirements, there would still be long waiting times. In fairness to those who passed the infrastructure bill, the waiting time for a new transformer back then was 50 weeks—not particularly fast, but far better than today's wait of over two years for most transformers and now even four years for specialized transformers.

What's happened is a perfect storm for manufacturers in the form of quickly increasing demand. ""Aging grid infrastructure, new renewable-energy generation, expanding electrification, increased EV charging stations, and new data centers all contribute to the rising demand for these machines,"" according to the IEEE Spectrum. And that demand is coming from all over the world, including fast-growing Asia, a European Green New Deal, and America's huge infrastructure spending that includes large sums for expanding green energy and readying the grid for that expansion.

The world's largest makers of transformers are increasing production, but those increases will take years. In addition, many transformers are customized for a particular installation. Naturally, it tends to take longer to produce these more complicated transformers, and they cannot, by definition, be standardized for mass production.

One more danger lurks in the background. Transformers are vulnerable to electromagnetic pulses, whether produced by a solar storm or by an atomic weapon. The possibility of using an atomic weapon exploded high in the atmosphere to create a powerful electromagnetic pulse has forced militaries across the world to harden their warfare equipment, including aircraft and communication gear, to withstand what would otherwise be a crippling electronic blackout, one that could take aircraft out of the air and bring communications to a halt.

Nothing comparable has been done for civilian infrastructure, which means, even if we humans avoid a nuclear war, an intense solar storm could someday produce similar devastation by shutting down most of the grid. The need in that case will be new transformers. But there simply won't be millions of spare ones sitting around to replace the damaged ones. A world without electricity would quickly become a death trap for most of its inhabitants.

In case you are wondering, the last solar storm capable of such devastation occurred in 1859, before the advent of our modern electrified civilization. Even as we attempt to greatly expand our current grid to meet the presumed needs of artificial intelligence and green energy generation, we should ask ourselves whether taking some additional precautions to shield ourselves from the known catastrophic danger of electromagnetic pulses might be warranted.

The framework trade deal, which ended months of uncertainty for industries and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, calls for strategic purchases, covering oil, gas, and nuclear fuel, during U.S. President Donald Trump's term in office.

NextDecade, Venture Global, and Cheniere Energy jumped between 3.5% and nearly 7%, with the deal bolstering the prospects for American LNG exporters as they expand to meet growing demand for cleaner-burning fuels.

Uranium miner Energy Fuels rose nearly 4%.

The U.S. became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, surpassing Australia and Qatar, as surging global prices fed demand for more exports, due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

“The HON rule was a reasonable step toward controlling the pollution that is making us all sick.
The EPA gave Denka 90 days to bring down its toxic emission levels, compared with two years for facilities in other parts of the country.
In September, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported a chloroprene leak at the Denka plant that forced it to halt operations.
The EPA has identified five census tracts in the LaPlace area as having the highest exposure to chloroprene in the nation — all attributed to the Denka plant.","A recent proclamation from President Donald Trump will allow 25 chemical manufacturers, including 12 with sites in Louisiana, to ignore new federal rules meant to contain harmful emissions.

A week ago, Trump issued what the White House labeled “regulatory relief for certain stationary sources to promote American chemical manufacturing security.” His action applies to regulations the Environmental Protection Agency published in May, called the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants – or the HON rule for short.

“The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations,” Trump said in his proclamation. “Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions.”

The Louisiana facilities now exempt from the HON Rule include:

Shell Chemical, Geismar plant

Dow Chemical Co. Glycol II plant, Plaquemine

Formosa Plastics, Baton Rouge

Union Carbide/Dow Chemical, Hahnville

Westlake Vinyl, Westlake

BASF Corp., Geismar

Rubicon, Geismar

Citgo Petroleum, Lake Charles

TotalEnergies Polystyrene, Carville

Denka Performance Elastomers, LaPlace

Sasol Chemicals, Lake Charles

DuPont Specialty Products, LaPlace

Anne Rolfes, director of the environmental group Louisiana Bucket Brigade, said Trump’s proclamation is based on the false claim that there is already strict government oversight of chemical facilities.

“The HON rule was a reasonable step toward controlling the pollution that is making us all sick. If anything, it didn’t go far enough,” Rolfes said. “Our congressional delegation should be up in arms about the White House rollback, but instead they are doing as they have always done: serving the needs of the chemical industry instead of the health and safety of the people. It continues to be up to us – to ordinary people in Louisiana – to protect ourselves from this industry.”

Many of the facilities on Trump’s HON rule exclusion list have a history of environmental concerns, with Denka Performance Elastomers arguably having the highest profile.

In February 2023, the EPA and U.S. Department of Justice filed a lawsuit against the company, alleging its neoprene operations “present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health and welfare” for the cancer risks its chloroprene emissions pose.

The Biden administration demanded Denka reduce emissions of chloroprene and ethylene oxide, another carcinogen, at its LaPlace plant. The EPA gave Denka 90 days to bring down its toxic emission levels, compared with two years for facilities in other parts of the country.

Gov. Jeff Landry accused the federal agency of trying to shut down the Denka site.

Within weeks of Trump returning to the White House, the Justice Department had the EPA lawsuit dismissed.

In September, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported a chloroprene leak at the Denka plant that forced it to halt operations. The EPA has identified five census tracts in the LaPlace area as having the highest exposure to chloroprene in the nation — all attributed to the Denka plant.

Other incidents at the exempted chemical plants have also made the news.

A July 2023 explosion at Dow Chemical’s glycol plant in Plaquemine produced a fire that burned for nearly two days before being brought under control. The same facility saw a string of emergencies dating back to 2019. The unit involved in the explosion two years ago was involved in four previous unauthorized releases of ethylene glycol, according to state records. The toxic compound is highly flammable and can cause kidney damage from prolonged exposure.

In January 2022, an explosion at the Westlake Chemical complex in Calcasieu Parish injured six people and forced nearby schools to place students under lockdown until a dark cloud of smoke over the Lake Charles area cleared. Federal records show the plant has an extensive history of spills, accidents and injured workers.

Before Trump returned to office, the EPA pursued financial sanctions against facilities that violated its safety and environmental regulations. The agency reached a $1.4 million settlement early last year with Sasol Chemicals for an “alleged accident” in October 2022 that resulted in a fire that burned 8 tons of triethyl aluminum, a catalyst used to make synthetic materials and jet fuel.

Trump’s EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, has argued the agency is authorized – but not mandated – to enforce the Clean Air Act, based on a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Zeldin also wants to walk back the Endangerment Finding, a 2009 EPA declaration that greenhouse gases and certain pollutants pose a public health risk. The finding gave the agency more power to enforce environmental regulations.

US.
But Lighthiser plaintiffs are also bringing “ultra vires” claims, which challenge executive actions that exceed presidential authority by breaking laws set forth by Congress.
“However, the ultra vires kinds of claims are getting a lot of traction.” There have been more than 50 cases that raise ultra vires claims against the second Trump administration, according to a Sabin Center analysis.
The presiding judge in May handed down a preliminary injunction in favor of plaintiffs, blocking the Trump administration from taking any more action on the program’s termination while litigation presses on.
The Environmental Protection Agency has been implementing Trump’s energy orders with gusto, which Lighthiser alleges is causing an unconstitutional upending of EPA’s statutory mandates.","President Donald Trump’s pro-energy agenda is confronting a new challenge from a constitutional youth climate lawsuit that is using a legal theory that has already seen success disrupting the administration in court.

Legal nonprofit Our Children’s Trust recently launched Lighthiser v. Trump, which like many of the group’s other cases centers around the argument that the US government is affirmatively violating kids’ constitutional rights to life by eroding the stability of the climate.

The Justice Department’s motion for dismissal in Montana federal court said the Lighthiser complaint only “recycled” the failed claims of its predecessor, constitutional rights case Juliana v. US.

But Lighthiser plaintiffs are also bringing “ultra vires” claims, which challenge executive actions that exceed presidential authority by breaking laws set forth by Congress. At issue in this case: three of Trump’s executive orders declaring an energy emergency, altering agency science, and promoting coal production.

“I don’t know that the constitutional theories will do any better than they did in Juliana,” said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “However, the ultra vires kinds of claims are getting a lot of traction.”

There have been more than 50 cases that raise ultra vires claims against the second Trump administration, according to a Sabin Center analysis. It found 13 of the 27 cases that met its criteria for study already have preliminary determinations—rulings on whether the party is likely to succeed on the merits—12 of them in favor of plaintiffs.

One such case, Metropolitan Transportation Authority v. Duffy, challenges the Federal Highway Administration’s bid to end congestion pricing in New York City. The presiding judge in May handed down a preliminary injunction in favor of plaintiffs, blocking the Trump administration from taking any more action on the program’s termination while litigation presses on.

A federal judge in northern California also granted a temporary restraining order in federal workforce cuts in Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. Trump, but the Supreme Court ultimately let Trump continue with the mass firings.

Ultra Vires

Some court watchers, though, still see Lighthiser as a long-shot.

Juliana was first rejected in 2020 because the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled plaintiffs couldn’t meet standing requirements. The split panel’s decision found a court couldn’t provide the remedy they sought against the US government—partly because the challenge targeted federal inaction rather than action.

The injury Lighthiser plaintiffs are “claiming ultimately results from the inaction that would result from following the affirmative directive of the executive order,” said Donald Kochan, a law professor at George Mason University. “So both cases actually are going after inaction.”

The slate of ultra vires cases against the Trump administration give courts plenty of opportunities to further probe the limits of how far executive orders can go, according to the Sabin Center.

Trump has issued more than 170 of these directives for federal agencies and employees so far. “Unleashing American Energy” and “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” which are targeted in Lighthiser, were among the first of them.

“The question, I think, will turn on whether the courts want to accept that anything the president says is an emergency is an emergency, or whether there are some boundaries on what the president can declare, and thus, allocate to himself certain powers to take action,” Yale Law School professor Daniel Esty said.

The Environmental Protection Agency has been implementing Trump’s energy orders with gusto, which Lighthiser alleges is causing an unconstitutional upending of EPA’s statutory mandates.

“Pursuant to the EOs, Defendants are methodically acting to ‘unleash’ fossil fuel energy and the GHG pollution that accompanies it by dismantling government policies and restrictions that prevent GHG pollution,” according to the complaint.

Implementation Begins

Agencies including the EPA and the Department of Energy have been faithfully following Trump’s directives since January, most recently with EPA proposing to rescind strong emission limits for power plants. A proposal rescinding the 2009 endangerment finding for greenhouse gases is also expected any day.

The EPA has collected or plans to take public comment submissions on those proposals, but some actions have made big changes without any notice and comment rulemaking procedure at all.

The Trump administration also has been steadily issuing compliance exemptions for heavy industry, based on an obscure and previously unused Clean Air Act provision granting presidential reprieves if “the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.”

Ultra vires claims may be gaining traction in lower courts, but climate law experts including Lewis & Clark Law School professor Lisa Benjamin are discouraged by what she said feels like an unpredictable legal environment.

The ultra vires theory makes Lighthiser “much more attractive” for lower courts to adjudicate and probe further, Benjamin said, but she is worried that US Supreme Court trends of ruling in Trump’s favor from its emergency docket may also dull the chances for the case’s ultimate success.

“It’s just a really difficult time to predict how the Supreme Court is going to interpret the way that agencies are acting, and to this point, at least in shadow docket decisions, they have not restrained the administration from acting strictly in accordance with an executive order,” Benjamin said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/5297f18/2147483647/strip/false/crop/4793x1847+4+0/resize/960x370!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8f%2Fd6%2F5cb99f884ac097044b5a0354cd95%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F1668657386,N,,2025-07-28 13:27:11.289824

The move includes LNG, oil, and nuclear energy and was announced in Brussels earlier today.

Cheniere Energy, NextDecade, and Venture Global were among the biggest pre-market gainers, with some stocks rising as much as 8.8% before the U.S. market opened. Analysts cited expectations of increased long-term offtake agreements and expanded export demand from European buyers.

Cheniere Energy, the largest U.S. LNG exporter, opened more than 6% higher but retraced by mid-morning to near-flat levels. Year-to-date, Cheniere is up over 2%.

NextDecade, which is developing the Rio Grande LNG terminal in Texas, surged nearly 9% pre-market but has since slipped by over 1%. However, the stock is still up nearly 37% year-to-date on project executions, contract signings and global tailwinds.

Venture Global, another major U.S. Gulf Coast supplier, remains modestly positive, holding onto early gains but off intraday highs. Venture Global stock is down over 39% year-to-date.

The EU’s new import target includes a mix of spot and contract-based supply and is designed to replace sanctioned Russian gas volumes while locking in long-term supply diversity. While no individual deals were announced, traders expect follow-on contracts to emerge in coming weeks.

Market reaction has been cautious after the initial surge, with equity analysts pointing to a gap between policy intent and commercial execution. LNG developers with uncommitted capacity are seen as best positioned to benefit if the pledged imports translate into structured offtake deals.

The U.S. currently ships more than 12 billion cubic feet per day of LNG, with roughly one-third historically bound for Europe. Pricing volatility and vessel availability remain variables as traders assess near-term upside.

The preemption provision applying to fuel efficiency standards reads as follows: When an average fuel economy standard is in effect, a State or a political subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards for automobiles covered by an average fuel economy standard under this chapter.
The import of the preemption clause is that Congress preferred to have federal regulation to state regulation.
But the clause, no matter how you read it, clearly shows that Congress preferred state regulation to no regulation at all.
Otherwise, it would simply have preempted all state regulation from the day the statute was passed, rather than conditioning preemption on federal standards.","The answer may depend on what being “in effect” means.

If a tree falls in the forest but no one hears it, does it still make a sound? If a law hasn’t been formally repealed but can be violated with complete impunity, is it still in effect? I’ll leave the first question to philosophers, but the second one could have major legal implications. Here’s why.

For decades, the government has set fuel efficiency standards for new vehicles. But in the big reconciliation bill it recently passed, Congress decided to embrace gas guzzlers and repealed all the penalties for violating the standards applying to light vehicles. What used to be legally meaningful standards are now at most a voluntary program.

This raises the question of whether they’re still in effect. That matters because it determines whether states can adopt their own fuel efficiency standards. The preemption provision applying to fuel efficiency standards reads as follows:

When an average fuel economy standard is in effect, a State or a political subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards for automobiles covered by an average fuel economy standard under this chapter.

There’s a reasonable argument that the the repeal of all penalties means that the CAFE standards are no longer in effect, so neither is the prohibition on state regulation. A similar question came up with Obamacare after Congress repealed the penalty for violating the individual mandate. The Supreme Court thought it was obvious that no one could have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the mandate because it had become meaningless: “The provision is unenforceable. There is no one, and nothing, to enjoin.” The Court was also somewhat incredulous about the idea that people would feel compelled to comply with the mandate after the penalty was zeroed out.

In fact, CAFE standards may not even legally qualify as regulations anymore. The Administrative Procedure Act defines a rule as “an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect.” But the CAFE standards no longer have any effect on anyone, present or future. They’re not rules; they’re just idle talk.

Since we have a textualist Supreme Court, we might also ask about the ordinary meaning of the phrase “in effect.” In some settings, it means “as a practical matter.” It would certainly be accurate to say, “in effect Congress repealed the CAFÉ standards for light vehicles.” More specifically, in application to a law or a rule, the common synonyms for “in effect” seem to be “operative” or “in force.” None of these various meanings seem to apply to a regulation that has been stripped of any legal consequences. As a matter of common sense, such a regulation is as insubstantial as a ghost.

Also note that the whole first clause of the provision — the one requiring a standard to be “in effect” — would be meaningless if this only required that a regulation be on the books. Stripped of the opening “in effect” clause, the preemption provision would read:

“A State or a political subdivision of a State may not adopt or enforce a law or regulation related to fuel economy standards or average fuel economy standards for automobiles covered by an average fuel economy standard under this chapter.”

When it added a separate requirement that a standard be “in effect,” Congress must have meant the opening clause to add something to merely being “covered by” a standard. After all, without the opening “in effect” clause, the rest of the preemption provision would prohibit state regulations if cars were “covered by” a federal standard. Presumably, Congress expected “in effect” to add something beyond that.

The reading that I’m suggesting is also plausible in terms of congressional intent. The import of the preemption clause is that Congress preferred to have federal regulation to state regulation. But the clause, no matter how you read it, clearly shows that Congress preferred state regulation to no regulation at all. Otherwise, it would simply have preempted all state regulation from the day the statute was passed, rather than conditioning preemption on federal standards. Allowing states to step in when federal regulation has been deprived of all possible practical effect is consistent with those congressional priorities.

I’m not arguing that this is the only possible reading of the preemption provision, but I don’t think it can be dismissed out of hand either, not in an era when the Supreme Court views statutory wording as the crux of interpretation. If a similar legal argument favored a policy they liked, the Trump Administration would certainly run with the argument.

Australia’s Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) has announced a record A$3.5 billion ($2.29 billion) investment in renewable energy and grid infrastructure for the 2024–25 financial year—more than double its funding from the prior year.

The milestone reflects a broader A$4.7 billion total commitment by the CEFC last fiscal year, as the government-backed green bank scales up efforts to support the energy transition and address national emissions goals.

The largest component was a A$2.8 billion program to modernize and expand Australia’s national electricity grid. Of that, A$2.1 billion was allocated to constructing a new transmission link along the country’s east coast.

“Australia requires ongoing investment in renewables and long-duration storage, clean energy affordability for consumers and measures to cut emissions,” said CEFC CEO Ian Learmonth.

Australia, a top global per-capita carbon emitter due to its coal-reliant power sector, has pledged to close all coal-fired power stations by 2038 and generate 82% of its electricity from renewables by 2030. However, projections from Wood Mackenzie suggest the country is currently on track to reach just 58% by the end of the decade.

Permanent 100 percent bonus depreciation. This allows businesses to immediately deduct the full cost of qualifying property, such as machinery and equipment, put into use on or after Jan. 19, 2025. This is intended to encourage investment and reduce taxable income in periods of high investment.

Expanded Section 179 expensing. The maximum deduction under Section 179 is increased to $2.5 million, with a phase-out starting at $4 million, for tax years beginning after Dec. 31, 2024. Both amounts are indexed for inflation. This provision allows businesses to immediately expense the full cost of qualifying equipment, software and certain improvements to nonresidential real property, rather than depreciating them over time. Manufacturers investing in automation, logistics systems or facility improvements may benefit from greater flexibility in managing taxable income, especially when coordinating with bonus depreciation to optimize deductions.

Qualified production property incentive. A new 100 percent deduction is available for new nonresidential real property used for manufacturing, production or refining tangible personal property, provided construction began after Jan. 19, 2025, and the property is in service before Jan. 1, 2031. This provision aims to incentivize investment in new production facilities. The deduction applies to new buildings and improvements, but excludes property for offices, lodging, parking, sales, research, software development, or engineering.

Research and development expensing. The OBBBA permanently permits the immediate deduction of eligible domestic R&D costs for tax years starting after Dec. 31, 2024, with potential retroactive deductions for small businesses.

Business interest limitation based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). The act restores a more favorable EBITDA-based calculation for limiting business interest deductions, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2024.

New markets tax credit (NMTC) permanency: The NMTC program is made permanent with an annual allocation of $5 billion. This program supports investment in low-income communities through tax credits, which could benefit manufacturing businesses located in these areas.

Slate announced on Monday that it is taking over the historic plant in the small town of Warsaw that closed in 2023. The new facility is expected to create 2,000 jobs, the company said.

The truck originally had a $20,000 price tag after federal EV incentives – much less than the average new vehicle, which sells for above $45,000. But Donald Trump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ killed the federal EV credit, now likely adding an extra $7,500 to the cost.

The brand is selling its truck on the concept that it “can change into whatever you need it to be – even an SUV.”

“Made in the USA at a price that’s actually affordable (no really, for real), their website boasts.

The baseline truck is small, measuring 15 feet long, which is smaller than a Honda Civic hatchback. The standard truck also only features two seats, for a driver and a single passenger, and will be built with gray panels, cutting costs by forgoing additional paint.

Standard versions of the truck also come with roll-down windows and manually adjustable rearview mirrors, according to Car and Driver. However, customization will allow customers to change countless features of the vehicle.

Slate says more than 100 accessory items will be available when deliveries of the truck begin at the end of 2026. Possible upgrades include power windows, a stereo and a center console.

There’s also an SUV kit, which adds a roof panel to the truck’s bed, a three-across rear bench seat, a roll bar, and airbags in the back of the car. It was not immediately clear how much each possible add-on would cost customers.

The Michigan-based company has raised over $700 million from investors, including Bezos, and received over 100,000 reservations for its cars, which won’t be delivered until late 2026 but can be reserved for $50.

The truck comes at a time where the cost of a new car is out of reach for many Americans – and may only get worse under President Donald Trump’s tariffs.

“There’s a growing appetite, especially among younger drivers, for vehicles that are more honest, more modular and less over-engineered,” said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific. “Slate taps right into that.”

In 2020, Honda donated 90 acres of land to TNC in Ohio to help protect the springs and streams that combine to form the headwaters of Big Darby Creek. Honda has also supported local TNC chapters including Alabama, California, and Indiana.

Over 30 years ago, Honda and TNC collaborated for the first time to preserve the Big Darby Creek watershed in Ohio. Since then, Honda has contributed more than $1 million to protect the headwaters of the Big Darby Creek – one of the Midwest's most biologically diverse aquatic systems and one of the healthiest tributaries to the Scioto River, which provides drinking water for tens of thousands of Ohioans.

How Tax Credits Lower EV Ownership Costs Federal EV tax credits play a crucial role in reducing both the upfront costs and the long-term expenses of owning an electric vehicle (EV).
How to Claim Your Tax Credit You can claim your federal EV tax credit in two ways: at the point of sale or on your tax return.
How Tax Credits Affect EV Resale Value Federal tax credits play a key role in shaping the resale value of electric vehicles (EVs).","Electric vehicle (EV) tax credits can save buyers thousands of dollars and significantly impact resale value. Here’s what you need to know:

Federal Tax Credits: Up to $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs (or 30% of the vehicle price, whichever is lower). These credits reduce federal tax liability but expire on September 30, 2025.

Eligibility: New EVs must meet North American assembly, price caps ($55,000 for cars, $80,000 for SUVs/trucks), and income limits. Used EVs must be at least 2 years old, cost $25,000 or less, and be purchased from licensed dealers.

Point-of-Sale Option: Buyers can transfer credits to dealers for upfront discounts, with over 150,000 transfers saving more than $1 billion by 2025.

Resale Value Impact: EVs depreciate faster than gas cars due to tax credit effects, with an average 52% value loss over 3 years. However, models with longer ranges and better battery health retain more value.

Market Trends: Used EV prices dropped 29.5% year-over-year in May 2024, averaging $28,767, cheaper than gas cars.

Key takeaway: Act before September 30, 2025, to maximize savings from federal credits, and research models with strong resale value to protect your investment.

Used EVs: What Happens After the Tax Credit Ends? | Ep. 92

Federal EV Tax Credits Explained

Federal EV tax credits come in two main types: a credit of up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles (EVs) and up to $4,000 for used EVs. These credits directly reduce the amount of federal tax you owe but won’t result in a refund if the credit exceeds your tax liability. Below, we’ll break down the key requirements and deadlines for both new and used EV credits.

These tax credits are structured to promote domestic manufacturing, with the new vehicle credit split into two parts - each worth $3,750 - based on specific battery and sourcing criteria. By mid-2024, these incentives had already helped 250,000 Americans make the switch to electric vehicles, with 97% of leases and 81% of new EV purchases benefiting from these credits.

New EV Tax Credit Requirements

To qualify for the new EV tax credit, buyers must meet several detailed conditions aimed at supporting North American production. First, the vehicle’s final assembly must take place in North America. Price limits also apply: sedans and passenger cars must cost $55,000 or less, while vans, SUVs, and pickup trucks can go up to $80,000 .

Income eligibility is also restricted:

Filing Status AGI Limit Single/Married Filing Separately $150,000 Head of Household $225,000 Married Filing Jointly $300,000

The credit is split into two equal parts of $3,750. The first half is available if a specific percentage of battery minerals is sourced domestically or from free-trade partners. The second half applies if the battery components meet similar sourcing requirements. Starting January 1, 2025, vehicles will no longer qualify if any critical materials or battery components are sourced from ""foreign entities of concern"", such as China, Iran, North Korea, or Russia. Additionally, the required percentage of domestically sourced critical minerals rose from 50% to 60% in 2024.

Used EV Tax Credit Requirements

The rules for used EV tax credits are simpler but come with their own restrictions. The credit is capped at $4,000 or 30% of the vehicle’s purchase price, whichever is lower. Eligible vehicles must be at least two years old and priced at $25,000 or less. Unlike new EVs, there’s no final assembly requirement for used vehicles.

Income limits for used EV buyers are lower:

Filing Status AGI Limit Single/Married Filing Separately $75,000 Head of Household $112,500 Married Filing Jointly $150,000

Other restrictions include buying only from licensed dealers - private sales don’t qualify. Additionally, the credit can only be claimed once in the vehicle’s lifetime, and buyers cannot claim another used EV credit for three years after using it.

Credit Expiration Dates and Changes

The federal EV tax credits are set to expire soon. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025, officially ends these credits on September 30, 2025. To qualify, buyers must purchase and take delivery of their EV before this date.

To help ease the transition, the OBBBA introduced a new tax deduction allowing up to $10,000 annually in interest on qualifying car loans. However, this benefit is expected to help only about 1% of car shoppers fully.

At the state level, California has stepped in to soften the impact. In 2024, Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans for state tax credits to maintain EV sales momentum and address environmental goals. Even without federal incentives, market forecasts suggest 70–75% of EV purchases will continue.

Alex Knizek, Associate Director of Auto Test Development at Consumer Reports, offers this advice:

""If you've already done your research and found a safe, reliable EV or PHEV that fits your needs and budget, you should make that purchase sooner rather than later. But don't panic-buy a car in a rush just for the sake of getting the tax credit.""

How Tax Credits Lower EV Ownership Costs

Federal EV tax credits play a crucial role in reducing both the upfront costs and the long-term expenses of owning an electric vehicle (EV). The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) explains:

""Vehicle tax credits lower the cost at the point of sale for new and used EVs or make leasing more affordable, expanding choice and accessibility for American consumers"".

These credits help narrow the price gap between EVs and traditional gas-powered cars, making electric options more attainable for a wider range of buyers.

But the benefits don’t stop at the initial purchase. SACE also notes:

""Electric vehicles offer an overall more affordable vehicle option. The lifetime cost of owning a battery electric vehicle is often cheaper than that of an internal combustion vehicle because of lower fuel and maintenance costs, even though the upfront cost is higher"".

By combining immediate tax savings with reduced operating expenses, EV owners can enjoy long-term financial advantages. Here’s how you can claim these savings for yourself.

How to Claim Your Tax Credit

You can claim your federal EV tax credit in two ways: at the point of sale or on your tax return. Opting for the point-of-sale transfer allows the credit to be applied directly to your purchase price, reducing the cost upfront. For this, the dealer must be registered with the IRS and submit the required time-of-sale report through the IRS Energy Credits Online (ECO) system.

To ensure a smooth process, confirm the dealer’s IRS registration, check the vehicle's VIN for eligibility, and visit FuelEconomy.gov to verify the model qualifies. If you choose to claim the credit on your tax return, you’ll need to file Form 8936 in the year you take delivery of the vehicle. Additionally, you must obtain a copy of the accepted time-of-sale report from the dealer, as this document is required to claim the credit. Keep in mind, you’re limited to two clean vehicle credit transfers per tax year.

Tax Credits with Financing and Leasing

For those financing an EV, you can transfer the credit at the time of purchase to lower the vehicle's price immediately or apply it later to reduce your down payment or monthly payments. If you’re leasing, the credit goes to the lessor (the leasing company), but they may pass some of the savings on to you through a reduced lease price. However, this isn’t guaranteed, so it’s worth negotiating with your dealer.

In July 2025, Mullen Automotive became an IRS-qualified manufacturer of commercial EVs, making certain models eligible for up to a $7,500 tax credit. John Schwegman, Mullen’s chief commercial officer, emphasized how these credits impact the total cost of ownership for businesses. This development underscores how tax credit policies continue to evolve, benefiting not just individual buyers but also commercial customers and fleet operators.

Total Ownership Cost Examples

Real-world numbers highlight the financial advantages of EV ownership. According to Kelley Blue Book data from June 2025, the average price of a new EV was $57,734, compared to $48,799 for a gas-powered car - a difference of nearly $9,000. However, applying the maximum $7,500 federal tax credit can shrink this gap to just $1,500.

The savings only grow over time. A 2020 study published in Joule found that a typical EV owner in the U.S. saves about $7,700 in fuel costs over 15 years compared to a gas-powered vehicle. Consumer Reports adds that EVs can save drivers between $1,800 and $2,600 annually on operating and maintenance costs.

Fuel costs are another area where EVs shine. Driving an EV costs about half as much per mile as driving a gasoline car. For example, an EV consuming approximately 0.32 kWh per mile costs around $64.80 per month for 1,200 miles driven - dramatically less than the fuel expenses of a gas vehicle.

While insurance costs for EVs are generally higher - about $442 more annually compared to gas cars - these additional expenses are minor when weighed against the significant savings on fuel and maintenance. As Ingrid Malmgren, Senior Policy Director of Plug In America, puts it:

""Quickly you'll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance"".

With the combination of federal tax credits and lower operating costs, owning an EV is becoming an increasingly smart financial decision.

How Tax Credits Affect EV Resale Value

Federal tax credits play a key role in shaping the resale value of electric vehicles (EVs). They create unique depreciation patterns that influence both immediate market demand and the long-term value of these vehicles.

Benefits and Drawbacks for Resale Value

Tax credits significantly increase the demand for EVs, which can help maintain their resale value in certain cases. But there's a twist that many EV owners might not anticipate. Jesse Lore explains:

""Electric vehicles depreciate by the amount of the tax credit that is available on that EV whether or not the purchaser is eligible for the credit or actually receives the credit.""

In simple terms, if a new EV qualifies for a $7,500 tax credit, the used market prices will reflect a depreciation equal to that credit. This mechanism creates noticeable differences in depreciation rates across various model years.

The numbers highlight the challenge. In 2023, EVs retained just 41% of their resale value, compared to a combined 66% for internal combustion engine vehicles and EVs. Data from ISeeCars.com shows that over a three-year period, electric cars typically lose 52% of their value, compared to 39% for gas-powered sedans or SUVs and 34% for gas-powered trucks.

However, there’s some optimism for the future. Experts predict that by 2027, EVs coming off a standard 36-month lease will retain around 53% of their value. This suggests that as EV technology matures, depreciation rates may stabilize, providing a more consistent resale market.

Model Year Effects on Resale Prices

Tax credit eligibility based on model year creates distinct pricing tiers in the used EV market. To qualify for the used EV tax credit, the vehicle must be at least two model years old. For instance, in 2025, only vehicles from model year 2023 or older will be eligible.

This eligibility rule gives a clear advantage to qualifying vehicles. Between 2024 and 2025, rebate-eligible used EVs sold six times faster than comparable non-eligible models. The used clean vehicle credit provides 30% of the sale price, up to a maximum of $4,000, but only applies to vehicles priced at $25,000 or less.

Gary Pretzfeld from AutoTrust USA highlights the frustration this creates among some buyers:

""The non-qualifying customers from an income perspective get frustrated when they see that a $20K Tesla will cost someone else only $16K -- they don't want to pay $20K when there's a rebate that could apply but doesn't.""

Alex Lawrence from EV Auto adds:

""The death zone for an EV right now is $24K if you don't qualify -- instead you spend $3K more and get something a few models later.""

With federal EV tax credits set to expire on September 30, 2025, a surge in demand is expected in early 2025 as buyers rush to take advantage of the incentives. Once the credits end, used EV prices may fluctuate until 2026, when an influx of lease returns is likely to stabilize the market. These eligibility rules are a major factor in shaping resale prices for individual models.

Resale Value Comparisons by Model

Tax credit eligibility and market positioning create distinct resale patterns for different EV models. Here’s a snapshot of current pricing for popular used EVs:

Make Model Year Average Price Chevrolet Bolt EV 2023 $17,100 Nissan LEAF 2023 $17,900 Hyundai Kona EV 2021 $20,000 Toyota Prius Prime 2017 $20,000 Chevrolet Bolt EUV 2023 $22,500 Volkswagen ID.4 2021 $24,200 Tesla Model 3 2021 $25,800 Nissan Ariya 2023 $27,300 Subaru SOLTERRA 2023 $28,600 Ford Mustang Mach-E 2021 $28,900 Tesla Model Y 2021 $29,900

As of September 2021, nearly half of all used EVs in the U.S. were priced under $25,000, with almost 30% falling below $20,000. Models like the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Nissan LEAF are prime examples of affordable options in the used market.

Teslas generally hold their value better than most luxury cars, though recent price cuts by Tesla have accelerated depreciation. This shows how manufacturer pricing strategies can directly affect resale values, independent of tax credit dynamics.

Alex Knizek from Consumer Reports' Auto Test Center offers insight into the future:

""Even when the tax incentive goes away, used electric vehicles will likely still cost much less than similar gas-powered vehicles. Because EV technology is developing so quickly, depreciation on used EVs is still high.""

While EVs currently face higher depreciation rates, estimates suggest that 70-75% of EV purchases will continue even without tax credits. This indicates that the appeal of EVs goes beyond initial financial incentives, driven by other factors like lower operating costs and environmental benefits.

What Affects EV Resale Value

While tax credits can influence the immediate depreciation of electric vehicles (EVs), there are several other factors that impact how well these cars retain their value over time. Understanding these elements can help you make smarter buying decisions and protect your investment.

EV Depreciation Rates

EVs tend to depreciate faster than traditional gas-powered cars, though the gap is shrinking as the technology advances. On average, new cars lose 20–30% of their value in the first year and about 50% after five years. However, some EV models can drop by over 50% in just three years.

For EVs, the steepest depreciation occurs within the first year, partly due to the immediate impact of tax credits, which lower the vehicle's resale value. After that, the depreciation rate slows and eventually aligns with that of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles over time.

Government incentives play a role in this dynamic. While these incentives reduce the initial cost of new EVs, they don’t typically carry over to the used market, which can suppress resale prices. That said, advancements like longer battery life and greater driving range are helping to stabilize depreciation rates.

Interestingly, EVs with a range of over 200 miles show depreciation trends similar to gas-powered cars over a five-year span. This indicates that as EV technology continues to improve, depreciation rates may become more stable across the board.

Main Factors That Affect Resale Value

Several factors significantly influence how well an EV retains its value. These include demand, condition, and electric range.

Battery condition is one of the most critical aspects. Modern EVs are equipped with lithium-ion batteries, which are known for their durability and efficiency. Most of these batteries retain at least 70% of their original capacity for eight years or around 100,000 miles. To maintain battery health - and, by extension, resale value - it’s best to avoid frequent fast charging and keep the charge level between 20% and 80%.

Brand reputation and model popularity also play key roles. Vehicles from established brands with strong reputations tend to hold their value better than those from newer or less familiar manufacturers. Access to a reliable charging network can further boost a vehicle’s appeal in the used market.

However, the rapid pace of EV innovation presents a challenge. Improvements in battery technology, efficiency, and features can make older models less desirable. Additionally, the prevalence of EV leasing increases the supply of used vehicles, which can put downward pressure on resale values.

If you’re looking to protect your investment, consider these tips:

Keep the vehicle in good condition with regular maintenance and by addressing any cosmetic issues.

Upgrade the battery if possible to improve range.

Stay informed about new technology updates for your EV model.

Opt for models with strong demand, solid range, and a reputable brand.

These steps can help minimize depreciation and ensure your EV performs well in the used market.

Popular EV Model Examples

Established brands tend to perform better in the resale market. Tesla, for instance, has set a high standard with models like the Model S and Model 3, both of which retain their value well due to their advanced technology and strong brand reputation.

The Nissan LEAF is another interesting example. While earlier models struggled with range limitations and battery degradation, newer versions with improved batteries have shown better performance in the used market.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) like the Toyota Prius Prime also hold their value well. Their extended electric range and the flexibility of switching between electric and gas power make them particularly appealing to buyers.

Range remains a deciding factor for all EVs. As one expert from Holman Ford Maple Shade explains:

""Electric vehicle range is one of the main factors that help determine an EV's resale value.""

When evaluating specific models, it’s important to consider factors such as range, battery health, brand reputation, access to charging infrastructure, and available technology upgrades. These elements can make a big difference in how well your EV retains its value over time.

Getting the Best Resale Value Through Dealerships

When it comes to buying or selling an electric vehicle (EV), licensed dealerships are your best bet for maximizing resale value. These dealerships bring a level of expertise and service that private sellers simply can’t match. From understanding complicated EV tax credits to providing accurate vehicle valuations, dealerships streamline the entire process while offering added benefits.

Why Buy Used EVs from Licensed Dealers

Purchasing a used EV from a licensed dealer isn’t just a smart move - it’s often a necessary one if you want to claim the federal used clean vehicle tax credit. This credit covers up to 30% of the sale price (with a maximum of $4,000) for vehicles priced at $25,000 or less, but only if the purchase is made through a licensed dealer.

Licensed dealers ensure you’re getting a reliable vehicle, thanks to thorough inspections that help maintain the car’s value over time. These businesses also provide legal protection, as they’re required to follow state regulations, offering you peace of mind and a clear course of action if any issues arise.

Dealerships also handle critical paperwork, which can boost your EV’s value as an investment. Many state programs, like Massachusetts’ MOR-EV Used program, require purchases from licensed dealers to qualify for rebates. Some dealerships even offer point-of-sale rebates, making the process smoother and more convenient.

Premium Autos Inc EV Services

Premium Autos Inc takes these dealership benefits a step further with services designed specifically for EV buyers and sellers. Operating out of Norco and El Monte, California, they’ve built a strong reputation, serving over 10,000 customers and earning a 4.5-star Google rating. Their focus?

With more than 400 vehicles available and an intuitive online browsing system, Premium Autos Inc makes comparing options simple. Their secure credit application process ensures a hassle-free experience for all parties involved.

How Federal Policies Shape Dealer Inventory

Federal regulations play a huge role in determining which EVs dealerships stock and how they price them. For example, dealers are required to report vehicle qualifications to both buyers and the IRS, ensuring they stay informed about which models are eligible for tax credits.

This reporting requirement naturally pushes dealerships to prioritize vehicles that meet federal criteria, such as those priced at $25,000 or less to qualify for the used clean vehicle tax credit. Battery replacement costs, which can range from $10,000 to $20,000, also influence how dealers evaluate and price their inventory. To address this, many dealerships use advanced diagnostic tools to assess battery health and provide buyers with detailed reports.

Federal policies also encourage dealerships to offer additional services, like battery upgrades and technology updates, which help EVs maintain their value over time. As incentives and regulations evolve, dealerships like Premium Autos Inc - known for their rigorous inspections and transparent reporting - are well-equipped to adapt. By focusing on vehicles that qualify for current incentives and offering services that enhance long-term value, licensed dealerships play a crucial role in preserving the resale potential of EVs.

Key Points About EV Tax Credits and Resale Value

Grasping how federal tax credits influence the resale value of electric vehicles (EVs) is essential for making informed buying decisions. These credits play a significant role in depreciation trends, presenting both challenges and opportunities in the EV market.

Tax credits impact depreciation rates, often leading to sharper initial value drops compared to traditional vehicles. Surprisingly, this depreciation happens even if buyers don’t claim the available credits. As a result, EVs can lose over 50% of their value within the first three years. For used car buyers, though, this steep decline can work to their advantage, offering lower prices while still allowing them to benefit from potential incentives.

Federal tax credits heavily influence buyer behavior, with 87% of EVs purchased in 2024 being eligible for these incentives, which provided an average savings of $5,124.

The expiration of these credits on September 30, 2025, is expected to shake up the EV market. This shift could lead to pricing fluctuations in the used EV market as buyers and sellers adjust to the changing landscape .

Navigating these changes requires expertise, and this is where licensed dealers, like Premium Autos Inc, come in. They can help verify tax credit eligibility and may even assist in applying available credits during the sale, reducing the upfront cost. Their understanding of current policies and credit requirements can be a valuable resource for maximizing both your initial investment and the vehicle's resale value.

FAQs

How do federal EV tax credits impact the resale value of electric vehicles?

When it comes to the resale value of electric vehicles (EVs), federal tax credits can have a noticeable impact. In the short term, these credits often drive up demand for new EVs, which can help support the resale market for used models. But there's a flip side - when these credits expire or are scaled back, some EVs may see their depreciation rates climb, with certain models losing a large chunk of their value within just a few years.

Beyond tax credits, other factors like how long the battery lasts, the reputation of the brand, and overall market trends play a big part in shaping resale values. If you're in the market for an EV, it's a good idea to dig into the details of specific models and think about how tax credits could impact both the upfront cost and the vehicle's worth down the line.

How can I boost my electric vehicle's resale value with upcoming tax credit changes?

To get the best resale value for your electric vehicle, especially with the evolving federal tax credit policies, there are a few smart strategies to keep in mind. Start with regular maintenance - stick to the recommended service schedule and take care of repairs as soon as they come up. Buyers appreciate a well-maintained car, and it shows that the vehicle has been cared for.

Another tip? Keep your EV's software updated. Many electric vehicles offer software updates that improve performance or add new features, and potential buyers often look for cars equipped with the latest tech.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress presented a first draft of an ambitious Environmental and Ecology Code, which is now open for public consultation.

Circular economy, waste traceability, extended producer responsibility, mandatory ESG clauses, civil, administrative, and criminal sanctions – everything is included.

The Code, expected to come into force in 2026, pending final approval, aims to unify all of China's environmental legislation into a single, structured legal framework.

Environmental protection obligations in China are not new. Companies already face extensive regulations, which in past years led to an industrial upgrade and even the shutdown of some operations to clean up major urban areas.

This article breaks down the main impacts of the Code for companies operating in China or sourcing from Chinese supply chains.

A 1,188-Article Code with National – and beyond – Reach

The draft is not just a simplification of the legal framework: it imposes a strict regime on all companies active in the Chinese market, including those operating through subcontractors (OEM / ODM) or local service providers. There are no exemptions based on company size or sector, reflecting a clear intent: to hold all economic actors, domestic and foreign, accountable.

Prevention, Traceability, Responsibility

The new obligations focus on three major areas:

Emission reduction and clean production: Companies will be required to cut pollutant emissions across their entire value chain and implement rigorous monitoring of consumption and waste.

Circular economy: The text promotes reduced use of virgin raw materials, the integration of eco-design, and sets strict collection and recycling obligations for key sectors such as electronics, automotive, and construction.

Extended producer responsibility (EPR): Producers will be legally required to ensure or fund the end-of-life management of products sold in China, even when handled by third parties.

Sanctions Matching the Ambition

The Code introduces strong deterrents: fines of up to 5 times the damages caused and up to 30% of the cost of damage caused to water or marine ecosystems, daily penalties, and criminal liability for executives – including prison sentences. The Public Prosecutor's Office will also be able to initiate legal actions in the absence of local authority enforcement. These are tools already present in existing laws but now reinforced.

A Tangible Impact for Foreign and Chinese Companies

Sustainability becomes a market access criterion, a contractual requirement, and a competitiveness factor. This draft law necessitates a rethinking of contract practices, especially with suppliers and subcontractors. Environmental compliance clauses, pre-contract audits, and traceability mechanisms must be integrated into business relationships. Management and relevant staff must also be sensitized to these new realities.

Get Ready Now

Starting in the second half of 2025, it will be essential to:

Conduct awareness-raising initiatives,

Identify high-risk suppliers,

Review commercial contracts,

Audit environmental service providers,

Align ESG practices with the upcoming Chinese framework.

Our Support

Our firm is already assisting French and international stakeholders as follows:

Upgrades to the facility not only allow for improved production capabilities but also create a new avenue for soybean oil through co-processing technology.

The processing upgrades were celebrated at a ribbon cutting ceremony in July, where the CountryMark team and top Indiana ag leaders gathered to highlight the wins this will have for Indiana farmers.

Background on renewable fuel

“Renewable fuel” seems to be a catch-all phrase — at least, that is what I’ve noticed during my travels and conversations. But the truth is that these updated processing pathways create new market opportunities for farmers while supporting sustainability goals. In the case of this CountryMark expansion, new technology will allow for production of renewable diesel fuel.

Soybean oil is combined with conventional diesel to make co-processed renewable diesel fuel. Differing from biodiesel, this fuel offers more desirable characteristics, according to CountryMark President and CEO Matt Smorch.

“It is important to understand that renewable diesel differs from biodiesel in several ways,” Smorch says. “Renewable diesel meets ASTM D975 diesel specifications, is stable in long-term storage and has a low cloud point, while biodiesel does not have those characteristics.”

This expansion could mark a turning point in the renewable fuels industry, which may prove benefits to Indiana farmers. Using renewable feedstocks, the renewable diesel fuel produced at this facility alone will drive demand for up to 20 million gallons of soybean oil each year.

“This is a multi-win for farmers,” says Don Lamb, director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture. “The farmers will benefit from the sale of the product from the farmer-owned cooperative, and they will have another purchaser in CountryMark.”

Next steps

While this expansion is a huge stride in the renewables space, there is still work to be done. It will take more refinery expansions and upgrades to match the growing output from Indiana and U.S. farmers, but this new market opportunity is a step in the right direction.

Looking ahead, another area that will need to stay top of mind is sustainable aviation fuel. And it will be important to keep these opportunities close to home.

“One area we could grow in would be within sustainable aviation fuel and encouraging the development of that technology,” Lamb adds. “We need to look for the companies who are already in Indiana and making these types of products and encourage them to create new products to increase demand for farmers and ROI for their business.”

Not only is this expansion a good move for farmers, but it also will offer a new avenue to match the need for sustainable solutions. Rather than putting that burden on the next generation, CountryMark is taking the initiative now to bring these solutions to Indiana, where both local farmers and consumers can reap the benefits.

The rescission of California’s federal air quality regulation waivers sets up what is expected to be a prolonged court battle.
“I can tell you, all the people I spoke to were all wondering, ‘What is the state of California going to do?","Congressional Republicans and President Trump have killed the U.S. electric vehicle rebate program, with most payments ending after September — to the dismay of climate-conscious car buyers. Now California regulators are evaluating an economically elegant but politically unproven idea to replace it: “feebates.”

The policy is a hybrid — part fee, part consumer rebate. Tacking an extra charge on the sale of gas-powered cars or trucks could raise the billions of dollars needed to subsidize the rapid adoption of zero-emission transportation, encouraging many buyers to make the switch.

A handful of other countries already use variations of the concept, with most fines and rewards based on the amount of carbon dioxide produced at the tailpipe. This could, for instance, redistribute hundreds to a few thousand dollars from the purchasers of inefficient luxury SUVs to those choosing from the nearly 150 electric models now sold in the state.

Daniel Sperling, founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis, and until two years ago a member of the California Air Resources Board, has studied the economics of feebates for two decades. He said they can be an equitable way to promote sustainable consumer choices, while avoiding the perennial threat of state budget cuts and federal climate policy reversals.

“The time was ripe years and years ago, but I think now it’s absolutely essential,” Sperling said. “There’s no other policy mechanism we have access to in California that’s nearly as potent and effective, and just plain good policy, as the feebate concept.”

Last month Gov. Gavin Newsom instructed state agencies to deliver by Aug. 11 a list of options for boosting EV adoption.

The Air Resources Board is leading the review, exploring a wide range of regulatory tools and inventorying possible sources of rebate money. The state could tap the state’s general fund, its already oversubscribed carbon-trading auction account, fees on fuel producers or another revenue stream. The board is hosting a series of public “dialogue sessions” to gather ideas and hear concerns, with the third scheduled for July 31 in Long Beach.

Many environmental advocates say that to move millions of drivers away from fossil fuels quickly, market-based solutions should be up for consideration, and Sperling said he expected some types of feebate to be on the list of options presented to the governor and Legislature. Agency officials continue to meet with proponents to determine the economic and political feasibility of feebates.

Despite the simplicity, however, this type of funding mechanism will surely face objections from the petrochemical and auto industries, which have a vested interest in selling more internal combustion engines. And it could upset drivers not yet convinced electric cars are practical.

Another obstacle: California law requires a two-thirds vote in each house of the Legislature to pass new taxes and many fees, meaning organized opponents could easily sink such a plan. And skeptics question whether incentives are still needed now that EVs account for nearly one-quarter of new cars sold in California, more than anywhere in the nation.

But conversion to zero-emission models has been much slower for heavy-duty vehicles and tractor-trailers, which spew diesel pollution particularly harmful to neighbors of highways and commercial zones. So, for 2025, proponents are targeting feebates in the trucking industry, where even modest electrification could yield substantial gains, and the politics of commercial users might be easier to navigate.

‘State of panic’

Since 2022, California has worked to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, in part by phasing out gasoline vehicles and banning their sale by 2035. But Trump and congressional allies have repeatedly erected roadblocks. In a June 12 executive order, Trump claimed the right to revoke waivers under which California could enforce its own air quality standards for vehicles.

That same day, Newsom sued to reassert California’s legal authority and issued his own executive order giving state agencies 60 days to propose fresh ideas that are immune to federal meddling.

The sweeping budget bill Trump signed on July 4 gutted many of former President Joe Biden’s signature environmental achievements, including electric car rebates of up to $7,500. With the state’s main rebate program having expired in late 2023, and without a clear way to pay for the millions of new credits needed to move the market, policymakers in Sacramento are casting their net broadly for innovative approaches.

Chris Grundler, deputy executive officer of the Air Resources Board, said recent federal actions had severely undermined the state’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, noxious fumes and smog plaguing many cities.

“I’m hopeful that these foolish, illegal and unconstitutional acts by the Congress and the president will be a galvanizing moment for all of California,” Grundler said. “Just appreciate this irony. The Environmental Protection Agency expects us to meet these health-based ambient air quality standards that they set. And at the same time, they’re taking away our most important tools to do so.” He added, “Our air districts are in a state of panic about how they’re going to do this.”

Grundler met two weeks ago with Sperling to discuss feebate concepts, with a focus on economic effectiveness. Grundler said he had not yet seen solid research on the market demand such incentive structures would stimulate. Sperling acknowledged that because feebates are relatively untested, and EVs have only recently gone mass market, it is hard to estimate how price influences the average car buyer’s decision to stick with gas or jump to a new technology. Other questions linger, Grundler said: “Are your ideas fast? And are they easy to explain to elected representatives?”

At a workshop in Sacramento last Wednesday, officers from an array of state agencies heard public comment on zero-emission policy pathways. Josh Miller, a program director at the International Council on Clean Transportation, echoed the call for feebates. “This is a unique opportunity to implement a really robust, innovative fiscal incentive that incorporates polluter-pays principles,” he said.

Rocky Fernandez, senior policy director for the San Diego-based Center for Sustainable Energy, told officials his research indicated that regardless of funding source, huge incentives would be needed to move markets — perhaps $15,000 per car just to get EVs up to 75% of new car sales, and $30,000 to reach 95%. “Sounds like a lot of money,” he said, but with the cap-and-trade program under re-evaluation, “the sky’s the limit for us, and we encourage you to do that as the No. 1 action.”

Liane Randolph, chair of the Air Resources Board, responded with a smile: “I appreciate your optimism.”

The affordability puzzle

Some economists say well-funded feebates could nudge most buyers toward zero-emission vehicles within a decade by making them competitive with or even cheaper than gas-powered ones. They are already moving in that direction: Technology is rapidly improving, battery prices continue to fall and the number of models on showroom floors has grown to 147, according to the Air Resources Board’s last count in May.

Because electricity costs much less per mile than gas, EVs are cheaper to own over their lifetimes. But the up-front sticker price can be a barrier, especially for low-income shoppers. The lagging roll-out of public charging stations makes life harder for apartment dwellers lacking off-street parking.

While EVs in California reached 23% of new vehicles this year, the adoption rate is too low to reach the 100% target within 10 years, Sperling said.

In a series of policy papers, Sperling and colleagues have argued that feebates can be revenue neutral, self-sustaining and legally resilient. One early version of their model for California would charge buyers of “gas guzzlers” — the car models that ranked in the top 15% by carbon emissions — up to $2,500. It would use those funds to reward buyers of the 15% of models with the lowest emissions, including EVs and potentially hybrids. Trucks also would fall under the feebate scheme, but evaluated more leniently because they are harder to make fuel efficient.

He said the program overall would not burden the working class. Low-income drivers tend to buy used cars, which would be exempt, while it is mostly the wealthy who buy the least efficient new gas-powered cars and SUVs, which would come with the highest surcharge.

Sperling said he now thinks the scheme could be further simplified by, for instance, placing a fee on all gasoline cars and rewarding just EVs, a change that would avoid complicated public messaging about fuel-efficiency calculations.

His group also extended the concept beyond California, saying adopting feebates nationwide could help reach the Biden administration’s goal of 50% EV market share by 2030. But even before this month’s repeal, federal tax credits were projected to cover only a small fraction of the vehicles needed. In contrast, UC Davis researchers found that a well-designed national feebate system could raise $60 billion to $135 billion over the next decade — enough to sustain mass EV adoption without new taxpayer spending.

Now, with opponents of climate regulation controlling the White House and Capitol Hill, no one expects federal rebates to resume before 2029. So the focus has shifted to California, and the 17 other states and Washington, D.C., that have followed its lead on some or all clean-car policies. Such a patchwork approach to rebates could send a market signal to carmakers to ramp up EV production.

Cleaning up freight

The UC Davis institute’s policy director, Roland Hwang, said his team briefed California legislative staff in February on a proposal to pilot feebates for trucks.

The state has a few incentive and loan programs to help businesses, including small firms that operate delivery trucks and large fleets of long-haul semis carrying produce or packages. But even after various credits for battery-electric or hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, the up-front purchase price for diesel versions remains tens of thousands of dollars lower.

According to a slide presentation shared with the San Francisco Public Press, the proposed $337 million-per-year program — funded either by taxing sales of new trucks or by imposing annual fees on existing ones — would last from 2026 to 2035 and cover 80% of the additional cost to buy electric. In the long run, trucking firms would recoup the difference in cost by swapping diesel fuel for cheaper electrons.

“The fleet market is so hyper-rational on the total cost of ownership, that’s how they look at things,” Hwang said. “How much does it cost? If it’s cheaper to own and operate an electric vehicle, they’ll buy that.”

Hwang said the goal is to give electric trucks a competitive advantage. “The value proposition of the zero-emission truck is just going to be a better product, which will save fleets money. Save consumers money as well, because we’ll be reducing the cost of goods movement.”

Another possible leverage point under California air quality law is the so-called indirect source rule, which allows regional air districts to require owners or operators of industrial facilities to reduce pollution from truck traffic and other emissions sources they attract. These include warehouses, seaports, airports and other public and private complexes. Electrification is one of the fastest approaches. The federal government generally does not preempt this authority.

“Our heavy-duty trucks have been almost entirely running on diesel and, in fact, are the single biggest source of toxic air pollution in California,” said Bill Magavern, policy director for the Sacramento-based Coalition for Clean Air.

Last Monday in Fresno, agency officials heard from farmers, truckers, commercial bus operators and public health advocates. They pointed to problems that must be solved before heavy-duty vehicles could go mostly electric.

Farmers said they worried that the extra cost of electric trucks would get passed on to food consumers. Truckers warned that out-of-state companies driving cheaper diesel rigs could undercut their business. Some business owners said the technology was not advanced enough for certain applications, like long-distance buses, where battery range may cover less than a quarter of the daily route.

In rural areas, it can take half an hour or more for residents to reach an electric charging station, said Wonuola Olagunju, a community organizer with the Central California Asthma Collaborative. While her constituents are interested in EVs, they will not buy them if they add expense and hassle.

“For a lot of Americans,” she said, “they’re going to be counting on every single dollar that they have to make it, whether it’s food, groceries, basic necessities. Literally at this point, I feel like a lot of people, if they lose their transportation, that’s basically it for them.”

States’ repeated attempts

A handful of countries have used feebates for years to persuade drivers of passenger cars to opt for more fuel-efficient models. France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom have had policies to reduce the carbon intensity of tailpipe emissions, with varying results. While none focuses on electric drivetrains in particular, EV sales spiked after the policies were introduced.

While many U.S. states offer modest EV rebates, feebate-like proposals have repeatedly died in committee or on the floors of legislatures in Maryland, Connecticut, Vermont, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, North Carolina and Washington, D.C.

In California, a feebate proposal fizzled before serious consideration, out of concern that it would be challenged in court by opponents on the grounds that it was a tax requiring a two-thirds vote.

In 2021 Kevin McCarty, a member of the Assembly who later became mayor of Sacramento, proposed a zero-emission vehicle rebate funded by a civil penalty on automakers for selling polluting vehicles but payable by consumers as a fee. A coalition including car manufacturers, fuel producers and the California Chamber of Commerce said the law would constrict consumer choice and give an out-of-control bureaucracy “a blank check.”

California’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project, which expired in late 2023 after the federal incentives kicked in, was funded through the state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, generated by cap-and-trade revenue. But as more drivers embraced EVs, demand ballooned, and funds regularly ran out, frustrating car buyers and dealers with long waiting lists.

Two rebate-like programs remain, but they are limited to low-income Californians and frequently run dry between funding cycles. Magavern at the Coalition for Clean Air said future incentives should stay focused on equity. “We don’t need a broad-based rebate anymore for well-off folks,” he said. “For them, it’s already a good deal to buy an EV.”

Some cities have partnered with industry to promote urban EV ownership by installing more high-speed charging facilities. On July 9, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie celebrated the opening of six 350-kilowatt fast chargers, built by EVgo with technical assistance from local agencies, in the Bayview Plaza on Third Street. Lurie said the electric vehicle push was part of the city’s broader effort to reduce its carbon footprint, primarily by upgrading cars and buildings.

Federal interference

California has pledged to make its economy carbon neutral by 2045, by replacing all electricity generation with renewable sources and slashing emissions from transportation, industry and agriculture. Transportation accounts for about half of the state’s greenhouse gases.

But for the last six months, the Trump administration has been shredding long-standing environmental, climate and transportation policies based on debunked claims about climate science. On July 18, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it would eliminate its scientific research division and lay off hundreds of scientists who study chemistry, biology, toxicology and other specialties in support of regulations to protect public health and safety. This development follows the firing of hundreds of scientists working on the National Climate Assessment, the periodic report informing policies to combat global warming. The federal budget bill itself fulfilled Trump’s pledge to systematically defund clean-energy generation, close climate science laboratories and grant tax breaks for the production and use of coal, oil and gas.

As California scrambles to design new EV supports, its regulatory authority remains in limbo. The rescission of California’s federal air quality regulation waivers sets up what is expected to be a prolonged court battle.

David Reichmuth, a clean-transportation researcher at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the fight to expand the EV market is not over. “It’s a well-funded opposition mostly from the oil and gas industry in California,” he said, citing high-profile social media ads that question electric mobility. “They can’t stop the transition away from petroleum, but they certainly can try to delay it as long as possible.”

It’s not just other states looking to California. Grundler — who retired after a 42-year career at the federal EPA, only to rejoin the workforce so he could help the state plan a new strategy in the face of nationwide cuts — said he recently returned from Europe, where his counterparts were eager to hear about new policy concepts emerging from the West Coast.

“I can tell you, all the people I spoke to were all wondering, ‘What is the state of California going to do? We’re counting on your innovation and your ideas,’” he said. “The eyes of the world are on us.”",https://www.sfpublicpress.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lurie-EVgo-opening-1170x704.jpeg,N,,2025-07-28 12:12:29.136549

The Maritime Minister Mike Kane announced the policy during a visit to Clydeport in Glasgow with the investment coming from the sixth round of the Clean Maritime Demonstration Competition (CMDC).

Successful companies will be given a share of funding to support the development of clean maritime fuels and technologies such as ammonia, hydrogen, methanol, solar and electric.

Investment in green fuels aims to supports the decarbonisation of shipping and develop clean energy as well as growing local economies and boosting jobs and skills, the government said.

CMDC has provided more than £136 million funding to-date to 142 organisations, as part of the wider UK SHORE funding – the government’s flagship programme dedicated to decarbonising maritime.

Successful projects include the installation of electric chargepoint networks across ports, including at Aberdeen, the demonstration of an electric crew transfer vessel at Aberdeen Offshore Wind Farm, and the demonstration of a green hydrogen shore power system at the port of Leith.

During his visit to Clydeport, the minister met with workers from the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland, which is looking to help Smart Green Shipping scale up the manufacturing of the FastRig windsail going forward. The FastRig is a high-tech wing sail which can be installed onto vessels, reducing fuel use and emissions by up to 40% per annum. The project received £3.3 million from the third round of the CMDC.

Kane also met Peel Ports and local workers at Clydeport’s King George V Docks, which has delivered £3 million of investment to support the demand for handling huge wind turbine components for the renewable energy sector.

UK SHORE is also delivering £3.85 million to the Clean Maritime Research Hub. Formed from a consortium of 13 universities across the UK, dedicated to conducting scientific research in clean maritime, the funding will enable the hub to continue its research, and support the installation of a liquid hydrogen facility at Durham University.

Maritime Minister Mike Kane said:

“We’ve charted a course to net zero shipping by 2050 and this £30 million will be crucial in supporting the green fuels and technologies of the future, so we can clean up sea travel and trade.

Chris Courtney, CEO, National Manufacturing Institute Scotland, said:

“Clean maritime is a vital part of a wider mission to decarbonise transport. Advanced manufacturing is critical to enable companies to scale up novel solutions that deliver emissions reductions and allow the creation of new jobs in these industries of the future.

“We’ve spent the past 2 years working on the CMDC-funded MariLight projects, led by Glasgow-based Malin Marine Consultants, part of the Malin Group, supported by industry partners, where we demonstrated how advanced manufacturing can cut lead times, lower carbon, and enable localised production in shipbuilding. It’s great to see continued momentum through the programme, and we look forward to supporting Smart Green Shipping’s journey as it scales.”

Diane Gilpin, Smart Green Shipping (SGS), CEO said:

“Over the last 3 years SGS has invested £7.6 million in R&D, 60% of that in Scotland. We’ve drawn upon engineering design skills in adjacent sectors like renewables and oil and gas, and digital expertise created in Scotland’s vibrant tech community. We are also working alongside the National Manufacturing Institute of Scotland to design circular manufacturing solutions to reduce embedded emissions and minimise use of precious materials while creating good green jobs as part of a sustainable just transition.

Jim McSporran, Port Director at Peel Ports Clydeport, said:

“Our recent £3 million investment in road infrastructure at King George V Dock to accommodate growing demand for handling wind turbine components, and our ongoing transformative work at Hunterston PARC in Ayrshire to support the renewables sector, demonstrate our commitment to decarbonising supply chains and enabling the transition to a greener economy.

“It’s fantastic to see government and industry working together to back innovation and today’s visit reinforces how Glasgow’s maritime legacy is helping to drive the UK’s clean energy future.”

Mike Biddle, Executive Director, Net Zero at Innovate UK, said:

“Congratulations to the awarded projects from Round 6 of the Clean Maritime Demonstrator Competition – a great opportunity for UK innovators to take part in a world-renowned maritime transport R&D grant funding programme. Innovate UK looks forward to working with partners to support these projects focused on the ever-more prevalent issue of decarbonisation with emphasis on a range of physical, digital, system and skills-based innovation.”

The project also includes the construction of a 500 kV substation and a single-circuit, 15 km transmission line connecting to Brazil’s National Interconnected System (SIN).

“We are very pleased to see Atlas work with BNDES again, this time financing our Draco Solar Complex,” said Carlos Barrera, CEO of Atlas Renewable Energy. “Together, we have financed the implementation of nearly 2 GW of installed solar capacity across Brazil, not only accelerating the country’s energy transition, but also strengthening local supply chains, generating skilled jobs, and delivering reliable, cost-effective power to key industries, such as Data Centers.”

“This project adds a significant volume of clean, renewable energy to our electricity mix and supports the government’s decarbonization policy,” said BNDES President Aloizio Mercadante. “With Brazil’s solar capacity now at 39 GW, BNDES remains committed to the green agenda across energy production, process decarbonization, and forest restoration.”

Atlas and BNDES share a history of pioneering financial solutions, initially collaborating on dollar‑denominated financing and now demonstrating adaptability with this BRL‑denominated agreement.

The framework trade deal, which ended months of uncertainty for industries and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic, calls for strategic purchases, covering oil, gas, and nuclear fuel, during U.S. President Donald Trump's term in office.

NextDecade, Venture Global and Cheniere Energy jumped between 5% and 7%, with the deal bolstering the prospects for American LNG exporters as they expand to meet growing demand for cleaner-burning fuels.

Uranium miner Energy Fuels rose 4% to $10.42.

The U.S. became the world's biggest LNG supplier in 2023, surpassing Australia and Qatar, as surging global prices fed demand for more exports, due in part to supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

The US Wind Energy Monitor report, released by Wood Mackenzie and the American Clean Power Association (ACP), revealed that in Q1 2025, the US wind sector more than doubled activity on the previous year's quarter.

The report shows that all installations in Q1 came from newbuild onshore activity. Wood Mackenzie projects that a total of 8.1GW of installed capacity will come online this year, including onshore, offshore, and repowering projects.

However, tariffs and policy uncertainty have placed significant challenges on the market, driving a 50% decrease in turbine orders for the first six months of 2025 compared to the same period last year, taking them to their lowest level since 2020.

“The surge in first-quarter wind installations, combined with a strong development pipeline, underscores the wind industry’s resilience and its capacity to rapidly deliver the clean, affordable, and reliable energy America needs,” said John Hensley, ACP’s senior vice president of markets and policy analysis.

“But this momentum is threatened by the changing policy landscape. Regulatory obstructions will drive up costs, putting at risk the nation’s ability to meet its energy demands with homegrown clean power.”

Turbine orders have slowed in 2025, but demand – especially for safe harbour orders – is projected to rebound in the second half following the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s (OBBBA) final passage.

“Market volatility will prompt a short-term decrease in onshore additions,” said Leila Garcia da Fonseca (pictured), director of research at Wood Mackenzie. “A quarter-over-quarter net reduction of roughly 430MW in the US onshore wind outlook from 2025-2029 reflects growing uncertainty for currently under-development projects, mainly driven by ongoing permitting challenges, tariff risk, and now a sunset of tax credits.”

A late-cycle spike is anticipated in 2029-2030 with developers looking to capitalise ahead of the tax credit expiration. Western states, which will add 9.4GW of installations through 2029, will see more activity than other regions, Wood Mackenzie said.

As almost all offshore projects in Wood Mackenzie’s five-year outlook are already under construction, the outlook remains largely unchanged. The analysts are projecting a total of 5.9GW of offshore wind capacity to come online by 2029.

“While we assume projects currently under construction or heading to construction will come online, we don’t expect to see any additional projects take a final investment decision during President Trump’s second term in office,” said Garcia da Fonseca. “This could have a significant impact on the number of offshore projects constructed in the 2030s.”

Despite near-term volatility, Wood Mackenzie forecasts average annual installations of 8.9GW over the next five years across onshore, offshore, and repowering segments.",https://www.renews.biz/media/34740/leila-garcia-da-fonseca-credit-wood-mackenzie.jpg?width=640,N,,2025-07-28 15:00:33.584461

There were 11 rulemakings that contained some kind of measurable economic impact. Most of these items were quite minor in scale, the most consequential of the bunch being a deregulatory Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rule extending various deadlines for previous coal run-off regulations. Across all rulemakings, agencies published $82.1 million in total cost savings but added roughly 1 million paperwork burden hours.

REGULATORY TOPLINES

Proposed Rules: 34

Final Rules: 49

2025 Total Pages: 35,309

2025 Final Rule Costs: -$75.9 billion

2025 Proposed Rule Costs: $174 billion

NOTABLE REGULATORY ACTIONS

The most significant rulemaking of the week was the EPA direct final rule regarding “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals [CCR] From Electric Utilities; CCR Management Unit Deadline Extension Rule.” The rulemaking’s main purpose is to push back a series of compliance deadlines from prior CCR rules by between one to two years. EPA expects that such delays will provide roughly $10.4-million-worth in annualized regulatory relief (the midpoint of the estimated $9.43–$11.3 million per year range), or roughly $147.5 million in net present value.

TRACKING TRUMP 2.0

Last week, the American Action Forum (AAF) reviewed the Trump Administration’s deregulatory record through its first six months back in office. The key finding of that report was that while the top-line reductions of $86 billion in regulatory costs and 52.2 million paperwork hours were substantial, they were largely the function of a single action. As noted above, this past week’s CCR Deadline Extension Rule provides a nominal addition to the current administration’s cost-cutting track record. Of note, this also marked another instance of the administration using the “direct final rule” path – a practice AAF discussed further in the aforementioned six-month review insight – to implement its agenda.

The most significant piece of non-rulemaking news from the White House with regard to regulatory policy was likely the president’s executive order (EO) on “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure.” The EO, as its title quite plainly suggests, directs relevant agencies to take a series of steps to streamline the permitting process during the construction of artificial intelligence data centers as well as any related power generation and transmission infrastructure. The particular steps largely focus on agencies involved granting the covered projects’ relevant determinations that allow them to bypass certain associated permitting hurdles.

Turning to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) front, there were some surprising developments. The expected votes on a series of CRA resolutions that address certain Department of Interior actions ended up stalling out, having been part of the House “rule” that got tied up in the political wrangling over congressional action on the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. These votes will now apparently have to wait until Congress returns from its August recess.

The other intriguing CRA items of the week came in a series of resolutions of disapproval introduced by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-CT). The four such resolutions introduced this past week (adding to one he introduced last month) represent the first real CRA volley focused on rules from the current Trump Administration. Given the underlying political dynamics, one does not expect these – or any other resolutions from Democratic lawmakers – to really see much movement anytime soon. Nevertheless, this set of resolutions does illustrate that the CRA represents a tool for lawmakers of either party to draw legislative attention to administrative actions they disagree with.

Be sure to check the AAF CRA tracker for a full survey of activity under the law during the first part of 2025. As of today, members of the 119th Congress have introduced CRA resolutions of disapproval addressing 54 rulemakings across the Biden and Trump Administrations that collectively involve $138 billion in compliance costs. Of these, 16 have been passed into law, repealing a series of Biden Administration rules that had a combined $3 billion in associated compliance costs – roughly 2 percent of that potential $138 billion total. While the main window of CRA action has largely passed, there are still outstanding resolutions that could move legislatively. AAF will continue to monitor and update such developments as appropriate.

In the first quarter of 2025 alone, 16 clean energy and electric vehicle manufacturing projects worth $8 billion were canceled, according to environmental group E2. In May, that total grew to $15.5 billion and the loss of 12,000 potential jobs.

The Trump administration has stated it wants to pause the disbursement of grants, loans and tax credits for clean energy projects and shift support to fossil fuels and nuclear power. To this end, the president’s recently passed tax law restricts clean energy credits offered by the Inflation Reduction Act.

While this broader shift has resulted in some cancellations, other major manufacturing projects are still moving forward. Amidst the news of new initiatives being canceled, existing projects at further stages are continuing to completion, expansion and launch.

Here are some of the biggest highlights of manufacturing investments that were announced or put on hold so far in 2025.

AESC

The EV battery cell maker has paused the construction of its $1.6 billion plant in South Carolina. The construction began in 2023 but has now been put on hold due to changes in policy and the resulting market uncertainty, according to a company statement.

AESC said it “fully intends to meet our commitments” and specified that the project hasn’t been canceled. However, no timeline or future plans were revealed.

Bosch

Bosch has halted plans to build a $200 million hydrogen fuel cell production facility in South Carolina. Originally slated for completion by 2026, the project aimed to produce fuel cells for Class 8 trucks and was expected to generate over 350 jobs.

The company attributed this suspension to “significant changes” in the industry and said it would “continue to re-evaluate the investment for local fuel cell manufacturing when regional market demand increases.”

Ford and SK On

BlueOval SK Battery, a joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and SK On, is preparing to begin production in 2025. The $11 billion EV battery production project will construct facilities in Kentucky and Tennessee.

The project received a $9.6 billion U.S. Department of Energy loan late last year, in addition to a $500 million grant from the state of Tennessee.

Freyr Battery/T1 Energy

Freyr, now rebranded as T1 Energy, canceled plans to build a $2.5 billion battery cell manufacturing plant in Georgia. The facility was slated to have created 700-plus jobs.

The company has now shifted its focus to solar cell manufacturing after acquiring Trina Solar’s 5-gigawatt solar module manufacturing facility and moving its global headquarters closer to this site.

In addition, T1 has announced a new 5-GW solar cell manufacturing facility that’s expected to begin construction in 2025 and production in the first half of 2026. The project is said to create up to 1,800 jobs with an investment of $850 million.

Hyundai

In March, Hyundai officially opened an electric and hybrid vehicle production facility in Georgia. With a $12.6 billion initial investment and commitment of an additional $21 billion investment from 2025 to 2028, it marks the largest economic investment project in the state’s history.

Hyundai announced that the facility has a production capacity of 500,000 vehicles annually and would create 8,500 jobs by 2031.

Intel

Intel has delayed the construction of its $28 billion Ohio One semiconductor production campus, which consists of two plants. The company received $1.5 billion in CHIPS funding for the project, which is expected to create 10,000 jobs.

The campus was supposed to be ready by the end of 2026, but the timeline has now been pushed back to 2030 and 2031 for the two plants, respectively.

JetZero

The aircraft maker is planning to build a $4.7 billion plant in North Carolina. The company aims to begin construction next year, and the first commercial aircraft is expected to be ready by the end of the decade.

The project is expected to create 14,500 jobs, which is the highest number in the state’s history.

Kore Power

The company is no longer moving forward with a previously announced $1.2 billion battery cell plant in Arizona. The plant was expected to begin production this year, but now the site has been listed for sale and the founder and CEO has stepped down.

The project was expected to have 6 GWh of initial capacity, eventually rising to 12 GWh, and create 3,000 jobs. However, the company claims it never received funds from an $850 million conditional DOE loan.

Texas Instruments

The semiconductor manufacturer has announced a $60 billion investment in seven fabrication plants across Texas and Utah. One of the Texas sites has received $40 billion for four fabs one of which is slated to begin production this year.

Once ready, all the fabs combined are expected to produce hundreds of millions of chips daily for leading companies like Apple, Ford and Nvidia. The overall project is also slated to create 60,000 new jobs.

TSMC

Late last year, TSMC began high-volume semiconductor production at its first Arizona fab. This year, the company finished construction of the second fab and is expected to begin operations by 2028. Work has also begun on the third fab, which is slated to be ready by 2030.

Cross-laminated timber could make it possible,Joey Pitchford,,,,,https://techxplore.com/news/2025-07-high-wood-laminated-timber.html,"A new study finds that adopting cross-laminated timber as a primary construction material could have significant environmental benefits, from carbon storage to global reforestation and increased forest cover.
Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is created by stacking multiple layers of timber and then adhering the layers together.
Sawtimber is used to make traditional wood products like plywood, lumber and wood panels, while pulpwood is used in paper products.
This effect is amplified by lowering demand for traditional construction materials like steel and concrete caused by an increase in CLT demand.
""When we increase usage of CLT, we decrease demand for those traditional construction materials.","A new study finds that adopting cross-laminated timber as a primary construction material could have significant environmental benefits, from carbon storage to global reforestation and increased forest cover.

Cross-laminated timber (CLT) is created by stacking multiple layers of timber and then adhering the layers together. This results in strong, light wooden panels up to 60 feet long, big enough to form an entire wall or other structures. These panels are also fire-resistant. When exposed to fire, the outer layer of a CLT panel turns to char, which seals the rest of the wood away and prevents it from igniting.

Because CLT is such a promising construction material, researchers wanted to determine the effects of adopting it more broadly. To do this, they combined an environmental assessment tool known as a life cycle assessment (LCA), which tracks the environmental effects of a product throughout its life cycle, with the Global Timber Model (GTM), an economic model which examines the effects of land use and policy on the global timber market.

The addition of the LCA set the study apart from prior research, said Kai Lan, lead author and assistant professor in the North Carolina State University College of Natural Resources. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications.

""The LCA tracks the environmental impact of the product from the raw material stage all the way to transportation, manufacturing, use phase and end of life,"" Lan said. ""We decided to combine these two tools because traditional research only examines these products at certain stages of their lifecycle, not the entire process.""

Researchers integrated data from the two tools to predict the economic and environmental impacts of a broad move toward CLT in construction globally. They found that a move to CLT would increase forest cover worldwide, as the production of CLT would necessitate larger and more intensely managed forests to supply raw timber. While a small portion of natural forest would need to be converted, the increase in managed forests and plantation land could lead to an overall increase in forest area of nearly 30 million hectares globally by 2100.

These increases are not uniform, however. Places like the United States and western Europe would see large increases in forestland, but tropical areas near the equator would see reductions specifically in natural forests.

Economically, the GTM showed that increased demand for CLT results in an increase in timber prices, as projected forest cover increases only add around 11% to the global wood supply even in the most aggressive adoption scenario. This leads to a 26.3% increase in sawtimber prices and a 25.9% increase in pulpwood prices by 2100, compared to no CLT adoption. Sawtimber is used to make traditional wood products like plywood, lumber and wood panels, while pulpwood is used in paper products.

Increasing forest cover also carries significant benefits for carbon sequestration, as both the CLT itself and the forests needed to create it store carbon. Depending on how quickly the global market adopts CLT, researchers predict that CLT demand would increase the amount of carbon stored on land by 20.3–25.2 gigatons (carbon dioxide equivalent) by 2100. This effect is amplified by lowering demand for traditional construction materials like steel and concrete caused by an increase in CLT demand.

""When we increase usage of CLT, we decrease demand for those traditional construction materials. When you use less traditional materials, you emit less greenhouse gases while creating those materials,"" Lan said. ""All of these effects combine over the entire lifecycle of the CLT to create the environmental benefits.""",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2018/timber.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 16:05:36.243200

Stakeholders say Energy Star could end up in the hands of either a for-profit company or an NGO.","Energy Star — best known for its bright blue-and-white logo — saves homeowners billions of dollars every year in energy costs. But it includes another key feature widely used by commercial real estate to gauge energy use from buildings, a main source of greenhouse gas emissions in cities.

Property owners and advocates are fretting over its possible demise under the Trump administration.

Over 330,000 buildings nationwide, representing nearly 25% of commercial building space, use Portfolio Manager — a software tool within the federal government’s Energy Star program. It allows owners to tally energy consumption across properties and spot inefficient buildings in need of upgrades. In the last year, Portfolio Manager helped businesses and organizations avoid $14 billion in energy costs.

“This is a business case for us,” says Duane Desiderio, counsel at The Real Estate Roundtable, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy group for the real estate industry. “It allows us to monetize how much energy we are saving. It translates to dollars.”

The software is currently free, and Energy Star is a joint program of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, administered by the EPA. But now Republicans are considering axing its funding and potentially privatizing it as they seek to decrease government spending.

Heating, cooling and lighting buildings is responsible for 26% of global emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

Portfolio Manager, which has been around since 2000, allows businesses to track, measure and compare energy efficiency across hundreds of thousands of buildings. In addition to helping them make decisions on where to invest in energy-saving upgrades, owners can use it to generate reports and ensure they’re complying with local mandates for energy use disclosure.

A preliminary version of the 2026 federal budget proposal released in May doesn’t call out Energy Star and its portfolio manager software program by name, but it suggests eliminating funding for the EPA’s Office of Atmospheric Protection, which Energy Star falls under.

Lee Zeldin, head of the EPA, in congressional testimony in May suggested his agency or the administration could privatize the program, which costs the government tens of millions of dollars a year.

“I have actually had multiple entities reach out to EPA over the course of the last few weeks because they want to take over Energy Star, which is a program that requires a big staff, a big taxpayer-funded staff, and a whole lot of tax dollars,” he said.

But some lawmakers and stakeholders, including The Real Estate Roundtable, say the administration would need to go through Congress to kill the program. The EPA declined to comment. The Energy Department and Office of Management and Budget did not respond to requests for comment.

Advocates working to save the software say stakeholders value it because it’s free, public and used across the whole industry.

“It’s really important to have a single source of truth that is trusted, third-party, government-backed,” says Alex Dews, CEO of the Institute for Market Transformation, a nonprofit that promotes energy-efficient buildings.

Because it’s objective and “science-based,” “no one has ever perceived it as biased,” says Dana Robbins Schneider, director of energy and sustainability at Empire State Realty Trust.

Building owners also use the tool to help them comply with state and local requirements to report and reduce building energy use. For example, Building Performance Colorado, a state energy efficiency and greenhouse gas reduction program, requires most buildings that are 50,000 square feet or larger to benchmark energy use and comply with building performance standards. Portfolio Manager allows those businesses “to easily track energy use and identify opportunities to improve efficiency and reduce costs,” says Ari Rosenblum, associate director of communications and engagement for the Colorado Energy Office.

Stakeholders say Energy Star could end up in the hands of either a for-profit company or an NGO. Building owners are strongly opposed to privatization because they say it will increase costs on what is now a free tool.

The industry is also concerned about the integrity of the data. It’s possible that multiple businesses would create their own versions of the software, fragmenting the data, experts say. State and local governments would struggle to enforce energy efficiency policies if buildings reported data from different sources, they add.

“You are able to compare yourself to so many other buildings because everybody uses Energy Star,” Robbins Schneider of Empire State Realty Trust says. “If the tool disappeared, it would be catastrophic for the industry.”",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tzr-imagesusersi4YKw4LYfAGoiWArLI9QYG24v1piFq5T3pJF0qzS8rF9LjsWaQ-1x-1.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-07-28 12:13:50.927843

The electric pickup truck will roll off the production line in Warsaw, a small town in the US state of Indiana. More precisely, on the approximately 130,000 square metre site of a former large printing plant, the main features of which opened in 1958 and ceased operations in 2023. This was reported by Business Insider.

“We would like to see what we can do to go into an existing facility that has been shuttered and reindustrialize and revitalize that community,” the US media outlet quotes Slate Managing Director Chris Barman as saying. Slate’s first own production facility is expected to create up to 2,000 new jobs in Warsaw, significantly more than were lost when the factory closed two years ago. At that time, the print shop still employed around 500 people.

It is not uncommon for American electric car manufacturers to take over and repurpose existing production facilities, albeit from old car factories. Rivian’s main plant in Normal, Ohio, for example, was previously a Mitsubishi factory, while Tesla’s first Gigafactory was originally part of the ‘New United Motor Manufacturing’ joint venture between General Motors and Toyota.

The site in Warsaw is home to two factory buildings, each measuring around 56,000 square metres. The US company has not yet announced how much space Slate Auto will need at the site for its production. However, demand for the Slate Truck, which Slate Auto expects to deliver to customers from the end of 2026, is high.

According to the startup, more than 100,000 pre-orders for the first model, which should be able to travel 241 or 386 kilometres, depending on the version, were received within a few weeks of the presentation in spring 2025. However, interested parties only had to pay 50 dollars. Compared to other electric pickup trucks, the Slate Truck is rather slimmed down and impresses above all with its high level of modularity, which also keeps prices low due to the large number of identical parts.

Without extra features, it is expected to cost 27,500 dollars or about 23,600 euros. This would make it the cheapest pickup truck in the USA at the moment. The angular and emphatically restrained retro design is reminiscent of the pickup trucks of the 1980s and early 1990s.",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/04/slate-auto-pickup-rendering-2025-11.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:17:25.767476

Kimberly-Clark is investing $160 million to deploy green hydrogen at two major UK manufacturing sites.

The project will replace natural gas in tissue production, cutting annual emissions by 28,500 tons.

It marks the first large-scale green hydrogen use in the UK consumer goods sector.

The initiative is backed by UK government funding and aligns with national decarbonization goals.

Kimberly-Clark Becomes First in Sector to Embrace Green Hydrogen at Scale

Kimberly-Clark, the company behind Andrex and Kleenex, is rolling out a $160 million investment into green hydrogen across its UK operations—marking a first for the consumer goods sector at this scale.

In partnership with Carlton Power and HYRO (a joint venture between RES and Octopus Energy Generation), the project targets two of the company's largest UK facilities: Northfleet in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria. Combined, the sites produce around one billion toilet rolls and 150 million Kleenex boxes every year, making them central to the company's European manufacturing footprint.

The initiative includes construction of two dedicated hydrogen production facilities—one directly on-site at Northfleet and another adjacent to the Barrow factory. Northfleet will generate 47GWh of green hydrogen annually, while the Barrow plant is expected to supply 100GWh per year. Hydrogen will be used to generate steam for tissue production, replacing natural gas in one of the most energy-intensive stages of the manufacturing process.

Decarbonization Goals Aligned with National Strategy

By 2027, Kimberly-Clark aims to cut natural gas use in its UK factories by half, compared to 2024 levels. The switch is projected to lower carbon emissions by roughly 28,500 tons a year—roughly equivalent to removing 20,000 petrol cars from the road.

The project has secured backing from the UK government through two funding schemes: the Hydrogen Production Business Model and the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund. This support reflects the broader push to scale up hydrogen in British industry, and comes as ten hydrogen projects prepare to go live across sectors from Teesside to Devon.

Dan Howell, Managing Director for the UK & Ireland, said, “Now is the right time for us to tap into hydrogen’s significant potential, improving energy supply and our decarbonisation needs. We are delighted to be the first UK consumer goods manufacturer to really embrace green hydrogen, showing that an energy intensive industry can take the lead and overcome the technical challenge and adopt green hydrogen at scale. This initiative builds on the investments and progress we’ve already made with innovative technologies for our business, our consumers and our customers.”",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250725-085050-a18-Northfleet%20Aerial%20view_1000.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 11:02:39.043703

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""OBBBA"").

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law H.R. 1, commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the ""OBBBA"").

The House Committee on Ways and Means first released the tax-related provisions of the OBBBA on May 12, 2025, and, following certain amendments, the House passed its version of the OBBBA on May 22, 2025 (the ""House-approved Bill"").1 Soon after, on June 16, the Senate Finance Committee released an initial proposal of the OBBBA. An evenly-divided Senate, with Vice President Vance breaking the tie, approved a modified version of the Senate Finance Committee proposal (the ""Senate-approved Bill""). Finally, on July 3, 2025, the House passed the Senate-approved Bill, setting the stage for the president to sign the OBBBA into law on July 4.

As discussed in greater detail below, the OBBBA includes several significant amendments to the energy transition tax credits available under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""),2 most of which were extended or created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the ""IRA"").

More recently, on July 7, 2025, President Trump released an executive order (the ""Executive Order"") requiring the Secretary of the Treasury (the ""Secretary"") to take action, within 45 days of the OBBBA's enactment (i.e., August 18, 2025), to enforce the termination of the CEPC and CEIC (each defined below) for solar and wind projects, including by issuing ""new and revised"" guidance related to the ""begin construction"" (""Begin Construction"") definition for federal income tax purposes. The Begin Construction definition is described in a series of IRS notices going back to 2013 (the ""IRS Notices"").3 The Executive Order contemplates the Secretary ""preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility"" for the CEPC and CEIC and ""restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built"" through its forthcoming guidance. Finally, the Executive Order requires the Secretary, within the same 45 day window, to take necessary action to implement the various foreign entity of concern provisions (the ""FEOC Provisions"") in the OBBBA.

The following are key takeaways from the OBBBA for clean energy projects and investment.

Key Takeaways

Solar and wind developers and investors face an early sunset of the CEPC and CEIC. The OBBBA provides that solar and wind projects must be placed in service for federal income tax purposes (""Placed in Service"") before the end of 2027 in order to claim the clean electricity production credit under Section 45Y (the ""CEPC"") or the clean electricity investment credit under Section 48E (the ""CEIC"").4 However, projects that Begin Construction on or before July 4, 2026 (i.e., 12 months after the OBBBA's enactment) will be exempt from the early sunset. An exempt project that Begins Construction in 2025 or in 2026 (on or before July 4) must be Placed in Service in 2029 or 2030, respectively, to satisfy the 4-year continuity safe harbor under the IRS Notices (or else satisfy the continuity requirement based on a facts-and-circumstances standard).5

The rush to Begin Construction hits an immediate speedbump. Solar (and, to a lesser extent, wind) developers became keenly focused on accelerating Begin Construction planning as soon as the 12- month transition period came into focus in the Senate-approved Bill. However, when the Executive Order was released, that rush came to an abrupt halt for fear that forthcoming guidance would make the Begin Construction definition more stringent and difficult to satisfy. Presumably, as is typically the case with IRS guidance, the forthcoming guidance will apply on a prospective basis, ideally with a transition rule (e.g., applicable 60 days after the guidance is released). Nonetheless, developers' Begin Construction planning is likely to remain on hold until the new guidance is released.

Other generation technologies + energy storage continue to have the benefit of a deferred phase down. Under the OBBBA, the CEPC and CEIC for clean electricity technologies other than solar and wind—including geothermal, hydropower, and nuclear—will be available at full rates for projects and facilities that Begin Construction through the end of 2033.6 Developers and investors continue to have the luxury of time to begin development of these project types, which is particularly advantageous for emerging technologies (e.g., next-gen geothermal and small nuclear reactors) still seeking commercialization. The CEIC for energy storage has the benefit of the same deferred phase down, even in the case of batteries co-located with solar or wind projects, which should permit energy storage to maintain its current momentum. On the other hand, energy storage projects that Begin Construction after 2025 must comply with the Material Assistance limitation, which is expected to create significant headwinds for this asset class.

Congress delivers surgical amendments to the AMPC.

Early termination for wind energy components. While the OBBBA does not impact the advanced manufacturing production credit under Section 45X (the ""AMPC"") for solar and battery components, the OBBBA terminates the AMPC for wind project components produced and sold after 2027. This change will eliminate a key economic uplift for wind project component manufacturers. In addition, as a result of this amendment, U.S. wind developers may encounter a thinner U.S. supply chain, thereby making it difficult to satisfy the Material Assistance limitation for projects otherwise eligible for the CEPC or CEIC.

New phase-down for critical minerals. The OBBBA applies a new phase down for the production of critical minerals beginning in 2030.7 Under the IRA, the AMPC for critical minerals was not subject to a scheduled phase down or termination. This amendment does not appear to align with the current administration's stated desire to boost domestic critical mineral production.

New credit for metallurgical coal. In a clear nod to the fossil fuel industry, the OBBBA creates a new AMPC for metallurgical coal produced and sold through the end of 2029, regardless of whether the coal is produced inside or outside the United States.8

The OBBBA picks winners and losers under Section 45Z.

Two-year extension and liberalized emissions rules. Under the OBBBA, the clean fuel production credit under Section 45Z (the ""CFPC"") is extended until the end of 2029—a two-year extension compared with the IRA. In addition, going forward, Emissions Rates will exclude emissions from indirect land use changes, which should tend to increase taxpayers' CFPC amounts.9

SAF faces a reduction in credit rate. The OBBBA reduces the base credit for sustainable aviation fuel (""SAF"") to $1.00 per gallon (from $1.75) in order to align with the base credit for highway transportation fuel.10 This amendment—which appears to be inconsistent with the substantial capital investment required to produce SAF—will present a significant challenge to the SAF industry.

Uplift for highway transportation fuel from animal manure. The OBBBA eliminates the possibility of negative Emissions Rates, which, on balance, is likely to drive CFPC amounts downwards. However, the OBBBA specifically excludes from this rule transportation fuels derived from animal manure, which, at the discretion of the Secretary, are permitted to have negative Emissions Rates beginning with emissions tables for 2026. This benefit, along with the 2-year extension and no reduction to the $1.00 base credit, will likely provide a boost to highway fuels derived from anaerobic digestion of animal manure.

The OBBBA retains credit transferability—but challenges lie ahead. Optimistically, credit transferability will continue to drive capital investment into U.S. clean energy projects. On the other hand, going forward, corporates with significant federal income tax liability may be wary to purchase tax credits subject to the FEOC Provisions, which will require significant due diligence of relevant projects and facilities, their owners, and their respective supply chains. In addition, tax credit buyers that have significant Chinese (or Iranian, North Korean, or Russian) ownership, and therefore could be classified as Specified Foreign Entities (defined below), may find themselves no longer eligible to acquire tax credits under the FEOC Provisions (discussed below).11

The FEOC Provisions are likely to disrupt the U.S. clean energy industry. The FEOC Provisions restrict access to energy transition tax credits for projects and facilities deemed to be owned, controlled, or to include material inputs from entities with nexus to China (as well as Iran, North Korea, and Russia).12

The FEOC Ownership Limitations.

The CEIC, CEPC, AMPC, and the carbon sequestration credit under Section 45Q (the ""Section 45Q Credit"") are subject to the most restrictive owner-level limitation. Starting in 2026, a taxpayer that is a ""Specified Foreign Entity"" or a ""Foreign-Influenced Entity"" is not eligible to claim these credits.

A ""Specified Foreign Entity"" includes ""Foreign-Controlled Entities."" The term ""Foreign-Controlled Entity"" means any entity, including a U.S. entity, that is more than 50% owned, directly or indirectly, by the Chinese government (or an agency or instrumentality thereof), an entity organized under the laws of China, an entity with its principal place of business in China, or a Chinese citizen or national, with exceptions for certain publicly-traded entities.

A ""Foreign Influenced Entity"" includes any entity, including a U.S. entity, of which (1) a Specified Foreign Entity has the direct authority to appoint an executive-level officer, board member, or equivalent position, (2) a single Specified Foreign Entity owns at least 25%, (3) multiple Specified Foreign Entities own at least 40%, or (4) at least 15% of the debt has been issued to one or more Specified Foreign Entities (determined as of original issuance). As above, this definition provides an exception for certain publicly-traded entities.

The CFPC and the zero-emission nuclear power production credit under Section 45U (the ""NPPC"") are subject to less onerous owner-level limitations. Starting in 2026, taxpayer that is a Specified Foreign Entity cannot claim these credits. The restriction on Foreign-Influenced Entities will not apply until 2028.

The owner-level limitation has a subtle retroactive quality. In the case of the CEPC and CEIC, the owner-level limitations will apply in 2026, regardless even with respect to projects that Began Construction between January 1, 2025 and the enactment of the OBBBA. Accordingly, the owner-level limitation will apply to projects that were under development before (in some cases long before) project stakeholders had notice of the OBBBA or the FEOC Provisions.

The owner-level limitations may be disruptive to private funds that claim energy transition tax credits at the portfolio level and routinely pursue Chinese investment. In this case, funds that seek, or plan to seek, access to tax credits at the portfolio level have less than 6 months to determine whether the presence of their Chinese limited partners will run afoul of the owner-level limitations and, if they do, to determine whether any structural solutions may be available.13 Notably, however, Chinese sovereign investors in U.S. private funds typically own less than 50% of the stock of U.S. corporate ""blocker"" entities to preserve certain exemptions from U.S. withholding tax, including pursuant to Section 892. As a result, such a U.S. blocker vehicle should not be classified as a Specified Foreign Entity and, in this case, the sovereign's investment should not implicate the owner limitations.14

U.S.-based manufacturing operations with Chinese ownership—including operations that were on-shored in response to the Section 45X rollout under the IRA—could find themselves without access to the AMPC depending on their controlling shareholder populations or even the jurisdiction/location of a parent entity.

The Effective Control Limitation.

Starting in 2026, a taxpayer that is deemed to make a payment in the previous taxable year to a Specified Foreign Entity pursuant to an Effective Control contract (including a licensing agreement for the use of intellectual property) is not permitted to claim the CEPC, CEIC, or AMPC with respect to the relevant project or manufacturing production line for the current year.15 The Secretary is obligated to provide guidance regarding the meaning of Effective Control before the end of 2026. Until then, taxpayers can rely on the text of the OBBBA, which provides that ""Effective Control"" means the unrestricted right of a contractual counterparty, for example, to (1) determine the amount or timing of activities related to power production or energy storage or determine who may purchase or use the electrical output of a power project (in the case of the CEPC or CEIC) or (2) determine the timing and quantity of component production at a manufacturing facility or who may purchase or use such components (in the case of the AMPC).16

For CEIC-eligible projects Placed in Service starting in 2028, 100% of the CEIC will be subject to recapture under Section 50 if the project owner makes one or more payments to a Specified Foreign Entity pursuant to an Effective Control contract (as described above) during the 10 years after the project is Placed in Service. This penalty could lead tax equity and CEIC credit buyers to seek increased assurances from project sponsors, especially if tax credit insurance underwriters are not willing to cover Effective Control risk.

Like the owner-level limitation, the Effective Control limitation has subtle retroactive application. The limitation applies to contracts and licensing agreements that were already in place when the OBBBA was enacted (for example, a tolling agreement for an early-stage battery storage project seeking the CEIC that was negotiated in early 2025).

In many cases, owners of credit-eligible projects and facilities may be unable to tell whether they have entered into a contract with a Specified Foreign Entity, particularly in the case of private entities with indirect Chinese ownership. As a result, project owners should review any project-level documents in place for current projects and, going forward, develop diligence and contract guidelines in light of the Effective Control definition in the OBBBA and any forthcoming guidance.

The Material Assistance Limitation.

A project will not be eligible for the CEPC or CEIC if the project is deemed to include Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity. A Prohibited Foreign Entity means a ""Specified Foreign Entity,"" a ""Foreign-Influenced Entity,"" or an entity that is under Effective Control of a Specified Foreign Entity.

This limitation applies to projects that Begin Construction after 2025. A project is deemed to include ""Material Assistance"" from a Prohibited Foreign Entity if the Material Assistance Cost Ratio of the project is less than the applicable Threshold Percentage. The ""Material Assistance Cost Ratio"" of a project equals the percentage of total costs of all manufactured products (and components) incorporated into a particular project produced by non-Prohibited Foreign Entities. The ""Threshold Percentage"" for a project is a flat percentage that increases on an annual basis.17

A similar Material Assistance rule—to be effective in 2026 without a transition rule based on Begin Construction date—applies to the production of eligible components for purposes of the AMPC.

The Secretary is required to issue Material Assistance guidance by the end of 2026, including a safe harbor table to identify the percentage of total direct costs of any manufactured product (for purposes of a CEPC or CEIC-eligible project) and the percentage of total material costs of any eligible components (for purposes of the AMPC), in each case, attributable to a Prohibited Foreign Entity. Until then, for purposes of solar, wind, and battery projects, taxpayers can rely on the cost percentages in IRS Notice 2025-08 plus certifications from a taxpayer's suppliers.

For developers and investors, the Material Assistance limitation is the greatest cause for concern in the OBBBA. It is unclear whether non-Chinese supply chains are sufficiently robust to permit compliance with this limitation, particularly in the case of solar and energy storage projects, nor does it seem likely that multinationals will continue to bring manufacturing onshore in light of current U.S. energy policy and the broader macroeconomic climate. In addition, the statutory text of the OBBBA suggests18 that the Material Assistance Cost Ratio should track costs incurred from Prohibited Foreign Entities throughout the supply chain, which would make the Material Assistance limitation nearly impossible to comply with. It remains to be seen how suppliers of key equipment and components will handle necessary certifications to project owners, particularly in light of new penalties resulting from any misstatements or inaccuracies.19

Limitation on tax credit transfers. Starting in 2026, a taxpayer cannot transfer the CEPC, CEIC, AMPC, Section 45Q Credit, CFPC, or NPPC to any taxpayer that is a Specified Foreign Entity. This limitation is likely to turn Section 6418 due diligence on its head. Going forward, tax credit sellers will likely perform due diligence on tax credit buyers, to be backed by contractual indemnification and perhaps even tax credit insurance.

The rest.

The sun will set earlier on Section 45V. The OBBBA terminates the clean hydrogen production credit under Section 45V for facilities that Begin Construction after 2028 (accelerated from 2033).

Carbon capture for EOR and commercial uses get a boost. The OBBBA increases the Section 45Q Credit rate for carbon captured and used in enhanced oil recovery or for a commercial use to $85 per metric ton ($180 per ton in the case of direct air capture) to align with the credit rate for underground sequestration.

Fuel cells eligible for the CEIC. Qualified fuel cells (including fuel cell power plants with a linear generator) that Begin Construction after 2025 are eligible for a flat 30% CEIC under the OBBBA, but without zero emissions rate requirement (fuel cells typically generate positive greenhouse gas emissions).20

Bonus adders remain unchanged. The OBBBA did not eliminate or reduce the domestic content adder, the energy community adder, or the low-income communities adder. To the contrary, the OBBBA provides a new energy community adder for advanced nuclear facilities located in a metropolitan statistical area which has (or, at any time after 2009, had) 0.17% or greater direct employment related to an advanced nuclear project or advanced nuclear development.

An unceremonious end to electronic vehicle and residential credits. Electronic vehicle credits and homeowner credits are subject to early sunset provisions, with termination dates ranging from September 30, 2025 to June 30, 2026.

Footnotes

1. We discussed the energy transition provisions of the House-approved Bill in a previous client alert.

2. All ""Section"" references contained herein are intended to refer to sections of the Code. The Weil tax team discussed the OBBBA, including the various non-energy provisions of the bill, in a previous client alert and podcast.

3. See, e.g., IRS Notice 2013-29; IRS Notice 2018-59; IRS Notice 2022-61. Generally speaking, a taxpayer will be deemed to Begin Construction of a project by paying or incurring at least 5% of the total costs of the project (under a bright-line rule) or by completing physical work of a significant nature on the project (under a facts-and-circumstances analysis). The OBBBA codifies the Begin Construction standard for purposes of the FEOC Provisions, but not for other purposes of the Code (including, for instance, the early sunset provision applicable to the CEPC and CEIC).

4. The CEPC and CEIC generally are available for clean electricity projects, regardless of the applicable technology, with an anticipated greenhouse gas emissions rate at or below zero.

5. The OBBBA does not curtail or otherwise impact the production tax credit under Section 45 or the investment tax credit under Section 48, both of which are available for eligible projects that Begin Construction before 2025.

6. Under the OBBBA, the CEPC and CEIC will be reduced to 75% and 50% of full credits rates for projects that Begin Construction in 2034 and 2035, respectively, and will terminate thereafter. The IRA would have deferred the beginning of this scheduled phase down until the second year after U.S. greenhouse gas emissions become equal to or less than 25% of the emissions produced in 2022 (expected to occur well after 2034).

7. Under the OBBBA, the AMPC will be reduced to 75%, 50%, and 25% of full credit rates for critical minerals produced in 2031, 2032, and 2033, respectively, followed by full termination.

8. This new AMPC is equal to 2.5% of applicable production costs (compare with 10% for other critical minerals). Metallurgical coal (as opposed to thermal/steaming coal) is used to make coke, which is essential to iron and steel-making.

9. The CFPC is equal to a base credit rate multiplied by an emissions factor. The emissions factor is based on a fuel's carbon intensity rate (the ""Emissions Rate""), which, under the IRA, could be positive or negative. A positive Emissions Rate generally would reduce the amount of the available CFPC while a negative Emissions Rate generally would increase it.

10. The credit rate assumes that the applicable facility is in compliance with applicable prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements under the Code (the ""PWA Requirements"").

11. In any event, tax credit sellers are likely to seek confirmation, perhaps along with supporting information, that tax credit buyers are not Specified Foreign Entities.

12. Although not entirely free from doubt, references to China in the FEOC Provisions should include Hong Kong and Macau.

13. Structuring strategies for existing or future funds must be informed by any considerations related to tax-exempt use property risk under Section 168(h)(6).

14. In addition, if a Chinese sovereign entity owns less than 50% of the stock of a U.S. blocker, the sovereign entity would not be deemed to own any of the underlying assets of the U.S. blocker pursuant to Section 318(a)(2) attribution principles, making it unlikely that the underlying portfolio entities would become classified as Foreign-Influenced Entities as a result of the sovereign's investment.

15. The prohibition on Effective Control would disallow the CEPC or CEIC on a project-by-project basis and the AMPC on a production unit-by-unit basis.

16. Under the OBBBA, any license for the provision of intellectual property that is entered into (or modified) on or after July 4, 2025 is a per se Effective Control contract. It is unclear whether or not this particular provision was intended or whether it represents a drafting error.

17. For a clean electricity project (including solar and wind), the Threshold Percentage would equal 40% of projects that Begin Construction in 2026, 45% in 2027, 50% in 2028, 55% in 2029, and 60% thereafter. For an energy storage project, 55% of projects that Begin Construction in 2026, 60% in 2027, 65% in 2028, 70% in 2029, and 75% thereafter

18. Most notably, the supplier certification with respect to any manufactured product or eligible component must include a statement that the supplier does not know (or have reason to know) there are any Prohibited Foreign Entities in the supply chain.

19. The OBBBA imposes a penalty for substantial misstatements on certifications provided by suppliers if misstatements give rise to a 5% understatement of income tax (with exception for reasonable cause). The penalty equals 10% of the understatement.

20. The 30% CEIC for fuel cells is not subject to reduction on account of a failure to comply with the PWA Requirements, and is not subject to increase on account of bonus adders.

At $2.50 per watt, it was also the lowest six-month median since EnergySage began tracking this data in 2014, when the median price was $3.75/W.
EnergySage’s report attributes part of the price decline to the low costs of equipment, with Wood Mackenzie adding that in 2024, the price of solar panels dropped 30% year-over-year.
It was the state with the lowest price, falling below $2/W for the first time.
Its median price fell 5.2% from the first half of the year, even though it has consistently seen the lowest median quoted price for the past four years.","At the end of April, online comparison-shopping marketplace EnergySage released its semiannual Solar & Storage Marketplace Report. EnergySage vets installers and service providers before allowing them to join the marketplace, where shoppers can analyze and compare quotes for solar and energy efficiency products.

After analyzing quotes from the second half of 2024, the company found that, for the third consecutive six-month period, the median price of installing a solar system had decreased. At $2.50 per watt, it was also the lowest six-month median since EnergySage began tracking this data in 2014, when the median price was $3.75/W. $2.50/W is 33% lower than 2014’s median and 6.4% lower than the median in the first half of 2024. Additionally, the average highest quote per watt dropped below $3.00 per watt (W) for the first time since EnergySage started tracking this information, to $2.89/W. The average lowest quote per watt also hit its lowest level, at $2.41/W.

In the words of Emily Walker, EnergySage director of content and insights, “Heading into 2025, solar and battery prices had never been lower on the EnergySage Marketplace, and for homeowners, that means more affordable and accessible clean energy solutions.”

Looking solely at prices for solar, excluding storage, the median price was $2.65/W in the second half of 2024, compared to $2.80/W in the first half, representing a 5.4% decrease. EnergySage’s report attributes part of the price decline to the low costs of equipment, with Wood Mackenzie adding that in 2024, the price of solar panels dropped 30% year-over-year.

At the same time, solar panels are getting bigger and more energy-efficient. In the second half of 2023, only 1% of quotes featured solar panels with outputs exceeding 450 watts; by the second half of 2024, that percentage had increased to 33%. Walker elaborated, “As panel technologies improve, more homeowners are being offered higher-output systems—meaning fewer panels, more power, and a better return on investment.”

A similar trend can be seen for solar-plus-storage, where the median price was $2.40/W in the second half of 2024, compared to $2.59/W in the first half, representing a 7.3% decrease. This coincides with a trend of a skyrocketing number of solar projects with battery attachments, reaching an all-time high of 45% of national listings on EnergySage’s platform. Consumer interest in battery storage on EnergySage’s platform, meanwhile, rests at 73%, with Hawaii, Tennessee, Alabama, Indiana, and Georgia among the states displaying the most interest.

EnergySage attributed the price drop partially to the high demand for Tesla’s Powerwall 3, as the cost of its integrated hybrid inverter was factored separately into the storage pricing, measured in terms of cost per kilowatt-hour stored. Tesla was the most popular battery company on EnergySage’s marketplace, appearing in 63% of quotes, and was also the second-most popular inverter company. Equipment featuring Tesla inverters was also a constant among the lowest quotes.

Charlie Hadlow, EnergySage president and COO, explained, “Tesla’s emerging dominance in both storage and inverter quotes reflects the market’s appetite for integrated, all-in-one solutions. But as concerns around availability and brand sentiment surface, we’re watching closely to see whether this momentum holds or if consumer backlash will begin to shift installer and homeowner preferences.”

Meanwhile, quotes for battery storage systems also reached $999 per kilowatt-hour, another historic low on EnergySage’s platform.

Some of the most predominant states experiencing declines in solar prices included:

Nevada, which saw its median price drop from $2.18/W in the first half of 2024 to $2.14/W in the second half

Florida, which saw its median price drop from $2.20/W in the first half of 2024 to $2.08/W in the second half

Texas, which saw its median price drop from $2.10/W in the first half of 2024 to $2.00/W in the second half

Arizona, which saw its median price drop from $2.10/W in the first half of 2024 to $1.99/W in the second half

Both Nevada and Arizona now have prices below the national median. Arizona was a particular highlight, with significant amounts of sunshine and state incentives. It was the state with the lowest price, falling below $2/W for the first time. Its median price fell 5.2% from the first half of the year, even though it has consistently seen the lowest median quoted price for the past four years.

Additionally, Illinois has higher-than-average solar prices, but it still saw cost declines due to state incentives. The state saw its median price drop from $3.05/W in the first half of 2024 to $2.99/W in the second half.

In a press release, Hadlow concluded, “The data in this report tells a broader story about the industry’s evolution. From the rise in storage adoption to the shift toward higher-efficiency equipment and lower costs, we’re seeing homeowners take greater control over their energy choices. EnergySage is here to help them power their way.”

The press release was clear, however, that the future of the solar industry is facing an uncertain future due to recent political changes. In a blog post, EnergySage explained, “Though solar prices have fallen for close to two years, dropping dramatically since EnergySage began tracking in 2014, changes in the political atmosphere could potentially reverse the trend in 2025.” Specifically, the combination of tariffs and the repeal of energy tax credits leaves the industry in a state of flux.

“We are tracking tariff-related solar panel stockpiling to see if it hinders U.S. solar technology growth in 2025,” the company wrote. Walker noted that the median of $2.50 per watt over the second half of 2024 “creates a compelling record-low benchmark to measure against as we begin to see the effects of shifting policies and tariffs take hold this year.”",https://thebusinessdownload.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/504937873_10163399302722363_5209904812160451648_n-1-e1753708974352.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:04:57.566693

With the way electric car technology is today, we must often make a similar trade-off.","If you're reading this article, there's a good chance that you're prone to tech remorse. It's that anxious feeling you get when you want to buy an expensive piece of tech, but you don't want to be caught off-guard if something better comes along in a few months. Think of the person who buys an iPhone in August when the new one comes out in September. We've all been there.

The same thing tends to happen when shopping for an electric vehicle (EV). Sure, the car with the 250-mile range seems fine now, but what if they come out with something that goes 350 miles?

With this in mind, CarMax has partnered with car-review experts from Edmunds to share a few things to consider for those on the fence about buying an EV now and who are concerned about future upgrades.

Define ""Better""

Here's a reality check many of us need: Technology is constantly improving, and something better will always be around the corner. If you play this waiting game, you might never make a decision on a purchase. You need to make peace with this notion and reach an understanding of what's good enough for your needs today.

Before making this purchase, it's important to decide what ""better"" means to you. If it's better range, how much range do you need to feel comfortable with the purchase? If it's more horsepower, how fast of a 0-60 mph time do you need? Is it a more efficient electric motor? A faster charge time?

Concern: Better batteries

Solid-state batteries have been touted as the ""next big thing"" for electric cars, as they have the potential to offer serious enhancements to range, reduced cost, greater efficiency, and weight savings. However, the current supply chains are set up for the more readily available lithium-ion batteries, and different factories are needed for solid-state battery production. It takes time to implement those changes. It could be several years before we see them used in cars at scale.

Solid-state batteries: Toyota's first application of solid-state batteries is estimated to appear in 2026, with more widespread use sometime in 2027 and beyond. Speaking at the 2025 Kia EV Day conference, Hyundai Motor Group's head of global business planning, Spencer Cho, said, ""There is a lot of uncertainty about the progress of solid-state batteries.""

Cho added that he didn't think that the company could ""commercialize these batteries before 2030.""

Sodium-ion batteries: A Stanford study on sodium-ion batteries concluded that while they have the potential to reduce supply costs, ""The amount of energy they hold per pound tends to be lower than lithium-ion batteries."" The report adds that despite the theoretical lower cost of materials, ""The cost per unit of energy stored remains higher for sodium-ion batteries. This likely would limit widespread commercial adoption.""

Are You Willing to Pay for ""Better Tech""?

Perhaps the biggest problem with wanting the newest technology is that it isn't cheap. According to Edmunds sales data, the average transaction price for a new EV in January 2025 was $62,002. Are you willing to pay that much for the latest tech?

New Tech Comes With New Problems

It's not uncommon for a new EV to be released to the public and then have several issues. When the Chevrolet Bolt was relatively new, a defect was discovered in which the battery could potentially catch fire, and several model years were recalled for this issue. Toyota's bZ4X was recalled in its first year of production due to the potential of its wheels to fall off. Tesla's all-new Cybertruck had seven recalls in 2024, ranging from an electrical inverter issue to the front wiper potentially falling off, plus one in 2025, for trim panels falling off.

This isn’t intended to scare you off EVs, as all new cars have recalls. And many of these issues are addressed either via recall or by the manufacturers improving the vehicles' build quality as problems are discovered. But when you choose to be an early adopter of new tech, issues like these are more likely to crop up than if you had waited a few years for the problems to be ironed out.

Do You Really Need a Lot of Driving Range?

When EV-curious people talk about ""tech getting better"" in the future, they're often talking about how far the car can go without charging. This so-called range anxiety tends to happen because there are far fewer electric charging stations than gas stations, and it takes significantly longer to charge an EV than to refuel a gas vehicle. The solution for these people is that they think they need to buy an EV with more range to mitigate this worry.

But the reality is, most people don't drive that much. According to data from mobility analytics platform Replica, the average commuting distance in the U.S. is about 42 miles a day. Most EVs should be able to comfortably handle this distance and more. Read this article for a deeper discussion on how much electric car range you actually need.

Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, roughly 80% of EV charging occurs at home. Home charging is like leaving the house with a full ""tank of gas"" every day. You're probably used to charging your smartphone every night, so if you take the same approach to your EV, the overall range is less likely to be important—unless you're on a road trip.

Car Technology Is Always a Game of Trade-offs

There's a concept in business called the ""Triple Constraint."" It states that a company can aim to produce something that's ""cheap, fast, and good,"" but it can only ever achieve two of the three.

Cars are a complex balancing act of engineering, mitigating cost, and generating a profit for the automaker. In other words, automakers can build an electric car with upward of 500 miles of range and a nice interior, like the Lucid Air, but it will cost you over $100,000 (when new). Similarly, you can have an inexpensive EV, like the Nissan Leaf, but it will be small and offer a range of about 200 miles or less.

With the way electric car technology is today, we must often make a similar trade-off. Are you comfortable having a relatively affordable EV with less range and potentially renting a gas car for long road trips? Or do you want to go all in on a long-range EV and be willing to pay extra for it?

Why To Buy Now

Here are three reasons why you should get off the fence and land on the ""buy now"" side of it:

Waiting may cost you more than buying now, as Edmunds analysts predict that used car prices are likely to increase this year due to several factors.

The current administration is actively discussing eliminating electric vehicle incentives, which means the days of the used EV tax credit might be numbered.

Once you determine what you really need in an EV, you'll find that most models made within the past few years are more than capable of handling most people's commutes, have solid fast-charging times, and have more durable batteries than ever.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/96/b9672b25-4754-5904-b7c5-3f325881ebd9/6887864f6861e.image.jpg?crop=1280%2C672%2C0%2C23&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-28 12:12:38.656763

Constellation Energy's acquisition of Calpine isn't a gamble; it's a calculated bet on the AI-driven economy's most critical need: power.","The energy sector is undergoing a seismic shift, and Constellation Energy's $26.6 billion acquisition of Calpine isn't just a headline—it's a seismic event. This move, finalized in January 2025, isn't just about size; it's about positioning for a future where AI-driven data centers will consume more electricity than entire nations. With the combined company now boasting 60 gigawatts of zero- and low-emission capacity, including nuclear, geothermal, and natural gas, Constellation isn't just riding the clean energy wave—it's building the dam.

A Strategic Move to Dominate the AI Energy Gold Rush

The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts that data center electricity demand will more than double by 2030, with AI alone driving a quadruple surge. This isn't just about powering servers—it's about securing a future where tech giants like Microsoft and Meta are willing to sign 20-year power purchase agreements (PPAs) to lock in reliable, clean energy. Constellation's nuclear fleet, already the largest source of 24/7 emissions-free power in the U.S., is the perfect match for these demands. The company's recent $16 billion PPA with Microsoft to restart Three Mile Island and its 1.1 GW deal with Meta are not just contracts—they're guarantees of long-term revenue visibility in a sector where volatility is the norm.

But here's where the genius of this deal shines: Calpine's 27.7 GW of natural gas and geothermal assets act as a bridge between today's grid realities and tomorrow's AI needs. While nuclear provides the backbone, natural gas offers dispatchable flexibility, and geothermal adds reliability. Together, they form a “clean energy trifecta” that's unmatched in the U.S. market. This isn't just diversification—it's a hedge against the intermittency of renewables and the regulatory risks of fossil fuels.

Financial Strength Meets Market Tailwinds

Let's talk numbers. Constellation's 2024 financials tell a story of a company on the rise: a 130% surge in net income to $3.75 billion, a 137% jump in EPS to $9.48, and a gross profit margin that more than doubled to 25.42%. The acquisition of Calpine isn't a drag—it's a turbocharger. Analysts project at least $2 billion in annual free cash flow from the deal, with EPS accretion of 20% in 2026 and beyond. This isn't just growth—it's a recipe for compounding value.

The Inflation Reduction Act's nuclear Production Tax Credit (PTC) adds another layer of financial armor. By providing a price floor for nuclear generation, the PTC allows Constellation to lock in margins even as commodity prices fluctuate. For a company with 60 GW of nuclear capacity, this is a game-changer. And with AI demand set to outpace manufacturing sectors in the next decade, Constellation's ability to deliver carbon-free power at scale isn't just strategic—it's essential.

Market Positioning: The Only Name in the Room with Both Nuclear and Gas

Here's the kicker: Constellation is the only U.S. independent power producer (IPP) with a vertically integrated, 24/7 carbon-free generation platform. Competitors like NextEra Energy and Duke Energy rely heavily on renewables or regulated utilities, but neither can match Constellation's dispatchable capacity. This isn't just a competitive edge—it's a moat.

The acquisition also solves a critical problem for the grid: resource adequacy. As AI data centers cluster in regions like Texas (ERCOT) and Pennsylvania (PJM), where demand is projected to rise 43% by 2034, Constellation's expanded footprint ensures it's not just selling power—it's solving a crisis. And with 20-year PPAs in place, the company's cash flows are as stable as the power it delivers.

Investment Thesis: A No-Brainer for the Long Haul

For investors, this deal is a masterclass in positioning for the future. Constellation's ability to blend nuclear's reliability with natural gas's flexibility and geothermal's consistency gives it a unique role in the AI energy ecosystem. The company's balance sheet, with a current ratio of 1.47 and investment-grade ratings from S&P and Moody's, ensures it can fund this growth without overleveraging.

The risks? Regulatory hurdles remain, though FERC already approved the deal with conditions. But given the administration's push for clean energy, Constellation's ESG alignment is a tailwind, not a headwind. And with AI demand accelerating faster than most models predict, the company's 10%+ annual EPS growth target through 2028 looks conservative.

Final Takeaway

This isn't just a stock—it's a stake in the future of energy. Constellation Energy's acquisition of Calpine isn't a gamble; it's a calculated bet on the AI-driven economy's most critical need: power. For investors with a 10-year horizon, this is a no-brainer.

While the agreement emphasizes clean energy and green technology, it stops short of committing to reducing coal use—a decision that has left many environmental groups concerned. Still, the partnership reflects a shift in global climate diplomacy, especially with U.S. leadership appearing uncertain.

Let’s break down the statement, its implications, and the key challenges ahead.

Clean Tech, Not Coal Cuts: What the Climate Statement Promised

At the EU-China Summit in Beijing on July 24, 2025, leaders from both sides released a joint press statement. The focus was on reinforcing their partnership in addressing climate change while promoting clean technologies like solar, hydropower, electric vehicles (EVs), and battery storage. The statement marked the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement and the 50th year of diplomatic relations between the two powers.

Key commitments include:

Supporting the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement as the backbone of global climate cooperation.

Turning climate targets into real-world outcomes through systematic policies.

Submit updated 2035 climate goals (NDCs) before COP30, covering all sectors and greenhouse gases.

Expanding global renewable energy access and sharing green technologies, especially with developing countries.

Boosting adaptation support to help nations respond to climate threats.

Collaborating on areas like methane reduction, carbon markets, and low-carbon technology.

Yet, coal was left unaddressed. Despite growing pressure from environmental advocates, the statement made no mention of cutting coal use, a major source of global emissions.

A United Push for Renewable Energy

The EU and China’s climate focus now leans heavily toward clean technology development and cooperation. This includes:

Solar panel production and installation.

Scaling up EV adoption with better batteries and charging infrastructure.

Building large-scale battery storage systems for better grid reliability.

These technologies could significantly lower emissions and make clean energy more affordable and accessible worldwide. Both China and the EU have strong manufacturing bases, positioning them as global leaders in the green tech race.

Their cooperation could be especially useful for developing countries struggling with the high costs of clean energy. If done right, this tech-sharing strategy could support global decarbonization and improve climate equity.

China’s Medog Dam: Climate Win or Ecological Fallout?

One of the most ambitious pieces in China’s green energy puzzle is the Medog Dam project in Tibet. With an estimated cost of $137 billion, the dam will become the largest hydropower station in the world. Once completed, it will generate around 300 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity annually, which could replace energy from hundreds of coal plants.

This scale of clean power is a major boost to China’s goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2060.

However, the project has drawn criticism for its environmental and geopolitical risks:

Built in a fragile ecosystem, near the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, the dam could harm biodiversity, impact river flows, and disrupt agriculture downstream.

Local communities face displacement, raising humanitarian concerns.

The dam’s location near the India-China border adds fuel to regional tensions, especially over shared water resources.

Environmental experts have also raised alarms about the lack of transparency around impact studies. While the project promises millions of tons of emissions savings, its ecological footprint could offset the climate gains if not managed responsibly.

Carbon markets and clean-tech exports offer hope for climate progress. But without firm commitments to end coal dependency and without stronger oversight of mega-projects, the climate gains may fall short. This balancing act between energy security and environmental integrity is one of the key challenges that the EU and China must address moving forward.

Is China Exporting Clean? And at What Cost?

China is stepping up its global presence as a major exporter of clean technologies. Today, it leads the world in the production of solar panels, electric vehicles (EVs), and batteries.

As per reports,

This surge in clean-tech exports is expected to reduce global emissions by as much as 2.5 billion tons by 2030—equivalent to removing 500 million cars from the world’s roads.

It saved 4Gt as the cumulative lifetime savings from just 2024 exports.

This boom is doing two things simultaneously. It supports climate action globally by offering countries affordable green alternatives, and it boosts China’s economy and expands its geopolitical influence, especially in emerging and developing markets.

However, there’s one more side of the leaf which isn’t so green. The environmental costs of producing these technologies can be significant. Mining and manufacturing components like lithium and rare earth elements often lead to high emissions.

If these upstream processes are not cleaned up, China could end up exporting “dirty green” solutions that undermine the broader climate goals. Life-cycle emissions, i.e., from raw material extraction to final product delivery, must be included when evaluating the real impact of these exports.

Thus, China needs to decarbonize its supply chains and ensure the climate benefits of its clean-tech exports are genuine and lasting.

Impact of EU-China Collaboration on Carbon Markets

One of the most promising outcomes of the EU-China climate statement is the potential impact on international carbon markets. As more countries introduce emissions caps, the demand for carbon credits is expected to surge. Analysts estimate that the carbon market could grow to $100 billion by 2030.

This creates a major opportunity. Companies involved in verifiable clean projects could benefit by generating and trading carbon credits. In turn, these credits can support global decarbonization, especially in hard-to-abate sectors. A stronger and well-functioning carbon trading system could accelerate the pace of emissions reductions worldwide.

However, carbon markets are only effective if they are transparent and based on actual, verified reductions in emissions. Strict rules and enforcement are necessary to prevent greenwashing and to ensure the system does not simply shift emissions from one place to another.

Without trust, data accuracy, and mutual accountability, the effectiveness of carbon markets will remain limited. Both the EU and China must ensure that any expansion of the carbon credit system is built on strong governance and integrity.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_1897799635.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 11:02:43.329147

In 2023, India had an estimated 378 billion t of coal reserves, making it the fifth-largest country in terms of coal deposits.
Coal India has partnered with Bharat Heavy Electricals, also a state-run company, to set up an ammonium nitrate plant.
In another project, NLC India, a company under the Indian Ministry of Coal, plans to produce methanol from syngas.
Any talk by richer countries of pressuring India to reduce its coal consumption amounts to “climate imperialism,” he adds.","At a United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow, Scotland, 4 years ago, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi made an ambitious pledge. In the presence of over 120 other global leaders, he set 2070 as India’s target year for net-zero emissions of carbon dioxide and other planet-warming gases.

For India, the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, meeting that goal will require moving away from coal, the country’s primary source of energy, and embracing renewable and other low-carbon resources. Along those lines, the government has made significant strides in building its renewable energy capacity over the past decade. Several ambitious investments in the fields of solar energy and green hydrogen have recently made headlines.

But as the country’s energy demand grows, renewable energy adoption hasn’t been accompanied by a decrease in reliance on coal, a fossil fuel that generates more CO2 per unit of energy produced than other nonrenewable sources, such as natural gas and oil.

In fact, India’s coal use is on the rise and not just for power generation. The government is investing in and incentivizing industrial projects based on coal gasification, in which coal is oxidized in the presence of steam at high temperatures. The process creates synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen.

The concoction, also known as syngas, serves as a raw material for basic chemicals such as methanol and ammonia. Syngas can also be used to produce olefins and other petrochemicals, though this approach is practiced mainly in China and South Africa. The Indian government is bullish on syngas technology, and officials have set a goal of gasifying 100 million metric tons (t) of coal, about 10% of the country’s annual coal consumption, by 2030.

Gasifying coal to make chemicals is not much better in terms of greenhouse gas emissions than burning coal—and much worse than making those chemicals from oil or natural gas. India relies heavily on oil, natural gas, and methanol imports, which not only are expensive but also contradict Modi’s vision of making the country self-sufficient. Although many policy experts defend India’s coal consumption as an economic right to utilize a domestic resource, it’s clear that the country, at least for now, is not moving in the direction of carbon neutrality.

An appetite for coal

In the world’s most populous country, home to nearly 1.4 billion people, coal remains the dominant energy source. It is used mainly in thermal power plants, where it is burned to generate electricity. The generated power is supplied to residences and industrial plants through India’s expansive electric grid. About 75% of the country's power comes from coal, according to the nation’s coal ministry.

“India doesn’t have a lot of oil and gas, but it has plenty of coal. Over the years, the country has developed ways to harness it,” says Sandeep Pai, head of research design and strategic engagement at Swaniti Initiative, a think tank that works at the intersection of climate action and economic development.

In 2023, India had an estimated 378 billion t of coal reserves, making it the fifth-largest country in terms of coal deposits. With a rapidly growing economy, India will continue to rely on coal, experts say.

Partha Sarathi Bhattacharyya, the former chairman of Coal India, the world's largest government-owned coal producer, says India’s per capita energy consumption is among the lowest in the world, but he expects the number to grow in the years ahead as the country becomes more prosperous. An analysis by World Population Review, a website with a goal of making demographic data more accessible, found that per capita 2023 energy consumption in the US was 277 gigajoules (GJ), compared with 27.3 GJ in India. “A population of 1.4 billion people can aspire [to] quite a lot,” Bhattacharyya says.

Nikit Abhyankar, co–faculty director of the India Energy and Climate Center at the Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley, notes that electricity demand in India is growing at an average rate of 7% per year. “In the residential sector, the highest demand comes from air conditioners,” he says.

India’s renewable energy capacity, which this year is five times more than it was in 2014, accounts for about 46% of the country’s overall power-generation capacity, but the reality is that less than 20% of the actual power consumed in India comes from renewables. With energy demand set to grow rapidly in the coming years, Bhattacharyya says, renewable sources will struggle to significantly increase their share of the country’s power-consumption requirements.

While India aims to generate 50% of its electricity from nonfossil sources by 2030, it also plans to ramp up coal production by as much as 42% during the same period, according to the Institute for Energy Research, a think tank based in Washington, DC. And one reason for the expected increase in the use of coal is that increasing amounts of it will be converted into syngas.

Coal-to-chemicals strategy

In the agricultural industry, syngas is used to make ammonia, a key fertilizer and raw material for other fertilizers. In the petrochemical industry, syngas can be reformed into methanol, which is a fuel as well as a feedstock for producing certain plastics, textiles, and pharmaceuticals.

In most of the world, the starting material for syngas is natural gas. But last year, the Indian government approved $1 billion in financial incentives for coal-gasification projects, with the aim of reducing dependence on imported fuel and chemicals and supporting indigenous technology.

Jindal Steel, a steel and power producer and a key player in India’s private sector, secured $66 million in government incentives for a 2-million-t-per-year coal-gasification project in India’s eastern state of Odisha. The company will use the syngas in the manufacture of sponge iron.

New Era Cleantech received $116 million for a coal-gasification project in western Maharashtra. Using the technique, the company aims to produce 330,000 t per year of ammonium nitrate and 100,000 t per year of hydrogen.

State-run companies are also pursuing coal gasification. Coal India has partnered with Bharat Heavy Electricals, also a state-run company, to set up an ammonium nitrate plant. The investment is expected to yield 660,000 t per year of ammonium nitrate, used both as a fertilizer and in explosives. In another project, NLC India, a company under the Indian Ministry of Coal, plans to produce methanol from syngas.

To some experts, these investments are a step in the right direction, given that the Indian chemical industry relies heavily on imports of key feedstocks. “Right now, India imports 90% of its methanol from the rest of the world,” says Sonal K. Thengane, an associate professor in the Department of Hydro and Renewable Energy at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.

Thengane says coal gasification offers India the opportunity to reduce its reliance on imports and continue raising its standard of living toward the levels enjoyed in Europe and the US. “With coal reserves lying idle in our own country, it doesn’t make sense to spend money on importing other cleaner fuels from those countries which are mainly responsible for the climate. It is simply not a sensible idea,” he says.

Although coal gasification is not the best option for the environment, it produces fewer emissions than burning coal, Thengane says. Others argue that coal gasification still generates significant greenhouse gas emissions and works against Modi’s net-zero vision.

Joe Hittinger, project manager for chemicals at Global Energy Monitor, a nongovernmental organization that crunches energy-related data, says that producing methanol from coal is significantly more carbon intensive than making it from natural gas. “The emissions intensity is around five times higher from coal to methanol versus natural gas to methanol,” he says.

International pressure to change

Hittinger says he understands the raw-material-independence rationale for the gasification projects, but he worries that the resulting emissions will be detrimental to climate goals for both India and the world. “India will almost certainly not meet its own climate goals if they don't consider lower-carbon ways to produce these chemicals,” he says. Furthermore, approaches like coal gasification need to be fitted with carbon capture technologies, which are still in the early stages of development, Hittinger adds.

Despite India’s coal-gasification goals, the primary outlet for the fossil fuel remains the power sector. And for years, India and China, the world's largest coal consumers, have faced immense pressure to transition away from fossil fuels, but neither country has yielded.

At the 11th hour of the 2021 Glasgow summit, India and China opposed a final communiqué stating that coal should be phased out. India's environment minister at the time took to the floor and said, ""How can anyone expect that developing countries make promises about phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies? Developing countries still have to deal with their poverty-reduction agenda.""

Kaushik Deb, executive director of the Energy Policy Institute’s India team at the University of Chicago, says that any pressure on India from rich countries is appalling, as India’s per-capita carbon emissions are lower than most of theirs. “Even if India tripled its electricity grid, it wouldn’t be enough to maintain a quality of life that the developed countries have. It won’t match what the US or China have,” he says. Any talk by richer countries of pressuring India to reduce its coal consumption amounts to “climate imperialism,” he adds.

The Indian government has set a target of doubling non–fossil fuel energy capacity to 500 GW by 2030, but transitioning away from fossil fuels, particularly coal, is not easy when plenty is available in the country’s backyard, says Shreyas Shende, a senior research associate focusing on South Asian security, energy, and public policy at the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab at Johns Hopkins University. “Purely from an equity perspective, India's argument could be, why should it constrain its carbon space and sort of kneecap its economic development prospects at the altar of international cooperation?” he says.

Until wealthier countries, historically the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, disburse capital in the form of climate finances to countries such as India, meeting a collective goal of keeping global warming under control will be difficult, Shende says. And such funding is scarce. He points to the deliberations at COP-29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, in 2024, as evidence of the difficulty of obtaining climate finances.

“Developing countries had asked for trillions of dollars to help mitigate climate change and move to cleaner energy, but rich countries agreed to give much less than that while at the same time failing to meet existing climate-finance commitments,” he says.

Shayak Sengupta, a senior research associate at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, notes that as the world gets warmer, electricity demand will only keep growing. For India, which is already experiencing increased bouts of heat waves, the need will be especially pronounced. “No matter how many renewables you add to the national electricity grid, they can't keep up with the demand increases,” Sengupta says. “For now, India will expand its coal capacity.”","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/into-India-s-Energy-transition---106639-1:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-07-28 12:13:26.969581

Overnight, we’ve got a blockbuster trade deal between the US and the European Union that’s got the markets buzzing with optimism and sending on an upward trajectory. The Trump Administration closed the deal that they said he couldn’t close. The commitment by the EU is to invest $600 billion into the US economy and to purchase $750 million in good old red white and blue US energy. According to the agreement, the EU plans to invest an additional $600 billion in the US and has agreed to purchase $750 billion in energy. This is the kind of agreement that puts American energy front and center, and by averting a potential trade war, it is opening the floodgates for US exports. A major win for US workers and jobs.

To break it down, late Sunday into Monday, the US and EU hammered out a preliminary deal that slaps a 15% tariff on most European goods heading our way – think autos and more – but in return, the EU commits to snapping up hundreds of billions in American energy products. This a whopping $600 to $750 billion in purchases of US liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil, and even nuclear fuel over the coming years isn’t just a handshake; it’s a lifeline for US producers who’ve been battling headwinds from global oversupply and geopolitical jitters.

Remember how Europe ramped up LPG and LNG imports from us back in 2022 to ditch Russian gas? This deal supercharges that trend, with exports potentially skyrocketing and helping to balance out demand as we head into the fall heating season. While some critics argue about “unbalanced” terms or higher consumer costs, these negotiations are designed to protect US jobs and energy independence. Wall Street has responded positively, with stock futures rising on recent trade developments. To date, tariffs have not led to the predicted inflation, as many foreign countries absorb the costs, and economic growth with more trade will offset any concern with any potential price increases. Can we say winning? Just asking.

Oil prices are loving it already. futures climbed about 1.2% overnight to hover around $82.50 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) pushed up to $78.30, building on last week’s gains fueled by strong earnings and easing tariff fears. Why the pop? Simple – this pact signals stability in transatlantic trade, reduces the risk of retaliatory tariffs that could crimp energy flows, and locks in Europe as a premium buyer for US Natural gas and crude.

It’s a win-win: Europe diversifies away from unreliable suppliers, and American drillers get a demand jolt that could tighten inventories just when the EIA is forecasting global oil consumption hitting a record 104.6 million barrels per day next year. But don’t sleep on the broader implications. With China tariff talks possibly extending and Middle East tensions simmering, this US-EU accord eases market nerves and underscores America’s role as the world’s energy powerhouse.

Bloomberg reports a growing surplus in oil and supply despite increased energy demand from trade deals, AI, and data centers. TotalEnergies (EPA: ) SE recently warned of oversupply as OPEC+ eases production cuts while global growth slows. Equinor ASA’s Johan Castberg field is running at full capacity, with new Brazilian production set to add more barrels from outside OPEC+.

Earlier this month, the International Energy Agency and the US Energy Information Administration both increased their projections for next year’s oil surplus. According to the two organizations, supply is expected to exceed demand by the largest margin since the pandemic, with the IEA forecasting a surplus of 2 million barrels per day.

are perking up too, with Henry Hub up 0.8% as traders bet on export volumes surging. And hey, if you’re in the refining space, keep an eye on gasoline cracks – they’re firming as summer driving demand lingers and this deal hints at smoother international supply chains.

Natural gas prices have been really beat up lately uh that could change. Fox Weather reports that although the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season has started quietly, two potential development areas could bring increased activity in early August. The FOX Forecast Center is tracking two areas—one in the Atlantic and one in the Gulf of America—for possible tropical development over the next ten days. July may end with record-breaking heat as a heat dome brings triple-digit temperatures and heat alerts from Florida to Virginia. On Sunday, extreme heat warnings are issued for southern Georgia through southeastern Virginia as high pressure shifts intense temperatures across the Southeast.

The International Energy Agency highlights how air conditioning affects electricity demand, but it’s also important to note that air conditioning has saved millions of lives and improved longevity in many countries by helping people cope with hot weather. The IEA reported that, “Around the world, demand for cooling is increasing quickly as temperatures, populations and incomes rise. In 2024, global average temperatures reached 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for the first time, intensifying the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heat waves. At the same time, economic development is reshaping access to air conditioning in many countries – especially in emerging and developing economies, where more than 80% of projected electricity demand for cooling by 2050 is expected to occur.

Currently, about 3.5 billion people live in regions with high temperatures, yet only about 15% of them own an air conditioner. But that is set to change in the years ahead. Across Southeast Asia, for example, the stock of air conditioners is set to increase ninefold between 2020 and 2040 based on today’s policy settings. In Indonesia specifically, the share of the population that owns an air conditioning unit is expected to rise from 14% in 2023 to 85% by 2050, driven in large part by an improvement in living standards.

If you're reading this article, there's a good chance that you're prone to tech remorse. It's that anxious feeling you get when you want to buy an expensive piece of tech, but you don't want to be caught off-guard if something better comes along in a few months. Think of the person who buys an iPhone in August when the new one comes out in September. We've all been there.

The same thing tends to happen when shopping for an electric vehicle (EV). Sure, the car with the 250-mile range seems fine now, but what if they come out with something that goes 350 miles?

With this in mind, CarMax has partnered with car-review experts from Edmunds to share a few things to consider for those on the fence about buying an EV now and who are concerned about future upgrades.

Define ""Better""

Here's a reality check many of us need: Technology is constantly improving, and something better will always be around the corner. If you play this waiting game, you might never make a decision on a purchase. You need to make peace with this notion and reach an understanding of what's good enough for your needs today.

Before making this purchase, it's important to decide what ""better"" means to you. If it's better range, how much range do you need to feel comfortable with the purchase? If it's more horsepower, how fast of a 0-60 mph time do you need? Is it a more efficient electric motor? A faster charge time?

Concern: Better batteries

Solid-state batteries have been touted as the ""next big thing"" for electric cars, as they have the potential to offer serious enhancements to range, reduced cost, greater efficiency, and weight savings. However, the current supply chains are set up for the more readily available lithium-ion batteries, and different factories are needed for solid-state battery production. It takes time to implement those changes. It could be several years before we see them used in cars at scale.

Solid-state batteries:Toyota's first application of solid-state batteries is estimated to appear in 2026, with more widespread use sometime in 2027 and beyond. Speaking at the 2025 Kia EV Day conference, Hyundai Motor Group's head of global business planning, Spencer Cho, said, ""There is a lot of uncertainty about the progress of solid-state batteries.""

Cho added that he didn't think that the company could ""commercialize these batteries before 2030.""

Sodium-ion batteries: A Stanford study on sodium-ion batteries concluded that while they have the potential to reduce supply costs, ""The amount of energy they hold per pound tends to be lower than lithium-ion batteries."" The report adds that despite the theoretical lower cost of materials, ""The cost per unit of energy stored remains higher for sodium-ion batteries. This likely would limit widespread commercial adoption.""

Are You Willing to Pay for ""Better Tech""?

Perhaps the biggest problem with wanting the newest technology is that it isn't cheap. According to Edmunds sales data, the average transaction price for a new EV in January 2025 was $62,002. Are you willing to pay that much for the latest tech?

New Tech Comes With New Problems

It's not uncommon for a new EV to be released to the public and then have several issues. When the Chevrolet Bolt was relatively new, a defect was discovered in which the battery could potentially catch fire, and several model years were recalled for this issue. Toyota's bZ4X was recalled in its first year of production due to the potential of its wheels to fall off. Tesla's all-new Cybertruck had seven recalls in 2024, ranging from an electrical inverter issue to the front wiper potentially falling off, plus one in 2025, for trim panels falling off.

This isn't intended to scare you off EVs, as all new cars have recalls. And many of these issues are addressed either via recall or by the manufacturers improving the vehicles' build quality as problems are discovered. But when you choose to be an early adopter of new tech, issues like these are more likely to crop up than if you had waited a few years for the problems to be ironed out.

Do You Really Need a Lot of Driving Range?

When EV-curious people talk about ""tech getting better"" in the future, they're often talking about how far the car can go without charging. This so-called range anxiety tends to happen because there are far fewer electric charging stations than gas stations, and it takes significantly longer to charge an EV than to refuel a gas vehicle. The solution for these people is that they think they need to buy an EV with more range to mitigate this worry.

But the reality is, most people don't drive that much. According to data from mobility analytics platform Replica, the average commuting distance in the U.S. is about 42 miles a day. Most EVs should be able to comfortably handle this distance and more. Read this article for a deeper discussion on how much electric car range you actually need.

Additionally, according to the U.S. Department of Energy, roughly 80% of EV charging occurs at home. Home charging is like leaving the house with a full ""tank of gas"" every day. You're probably used to charging your smartphone every night, so if you take the same approach to your EV, the overall range is less likely to be important-unless you're on a road trip.

Car Technology Is Always a Game of Trade-offs

There's a concept in business called the ""Triple Constraint."" It states that a company can aim to produce something that's ""cheap, fast, and good,"" but it can only ever achieve two of the three.

Cars are a complex balancing act of engineering, mitigating cost, and generating a profit for the automaker. In other words, automakers can build an electric car with upward of 500 miles of range and a nice interior, like the Lucid Air, but it will cost you over $100,000 (when new). Similarly, you can have an inexpensive EV, like the Nissan Leaf, but it will be small and offer a range of about 200 miles or less.

With the way electric car technology is today, we must often make a similar trade-off. Are you comfortable having a relatively affordable EV with less range and potentially renting a gas car for long road trips? Or do you want to go all in on a long-range EV and be willing to pay extra for it?

Why To Buy Now

Here are three reasons why you should get off the fence and land on the ""buy now"" side of it:

Waiting may cost you more than buying now, as Edmunds analysts predict that used car prices are likely to increase this year due to several factors.

The current administration is actively discussing eliminating electric vehicle incentives, which means the days of the used EV tax credit might be numbered.

Once you determine what you really need in an EV, you'll find that most models made within the past few years are more than capable of handling most people's commutes, have solid fast-charging times, and have more durable batteries than ever.

While solvent-based capture is currently the most common and mature carbon capture technology, it is not the only promising carbon capture technology.

Third, the United States should develop a carbon capture export strategy by mobilizing agencies like the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and Export-Import Bank (EXIM) to support the international deployment of U.S. carbon capture technologies.","The United States is broadly considered the current world leader in carbon management, with enough installed capacity to capture over 20 million metric tons per year (Mtpa)—nearly half of the global total. The term carbon management refers to the suite of technologies aimed at capturing, utilizing, or storing carbon emissions from industrial sources—known as CCUS—or carbon from the atmosphere—known as carbon dioxide removal (CDR). U.S. success in this area has been underpinned by stable policy support, favorable geological conditions for carbon storage, a skilled workforce, and a series of pilot- and commercial-scale project demonstrations.

However, that leading position is now in question as U.S. priorities change and other countries scale up their CCUS deployment efforts. Maintaining U.S. leadership in this frontier energy technology is not just a matter of climate policy or domestic economic development—it is a strategic opportunity that positions the United States to capture an emerging global market.

An Economic Growth and Market Potential Proposition

The carbon management sector—inclusive of both CCUS and CDR technologies—presents a sizable economic opportunity for the United States. A Department of Energy (DOE) report from 2022 asserts that reaching carbon capture deployment of 500 to 1,200 Mtpa would generate $75 to $110 billion in gross value added to the U.S. economy through 2030, growing to $600 billion to $1.5 trillion by 2050.

Achieving that scale of deployment and investment is tied to significant job creation potential—an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 direct job-years (defined as one year of work for one person) in the near term, growing to a cumulative total of 3 million direct job-years through 2050. Notably, the capture segment of the carbon management value chain is projected to drive over 90 percent of job creation, attributed to the engineering, manufacturing, construction, operation, and maintenance of capture facilities.

These values would be even higher when factoring in prospective international markets that could also be serviced by U.S. firms, underscoring the immense economic potential at stake. Globally, the International Energy Agency estimates that approximately 7.6 billion tons, or gigatons (Gt), of carbon emissions will need to be captured annually to reach net-zero by 2050. To illustrate the scale of this industrial opportunity, equipping the United States with enough capacity to support about a fourth of this global market—or 2 Gt—for carbon capture would require manufacturing 14 million tons of monoethanolamine (MEA), a common carbon capture solvent. For reference, U.S. production of ethanolamines—the broader family of chemicals that includes MEA—stood at just 0.7 million tons in 2019, which mostly meets non-CCUS demand. While this example only accounts for one supply chain segment for a single CCUS technology, enabling such an explosive growth opportunity will require proactive investment and sustained industrial policy that supports U.S. CCUS manufacturers and technology developers.

Capturing Cost Reductions and Supply Chains

While most jobs are projected to come from the capture stage, it is also the segment that accounts for the majority of total CCUS system costs—as much as 90 percent of the total cost of CO2 avoided or sequestered. And although downstream activities—such as storage credits, CO2 utilization, or enhanced oil recovery (EOR)—are the main sources of project revenue and value creation, none are possible without economically viable capture at scale. Hence, to establish a globally competitive carbon capture industry that supports domestic growth while enabling exports of technologies, services, and materials, the United States must commit to continued innovation, supply chain development, and scaled deployment—all aimed at lowering the cost of capture.

Understanding the cost components of a capture facility clarifies the challenge of cost reductions. While the primary cost drivers of carbon capture are exogenous—such as the concentration, partial pressure, scale, and desired capture rate of the CO2 stream—ongoing research is focused on improving capture technologies to mitigate their cost impact on the carbon management value chain. Capital costs are largely attributed to the absorbent towers, which account for about 40 percent of modeled capital expenditures, while nearly all operating costs for solvent-based capture systems are driven by the reboiler and other components requiring process energy. Remarkably, the reboiler alone accounts for 68 percent of total costs when annualizing capital and operating costs, highlighting how improvements in the energy consumption profile of the capture process are a clear pathway to cost reductions. Assessed as a whole, these values illustrate the materials- and energy-intensive nature of incumbent carbon capture methods, reinforcing the need for continued innovation that yields more efficient and optimized capture materials, processes, and equipment designs.

While solvent-based capture is currently the most common and mature carbon capture technology, it is not the only promising carbon capture technology. Novel capture materials and processes are currently in development, each with specific advantages and disadvantages to realizing further cost of capture reductions. Balancing commercialization and deployment of a diverse set of carbon capture solutions will make the sector adaptable to a broad range of end-use characteristics and applications. This fact also highlights the potential for robust domestic value creation in carbon management without facing global supply chain bottlenecks. A DOE Supply Chain Risk Assessment indicates that carbon management would not experience significant supply chain risks even under high growth scenarios. The report found that many of the key inputs, such as chemicals and equipment, are common products with robust and mature domestic industries behind them. This supply chain security stands in contrast with other clean technologies, where geographically concentrated materials and supply chain segments present a sourcing challenge.

While the United States stands to benefit from a diverse technology landscape and low supply chain risk for scaling carbon capture, these conditions alone are not enough to secure long-term leadership. International competitors are steadily making inroads in the carbon management space by accelerating innovation, deployment, and policy alignment.

Progress Abroad and Uncertainty at Home

Perhaps unsurprisingly, China is positioning itself as a challenger to U.S. leadership. The country views carbon capture technologies as a strategic tool to clean up its economy while maintaining energy security and industrial competitiveness in the long term. This is reflected by China’s rapidly growing project pipeline of more than 100 CCUS demonstration projects as of September 2023. About half of these projects are already operational and amount to 6 Mtpa of installed capture capacity, with over 10 of them each exceeding 0.5 Mtpa.

This governmental ambition has also spurred advances in innovation. In 2022, Chinese entities filed nearly three-quarters of all global CCUS patents—a total of 298 patents to the 42 filed by U.S. researchers. This surge in intellectual property is in turn fueling improvements at large-scale demonstration projects. For example, the Huaneng Longdong project employs a proprietary solvent that requires about 20 percent less energy for regeneration than traditional solvents at equivalent capture rates, while also acting as the testing ground for other more advanced, energy-efficient solvents. When fully operational, the project will become the world’s largest coal-fired CCUS power plant with a 1.5 Mtpa capture capacity. If momentum is sustained, this surge in innovation and deployment could allow Chinese firms to dominate carbon capture markets much as they did with other clean energy technologies—a scenario that should spur the U.S. government to renew its carbon management ambitions.

Meanwhile, Europe has set ambitious deployment targets that could either act as an opportunity or put competitive pressure on U.S. technological leadership. The European Commission adopted the Industrial Carbon Management Strategy in February 2024 with the objective to increase CO2 storage capacity from 3 Mtpa to 50 Mtpa by 2030, scaling to over 250 Mtpa by 2040. This strategy goes beyond policy targets and is backed by climate legislation, regulatory certainty, carbon pricing, and infrastructure investment across member states. European countries like the United Kingdom, Norway, and the Netherlands have already launched major capture projects, leveraging public funding with private sector deployment to make capture commercially viable at scale while taking advantage of the mandated storage capacity under development. The result is a burgeoning pipeline of over 100 Mtpa in CCUS capacity under construction or development by 2030, which could potentially turn once “lagging” Europe into a competitive carbon management destination within this decade.

In contrast, the United States is sending mixed signals to the over 130 announced facilities under development with a combined capture capacity of over 130 Mtpa and an estimated $77.5 billion in invested capital expenditures. In May 2025, the DOE terminated $3.7 billion in previously awarded grants for industrial decarbonization projects, which primarily included carbon capture projects. Concurrently, firings and resignations at national labs working on carbon capture breakthroughs raise concerns about sustained innovation. On the other hand, the recently passed budget reconciliation package gives a slight boost to the 45Q tax credit for carbon utilization and EOR, while the Environmental Protection Agency is slated to make Texas the sixth state to be granted primacy for Class VI carbon storage wells. Although there are some positive developments, there is still little supportive political rhetoric behind the carbon management sector.

Immediate Policy Opportunities to Maintain the United States’ Capture Edge

The United States stands at a critical juncture. It can leverage its current lead in the sector to develop the next generation of capture technologies, scale and anchor their supply chains, and become the prime global provider of carbon management solutions. To seize this opportunity and solidify its leadership, the current administration can act now on low-regret, high-impact initiatives that unlock near-term CCUS deployment while enabling U.S. economic growth, energy security, and global industrial competitiveness.

First, the federal government should support the buildout of enabling infrastructure for carbon capture projects at ethanol plants by streamlining permitting and siting while developing robust oversight and educational programs that enhance public perception and acceptance. With dozens of proposed projects in the pipeline, ethanol facilities are ideal candidates for deploying mature, pre-combustion capture technologies since they emit nearly pure streams of CO₂. Diminishing permitting friction—especially across state lines—and improving public acceptance could unlock billions in private investment and build out shared carbon infrastructure that other emerging industries, such as low-carbon cement and fertilizers, would also benefit from.

Second, the administration should recognize carbon capture as a clean speed-to-power enabler for AI data centers. Energy companies are already moving to deploy post-combustion carbon capture solutions at power plants to exploit this opportunity, while novel technologies like oxy-combustion and cryogenic capture have continued to make headway in recent years. Acknowledging CCS-equipped facilities in executive orders or permitting fast lanes and encouraging the development of “CCS-ready” power plants would help bring more generating capacity online to power the country’s AI ambitions while enabling Big Tech’s clean procurement goals. The federal government can leverage this vast demand for clean baseload power to deploy and commercialize next-generation energy technologies.

Third, the United States should develop a carbon capture export strategy by mobilizing agencies like the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and Export-Import Bank (EXIM) to support the international deployment of U.S. carbon capture technologies. While both institutions have historically overlooked the technology, they could now be leveraged alongside energy diplomacy efforts to capture prospective overseas CCUS markets: Brazil and its goal to decarbonize its large industrial base and ethanol sector, the latter being second only to the United States’ own in terms of production capacity; Europe and its low-carbon materials ambitions, resulting in a CCUS-enabled, net-zero cement facility’s output already being sold out for the year; and Southeast Asian nations like Indonesia and Malaysia, with grand CCUS targets that are enabled by world-class geologic storage conditions. Supporting these agencies and their export instruments through technical partnerships and standard-setting engagement would ensure that U.S. firms—not foreign competitors—set the pace for the formation of global CCUS value chains.

Among the 31 “historic” actions that the EPA began at the time was the “reconsideration” of what’s known as the endangerment finding — the 2009 declaration made by the Obama EPA that greenhouse gases present a risk to human health and can thereby be regulated under the Clean Air Act. The finding is, in many ways, the heart of federal climate efforts: It’s the foundation for all federal regulations that limit carbon emissions. Now, the Trump EPA appears to be on the verge of overturning it, as The New York Times and other news outlets have reported.

RELATED: When Science Is Silenced, We All Breathe the Consequences

Having no basis for regulating carbon emissions would have devastating consequences not just for every American but for the entire world, as the United States remains the largest emitter of carbon globally. But as is so often the case when it comes to climate change and other environmental issues, Black people will likely face the worst and most immediate consequences if greenhouse gas emissions are no longer regulated — because the already dirtier air that Black America breathes will get that much worse.

The Plan: Roll Back Tailpipe Emissions Standards

There’s no need to guess as what the knock-on effects of overturning the finding might be, because the EPA’s draft plan, as the Times has reported, makes the next steps very clear: with the endangerment finding gone, the Trump EPA plans to rollback all tailpipe emissions from every class of vehicle, from passenger cars to semi trucks.

“The E.P.A. intends to argue that imposing climate regulations on automakers poses the real harm to human health because it would lead to higher prices and reduced consumer choice, according to the two people familiar with the administration’s plan,” according to the Times.

The stricter tailpipe emission standards announced by the Biden Administration last year are a prime example of how limiting greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to address the climate crisis has an immediate effect on local air quality, as well. The rule introduced progressive reductions of both carbon and nitrogen oxides emissions from all vehicle classes, which would significantly increase the number of electric vehicles on American roads, as well as significantly reduce emissions from new vehicles that continue to run on fossil fuels.

Black Communities Already Breathe Dirtier Air

Nitrogen oxides contribute to smog, which presents a host of public health issues that are felt most strongly in communities that are disproportionately exposed – which tend to be Black and Brown neighborhoods.

Cutting greenhouse gas emissions alone also reduces other toxic emissions from vehicles, like fine particulate matter pollution, which exacerbates asthma and other respiratory diseases, which are also disproportionately prevalent in Black communities.

Cleaner Cars, Healthier Neighborhoods

The Biden EPA made the tailpipe standards technology-neutral, leaving it up to auto companies to decide how to reduce emissions — but the government estimated that by 2032 the new standards would lead to a majority of new passenger cars and light trucks being all-electric or hybrid models. Even if the goal of the standards was solely to reduce carbon emissions and not nitrogen oxides too, all those new zero- to low-emission vehicles would have the immediate effect of making the air cleaner, particularly for Black communities.

The Impact on Black America

Conversely, doing away with tailpipe standards will increase carbon emissions, nitrogen oxides emissions, and a host of other toxic emissions associated with burning fossil fuels — and that will have an outsized immediate and long-term effect on Black communities, both in terms of reduced air quality and the worsening effects of climate change, including extreme weather events.",https://wordinblack.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-157313230.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:14:58.619665

This trend has been further compounded by rising investments in advanced infrastructure such as healthcare facilities, data centers, and emergency response systems, all of which rely heavily on backup power solutions like gensets.

MARKET DRIVERS

Increasing Frequency of Climate-Induced Power Disruptions

The escalating frequency of climate-induced power disruptions is likely to degrade the growth of the North America genset market. As global temperatures rise, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, wildfires, winter storms, and flooding have become more intense and frequent. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. faced 28 weather-related disasters in 2023, each causing damages exceeding $1 billion an increase from the annual average of 18 such events recorded between 2018 and 2022. These events often lead to prolonged grid outages, compelling households, businesses, and municipalities to invest in gensets for uninterrupted power supply. For instance, Texas, one of the most affected states in terms of winter storm-related blackouts, saw a 42% year-over-year surge in residential genset purchases following the 2021 deep freeze, as reported by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). Similarly, California’s wildfire seasons have led to widespread Public Safety Power Shutoffs (PSPS) by utility companies, prompting both homeowners and small businesses to adopt backup power systems. This shift reflects a growing consumer preference for resilience against unpredictable energy availability. Industrial and institutional users in healthcare and logistics, have also ramped up genset installations to comply with federal regulations requiring continuous power for life-support systems and cold-chain storage, especially post-pandemic.

Growth in Data Centers and Infrastructure Development

The rapid expansion of data centers and infrastructure development in the U.S is additionally to promote the growth of the North America genset market. According to Synergy Research Group, the U.S. accounted for nearly 40% of global hyperscale data center capacity in 2023, hosting over 700 large-scale facilities operated by tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The Uptime Institute reports that even a single hour of downtime in a Tier IV data center can cost operators upwards of $1 million. To mitigate this risk, major cloud service providers are investing heavily in redundant power architectures, including multiple genset units capable of providing full-site backup within seconds of a grid failure. Additionally, government initiatives aimed at modernizing infrastructure, including hospitals, airports, and emergency services, are reinforcing genset demand. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) mandates that all Level I trauma centers maintain on-site backup power capable of supporting full operations for at least 96 hours.

MAKET RESTRAINTS

Stringent Emission Regulations and Environmental Compliance Costs

The imposition of increasingly stringent emission regulations by environmental authorities is limiting the growth of the North America genset market. In the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces strict standards under the Clean Air Act, particularly targeting nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted by internal combustion engines used in gensets. As per data from the EPA, compliance with Tier 4 standards has raised the average cost of diesel gensets by approximately 15–20%, making them less attractive to price-sensitive customers. Additionally, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), known for having the most rigorous air quality rules in the country, mandates ultra-low NOx levels for stationary engines operating in non-attainment zones. These restrictions have limited the use of traditional diesel-fueled gensets, pushing buyers toward alternative technologies such as battery storage or hydrogen-based power systems, which are still in early adoption phases. Moreover, the push toward decarbonization under federal policies like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has incentivized cleaner energy sources, indirectly discouraging diesel genset usage.

Rising Adoption of Renewable and Alternative Energy Systems

The growing adoption of renewable and alternative energy systems, which are increasingly being used as substitutes for conventional gensets is another attribute impeding the growth of the North America genset market. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, wind turbines, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) are gaining traction as viable options for backup and off-grid power generation. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, distributed solar installations grew by 32% in 2023 compared to the previous year, with over 17 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity added nationwide.

The decline in battery storage costs has further accelerated this shift. BloombergNEF reports that lithium-ion battery prices fell by 89% between 2010 and 2023, reaching an average of $151 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), making BESS an economically feasible option for short-term backup power. In California, where rolling blackouts have become common, many residential and commercial consumers are opting for hybrid solar-plus-storage systems instead of traditional diesel gensets. Additionally, corporate sustainability commitments and investor pressure are steering businesses away from fossil fuel-based power solutions. Major corporations like Apple, Walmart, and Google have pledged net-zero emissions by 2030 or earlier, favoring green alternatives over diesel generators.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Expansion of Microgrid and Off-Grid Power Solutions

The growing development and deployment of microgrid and off-grid power systems is setting up new opportunities for the growth of the North America genset market. As centralized power grids face increasing strain from aging infrastructure and rising demand, decentralized energy solutions are gaining prominence across various sectors.

Microgrid is localized energy networks that can operate independently or in conjunction with the main grid are increasingly integrating gensets as part of their hybrid power architecture. These systems combine renewable energy sources like solar and wind with battery storage and gensets to ensure reliability and stability. According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, microgrids incorporating gensets provide a balanced solution for mission-critical applications in military bases, universities, hospitals, and remote communities where grid access is limited or unreliable.

For example, the Alaska Center for Energy and Power has implemented numerous microgrid projects using diesel and natural gas gensets in combination with wind turbines and batteries to support remote villages disconnected from the main grid. Similarly, in the wake of increasing cyberattacks on national power infrastructure, federal agencies such as the Department of Defense are investing in resilient microgrids equipped with gensets to ensure continuous operation of defense installations.

Integration of Hybrid and Dual-Fuel Gensets

The increasing adoption of hybrid and dual-fuel gensets, which offer enhanced efficiency, lower emissions, and greater fuel flexibility is also to escalate the growth of the North America genset market. Unlike conventional diesel-only systems, dual-fuel gensets can operate on a combination of diesel and natural gas, reducing dependency on liquid fuels and lowering overall carbon footprint. According to the Gas Technology Institute, dual-fuel gensets can achieve up to a 40% reduction in diesel consumption while maintaining equivalent power output.

Natural gas availability through pipeline infrastructure in the U.S. and Canada provides a stable and cost-effective alternative to diesel, especially in urban and semi-urban areas. The American Clean Power Association reports that natural gas prices in North America remained relatively low in 2023, averaging $2.70 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), making dual-fuel systems more economical than ever before.

In contrast, Europe – where total ownership of air conditioning units is relatively low, at 20% – sees more equitable distribution across income levels.
Users can also significantly reduce energy consumption by making the temperature setpoints on their air conditioners slightly higher, or by using fans in conjunction with air conditioning.
Keeping cool entails more than just installing air conditioning.
How we design our buildings and plan our cities can significantly impact the magnitude of cooling demand.","Around the world, demand for cooling is increasing quickly as temperatures, populations and incomes rise. In 2024, global average temperatures reached 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels for the first time, intensifying the frequency and severity of extreme weather events such as heat waves. At the same time, economic development is reshaping access to air conditioning in many countries – especially in emerging and developing economies, where more than 80% of projected electricity demand for cooling by 2050 is expected to occur.

Currently, about 3.5 billion people live in regions with high temperatures, yet only about 15% of them own an air conditioner. But that is set to change in the years ahead. Across Southeast Asia, for example, the stock of air conditioners is set to increase ninefold between 2020 and 2040 based on today’s policy settings. In Indonesia specifically, the share of the population that owns an air conditioning unit is expected to rise from 14% in 2023 to 85% by 2050, driven in large part by an improvement in living standards.

Expanding access to cooling stands to improve the quality of life of millions of people. It would also save lives. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), almost half a million deaths per year globally are related to heat. While extreme heat is not a new concern in many emerging and developing economies, the challenge is becoming more urgent. Meanwhile, recent heatwaves have pushed temperatures to almost 39 °C in Paris, 37 °C in New York City and 37 °C in Seoul, and last month was the warmest June on record in Western Europe – showing that even traditionally temperate regions are increasingly affected.

While demand for air conditioning is growing rapidly, access to cooling equipment is still highly unequal, especially across income brackets. In a region that covers East Asia and the Pacific, for instance, only about 25% of low-income households own an air conditioning unit, compared with over 75% of the richest households. In sub-Saharan Africa, despite high cooling needs, use of air conditioners outside the wealthiest quintile is extremely limited, in part due to a lack of access to electricity. In contrast, Europe – where total ownership of air conditioning units is relatively low, at 20% – sees more equitable distribution across income levels.

Space cooling is now the fastest growing source of energy demand from the buildings sector, rising by almost 4% annually to 2035 under today’s policy settings IEA’s STEPS scenario. Most of this growth is set to occur in emerging and developing economies.

While the increased penetration of air conditioning units is helping households cope with heat, it also brings with it a series of challenges for the energy system – most notably an increase in peak demand, both during the day and in the evening. During the early summer heat waves of 2025, France – where air conditioning ownership is low – recorded an evening electricity peak that was 25% above the off-season average. In New York, where air conditioning ownership is high, it was 90% higher.

These cooling-driven peaks can put electricity affordability and reliability at risk, especially if efficient technologies are not in place to dampen the effects on energy systems.

IEA analysis finds that in India, each 1 °C increase in outdoor temperature in 2024 was associated with a 7 gigawatt (GW) increase in peak electricity demand. This represented a strong increase over the previous five years, and it could further rise to 12 GW per degree in 2030 without further efficiency action. If India were to experience similar heatwaves as in recent years – with temperature anomalies of over 4 °C – the additional peak load would amount to 47 GW, putting substantive pressure on grids and electricity production. However, if all new air conditioners sold in India between now and 2030 were highly efficient, the increase in peak load could be 20% lower.

As households seek effective cooling solutions and policy makers look to address the impacts on electricity grids, improving the efficiency of air conditioning units can serve as a key short-term approach.

Globally, the average new air conditioner sold is only about half as efficient as the best models available. But more efficient equipment does not have to cost more. IEA analysis across Southeast Asia and Latin America shows that for the same amount of money, consumers can purchase air conditioners with efficiency levels ranging from 3 watts per watt (W/W) to more than 6 W/W. That is twice the level of efficiency for the same upfront cost.

Promoting the purchase of high-efficiency units would not only reduce the strain on electricity systems but also would produce cost savings for consumers. At the IEA’s 10th Annual Global Conference on Energy Efficiency, ministers from nearly 50 countries agreed to work collectively towards boosting the uptake of energy-efficient appliances such air conditioners in order to improve the affordability of energy.

Even so, the efficiency of the equipment is only part of the solution. Users can also significantly reduce energy consumption by making the temperature setpoints on their air conditioners slightly higher, or by using fans in conjunction with air conditioning. These options do not require compromises on thermal comfort and can result in much lower electricity costs.

In a study on thermal comfort in Singapore, participants reported feeling equally or more comfortable when air conditioners were set to a higher temperature and used in combination with a fan. This approach uses much less energy: an air conditioner of average efficiency set to 26 °C in a well-insulated building in Singapore consumes about 30% less energy than one set to 24 °C. And adding a fan consumes a negligible amount of additional energy compared with lowering the temperate setpoint by two degrees.

Keeping cool entails more than just installing air conditioning. How we design our buildings and plan our cities can significantly impact the magnitude of cooling demand.

At the building level, measures like proper insulation and exterior shading can cut a building’s cooling demand by up to 80%, while passive cooling techniques like natural ventilation can offer quick relief, lowering indoor temperatures by up to 9 °C.

As extreme heat becomes more common, rethinking the design of cities is just as important. During a recent heatwave in Paris, for example, nighttime temperatures in an inner-city park were up to 7 °C cooler than in nearby built-up areas. Integrating more green spaces – such as parks and trees – into urban planning can significantly reduce heat island effects and help cities cool down more effectively overnight.

Policy makers must now account for higher cooling demand by adopting a broad, long-term approach that includes both addressing equipment efficiency and integrating cooling considerations into building and urban design.",https://iea.org/assets/front/images/iea_open_graph.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:13:13.210665

The journey of the 45V tax credit has been marked by significant shifts since its inception in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of August 2022. Initially offering up to US$3 per kilogram for clean hydrogen production, the credit promised to revolutionise the industry by incentivising projects with lifecycle emissions below 4kg CO2 per kg of hydrogen produced.

However, as Payal Kaur, hydrogen analyst with Bloomberg NEF, explained, December 2023 brought substantial changes with Treasury’s proposed regulations introducing the “three pillars”:

Incrementality: Power sources for electrolysers must be relatively new (operating no more than 36 months prior to the hydrogen facility’s placement in service)

Deliverability: Electricity must be generated in the same grid region as the hydrogen project

Temporal matching: Initially annual matching until 2028, later switching to hourly matching

The final rules released in January 2024 provided some flexibility, extending hourly matching to 2030 and creating exceptions for nuclear plants and states with robust greenhouse gas emission caps. However, the most significant change came between May and July 2024, when the timeline to qualify for 45V was dramatically shortened from 1 January 2033, to 1 January 2028—reducing the window by five years.

Winners and losers in the new landscape

The panel identified clear winners and losers emerging from these regulatory shifts.

“Blue hydrogen has come out of the changes somewhat unscathed, whereas green is the one that’s really taken the brunt of the impact,” noted Kaur. This assessment is reflected in market data showing over 80% of signed offtake agreements in the US are for blue hydrogen or blue ammonia.

Michael Sykes, tax partner at White and Case, identified the biggest winners as “those who already knew that their projects qualified and could fit into one of these pathways.” Meanwhile, projects requiring provisional emission rates face significant uncertainty.

For electrolyser manufacturers, the outlook is particularly challenging. “There’s a lot more electrolyzing manufactured capacity than there is demand for it,” Kaur explained, noting that dampened sentiment for green hydrogen in the US will further strain this market segment.

The global shift

Perhaps most concerning for US competitiveness is the international investment exodus described by Roxana Bekemohammadi, founder of the US Hydrogen Alliance.

“All those investors that came to our doors several years ago to build here are gone. They’re in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and sometimes Africa,” she observed. “We have completely lost our upper hand, and this will become a national security issue unless we change our actions.”

This shift is evident in Bloomberg NEF’s data showing only 19% of global clean hydrogen offtake agreements originate from the US, with the remainder coming from Europe, the Middle East and Asia.

Building a path forward

Despite these challenges, the panelists outlined strategic approaches for industry resilience. Bekemohammadi emphasised state-level action: “The hydrogen economy that exists in the US today was state-enabled. In order to build, you must do that locally.”

She advocated for a dual approach of mandates to create marketplaces and incentives to support technology deployment.

For project developers, Sykes recommended working backward from verification requirements: “Understand what is technically required for you to file for, claim and actually monetise the tax credits.”

This includes identifying who will verify emissions rates and determining if projects fit within established pathways.

Jason Munster, who moderated the panel and previously led the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) commercial analysis for 45V recommendations to Treasury, noted that projects with multiple revenue streams may have advantages. “If hydrogen is a byproduct or secondary revenue stream from what they’re already doing,” these projects can “test the water” while maintaining financial viability.

The critical window

The industry now faces what Bekemohammadi called “make or break” time—approximately 2.5 years to establish viable projects before the construction deadline.

“This opportunity is one that we must learn from,” she urged. “The mentality that they’ve had to build the hydrogen economy to date is not the same paradigm that’s going to build the hydrogen economy of our future.”

This sentiment was echoed by Sykes, who noted that the shortened timeline “creates an urgency” that has been “encouraging because there has been quite a bit of it.”

Looking ahead

As the industry adapts to these new realities, several key factors will determine success:

State-level initiatives that create markets through both mandates and incentives

Strategic focus on applications where hydrogen has clear advantages over electrification

Building redundancy into political strategies rather than relying on single policies

Collaboration across industry segments to create demand and political support

While the shortened timeline for 45V presents significant challenges, the panelists maintained that hydrogen remains essential to America’s energy transition.

Conagra expects that the fuel cell systems at its Ohio plants will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 19% according to 2022 e-grid data.","For U.S. manufacturers, access to reliable and high-quality power is becoming increasingly challenging. Whether expanding operations, modernizing facilities or bringing new capacity online, companies must overcome a tight power supply, escalating power costs and a traditional utility infrastructure that can’t keep pace with today’s energy demands.

Amid the search for cleaner, more resilient solutions, fuel cells are gaining traction as a primary power source for mission-critical manufacturing operations. Yet outdated assumptions persist. Some still believe fuel cells are too small, too expensive or too unreliable to meet the demands of modern manufacturing.

The reality? Leading manufacturers are already proving those myths wrong.

Myth #1: Fuel cells can’t support manufacturing loads

This may have been true once, but today, fuel cells are reliably providing large-scale primary power for manufacturing facilities. The core building block of modern fuel cell systems, such as those offered by Bloom Energy, is a small module that can be scaled to generate tens of megawatts — enough to meet the energy demands of even the most power-intensive manufacturers, such as those in the steel or semiconductor industries.

Bloom Energy fuel cells generate approximately 6 MW of electricity for two of Conagra’s Ohio production facilities. This is around 75% of the plants’ annual demand to produce billions of Slim Jim’s meat sticks and canned goods for the company’s Hunt’s, Manwich and Libby’s brands.

Myth #2: Fuel cells aren’t reliable enough to serve as primary power

With modular designs, fuel cells offer a scalable path to reliable power — especially in locations where the grid can’t move fast enough.

“The trajectory of U.S. power consumption has changed dramatically in recent years, with the explosion of AI data centers and the fact that we’re using a lot more electricity on a daily basis,” said Adam Colling, head of commercial and industrial sales at Bloom Energy. “Unfortunately, utility infrastructure investments have not kept pace with demand, so companies that are looking to expand or bring manufacturing onshore are facing multi-year power delivery delays.”

An onsite, islanded fuel cell system that operates independently from the grid can be up and running in as little as four months, delivering up to five nines (99.999%) of uptime reliability, significantly reducing time to power and enabling manufacturers to take control of their energy future.

Under pressure to meet growing customer demand, Quanta Computer, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, opted to install a fully islanded solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-powered microgrid at its Freemont, CA, plant, bypassing a years-long utility interconnection queue. The microgrid powers operations 24/7, enabling the production of critical hardware serving the AI industry. The power solution will also scale with the plant — the company recently announced it would be expanding its SOFC installation by 150%.

Myth #3: Fuel cells only run on hydrogen

The hydrogen fuel cells that power electric vehicles, including forklifts and other material-handling equipment, garner considerable attention. However, most manufacturing-based fuel cell deployments are powered by natural gas. These systems are fuel-flexible and can easily be converted to run on biogas, hydrogen or blended fuels as these alternatives become more widely available. This enables manufacturers to meet today’s needs while also preparing for the future.

Myth #4: Fuel cells that run on natural gas are not sustainable

Because they do not burn fuel to generate electricity, fuel cells don’t produce harmful air pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) or sulfur dioxide (SO2), even when operating on natural gas. Conagra expects that the fuel cell systems at its Ohio plants will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 19% according to 2022 e-grid data. Additionally, unlike thermal power plants, fuel cells do not require additional water during normal operation, enhancing their environmental metrics.

Myth #5: Fuel cells are too expensive

Ten to fifteen years ago, fuel cells were viewed as a more expensive niche solution, particularly where high-quality power was required. This sentiment is outdated as fuel cells are now cost-effective over the long term, according to Colling. “Fuel cell prices have come down significantly in recent years, but utility electricity rates have gone up substantially, such that there’s now a very wide gap between the price per kilowatt hour that fuel cells can deliver versus utility prices,” Colling said.

With electrical efficiencies of up to 65%, and greater than 90% when integrated with combined heat and power (CHP) configurations, fuel cells require less fuel to generate each kilowatt-hour of electricity. Additionally, working with partners like Bloom Energy reduces exposure to fuel price volatility and provides manufacturers with access to highly reliable energy at predictable prices.

They also have low maintenance requirements, further reducing operational costs. Finally, high uptime rates minimize costly production shutdowns.

“Manufacturers are realizing that fuel cells are a viable option for onsite power that’s more cost-effective, more reliable and has a better environmental scorecard than traditional grid power,” Colling said.

Myth #6: Fuel cells can’t handle flexible loads

Modern fuel cell systems, such as Bloom Energy’s Energy Server®, feature load-following technology that ramps power output up or down as energy needs fluctuate, without sacrificing performance. This makes fuel cells an ideal solution for powering dynamic and automated manufacturing processes.

“Customer loads are connected directly to the fuel cell, which operates together with the system’s Ultra Capacitor to produce the exact amount of power the loads are calling for,” Colling explained.

Conclusion: Fuel cells are a reliable, cost-effective and sustainable solution for manufacturers

Fuel cells are no longer a niche solution — they are a proven, flexible and sustainable option for manufacturers seeking energy security and emissions reductions.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/RYqFt82NAUMN5ASDtqTgUyhpjp-4hDPBmb-xv21eIw8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTg5NjM4NTEyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-28 11:04:03.595108

LONDON, July 28, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- RheEnergise, a pioneering energy storage company, today announced the launch of its North American fundraising campaign on Republic, a leading platform for private investing. The campaign offers individual investors the opportunity to benefit from the company's growth as it scales deployment of its proprietary High-Density Hydro® energy storage systems across the United States and Canada.

The missing, vital piece of the energy system puzzle: RheEnergise's High-Density Hydro, an economical, long-duration energy storage solution, which stores abundant, ultra-low-cost daytime energy and releases it back to consumers when demand and prices rise. HD Hydro delivers affordable energy during mornings and evenings when it's needed most. The solution offers multiple benefits: it keeps energy prices low, delivers attractive returns for project owners, supports grid reliability, and accelerates the clean energy transition — making clean, affordable energy widely available.

""Our High-Density Hydro technology is a game-changer,"" said Stephen Crosher, CEO of RheEnergise. ""It delivers the scale and flexibility the market desperately needs—between 20 and 100 megawatts per project, with up to 20 hours of storage. A typical 40 megawatt, 10 hour project would provide 32,000 typical US homes constantly for around 10 hours. With round-trip efficiencies exceeding 80%, it's probably the most effective, scalable solution on the market. This fundraising campaign allows us to bring together many more everyday investors alongside the 4,000 from Europe, on our mission to revolutionize energy across North America.""

Unlike conventional pumped hydro, RheEnergise's technology uses a proprietary fluid 2.5x denser than water, enabling projects to be built on small hills rather than mountains and closer to where energy is needed. This creates broader site availability and lower costs, making the technology well suited for both urban and remote applications.

The opportunities for HD Hydro are vast. Here are three example states:

California: ~21,000 potential sites.

New York: ~6,500 potential sites.

Texas: ~6,250 potential sites.

Just 500 projects in any state would provide ~250GWh of long-duration energy storage. To put this into perspective that is more than enough to power the entirety of New York City for the day.

Funds raised through Republic will help accelerate RheEnergise's expansion in North America, including project development, technology deployment, and strategic partnerships.

""This is a pivotal moment,"" added Crosher. ""With the demand for energy, grid pressures mounting and renewable adoption continuing to increase, North America needs scalable, proven, long-duration storage solutions. RheEnergise is here to meet that need.""

The data center also uses natural gas turbines, which have added pollutants to the air, he said.
“Data centers use so much electric power that it is forcing other consumers to pick up the bill,” he said.
Although many of the data center regulation changes proposed in the action plan are federal, the plan also noted that the Federal Communications Commission will evaluate how state policies are impacting AI development.
Data centers are already operating in West Virginia, King said, in places where there has been historic pollution.","The Trump administration recently released America’s AI Action Plan, a document that outlines how and why the government plans to support the growth of artificial intelligence in the United States.

“Whoever has the largest AI ecosystem will set global AI standards and reap broad economic and military benefits,” according to the plan. “Just like we won the space race, it is imperative that the United States and its allies win this race.”

The plan mentions the benefits AI could bring the country and the world, including innovations in medicine, chemistry, energy development, and education.

To make America the world’s AI development hub, the Trump administration “will continue to reject radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape,” according to the plan, and it directs federal agencies to seek information from businesses and citizens, and to search themselves, for federal regulations they think are a hindrance to AI development.

Critics of the plan, including some members of Congress, are concerned that the push will come at the expense of the environment and public health because of the vast network of data centers needed to develop the emerging technology.

Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., held a webinar Wednesday to discuss some of these concerns and to share a story map that told the stories of Americans who say they have already been negatively impacted by these large data centers.

“When it comes to keeping communities and our environment safe it’s actually an AI ‘in-action’ plan,” said Markey, with “no environmental reviews of data centers, no protections from the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, or even the Superfund Act to keep communities safe from potential harm.

“This AI in-action plan wants to create loopholes so big in our federal environmental laws that you could actually build a hyper-scale data center inside of them.”

Concerns over the data centers, which generate energy to run AI platforms and tools, such as ChatGPT, X’s Grok, and Google’s AI search engine summaries, range from their high energy usage to the water and air pollution they may cause.

Rep. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., noted a data center in his district in Memphis, operated by one of Elon Musk’s companies, uses millions of gallons of water for cooling and hundreds of megawatts of energy each year. The data center also uses natural gas turbines, which have added pollutants to the air, he said.

Although there have been some benefits from the data center, including job creation and a gray water project, Cohen said he questions whether those offsets are really enough.

“We’ve got to be leery of the future but welcoming at the same time,” he said.

Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, said as the demand for energy goes up, the cost to other consumers increases with it.

“Data centers use so much electric power that it is forcing other consumers to pick up the bill,” he said. “So, big tech and private equity data centers that are running the supercomputers for generative AI and other purposes are not paying their fair share.”

Markey noted that with President Trump’s rollbacks on green energy policies, fossil fuel burning power plants will likely be employed to fulfill the country’s growing energy needs.

Alongside energy usage, water usage at data centers is also increasing, according to Julie Bolthouse, director of land use for the Piedmont Environmental Council, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group in Virginia.

The increased demand will mean more draws on groundwater and the need to increase the capacity of water infrastructure, Bolthouse said, and the resource is already precarious in many places.

Although many of the data center regulation changes proposed in the action plan are federal, the plan also noted that the Federal Communications Commission will evaluate how state policies are impacting AI development.

In Rhode Island, a bill was introduced in the General Assembly this year that would have created tax and regulatory incentives for data centers, but it didn’t make it out of committee.

“These proposals for data centers are coming to places, especially where they haven’t been before, and especially in places that are disproportionately affected by environmental injustices,” said Morgan King, the climate and energy manager with the West Virginia Citizens Action Group.

Data centers are already operating in West Virginia, King said, in places where there has been historic pollution.

“More than ever,” she said, “organizers across the country and local communities need resources and support to be able to fight these centers on the ground, and to be able to advocate for stronger protections and policies.”",http://ecori.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-23-at-12.10.19-PM-1024x580.png,N,,2025-07-28 11:04:08.557291

But Bezos-backed Slate Auto thinks it’s genius, especially with that $7,500 tax credit vanishing soon.

Slate Auto, a Michigan-based startup backed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is introducing a minimalist electric pickup truck priced under $20,000, but the impending expiration of a $7,500 federal tax credit poses a significant hurdle for potential buyers, reports Reuters. This development highlights the challenges in the U.S. EV market, where cooling sales and rising costs test new entrants’ strategies for affordability.

Minimalist Design Targets Cost Savings

Slate Auto simplifies its two-seat pickup, which measures slightly smaller than a Honda Civic hatchback, by using about 500 parts in assembly—far fewer than the thousands in traditional trucks. The company employs composite body panels in gray, with an optional vinyl wrap, eliminating the need for an expensive paint shop. This approach allows Slate to produce all trucks in a basic package, dubbed a “SKU of one,” where customers can add features like a stereo, center console, or special lighting later. Executives aim to hold down costs through this modular system, enabling the startup to absorb the tax credit loss and still undercut competitors, as Barman explained.

The design draws from an idea by Miles Arnone, CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing, who sought better access to affordable vehicles for workers. A team formed, including Chairman Jeff Wilke, a former Amazon executive, and hired CEO Chris Barman, previously an engineering executive at Fiat Chrysler.

Barman reportedly stated at a Detroit conference in July: “We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never delivered.”

Challenges in a Cooling EV Market

U.S. EV sales growth has slowed as consumer interest wanes, compounded by the high cost of batteries that hinders profitability for most players. Even in China, where smaller EVs thrive with cost advantages, many companies remain unprofitable. Slate enters this landscape with over 100,000 reservations and $700 million raised, yet faces a long path to viability. The average new-vehicle price exceeds $45,000, creating an opportunity for Slate’s sub-$20,000 offering, especially as Tesla has shelved plans for a mid-$20,000s EV.

The loss of the federal tax credit, set to expire on September 30 following a budget package signed by President Donald Trump, could dampen demand further. Auto executives and analysts predict this will hurt EV adoption. Potential tariffs under the Trump administration threaten to raise prices on imported budget cars from Mexico and Korea, potentially worsening affordability issues for many Americans.

Consumer Appeal and Industry Reactions

Slate bets on a shift toward no-frills vehicles, particularly among younger drivers. This raises questions about whether U.S. buyers, who last year spent 33% above base prices on average for higher-end features—up from 28% in 2014—will embrace crank windows and optional stereos. Evidence suggests new cars are increasingly out of reach, fostering appetite for modular, honest designs.

Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific, noted: “There’s a growing appetite, especially among younger drivers, for vehicles that are more honest, more modular and less over-engineered. Slate taps right into that.”

Industry leaders echo intrigue. Ford CEO Jim Farley and Executive Chair Bill Ford admired Slate’s customer-centered ethos and affordability in a May town hall.

Stellantis’ Tim Kuniskis, head of American brands, called it “super interesting” at a June event, adding: “The idea behind it, we’ve talked about that idea a million times. It’s a cool idea.” Yet Kuniskis questioned final costs once options are added.

Slate plans production at a former catalog factory in Warsaw, Indiana, with launches expected late next year. Startups like California-based Telo also pursue smaller electric pickups, contrasting larger models from traditional automakers that have seen mixed success. This trend underscores a pivot toward compact, efficient EVs amid economic pressures.

Slate’s strategy tests the market’s readiness for stripped-down electrics, balancing innovation with real-world barriers like regulatory changes and consumer habits. As EV adoption evolves, such ventures could redefine accessibility in transportation.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/img_7573-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:15:22.692238

The report, from Americans for a Clean Energy Grid and focused on the need for transmission to meet demand growth, is titled “Fewer new miles: Strategic industries held back by slow pace of transmission.”

The annual benchmark of at least 5,000 miles of new high-capacity transmission is based on the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2024 National Transmission Planning Study. The study compared how the optimal electricity system, which would be a high-renewables grid given the low cost of renewables, might evolve with different constraints and opportunities for transmission.

Under the study’s most conservative scenario, DOE’s findings “imply the need” to build about 5,000 miles per year of high-capacity transmission within grid regions, along with more interregional transmission, the report says.

Solar benefits

With increased transmission capacity, solar and storage projects located near new or upgraded transmission lines can more easily interconnect to the grid.

One interregional project completed last year, a 125-mile, 500 kV line connecting a substation in Arizona with one in California, will likely transmit solar power because the report says it will support “anticipated growth in new generation in the desert Southwest.”

Gearing up

The United States added nearly 4,000 miles of high-voltage transmission in 2013, the report said, but since then, “development has slowed to a trickle.”

Even so, the expertise and capacity to build new high-voltage lines “still exists, and the success of 2013 shows that it can be done again with the right policies and commitments in place.”

Achieving the transmission growth needed will require “proactive, multi-value” transmission planning, which is now required under Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 1920.

Transmission providers have received extensions on their deadlines to comply with Order 1920. But four transmission providers have made progress in the interim, making tens of billions of dollars of transmission investment decisions in 2024:

$21.8 billion by mid-continent grid operator MISO

$13 billion by Texas grid operator ERCOT

$7 billion by central U.S. grid operator SPP

$6 billion by California grid operator CAISO.

The report suggested a “lesson” for high-voltage transmission, saying that “natural gas pipelines get built under strong FERC permitting authority” because under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has the authority to site interstate pipelines.

As for transmission between regions, the report notes that a study last year by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation projected that 35 GW of interregional transfer capacity “may be needed by 2033 to maintain reliability.”

Reconductoring

“There are many miles” of transmission that are reconductored in the United States every year, said a spokesperson for Americans for a Clean Energy Grid, but data on reconductoring was not readily available to include in the report.

Dave Bryant, director of technology for CTC Global Corporation, which manufactures advanced conductors used for reconductoring, said the company received about 40 orders for its conductors for projects in the United States in 2023 and 2024.",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/New-transmission-lines-in-2024.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:16:02.158268

Hybrid sales, however, grew by 36%, continuing the strong growth seen in recent years and reaching a market share of 13%.","The global battle for rare earth elements and how companies can respond

Rare earth elements (REEs) are vital to modern technology, playing a key role in battery electric vehicles, smartphones, and various military technologies. Despite being termed ""rare,"" these elements are relatively abundant, being three times more common in the Earth's crust than copper and 200 times more than platinum or gold. However, REEs occur in low concentrations, making extraction and refining challenging and raising environmental and sustainability concerns.

A significant issue with REEs is their limited geographic distribution. While many countries have sparse or nonexistent reserves, nearly half (48%) of the global REE reserves are in China, which also accounts for over two-thirds (69%) of global production. This concentration creates a geopolitical risk as REE-rich countries can leverage their resources in trade negotiations.

Amid rising trade tensions, REEs and other critical raw materials have become strategic assets for certain nations. To mitigate these risks and diversify their supply chains, countries and companies should consider the following strategies:

France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK

In the top five European markets, BEV sales rebounded in the first half of 2025 following a slight decline in 2024.

Germany's BEV market, which faced challenges last year due to the withdrawal of incentives, has shown significant recovery, achieving the highest unit sales in Europe during this period with 249,000 units sold. This surpasses the UK market, which also grew 35% year-over-year in the first half of 2025. However, France saw a 6% decline in sales year-over-year, although this is better than the overall market decline of 8%.

Spain recorded the most substantial growth among the top five European markets, increasing by 84% year-over-year in the first six months of 2025. Although starting from a low base, Spain's BEV market share is beginning to outpace Italy, where market trends have traditionally been similar.

Other European markets

Denmark led the way in BEV growth among other European countries, with a 47% increase in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. Norway's BEV market also experienced strong growth, rising 36% to achieve an impressive market share of 94%.

China

BEV sales exceeded two million units in the second quarter of 2025, marking a 42% increase compared to the same period last year. This surge in BEV sales has impacted the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) and hybrid markets, which grew at a more modest rate of 6% year-over-year in Q2. Consequently, BEVs now hold a market share of nearly one-third (32%) in China.

The Japanese EV market is still dominated by hybrids, which accounted for a market share of 59% in Q2 2025. Nonetheless, both the BEV and PHEV markets are beginning to show growth, although from a low base.

South Korea

BEV sales increased by 41% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, raising the BEV market share to 13%. With hybrids continuing to dominate, the combined EV market share is nearing 50% for the first time.

BEV sales declined by 3% in the second quarter of 2025 compared with the same quarter last year, marking the first year-over-year quarterly drop since the COVID-affected 2020.

Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) sales fell by 4%, marking the fourth consecutive quarterly year-over-year decline. This trend partly stems from some popular PHEV models becoming disqualified for tax credits due to battery sourcing requirements.

Hybrid sales, however, grew by 36%, continuing the strong growth seen in recent years and reaching a market share of 13%.

They are designed to handle larger payloads and have an extended reach, making them ideal for integrating with larger injection moulding machines.
Instead, the manufacturer opted for Shibaura Machine’s all-electric injection moulding machines supplied by TM Robotics.
These benefits, along with flexible clamping force and faster production, have led Lotan to invest in more Shibaura injection moulding machines — specifically the SXIII range.","McKinsey & Company forecasts a significant rise in global chemical production driven by expanding capacity in regions with cost-competitive feedstocks such as the United States and the Middle East — intensifying pressure on European producers. These trends will also influence the UK plastics sector, where manufacturers must adopt new technologies to meet sustainability goals and improve their bottom line. Here Nigel Smith, CEO of Shibaura Machine’s UK and Ireland partner and distributor TM Robotics, explains how industrial robots and all-electric injection moulding machines can help companies more than halve their energy consumption, while enhancing productivity.

“The chemical industry is involved in 96 per cent of all manufactured goods,” according to Deloitte’s 2025 Chemical Industry Outlook — but the same result also highlights the need for the industry to bolster its sustainability investments. Sustainability will become more imperative as the chemical industry continues to expand. Aside from the aforementioned growth in the US and Middle East, in The state of the chemicals industry, McKinsey reports that China is expected to add more than 20 million tons of annual capacity in polyethylene within five years, by 2028.

Energy-efficient solutions are now critical for the plastics sector — especially in a time of increasing energy costs and sustainability pressures. However, traditional injection moulding methods are energy-intensive, especially those that rely on hydraulic-powered machines. These machines often continue to consume electricity even when they are not in active use, which results in inefficiency. Instead, all-electric injection moulding machines offer a significant improvement, using energy only when necessary and contributing to substantial reductions in electricity consumption.

Performance tests by Shibaura Machine found that switching to all-electric injection moulding machines — specifically the Shibaura Machine EC650SX-61B IMM with a clamping force of 650 tons — delivered a 51 per cent energy reduction versus using a hydraulic servo machine. These energy savings are especially important, as manufacturers strive to balance increased demand for plastics with the need to minimise their environmental footprint.

Enhanced productivity and sustainability

Robotics can also play a crucial role in amplifying the benefits of all-electric injection moulding machines. SCARA robots, known for their high-speed performance and repeatability, are ideal for applications across industries such as packaging, medical device manufacturing and automotive.

Robots like Shibaura Machine’s THE400 SCARA offer increased adaptability and improved throughput. They are designed to handle larger payloads and have an extended reach, making them ideal for integrating with larger injection moulding machines.

Another key development is the use of ceiling-mounted SCARA robots, which optimise available space in production environments. For instance, in a plastics factory, such a robot could swiftly pick and place newly moulded plastic parts from an injection moulding machine onto a conveyor, without taking up valuable floor space.

These robots can unload parts from moulding machines, while also providing additional functions such as inspection, assembly or packaging of the product — all while maintaining high-speed operation and precision. With automation becoming more affordable, manufacturers can not only reduce labour costs but also improve production efficiency, which makes these investments highly cost-effective.

Reduced running costs

Lotan, a UK-based manufacturer of plastic containers, had relied on hydraulic injection moulding machines, but found these to be too energy-intensive. Instead, the manufacturer opted for Shibaura Machine’s all-electric injection moulding machines supplied by TM Robotics. As a result, Lotan was able to cut its running costs by 20 to 40 per cent and shorten its cycle times by 35 per cent, with a lower cost-per-mould.

These benefits, along with flexible clamping force and faster production, have led Lotan to invest in more Shibaura injection moulding machines — specifically the SXIII range. As an all-electric machine, the SXIII helps reduce running costs and cycle times while maintaining precise clamping force control.

As highlighted in Deloitte’s 2025 Chemical Industry Outlook, the UK plastics sector must adopt energy-efficient solutions to stay competitive. The integration of all-electric injection moulding machines and industrial robots offers a practical path, reducing energy consumption, cutting costs and boosting productivity. These innovations not only support sustainability goals but also position manufacturers to thrive in a rapidly evolving market.",https://roboticstomorrow.com/images/facebooknews.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 11:03:06.419768

The latest wave of cancellations — affecting five battery, storage, and electric vehicle factories in Colorado, Indiana, Michigan, New York, and Oregon — follows growing uncertainty among businesses as Congress was making the final push to effectively end federal clean energy tax credits. More than 5,000 jobs were lost to the cancellations and scales backs in June, bringing the total number of jobs lost to abandoned projects in 2025 to 16,500.

Republican congressional districts are losing the most from the cancellations. More than $11.7 billion in investments and 11,700 jobs have been cancelled, delayed or closed in Republican districts so far in 2025. Over $6.1 billion and nearly 4,000 jobs have been lost in Democratic districts.

June’s cancellations were led by major automakers scaling back electric vehicle production investments. General Motors cancelled a $4.3 billion plan to expand its Orion plant in Michigan to build new electric pickups and instead shift its investments there to build 8-cylinder gas vehicles. Additionally, Toyota scaled back a $2.2 billion plan to retool a manufacturing plant in Indiana that was going to build a new three-row electric SUV, consolidating production to its Georgetown, Kentucky plant instead.

Following is a statement from MICHAEL TIMBERLAKE, E2 COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:

“These cancellations aren’t just numbers on a balance book. They’re jobs, paychecks, and opportunities in communities that were counting on these clean energy projects to drive economic growth. And now they’re gone.

“By effectively ending clean energy incentives, Congress is turning its back on thousands of American workers and dozens of communities that were ready to build our energy future and strengthen America’s competitiveness.""

Amid the cancellations and rising uncertainty, businesses in June announced more than $2.1 billion in investments for new hydrogen, EV, and grid and transmission equipment factories across five states — including a $1.8 billion investment by Element Resources to build North America’s largest hydrogen production facility in California. Separately, Howard Industries announced more than $236 million to expand its electrical and transmission manufacturing operations in Mississippi that is expected to create at least 450 permanent jobs.

Through June, 62 percent of all clean energy projects announced—along with 72 percent of all jobs and 81 percent of all investments —are in congressional districts represented by Republicans.

According to E2’s tracking, June’s announcements bring the overall number of major new clean energy projects announced since federal clean energy tax credits passed in August 2022 to 402 across 42 states and Puerto Rico. Companies have said they plan to invest more than $133 billion in these projects and hire 123,000 permanent workers. (These figures reflect ongoing revisions and updates).

Since federal clean energy tax credits were passed by Congress in August 2022, a total of 58 announced or operational projects have been cancelled, closed, or scaled back—35 in 2025 alone. More than 26,000 jobs and nearly $25 billion in investments were connected with the abandoned projects and facilities.

A full map and list of announcements is available at e2.org/announcements/. Cancellation data will be incorporated in the coming months.

Six coal plants are also exempt from the more stringent restrictions on emissions of mercury, nickel, arsenic, and lead set by the Biden administration, joining 66 other coal plants previously exempted.
In March, the EPA set up a portal allowing companies to request exemptions from nine Clean Air Act rules.
Other coal plants that received exemptions earlier are Montana’s Colstrip Generating Station, North Dakota’s Coal Creek Station, and the Oak Grove plant in Texas.
Equal treatment under the law requires that all companies operate under the same set of rules, not temporary carveouts granted through executive discretion.","The Trump administration is exempting over 100 chemical manufacturing plants, oil refineries, coal plants, medical device sterilizers, and other companies from Clean Air Act rules set by the Biden administration, recognizing that “overly restrictive environmental regulations undermine America’s energy reliability, economic vitality, and national security.” The Trump administration issued four proclamations exempting the facilities from one of four rules for two years. The plan is that by the time the two-year exemptions expire, the rules in question may be removed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). According to the White House, “The exemptions ensure that these facilities within these critical industries can continue to operate uninterrupted to support national security without incurring substantial costs to comply with, in some cases, unattainable compliance requirements.” Even the Biden administration had noted the disruption the rules would cause when it previously said it would consider exempting facilities from a rule to prevent disruptions to supply chains for medical devices.

Due to one of the proclamations, more than 50 chemical manufacturers and oil refineries are exempt from requirements to reduce emissions of certain chemicals, including ethylene oxide and chloroprene. Eight producers of taconite iron ore, used in making steel, are exempt from requirements to reduce mercury emissions by about 33%. These plants are needed in the production of semiconductors and energy. Six coal plants are also exempt from the more stringent restrictions on emissions of mercury, nickel, arsenic, and lead set by the Biden administration, joining 66 other coal plants previously exempted.

On May 7, 2024, Biden’s EPA published a final rule, titled National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants: Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units Review of the Residual Risk and Technology Review, which amended the preexisting Mercury and Air Toxics Standards rule set by the Obama administration to make it more stringent. The Biden rule’s compliance date is July 8, 2027, three years after the rule’s effective date of July 8, 2024. Because the rule requires compliance with standards based on emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form, President Trump issued the proclamation for coal plants that allows the exemptions.

In March, the EPA set up a portal allowing companies to request exemptions from nine Clean Air Act rules. Among those exempted are taconite iron ore plants in Minnesota owned by the United States Steel Corp. and six facilities owned by Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. in Minnesota and Michigan. Chemical makers, including Dow Inc. and BASF SE, and refiners such as Phillips 66 and Citgo Petroleum Corp., also received waivers from EPA regulations requiring emissions controls for certain facilities, allowing them to avoid massive capital investments for compliance or shutting down.

With the latest announcement, coal-fired power plants in Ohio, Illinois, and Colorado were exempted from Biden’s climate mandates limiting emissions of mercury. Other coal plants that received exemptions earlier are Montana’s Colstrip Generating Station, North Dakota’s Coal Creek Station, and the Oak Grove plant in Texas. The exemptions also apply to four plants operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation’s largest public utility. According to the EPA, the presidential exemptions “will bolster coal-fired electricity generation, ensuring that our nation’s grid is reliable, that electricity is affordable for the American people, and that EPA is helping to promote our nation’s energy security.”

President Trump issued executive orders to allow some older coal-fired power plants set for retirement to keep operating due to rising U.S. electricity demand from growth in data centers, artificial intelligence, and electric vehicles. Trump also directed his agencies to identify coal resources and prioritize coal leasing on federal lands, and to lift barriers to coal mining.

Analysis

Ideally, environmental regulations should not be subject to ad hoc exemptions on a firm-by-firm basis, as this undermines the rule of law and creates uncertainty for both industry and the public. Equal treatment under the law requires that all companies operate under the same set of rules, not temporary carveouts granted through executive discretion. Given that the current regulations are unworkable and reliant on nonexistent technologies, the EPA should move swiftly to revoke or revise them through proper administrative channels. Furthermore, Congress should act to codify a more balanced and technologically feasible standard, ensuring clarity, consistency, and long-term legal stability for energy producers and manufacturers alike.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bigstock-Oil-gas-refinery-plant-May-ca-468137539.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 11:04:18.577498

Cool factor: The projects are currently under construction and are expected to bring renewable energy to households across the five states. Once fully operational, the portfolio will deliver significant environmental and economic benefits to local communities, including clean energy to more than 11,000 households, and is expected to create 190 jobs in the communities where they are built.

This investment is part of a broader $2.5 billion tax equity joint venture between Greenprint Capital and funds managed by AB CarVal. NUPH is the long-term owner of the projects, responsible for overseeing construction, financing, maintaining long-term performance and acquiring and managing customer subscriptions through its proprietary community solar subscriber management and acquisition platform.

Xcel Energy announces portfolio of new power projects in Texas and New Mexico

Xcel Energy has announced new generation resource additions as part of an overall portfolio to meet the rising energy needs of its Texas and New Mexico service area. The portfolio includes extensions of 521 MW of existing generation and the addition of 17 new power projects that will add 5,168 MW of new capacity to the region’s generation fleet by 2030. Technologies selected include 3,200 MW of dispatchable generation and energy storage and 1,968 MW of wind and solar facilities.

“This portfolio is about more than just adding power. We are working to increase speed to market with a stronger, modern and more resilient energy system that our customers can count on,” said Adrian Rodriguez, president of Xcel Energy – Texas, New Mexico. “We’re investing in the right mix of resources to benefit customers by keeping electricity reliable and supporting economic growth so we can meet our region’s energy needs today and in the future.”

Cool factor: To help meet New Mexico’s 50% renewable energy requirement by 2030, two solar projects are included as additions to the portfolio and will be dedicated to New Mexico customers. The region’s electricity demand is expected to grow by more than 40% by 2030, driven by population growth, industrial expansion and increased electrification. New planning reserve margin requirements from the Southwest Power Pool further raise the bar, with utilities now required to have more capacity to meet increasing seasonal demand.

Xcel Energy will seek approval of the portfolio from state regulators in the second half of 2025. Encouraged by developer response to this recent solicitation and to increase speed to market for new customers and those seeking to expand their regional operations, the company plans to issue another all-source request for proposals to secure additional resources to be operational by 2032.

Louth Callan begins construction on 27 MW solar project in New Hampshire

Louth Callan Renewables (LCR) has commenced construction on a new 27 MW solar project in New Hampshire. The project was recently awarded to LCR as the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) partner.

Cool factor: Site mobilization began in mid-July, with civil work being completed and underway with Brooks Construction. Full commissioning is expected by Q3 2026.

“We’re excited to bring our construction expertise to another large solar project in the New England region,” said Nick Sylvestre, founder and CEO of Louth Callan Renewables. “Our team has spent worked hard to value engineer the project to help the owner make it a buildable and valuable asset. Now we’re focused on executing a clean, safe, and high-quality build that reflects our commitment to industry best practices and community engagement.”

Editor: Pennsylvanians could be forgiven for feeling a bit whipsawed when it comes to recent energy-related news here in the Keystone State. On one hand, the recently signed federal “One Big Beautiful Bill” pulls back from recent progress that has been made in clean energy production, limiting our energy options instead of supporting an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. That means fewer jobs, less economic growth and an electric grid that will become increasingly strained under continued and unprecedented demand for more power.

On the other hand, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick and President Donald Trump were in Pittsburgh recently to announce a whopping $90 billion in energy and technology investments in Pennsylvania. Among them is a plan from Westinghouse Electric Co. to build 10 new, large nuclear power plant reactors across the U.S. — expected to generate $6 billion in investment and 15,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania alone.

There is widespread support for more investment in safe, reliable nuclear power. Pennsylvania has a strong nuclear legacy and generates the second most nuclear energy in the country. To lead the new nuclear resurgence, we’ll have to exceed our current pace. As other states are making investments in advanced nuclear energy technology, Pennsylvania should be next.

That’s why we’re calling on federal and state leaders to renew their commitment to an energy future that keeps Pennsylvania at the forefront of energy dominance. That means setting aside party labels and advancing commonsense energy policy that is solution-driven and puts Pennsylvanians first. Nuclear power can play an important role in our clean energy future, but we must also include other energy sources and technologies, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.

Only through a comprehensive approach to our energy policy can we ensure our power supply is reliable, clean and affordable — not just today, but for future generations.

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the FY 2025 budget bill (the ""Act""), which includes substantial business tax proposals. At a high level, the Act permanently extends many of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's (TCJA's) expiring tax provisions, introduces new tax provisions, including ones that President Trump campaigned on, and eliminates or phases out various clean energy credits established by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Notably for businesses, the Act does not incorporate the following aspects of the Trump Administration's tax agenda: closing the carried interest loophole, lowering the corporate income tax rates, and eliminating the 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax.

Business owners should consider the implications of the Act's various business tax proposals, which are summarized below.

Modifying the Section 163(j) limitation. The Act increases the Section 163(j) business interest expense limitation by (i) modifying ""adjusted taxable income"" from 30% EBIT to 30% EBITDA and (ii) expanding floor plan financing to include certain recreational trailers and campers. However, the Act also decreases the Section 163(j) limitation by excluding various international tax items, such as Subpart F income, Net CFC Tested Income (previously referred to as GILTI), the gross-up for deemed paid foreign tax credits under Section 78 and related deductions from the adjusted taxable income calculation.

Additionally, under a new ordering rule, the Section 163(j) limitation applies to capitalized interest before interest expense in any given year. Historically, taxpayers could capitalize interest into the basis of assets and depreciate it over the life of the assets without limitation under Section 163(j). Subjecting capitalized interest to the Section 163(j) limitation curtails taxpayers' ability to use the interest capitalization rules to circumvent Section 163(j) limitations.

Accordingly, businesses, especially those with foreign corporate subsidiaries, should carefully consider the impact of the revised Section 163(j) limitation on their ability to deduct interest.

Preserving the PTET deduction. The Act permanently retains the TCJA's cap on the total state and local taxes (SALT) that an individual taxpayer may deduct. However, it increases the cap from $10,000 to up to $40,000 for individuals with taxable income of $500,000 or less. That said, the Act does not restrict the pass-through entity tax (PTET) workaround to the SALT cap, which earlier drafts had proposed. Specifically, in response to the TCJA's SALT cap, various states enacted legislation allowing pass-through entities to elect to pay state income taxes on behalf of their owners at the entity level. The IRS subsequently issued Notice 2020-75, which allows PTET paid by entities to be netted against the owner's federal taxable income, effectively circumventing the SALT cap. In the Notice, the IRS noted that it planned to issue further guidance in the form of proposed regulations; however, it has yet to do so. Thus, the IRS may revisit or revoke its earlier PTET guidance in light of the Act's more favorable SALT cap, and pass-through business owners should closely review any subsequent guidance.

Extending the Section 199A pass-through deduction. The Act permanently extends Section 199A, thereby allowing individuals to deduct up to 20% of qualified business income from certain pass-through entities.

Eliminating and phasing out certain energy tax credits. The Act eliminates consumer facing credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades and curtails certain other energy tax credits introduced by the IRA. The Act also truncates the eligibility timeline for the tech-neutral investment tax credit (ITC) and production tax credit (PTC) by requiring that wind and solar projects either begin construction before July 5, 2026, or be placed into service before 2028. Moreover, as discussed further here, the Trump Administration recently suggested that it may seek to further scale back the IRA's energy tax credits.

Extending the Clean Fuel Production Credit. The Act extends the Clean Fuel Production Credit through 2029.

Immediate expensing for domestic R&D. New Section 174A allows either immediate expensing or an elective five-year amortization of domestic R&D costs incurred from 2025 onward. Additionally, Section 174A applies retroactively to domestic R&D expenses incurred from 2022 through 2024, allowing certain small business taxpayers to claim a full deduction in the expense year and other taxpayers to immediately expense any remaining amortization. Before the Act, taxpayers amortized domestic R&D expenses over a five-year period. Foreign R&D expenses remain unchanged and are capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period.

Permanently reinstating the TCJA's 100% bonus depreciation. Specifically, Section 168(k) now allows taxpayers to immediately expense certain trade or business property placed into service after January 19, 2025. While the TCJA had temporarily allowed bonus depreciation, permanently extending it is a significant deviation from the historic requirement that these costs be capitalized and depreciated over the asset's relevant recovery period. Business owners should review their receipts and records for assets acquired after January 19, 2025, to ensure optimal expensing of those assets.

Increasing the Section 179 limitation. The Act increases the Section 179 limitation for immediately expensing certain trade or business assets from $2.5 million to an inflation-adjusted $4 million for property placed into service after 2024. Businesses may immediately expense certain assets, namely HVAC systems, roofing, security systems, and fire protection systems, which are not otherwise eligible for immediate expensing under Section 168(k), as discussed above.

Providing 100% bonus depreciation for certain nonresidential real property. New Section 168(n) provides 100% bonus depreciation for nonresidential real property connected to certain agricultural or chemical manufacturing and production activities, provided that (i) construction begins between January 20, 2025 and December 31, 2029, and (ii) the property is placed into service before 2031.

Increasing the Net CFC Tested Income, FDII, and BEAT tax rates. The Act increases the effective rates on Net CFC Tested Income (formerly known as GILTI) from 10.5% to 14%, on Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII) from 13.125% to 14%, and on the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT) from 10% to 10.5%.

Modifying the CFC rules. The Act modifies the controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules by (i) permanently extending the CFC look-through rule, (ii) restoring the limitation for applying downward attribution from a foreign person to a U.S. person when determining CFC status, (iii) requiring any CFC shareholder to include its pro rata share of Subpart F income regardless of whether it held CFC stock on the last day of the year, and (iv) eliminating a CFC's ability to elect a tax year that ends earlier than that of its majority shareholder.

Modifying the Foreign Tax Credit regime. The Act includes various business favorable changes to the foreign tax credit (FTC) regime. First, the Act increases the deemed paid credit that U.S. corporations may claim on foreign taxes paid on Net CFC Tested Income (formerly known as GILTI) from 80% to 90%. Second, under the Act, R&D and interest expenses, as well as other expenses not related to Net CFC Tested Income, are not be allocated to Net CFC Tested Income for purposes of calculating foreign source taxable income, thereby potentially allowing more foreign taxes to be credited. Finally, the Act allows up to 50% of the income from the sale of inventory produced in the U.S. and sold through certain overseas offices to be treated as foreign source income for FTC limitation purposes, rather than U.S. source income as it was previously treated, thereby potentially allowing more foreign taxes to be credited.

Modifying the REIT rules. The Act increases the total amount of Taxable REIT Subsidiary (TRS) stock that a REIT can hold from 20% to 25%, thereby reinstating the pre-TCJA limit and providing greater flexibility for REIT structuring.

Increasing the Low-Income Housing Credit. The Act expands the Low-Income Housing Credit by allowing states to issue more tax credits and increasing the credits for properties financed by tax-exempt bonds.

Partially excluding certain agricultural loan interest income. Under new Section 139L, banks can exclude from their gross income 25% of the interest on certain loans secured by rural or agricultural property that are incurred after the enactment date.

Excluding tips and overtime compensation. The Act creates a temporary deduction for employees earning certain qualified tip and overtime compensation from 2025 through 2028. Notwithstanding the above, employers must (i) separately track qualified tip and overtime compensation, and (ii) withhold FICA taxes thereon. Employers should consider necessary updates to their payroll systems to address tip and overtime compensation.

The new Trump administration budget eliminated tax credits designed to encourage investment in wind and solar projects.

More than 90% of Alaska residents rely on power cooperatives for their electricity, which have made an effort in recent years to invest in wind and solar - especially in the most remote areas.

Alaska Energy blog author Erin McKittrick said rate payers will pay higher prices as a result of fewer alternative energy options.

""Renewable energy is holding out this promise to maybe keep rates down, but the way things are going we may not get that option, or if we get it, it might be more expensive than it is otherwise,"" said McKittrick. ""So, everybody is going to see their rates go up.""

U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-AK, tried to negotiate some alternative energy tax credits back into the bill for her state just prior to a final vote - but was not able to secure money for Alaska's indigenous whale hunters to buy equipment they rely on for subsistence hunting and fishing.

Beyond affecting larger power co-ops, McKittrick said the elimination of the tax incentives will also hurt small companies that install wind and solar power in Alaska's remote locations.

""They don't have this position where they have a huge portfolio of lots of things going on and they can handle uncertainty for one or another project,"" said McKittrick. ""Whether they exist at all in the future is questionable I would think.""

The League of Conservation Voters is working at the grassroots level in Alaska to find ways to keep wind and solar projects alive in the state as it tries to move away from a heavy dependence on diesel fuel and a dwindling supply of natural gas.

Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has signed into law the first set of statewide policies in the country supporting community-owned microgrids.

Microgrids are local, self-contained energy systems that use renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power.

Dylan Kruse - president of Sustainable Northwest, a nonprofit involved in drafting the legislation - said microgrids can help mitigate the uptick in power outages caused by wildfires and extreme weather, especially in rural parts of the state.

""We're seeing an increased interest from small towns, from communities, from tribes,"" said Kruse, ""saying 'look, if the lights go out, we need to have options so we can continue to provide emergency services, we can provide communications.'""

Microgrids can power critical facilities, such as hospitals or fire stations, operating either connected to the main grid or independently during emergencies.

Joshua Basofin - clean energy program director with Climate Solutions - said that while some microgrids are being developed in Oregon alongside utility companies, they are most valuable when communities reap the economic and resiliency benefits.

""When communities own those systems themselves,"" said Basofin, ""they actually have the ability to control those microgrids as they need for their own purposes.""

Oregon's new law requires the state Public Utility Commission to establish clear rules for the operation and ownership of community microgrids, which Kruse said he believes will expedite their construction.

He said while other states have considered moving in this direction, Oregon is the first to take this step.

""This legislation,"" said Kruse, ""is the most ambitious, comprehensive legislation in the country of its kind.""

More than $7 billion in Colorado's GDP and 9,600 jobs are projected to be lost under President Donald Trump's signature tax and spending bill which cuts incentives for clean energy, according to a new report by the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation.

Solar and wind capacity is expected to drop by 340 gigawatts, raising home energy costs by an extra $170 per year.

Margaret Kran-Annexstein, director of the Colorado chapter of the Sierra Club, said the new law reverses years of work transitioning to a clean energy economy.

""We have seen how investments in clean energy programs can attract more jobs, and can help people lower their electricity costs,"" Kran-Annexstein pointed out.

Trump campaigned on promises to end climate mitigation efforts and to bring down energy costs by increasing the use of fossil fuels. Republicans critical of clean energy tax credits have argued they amount to the government picking industry winners and losers. According to a separate industry analysis, just 30% of U.S. solar and 57% of wind projects are expected to survive under the new GOP law.

Oil and gas companies have benefited from taxpayer subsidies for decades and currently receive $170 billion a year. Kran-Annexstein noted efforts to boost clean energy, to slow climate change and reduce air pollution, pale by comparison.

""This bill is going to be giving polluters an additional $15 billion tax break, while gutting clean energy programs,"" Kran-Annexstein explained. ""We need to be investing in solutions, and we also need to not be giving tax breaks to the companies that are causing these problems.""

The new GOP law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and SNAP to finance Trump administration priorities including extending 2017 tax cuts. Kran-Annexstein worries ramping up fossil fuel production and limiting health coverage will produce dire consequences.

""If we're revoking people's access to health care, and we're going to be seeing increases in the amount of pollution, people are going to be sick and people are going to die,"" Kran-Annexstein contended.

Despite last-minute concessions in the Trump administration's budget, which removes alternative energy tax incentives, rural Alaska power providers now face huge obstacles to distributing power to the most rural and isolated parts of the state.

Investments in wind and solar power now face an uphill battle. Alaska's extreme weather and challenging geography already make power generation difficult and expensive. Now, with fewer incentives to diversify, the state's most isolated places will be forced to continue relying on fossil fuels for their electricity.

Pierre Lonewolf, board member of the Kotzebue Electric Association, said the loss of tax incentives means critical alternative energy programs are dead in the water.

""That has put the kibosh on our wind projects, which we are partnering with the local tribe to install two more megawatt wind turbines, another megawatt or so of solar,"" Lonewolf explained.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted for the budget bill but only after she worked to secure some alternative energy tax incentives and funding for Native whale hunters back into the measure in the debate's eleventh hour.

Lonewolf added village and tribal members have worked to move away from diesel fuel for power generation and said a lack of incentives to diversify to wind and solar will fall directly on rural Alaska's consumers who need affordable power to heat their homes.

""We don't want to have to raise our prices on electricity but we have to cover our costs to pay our people,"" Lonewolf acknowledged.

Kotzebue is a gateway for the diesel fuel powering 10 villages in rural Alaska. What Lonewolf called a war on renewable energy will only cause prices to keep rising in parts of the state that can least afford it.

Despite an expected decline in EV sales this year—thanks to the Trump administration taking a sledgehammer to pro-EV programs—the country’s charging network is growing bigger. Charging stations are swelling in size, stalls are delivering more power and the result is a better experience for EV drivers plugging in.

Charging companies seem more committed than ever to create the sort of foundation that could shape the future of EVs for years to come. What does that mean for you? It’s mostly good news.

The odds of pulling up to a station with broken, crowded, or painfully slow chargers are shrinking. At the same time, the chances of you finding a reliable, high-powered station—complete with WiFi, restrooms and even a decent cup of coffee and a variety of snacks—are steadily increasing.

The deployment of new fast charging ports, as well as stations, is on record pace in 2025, charging data company Paren said in a report released Monday.

America is on track to add 16,700 public fast-charging ports by the end of this year, which would be about 2.4 times the number of ports added in 2022. If this pace continues, the U.S. will have 100,000 public fast-charging ports by 2027.

""Despite the [federal funding] pause and other factors, 2025 will be a record year of fast charging deployment—our estimate of nearly 20% year-over-year increase in new ports,"" Paren's Chief Analyst Loren McDonald said in an email.

Partly contributing to this trend are what Paren calls “Charging 2.0” companies. That means new companies such as Ionna, Mercedes-Benz High Power Charging, BP Pulse and Walmart that are heralding the next phase of charging in the U.S.

In this phase, new EV charging stations are becoming more standardized, with a minimum of 10 stalls that deliver 350 kilowatts to 400 kilowatts of maximum power. That means more available plugs for EV drivers, less congestion and faster charging times. In fact, 63% of the ports deployed in the second quarter were capable of delivering 250 kilowatts or more power, up from 47% in the first quarter.

The U.S. now has 11,687 public fast charging stations with nearly 60,000 ports. About 4,242 of these ports were added across 784 stations in the second quarter of this year, a 23.3% increase over the previous quarter. Tesla, ChargePoint and EVgo led this quarter-over-quarter speed of deployment.

Tesla still accounted for 40.2% of the new fast-charging ports opened between April and June. Its all-time share is at a solid 54.3%. In terms of overall market share for DC fast charging ports, Electrify America is second (7.9%), followed by ChargePoint (6.9%).

The size of the stations is also growing. In second quarter of 2024, non-Tesla public fast charging stations averaged 3.0 ports per station whereas Tesla averaged 12.4 ports per station. But that's growing fast with non-Tesla stations now averaging 3.8 ports per station whereas Tesla Superchargers now have an average of 15.1 ports at each location.

Even though that’s great news for EV drivers as automakers continue to launch new models, the full picture isn’t rosy.

The average utilization rate of fast charging stations in the U.S. dropped from 16.6% in the first quarter to 16.1% in Q2. In fact, utilization rates dropped in 70% of the states, even though more people in rural America showed higher usage rates with fewer stations available in their regions.

Paren partly attributed that to seasonal changes—an EV battery charges faster in summer compared to winter, where cells can take some time to get up to optimal temperatures.

But the average utilization rates also dropped due to increased installation of new chargers in low-adoption regions. That’s because these newer “Charging 2.0” companies are “future-proofing” and “building ahead of demand.”

“If you look at Ionna, Mercedes-Benz, BP Pulse, Walmart, these big companies have all been very public about their plans to open thousands of fast charging stations between now and 2030,” McDonald told InsideEVs.

“They're all full steam ahead on that and sticking to those goals regardless of what happens with EV sales, tariffs, the loss of the tax credits and all that,” he added. “They have these very concrete plans and they're moving forward with those.”

Ioniq 9 Tesla Charging

I saw part of this trend unfold in real time when I charged a Hyundai Ioniq 9 press loaner multiple times at a brand new Tesla Supercharger last week.

Earlier, Brooklyn had only one free-standing Tesla Supercharger with no pay-to-park fees. It had long waiting times 24/7, mainly due to high traffic from rideshare drivers who sometimes charge more than once per day. Tesla opened another Supercharger nearby just last month, which is even bigger with 20 stalls, with 20 more opening soon.

One rideshare driver told me the new station “saved my business.”",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/XBqgp6/s1/hyundai-ioniq-9-charging-at-tesla-supercharger.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:59:07.466124

THE TOP FIVE

1. Congress pushes back on Trump’s plan to kill Energy Star

In May, the Trump administration signaled its plans to gut Energy Star, the energy efficiency certification program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. Energy Star is extremely popular — its brand is recognized by nearly 90% of Americans — and at a cost to the federal government of just $32 million per year, saves American households upward of $40 billion in energy costs per year as of 2024, for a total of more than $500 billion saved since its launch in 1992, by the EPA’s own estimate. Not only that, as one of Energy Star’s architects told Heatmap’s Jeva Lange back in May, more energy efficient appliances and buildings help reduce strain on the grid. “Think about the growing demands of data center computing and AI models,” RE Tech Advisors’ Deb Cloutier told Jeva. “We need to bring more energy onto the grid and make more space for it.”

That value has clearly resonated with lawmakers on the Hill. Legislators tasked with negotiating appropriations in both the Senate and the House of Representatives last week proposed fully funding Energy Star at $32 million for the next fiscal year. It’s unclear how the House’s decision to go into recess until September will affect the vote, but Ben Evans, the federal legislative director at the U.S. Green Building Council, said the bill is “a major step in the right direction demonstrating that ENERGY STAR has strong bipartisan support on Capitol Hill.”

2. China installed 15 gigawatts of solar last month, marking an 85% dip

The United States installed just under 11 gigawatts of solar panels in the first three months of this year, industry data show. In June alone, China installed nearly 15 gigawatts, PV Tech reported. And, in a detail that demonstrates just how many panels the People’s Republic has been deploying at home in recent years, that represented an 85% drop from the previous month and close to a 40% decline compared to June of last year.

The photovoltaic installation plunge followed Beijing’s rollout of two new policies that changed the renewables business in China. The first, called the 531 policy, undid guaranteed feed-in tariffs and required renewable projects to sell electricity on the spot market. That took effect on June 1. The other, called the 430 policy, took effect on May 1 and mandated that new distributed solar farms consume their own power first before allowing the sale of surplus electricity to the grid. As a result of the stalled installations, a top panel manufacturer warned the trade publication Opis that companies may need to raise prices by as much as 10%.

3. Citing Trump, the world’s No. 4 iron maker quits green hydrogen

For years now, Fortescue, the world’s fourth-biggest producer of iron ore, has directed much of the earnings from its mines in northwest Australia and steel mills in China toward building out a global green hydrogen business. But changes to U.S. policy have taken a toll. Last week, Fortescue told investors it was canceling its green hydrogen project in Arizona, which had been set to come online next year. It’s also abandoning its plans for a green hydrogen plant on Australia’s northeastern coast, The Wall Street Journal reported.

“A shift in policy priorities away from green energy has changed the situation in the U.S.,” Gus Pichot, Fortescue’s chief executive of growth and energy, told analysts on a call. “The lack of certainty and a step back in green ambition has stopped the emerging green-energy markets, making it hard for previously feasible projects to proceed.” But green hydrogen isn’t dead everywhere. Just last week, the industrial gas firm Air Liquide made a final decision to invest in a 200-megawatt green hydrogen plant in the Netherlands.

4. Top NOAA officials behind ‘Sharpiegate’ placed on leave

The Trump administration put two high-ranking officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on administrative leave, CNN reported. The reasoning behind the move wasn’t clear, but both officials — Steve Volz, who leads NOAA’s satellites division, and Jeff Dillen, NOAA’s deputy general counsel — headed up the investigation into whether President Donald Trump violated NOAA’s scientific integrity policies during his so-called Sharpiegate scandal.

The incident from September 2019, during Trump’s first term, started when the president incorrectly listed Alabama among the states facing a threat from Hurricane Dorian. Throughout the following week, Trump defended the remark, insisting he had been right, and ultimately showed journalists a weather map that had been altered with a black Sharpie market to show the path of the storm striking Alabama. NOAA’s investigation into the incident concluded that Neil Jacobs, the former agency official who backed Trump at the time and is now nominated to serve as chief, succumbed to political pressure and violated scientific integrity rules.

5. North Carolina Republicans prepare to force through a controversial energy bill

In March, North Carolina’s Republican-controlled Senate passed a bill to repeal the state’s climate law and scrap the 2030 deadline by which the monopoly utility Duke Energy had to slash its planet-heating emissions by 70% compared to 2005 levels. Governor Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed the legislation. But on Tuesday, the GOP majorities in both chambers of the legislature plan to vote to override the veto.

Doing so and enacting the bill could cost North Carolina more than 50,000 jobs annually and cause tens of billions of dollars in lost investments, Canary Media’s Elizabeth Ouzts reported. That’s according to a new study from a consultancy commissioned by clean-energy advocates in the state. The analysis is based on data from the state-sanctioned consumer advocate, Public Staff.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.
On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.","Drive through the plains of Iowa or Kansas and you’ll see more than rows of corn, wheat and soybeans. You’ll also see towering wind turbines spinning above fields and solar panels shining in the sun on barns and machine sheds.

For many farmers, these are lifelines. Renewable energy provides steady income and affordable power, helping farms stay viable when crop prices fall or drought strikes.

But some of that opportunity is now at risk as the Trump administration cuts federal support for renewable energy.

Wind power brings steady income for farms

Wind energy is a significant economic driver in rural America. In Iowa, for example, over 60% of the state’s electricity came from wind energy in 2024, and the state is a hub for wind turbine manufacturing and maintenance jobs.

For landowners, wind turbines often mean stable lease payments. Those historically were around US$3,000 to $5,000 per turbine per year, with some modern agreements $5,000 to $10,000 annually, secured through 20- to 30-year contracts.

Nationwide, wind and solar projects contribute about $3.5 billion annually in combined lease payments and state and local taxes, more than a third of it going directly to rural landowners.

These figures are backed by long-term contracts and multibillion‑dollar annual contributions, reinforcing the economic value that turbines bring to rural landowners and communities.

Wind farms also contribute to local tax revenues that help fund rural schools, roads and emergency services. In counties across Texas, wind energy has become one of the most significant contributors to local property tax bases, stabilizing community budgets and helping pay for public services as agricultural commodity revenues fluctuate.

In Oldham County in northwest Texas, for example, clean energy projects provided 22% of total county revenues in 2021. In several other rural counties, wind farms rank among the top 10 property taxpayers, contributing between 38% and 69% of tax revenue.

The construction and operation of these projects also bring local jobs in trucking, concrete work and electrical services, boosting small-town businesses.

The U.S. wind industry supports over 300,000 U.S. jobs across construction, manufacturing, operations and other roles connected to the industry, according to the American Clean Power Association.

Renewable energy has been widely expected to continue to grow along with rising energy demand. In 2024, 93% of all new electricity generating capacity was wind, solar or energy storage, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration expected a similar percentage in 2025 as of June.

Solar can cut power costs on the farm

Solar energy is also boosting farm finances. Farmers use rooftop panels on barns and ground-mounted systems to power irrigation pumps, grain dryers and cold storage facilities, cutting their power costs.

Some farmers have adopted agrivoltaics – dual-use systems that grow crops beneath solar panels. The panels provide shade, helping conserve water, while creating a second income path. These projects often cultivate pollinator-friendly plants, vegetables such as lettuce and spinach, or even grasses for grazing sheep, making the land productive for both food and energy.

Federal grants and tax credits that were significantly expanded under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped make the upfront costs of solar installations affordable.

However, the federal spending bill signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, rolled back many clean energy incentives. It phases down tax credits for distributed solar projects, particularly those under 1 megawatt, which include many farm‑scale installations, and sunsets them entirely by 2028. It also eliminates bonus credits that previously supported rural and low‑income areas.

Without these credits, the upfront cost of solar power could be out of reach for some farmers, leaving them paying higher energy costs. At a 2024 conference organized by the Institute of Sustainability, Energy and Environment at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I work as a research economist, farmers emphasized the importance of tax credits and other economic incentives to offset the upfront cost of solar power systems.

What’s being lost

The cuts to federal incentives include terminating the Production Tax Credit for new projects placed in service after Dec. 31, 2027, unless construction begins by July 4, 2026, and is completed within a tight time frame. The tax credit pays eligible wind and solar facilities approximately 2.75 cents per kilowatt-hour over 10 years, effectively lowering the cost of renewable energy generation. Ending that tax credit will likely increase the cost of production, potentially leading to higher electricity prices for consumers and fewer new projects coming online.

The changes also accelerate the phase‑out of wind power tax credits. Projects must now begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service before the end of 2027 to qualify for any credit.

Meanwhile, the Investment Tax Credit, which covers 30% of installed cost for solar and other renewables, faces similar limits: Projects must begin by July 4, 2026, and be completed by the end of 2027 to claim the credits. The bill also cuts bonuses for domestic components and installations in rural or low‑income locations. These adjustments could slow new renewable energy development, particularly smaller projects that directly benefit rural communities.

While many existing clean energy agreements will remain in place for now, the rollback of federal incentives threatens future projects and could limit new income streams. It also affects manufacturing and jobs in those industries, which some rural communities rely on.

Renewable energy also powers rural economies

Renewable energy benefits entire communities, not just individual farmers.

Wind and solar projects contribute millions of dollars in tax revenue. For example, in Howard County, Iowa, wind turbines generated $2.7 million in property tax revenue in 2024, accounting for 14.5% of the county’s total budget and helping fund rural schools, public safety and road improvements.

In some rural counties, clean energy is the largest new source of economic activity, helping stabilize local economies otherwise reliant on agriculture’s unpredictable income streams. These projects also support rural manufacturing – such as Iowa turbine blade factories like TPI Composites, which just reopened its plant in Newton, and Siemens Gamesa in Fort Madison, which supply blades for GE and Siemens turbines. The tax benefits in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act helped boost those industries – and the jobs and local tax revenue they bring in.

On the solar side, rural companies like APA Solar Racking, based in Ohio, manufacture steel racking systems for utility-scale solar farms across the Midwest.

“The opportunities for significant inward investment that would come from enhanced grid capacity are obvious and our report sets out a detailed plan for how Freeport East and industry stakeholders, working alongside Government, can make this a reality.” Steve Beel, Chief Executive at Freeport East, said: “We welcome this important report which sets out how major investment opportunities at Freeport East can thrive with additional grid capacity.","Delivering targeted support for 500MW of new grid capacity around Felixstowe and Harwich could unlock hundreds of millions of pounds of investment, according to a new report from the Renewable Energy Association.

Analysis from the Green Transport Hub Strategy report found investment in grid capacity around the Freeport East Economic Area could enable further development of the transport, manufacturing and digital hub.

This could support thousands of new jobs and helping meet the transport industry’s demand for decarbonisation and new growth, it said.

Freeport East, which includes the ports of Felixstowe and Harwich, forms part of the East of England clean energy cluster, and transits more than 40% of the UK’s container shipping traffic.

According to the report, evolving the site would enhance its capacity to produce and supply sustainable fuels, attract new cleantech manufacturing and provide charging infrastructure for EHGVs, and attract foreign investment, contributing to the £5.5bn that the freeport is forecast to contribute to the economy.

Plans unveiled as part of the government’s new Industrial Strategy would see the UK’s Freeports incorporated into the new category of Industrial Strategy Zones, with bespoke support and funding models now streamlined to enable their success.

These include a Connections Acceleration Service and a £600m Strategic Sites Accelerator both of which could help speed up new investments.

To ensure Freeport East will be able to realise its potential as an engine of economic growth, and access the required 500 MW of additional grid capacity, the report recommends:

Developing a coordinated electricity capacity plan that brings together the needs of businesses, developers, and the local community and reflects Freeport East’s position both as an economically significant industrial cluster, and a Government-backed Industrial Strategy Zone.

Securing governance assurance from local and national bodies to ensure the necessary electricity capacity is prioritised.

Engaging with the Regional Energy Strategic Plans (RESPs) process to advocate for the increased capacity required for Freeport East’s green and industrial developments and ensure that 2026 tRESP plan addresses Freeport East’s capacity needs.

Maintaining ongoing analysis and collaboration with local distribution grid operator UK Power Networks to identify future energy needs and ensure timely grid upgrades.

The report itself has now delivered on the first two of those recommendations. Freeport East and the industry are now leading engagement with the National Electricity System Operator (NESO) to ensure new energy capacity is available to supporting planned investments.

Matt Adams, Head of Transport at the REA, said:

“Freeport East is one of the UK’s most strategically important industrial clusters. Ensuring it is able to transition to a Green Transport Hub and support new manufacturing investments is critical for meeting our decarbonisation goals and for maintaining the UK’s position as a leader in clean transport, technology, innovation and infrastructure.

“The opportunities for significant inward investment that would come from enhanced grid capacity are obvious and our report sets out a detailed plan for how Freeport East and industry stakeholders, working alongside Government, can make this a reality.”

Steve Beel, Chief Executive at Freeport East, said:

“We welcome this important report which sets out how major investment opportunities at Freeport East can thrive with additional grid capacity.

“Modern investments across a range of sectors including Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Energy Industries and Digital & Technology Services require strong access to the grid. This allows for reliable power access as well as the ability for businesses to develop self-sufficiency through on-site renewables production that can share surplus energy with wider consumers.

“The Government’s endorsement of Freeport East as a new Industrial Strategy Zone provides exactly the kind of focus on delivery that we feel can deliver the grid infrastructure we require to fulfil our economic potential.”

NEER added 3.2 GW to its renewables backlog, exceeding the 3 GW threshold for the 6th time in 8 quarters in Q2 2025, bringing its total to 29.5 GW as of July 23, 2025. The new additions comprised solar (1.7 GW), wind (300 MW), battery storage (900 MW), and repowering for wind and solar assets (300 MW) during the quarter. It includes more than 1 GW serving hyperscalers to enable their AI buildout.

The management attributes the growth in its backlog to strong demand from technology and data center customers. In total, its backlog comprises close to 6 GW of projects intended to serve these customers.

“If you include our operating portfolio together with the expected buildout of our backlog, we will have over 10.5 gigawatts serving technology and data center customers across the United States,” said Chairman, President and CEO of NextEra Energy, John Ketchum.

It has now originated approximately 12.7 GW of new renewables and battery storage projects over the last 12 months, with roughly 30% coming from storage.

He also added that the company’s prior investments in renewables and the ‘constant state of construction’ made before the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) will support its project pipeline through 2029, covering both early- and late-stage developments.

OBBBA has advanced the phase-out of wind and solar tax credits under the Inflation Reduction ACT (IRA). These will only be available for projects that are placed in service by December 31, 2027, or start construction by July 4, 2026, leaving the option of safe harbor open. However, the federal government is feared to be tightening provisions around safe harbor now, leading to uncertainty among developers (see Trump Signs Executive Order To End Green Energy Subsidies).

Another NEE subsidiary, Florida Power & Light (FPL), plans to add more than 8 GW of reliable, cost-effective solar and battery storage by 2029 to complement its existing natural gas and nuclear fleet in Florida.

The management stated that FPL is America’s blueprint for utilizing all forms of energy to keep reliability high and electric bills low.

While NEE is a big name in the US renewables space, it is the smaller players that are likely to be hit the hardest under the country’s policy scenario. Nevertheless, demand for renewables seems to be growing, irrespective of the regulatory environment.

Speaking to analysts on the company’s earnings call, President and CEO of NextEra Energy Resources Brian Bolster said, “And I just want to remind everyone while the tax laws may be changing, the demand picks that we've been talking about now going on four or five quarters is not. The customer dialogue, whether it's in '27, '28, '29, or '30, is as robust as it's ever been.”",https://media.assettype.com/taiyangnews%2F2025-07-28%2F4qdju5ay%2FPresentation1.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-07-28 11:05:03.174810

Grid-scale storage is getting bigger and safer, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) are finding homes across the country.
While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR1) hammered renewable energy incentives, energy storage emerged unscathed.
Finally, energy storage seems to be a real part of the U.S. energy conversation.
Arevon CEO Kevin Smith has been in the energy industry for almost 40 years and said the energy storage market has been an exciting place to set up camp.","For years, the energy storage market in the United States existed on speculation. There was plenty of discussion on the technology’s ability to improve the electrical grid but very little follow-through. The mood started to shift in the 2020s. Each quarter has a new record-breaking storage installation headline. Grid-scale storage is getting bigger and safer, and battery energy storage systems (BESS) are finding homes across the country.

While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (HR1) hammered renewable energy incentives, energy storage emerged unscathed. Storage still has access to the full investment tax credit (ITC) through 2033, whereas solar and wind projects basically have one year to start construction to access any incentives. Energy storage projects with American batteries and components can also still receive the domestic content bonus, and manufacturers may still qualify for the advanced manufacturing production credit (45X) when making batteries in U.S. factories. Not only is the federal government still encouraging energy storage deployment, but it’s also aiding domestic supply.

Finally, energy storage seems to be a real part of the U.S. energy conversation.

But while HR1 isn’t terrible for the battery market, the timing of some of its restrictive clauses could stall progress and discourage further developments in domestic battery manufacturing. Project developers and manufacturers have mixed feelings about the years ahead.

Solar + storage will keep being constructed

Developer and project owner Arevon Energy has 4.7 GW of solar and energy storage projects operating across the country, 1.5 GW under construction right now and another 10 GW in the development pipeline. Arevon CEO Kevin Smith has been in the energy industry for almost 40 years and said the energy storage market has been an exciting place to set up camp.

“Finally, the market was catching up. Ten years ago, people talked a lot about energy storage, but there weren’t a lot of projects because it didn’t make financial sense,” he said. “Pricing has come down substantially on energy storage, and the need has increased. It’s really hard to get projects — whether it’s solar or wind or natural gas — into urban settings. In some cases, energy storage is a better solution than building generation.”

Arevon recently completed a $300 million storage-only project located a quarter mile from the coast of San Diego Bay. The 200-MW/400-MWh Peregrine Energy Storage Project makes the electrical grid in a dense, urban neighborhood more resilient, storing power during high generation periods and doling it out when there’s high demand. With energy demand only growing across the United States due to data center growth and overall electrification, Smith said Arevon expects to stay as busy as ever. Regardless of incentives, renewable energy and storage projects are cheaper and quicker to build than fossil fuels, and more energy is needed on the grid, fast.

“Wind, solar and storage were like 90% of new generation last year because those projects are more cost-effective, easier to get to market, have quicker development times, quicker construction times,” he said. “For the next five or more years, we’re going to have renewables and battery storage.”

Since batteries are power holders/movers and not generators, Smith said he doesn’t expect to see a rise in storage-only projects just because they still have the ITC. They’ll still be paired with solar projects, and perhaps more so now to help projects still pencil with the remaining storage tax credits.

Brad Thompson, partner at law firm Duane Morris, said he expects to see more storage added to existing solar projects too.

“[Utilities will have] a renewed focus on areas that may have had large-scale solar deployment but have not yet paired with BESS projects,” he said. “An area that is known for load congestion with a high concentration of renewables will be prime real estate for BESS developers to seek interconnection approvals from utility operators to further deploy BESS. The continued incentives for BESS projects will fuel additional deployment of battery storage solutions.”

Ultimately, utilities will determine if the solar and storage markets will continue to grow in the next few years in this changing federal policy landscape.

“They’re going to buy storage when they need storage,” Smith said. “If we’re truly going to keep pace with China on data center installations and other manufacturing activities, we’re going to have to build more power generation and, with that, more battery storage. Despite the changes, we still think the renewable energy markets will continue to grow. You will see some installations canceled that can’t deal with volatility. You will see some investors exit. You will see fewer projects getting built that would otherwise get built, but you’re still going to see lots of construction activity.”

Some American batteries will materialize, but probably not enough

The new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) clause in HR1 throws a wrench into plans for both installation and manufacturing of storage technologies. Solar and storage projects are unable to qualify for the ITC if they use products from China, nor are U.S. manufacturers able to collect the 45X credit if they use a certain percentage of components from China in their domestic products. Both the solar and storage markets will have a hard time avoiding components from China, which dominates both supply chains.

The IRA was helping the grid-scale storage market establish its domestic supply chain. A few more years of uninterrupted progress could have made all the difference. New FEOC rules go into effect in 2026, and many U.S. battery manufacturing hopefuls might not make the deadline.

“Tesla is a big supplier. They have U.S. manufacturing, but they’re bringing in a fair amount of the subcomponents from China,” Smith said. “In a couple years, the manufacturing of batteries would be well advanced. This is going to end up short-circuiting a lot of that manufacturing.”

A few domestic manufacturing outfits are better off than others. LG Energy Solution (LGES) opened a 16.5-GWh LFP battery cell manufacturing plant in Michigan earlier this summer. The site previously made battery components for EVs, but the Korean company invested $1.4 billion to swap manufacturing to the BESS market.

“ESS was the ugly duckling for some time for LG,” said Jaehong Park, CEO of LG Energy Solution Vertech, the stationary storage arm of LGES. “The financial performance of ESS in the past was difficult,” and EV was a much larger financial driver for the company. But now LGES sees more growth for stand-alone batteries and is building more assembly sites across the United States.

A handful of other battery manufacturers are also operating in the United States, including Hithium and its 10-GWh LFP battery assembly plant in Texas, and AESC with its estimated 3-GWh LFP cell plant in Tennessee. Canadian Solar subsidiary e-STORAGE is building a 3-GWh LFP cell and module plant in Kentucky, but it’s not yet complete. Still others have announced plans to retool EV battery factories to BESS production, but the FEOC rules will affect whether these projects reach the finish line.

The latest “ESS Supply, Technology and Policy Report” from Clean Energy Associates found that nearly 21 GWh of planned energy storage cell manufacturing capacity has been canceled in 2025 due to financing issues and policy uncertainty — and this was before FEOC rules were put in place.

“The industry was making very strong strides,” Smith said. “Two years from now, I think we would have been well into that manufacturing and a lot of those subcomponents would be from U.S. sources or at least non-FEOC sources. When the FEOC rules kick in in January 2026, it’s going to cause a lot of volatility in the market. It will cause lost jobs, because there will be some manufacturing facilities that had been approved for construction, and the manufacturing sector still depends on [Chinese] equipment. The timing is bad.”

Storage incentives may have been preserved in HR1, but it’s still uncertain whether other legislative hurdles will harm this market too.",https://www.solarpowerworldonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stock-abttery-2-Arevon_California-Flats-Solar-plus-Storage.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:16:10.600793

The new agreement is Google’s first commercial long-duration energy storage deal, and part of a portfolio of technologies being deployed to achieve its CFE goal, according to the companies.
Claudio Spadacini, Founder and CEO of Energy Dome, said: “The programmatic and strategic deployment of our technology at scale to help Google reach carbon-free energy represents the core of our industry-first agreement.
Beyond the commercial collaboration, Google has also made an investment in Energy Dome.
Maud Texier, Director of EMEA Energy at Google, said: “Google is committed to powering our operations with clean energy, and Energy Dome’s technologically proven and scalable long-duration energy storage solution can help us unlock rapid progress.","Google and energy storage startup Energy Dome announced the launch of a new long-term partnership, alongside a strategic investment by Google, aimed at deploying Energy Dome’s advanced long-term energy storage (LDES) solution globally, and addressing a key challenge enabling the use of 24/7 clean energy.

Energy storage forms one of the key building blocks for the rapidly expanding clean energy transition, given the intermittent generating nature of many sources of renewable energy, such as wind and solar, and the need to satisfy round-the-clock energy demand, while ensuring that energy is not wasted, particularly as demand on the grid grows from areas such as transport electrification and AI computing.

Founded in 2019, Milan, Italy-based Energy Dome enables expanded use of renewable energy by making solar and wind power dispatchable using its CO2 Battery, utilizing thermodynamic processes to use CO2 as an energy storage fluid at ambient temperature, and providing energy when the CO2 warms up, expands and turns a turbine to generate electricity, for dispatch into the grid as needed.

Energy Dome’s CO2 Battery solves one of the key challenges of energy storage through its ability to continuously dispatch energy for up to 24 hours, compared with current technologies such as lithium-ion batteries, which typically have much more shorter-term capabilities for storage and dispatch.

Google parent Alphabet announced a 24/7 CFE ambition in 2020, aiming to run its entire business on carbon-free energy (CFE) by 2030, including matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates.

The new agreement is Google’s first commercial long-duration energy storage deal, and part of a portfolio of technologies being deployed to achieve its CFE goal, according to the companies.

Claudio Spadacini, Founder and CEO of Energy Dome, said:

“The programmatic and strategic deployment of our technology at scale to help Google reach carbon-free energy represents the core of our industry-first agreement. We’re proving that a 24/7 cost-effective and carbon-free energy supply is achievable with the right technology and partnership model.”

Under the new agreement, Google will support multiple commercial deployments of Energy Dome’s technology in key geographical strategic areas, including Europe, America, and Asia-Pacific, with a pipeline of sites and projects currently in development and contracting stages already identified. Beyond the commercial collaboration, Google has also made an investment in Energy Dome.

Among the key benefits of LDES technology highlighted by Google was its potential to commercialize much faster than some other clean energy technologies, enabling its use in the near term to more flexibly and reliably grow the electricity system, with the new partnership aimed at helping bring the technology to scale faster, and at lower cost.

Maud Texier, Director of EMEA Energy at Google, said:

“Google is committed to powering our operations with clean energy, and Energy Dome’s technologically proven and scalable long-duration energy storage solution can help us unlock rapid progress. But this isn’t just about Google. By helping to scale this first-of-a-kind LDES technology, we hope to help communities everywhere gain greater access to reliable, affordable electricity and support grid resilience as we integrate more renewable energy sources.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Energy-Dome3.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:01:48.573006

Hitchai Energy will utilise its footprint, investments and partnerships to reserve capacity and lead industry efforts to address the global shortage in transformers, a critical component of power grid infrastructure.

The project follows the recent German government elections, in which energy prices and reliability were a key concern among voters. More than 70 percent of Germans cited rising living costs as their main concern, with energy prices at the forefront of this worry. Electricity demand in Germany is forecast to grow rapidly from 96 TWh in 2024 to 236 TWh by 2035, driven by AI, data centres and the electrification of key industries including vehicles, heat pumps and hydrogen.

Transformers are crucial to enable the efficient transmission and distribution of electricity. There is currently a major global shortage and Hitachi Energy is executing the largest investment plan in the global industry with $9 billion to scale up manufacturing capacity across the world. Germany is integral to the programme, having recently announced the expansion of its transformer factory in Bad Honnef. The company holds deep roots in Germany, employing over 2,000 people across eight locations, including three key manufacturing sites in Bad Honnef, Brilon and Roigheim.

The Bundesnetzagentur, and other German utilities and grid operators, urgently need transformers to prevent a delay in grid connections, blocks to new routing, and threats to ambitious expansion plans designed to support clean power and electrification. As part of the framework agreement with E.ON Hitachi Energy will deliver a considerable part of the transformers by reserving manufacturing capacity to support the accelerated expansion and modernisation of the German power grid.

“The growing importance of power grids demands bold investments and breakthrough innovations to shape the energy systems of the future” said Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of Hitachi Energy. “Our expansion goes beyond business - it reflects our responsibility as a global leader to accelerate capacity and deliver the critical equipment our customers urgently need. Strategic partnerships like this one empower TSOs, utilities, and industry to build a more sustainable, secure, resilient, and affordable energy system for Germany.”

Hitachi Energy is the world leader in transformers, with over two million distribution transformers and tens of thousands of other transformers deployed worldwide. In high-voltage technology, one in every four high-voltage switchgear units in operation is from Hitachi Energy.

As the inventor and market leader in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) technology, Hitachi Energy has integrated more than 150 GW of capacity - enough to power two-thirds of Europe’s households. The company is also the top supplier for offshore wind grid systems, connecting over 54 GW to the grid through our centers of excellence in Germany and Sweden. Its grid automation solutions support 50 percent of the world’s top 250 utilities.

Dave McCormick announced about $90 billion worth of new investments in PA energy, infrastructure and AI-related projects at his summit last week at CMU. Isn’t this exactly the type of event a GSD (Get Shit Done) type governor like Josh Shapiro should have organized?

Yes, indeed.

That successful, forward-looking summit is the exact type of enterprise our GSD governor, deep into his first term and headed toward a re-election race — and an always-being-hinted-at-2028-presidential-run — should have organized…

But of course Shapiro and his entire, sprawling administration did not do that, and couldn’t do that, as he’s been standing athwart the state’s burgeoning energy industry since he became governor.

Rather than working to boost it, or even to just get out of its way, Shapiro’s been fighting to impose more taxes on our entire energy generation system through his foolhardy fight to force PA into RGGI — the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

Basically, RGGI is an excuse to impose more regulations and taxes on us via our electric bills. The Shapiro Administration’s unnecessary push for this has for years paralyzed our energy sector to the point where PJM, which manages our grid, recently warned of looming power shortages.

As the Commonwealth Foundation has noted, “Shapiro appealed the court decision that ruled the carbon tax imposed by the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) was unconstitutional.”

Rather than get on with his supposed GSD agenda, Shapiro went back to the courts to attempt a redo. Nor did he “lift a finger to fight against federal overreach,” à la former President Biden’s ban on liquefied natural gas.

It’s hard to trumpet Pennsylvania’s home-grown energy abundance when you’re at war with it.

Kudos to McCormick and our home-grown power generation and distribution firms for being able to look past that, and fight through Shapiro’s RGGI-induced inertia and look toward the future and realize our need for increased electricity generation. And welcome as well to the other companies that also announced new investments in the state — it’s a great start.

As several summit participants noted, it just makes sense to locate new electric generating plants here because they are very close to (and in some cases, right on top of) the natural gas that will power many of them.

The sprawling coal-fired Homer City electric generating complex in Indiana County, now being torn down and rebuilt into a sprawling natural gas-powered generating complex, was originally sited there because it was right in the middle of western Pennsylvania’s coal fields.

And the same now goes for the gas-fired plants. Duh!

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Commonwealth is the nation’s second largest producer of natural gas and also the second largest net supplier of total energy to other states. (In both instances only Texas outranks Pennsylvania.)

For decades NEPA’s (northeast Pennsylvania) hard anthracite coal kept the heat on in East Coast urban centers, while the bituminous coal of western Pennsylvania powered the industrial revolution.

There’s a certain logic in moving to ensure the state’s vast natural gas (and other) resources power the next energy-intensive phase of America’s growth. Enter McCormick, as Shapiro has been AWOL.

It’s nice — and appropriate — that McCormick invited Gov. Josh Shapiro to one session at the summit, and equally as nice that Shapiro accepted.

But McCormick was the star of the show, and filled the void unfortunately created by Shapiro’s well-practiced nonchalance toward Pennsylvania’s energy-related sectors.

Both men were playing to type: McCormick, the hedge fund investment manager/dealmaker and Shapiro, the prevaricating career politician who’s never held a job in the private sector – outside a short-term gig at a law firm.

Now the hard part begins — getting those projects McCormick curated and announced across the finish line.

Perhaps Shapiro can be helpful in that endeavor, or perhaps…we need a new governor who is more focused on this, rather than on endless self-promotion. Imagine if Shapiro would devote as much time to spearheading a new energy renaissance as he does to pushing his “cringeworthy” social media strategy.

Yes indeed.

Bee Charged EV has positioned mobile charging units near these airports to respond to emergency calls within 15-20 minutes.
""We kept hearing from EV drivers who got stuck at airports with dead batteries,"" said Antony Okuribido, founder of Bee Charged EV.
Beyond airports, Bee Charged EV responds to calls from shopping centers, office buildings, and residential areas where people get stranded.
For more information about Bee Charged EV mobile charging services, visit beechargedev.com or call 888-675-9555.","Bee Charged EV has launched mobile electric vehicle charging services across the Washington DC metro area, establishing partnerships with airports in Virginia, Maryland, and DC to provide emergency charging for stranded EV drivers.

The service covers Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington Dulles International Airport, and Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Bee Charged EV has positioned mobile charging units near these airports to respond to emergency calls within 15-20 minutes.

""We kept hearing from EV drivers who got stuck at airports with dead batteries,"" said Antony Okuribido, founder of Bee Charged EV. ""Maybe they miscalculated their range, or the charging station was broken, or they couldn't find one. Airport parking lots became these anxiety zones for EV owners.""

The company uses mobile charging robots that can drive directly to stranded vehicles. These units carry enough power to either get a car to the nearest charging station or provide a full charge on-site, depending on what the customer needs.

Filling Gaps in Regional Charging Network

Okuribido started Bee Charged EV after his own experience running out of power in his Tesla on I-95. ""I sat there for three hours waiting for a tow truck that didn't know how to handle an EV,"" he recalled. ""That's when I realized there had to be a better way.""

The DC area expansion includes coverage throughout Northern Virginia, Maryland suburbs, and the District itself. The mobile units operate around the clock, with technicians on standby for emergency calls.

Airport partnerships made sense because travelers often arrive with low batteries or face unexpected delays that drain their charge while parked. Business travelers especially appreciated not having to hunt for charging stations in unfamiliar areas.

""Last month we helped a family from Ohio whose Model Y died in the Reagan National parking garage,"" Okuribido said. ""They had three kids and luggage, and the nearest public charger had a two-hour wait. We had them back on the road in 25 minutes.""

The service works with all EV brands, not just Tesla. Technicians carry adapters for Ford Lightning, Chevy Bolt, BMW i4, and other popular models. They can provide Level 2 or DC fast charging depending on the situation.

Response times average 15-20 minutes for airport locations, though this can stretch during severe weather or heavy traffic. Service areas include Alexandria, Arlington, Bethesda, Silver Spring, Fairfax, and surrounding communities.

The company charges a flat service fee plus the cost of electricity delivered. Monthly memberships are available for frequent travelers or local residents who want guaranteed emergency coverage.

Beyond airports, Bee Charged EV responds to calls from shopping centers, office buildings, and residential areas where people get stranded. They also provide scheduled charging for businesses running electric delivery fleets.

""We're not trying to replace charging stations,"" Okuribido explained. ""We're the safety net for when things go wrong. Every EV driver has that moment where they wonder 'what if I don't make it?' We eliminate that worry.""

The DC metro area has seen rapid EV adoption, with Virginia offering rebates up to $2,500 and Maryland providing tax credits for electric vehicle purchases. DC itself has committed to installing 15,000 new charging ports by 2030.

However, charging infrastructure hasn't kept pace with demand. Popular stations often have long waits, and equipment failures can leave drivers stranded. Bee Charged EV aims to bridge these gaps with on-demand mobile service.

The company plans to add more mobile units as demand grows. They're also exploring partnerships with car dealerships, rental agencies, and rideshare companies operating electric fleets.

EV drivers can request service through the Bee Charged EV app or by calling 888-675-9555. The dispatch center operates 24/7 and can typically provide arrival time estimates within minutes of receiving a call.

""People always ask if this is really necessary,"" Okuribido said. ""I tell them to imagine being stuck with a dead phone battery and no charger. That's what it feels like when your EV dies and you're miles from help. We make sure that never happens.""

Service coverage includes Washington DC, Northern Virginia, and Maryland, with plans to expand into other Mid-Atlantic markets later this year.

Uneven standards, where government energy subsidies are granted to some, such as fossil fuels, and not to others, such as clean energy, result in higher energy costs for consumers.
Congress can still, and should, phase out all energy subsidies, not just the current clean energy cuts.","Congress voted to pass a massive budget package that, among other things, drastically cuts clean energy tax credits to reduce federal spending. Claiming victory, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4.

Indeed, taxpayer dollars subsidizing any special industry can play havoc with the intelligence and efficiency of the free market system. That said, the obvious question is this: Why only the renewable subsidies? Why were fossil fuel subsidies not also eliminated?

Lowering the tax burden from fossil fuel subsidies would have offered substantial savings to our federal budget. The U.S. government funnels $10 billion to $15 billion per year to the industry through tax breaks, direct spending (federal programs and infrastructure support), and below-market leases on public lands. Such preferential treatment is sometimes called “corporate welfare.”

Taxpayers actually pay twice for these subsidies, because we also foot the bill for rising costs of localized pollution and climate impacts resulting from increased greenhouse emissions. These federal subsidies benefit profitable oil, gas, and coal companies at taxpayer expense.

But instead, the budget bill added a new stack of subsidies for the oil and gas industry. For example, it rolled back royalty fees for extraction on public lands to 1920 rates. It added a new tax credit for intangible drilling and development costs. It increased the value of existing tax credits for use of carbon dioxide to boost extraction. It stalled implementation of a pollution fee on wasted methane flared or vented from oil wells. It also added noncompetitive leasing rules that can offer energy companies bargain-basement prices.

The bill also gave the coal industry new subsidies, slashing royalty payments on public lands from 12.5 percent to a maximum of 7 percent for all existing and future leases. There is also a new 2.5 percent tax break for extraction of metallurgic coal, which is hard to justify from an “America First” perspective. Almost all metallurgic coal mined in the U.S., after all, is exported, primarily to China and India, where it is used to manufacture carbon-intensive steel that out-competes cleaner U.S. steel on the global market.

Pollution reduction results in healthier communities and fewer health and disaster costs. There is a fundamental contradiction in providing financial support to companies that are not held financially responsible for the damaging consequences of what they produce, even while eliminating support for clean energy sources like solar and wind.

A case can be made that all energy subsidies — whether for fossil fuels, nuclear, or renewables—should be eliminated in the U.S. to create a truly competitive, transparent, and market-driven energy sector. Subsidies distort pricing, shield inefficient technologies from natural market pressures, and lead to inefficient allocation of public funds.

While initially helpful in developing emerging industries, long-term subsidies can lock in political favoritism, suppress innovation, and over-burden taxpayers. Removal of subsidies forces energy producers to compete on a level playing field, where cost, efficiency, and sustainability — not government handouts — determine success. This approach would not only save billions in federal spending but also encourage more cost-effective energy solutions driven by actual demand and performance.

Uneven standards, where government energy subsidies are granted to some, such as fossil fuels, and not to others, such as clean energy, result in higher energy costs for consumers. If we stop subsidizing America’s richest energy companies and oldest industries, we could lower the deficit without cutting essential services and free up more funds for public investment. We need smarter policy that results in fairer energy markets and global energy leadership.

Eliminating subsidies is often economically rational but politically difficult, but our individual action can play a meaningful role in shifting political momentum, especially when it is sustained and collective.

Congress can still, and should, phase out all energy subsidies, not just the current clean energy cuts.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/AdobeStock_228860314-1.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-28 09:02:02.684159

MARKET DRIVERS

Expansion of Renewable Energy Infrastructure

The rapid expansion of renewable energy infrastructure such as solar photovoltaic (PV) installations is ascribed to fuel the growth of the North America power inverter market. Power inverters serve as essential components in these systems, converting the DC electricity generated by solar panels into usable AC power for homes, businesses, and the grid. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), the United States installed over 32 gigawatts (GW) of new solar capacity in 2024 , marking a year-over-year increase of 28%. Moreover, government policies such as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) have significantly accelerated investment in clean energy by extending tax credits and subsidies for both residential and utility-scale projects. In Canada, similar trends are evident, with provinces like Ontario and Alberta leading in large-scale solar farm deployments. Natural Resources Canada estimates that the country added over 2.5 GW of solar PV capacity in 2024 , necessitating robust inverter solutions capable of handling bidirectional power flow and grid synchronization.

Growth of Residential and Commercial Solar Installations

The growing adoption of solar energy in residential and commercial sectors is additionally to fuel the growth of the North America power inverter market. Homeowners and businesses are increasingly investing in rooftop solar systems to reduce electricity costs, achieve energy independence, and support sustainability goals. Power inverters are integral to these setups by ensuring seamless conversion of solar-generated DC power into AC electricity compatible with household appliances and grid interconnection standards. This widespread uptake is fueled by declining system costs, financing options such as solar leases and power purchase agreements (PPAs), and net metering policies that allow consumers to sell excess electricity back to the grid. On the commercial front, businesses across retail, hospitality, and logistics are adopting solar to meet corporate ESG targets and hedge against rising utility rates.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

Supply Chain Disruptions and Component Shortages

The persistent supply chain disruptions and semiconductor component shortages is limiting the growth of the North America power inverter market. The global semiconductor industry has faced prolonged bottlenecks since 2020, impacting the availability of components such as insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), MOSFETs, and microcontrollers used in inverter designs. These delays have resulted in production slowdowns and increased manufacturing costs for inverter manufacturers. A report by McKinsey & Company indicated that material costs for power inverters rose by approximately 20% in 2023 compared to the prior year, pressuring profit margins and delaying project timelines for downstream customers. Additionally, geopolitical tensions and trade restrictions have further complicated sourcing strategies, particularly for silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN)-based semiconductors that offer superior efficiency in next-generation inverters.

High Initial Costs and Regulatory Complexity

The high initial cost of advanced inverter systems combined with complex regulatory requirements is limiting the growth of the North America power inverter market. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the cost of a residential solar inverter typically ranges between $1,000 and $3,000 , depending on the type and capacity. For commercial and utility-scale projects, inverter expenditures can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars per megawatt. Regulatory complexity further compounds this issue. Compliance with standards such as IEEE 1547-2018 for grid interconnection, UL 1741 certification, and local building codes varies across states and provinces, requiring customized inverter configurations.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Integration with Energy Storage Systems

The growing integration of inverters with energy storage systems is gaining huge traction is prompting the growth of the North America power inverter market. Hybrid inverters, which combine the functions of a traditional solar inverter with a battery inverter, enable seamless energy management by allowing users to store excess solar power for later use. According to Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables, the U.S. energy storage market installed over 4.2 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of new capacity in 2024 , representing a year-over-year growth of 38%. Moreover, utilities and grid operators are increasingly deploying grid-scale battery systems equipped with advanced inverters to enhance grid stability, frequency regulation, and peak shaving capabilities.

Electrification of Transportation and EV Charging Infrastructure

The rapid electrification of transportation and the expansion of electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure is another factor propelling the growth of the North America power inverter market. Inverters play a crucial role in EV systems, converting DC power from the battery into AC to drive the motor, while also facilitating bidirectional energy flow in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) applications. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the number of EVs on U.S. roads surpassed 8 million in 2024 , with projections indicating continued exponential growth. This surge is supported by federal and state-level incentives, including the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which allocated $7.5 billion for nationwide EV charging station development.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Rapid Technological Evolution and Product Obsolescence

The rapid pace of technological evolution, which results in frequent product obsolescence and short innovation cycles is restricting the growth of the North America power inverter market. Inverter manufacturers must continuously upgrade their designs to incorporate wide bandgap semiconductors such as silicon carbide (SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN), which offer higher efficiency, reduced size, and improved thermal performance. However, this constant innovation creates pressure on vendors to maintain backward compatibility while introducing forward-looking features. Additionally, the integration of smart grid functionalities such as real-time diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and cybersecurity protections requires continuous software updates and hardware modifications.

Grid Interconnection Standards and Compatibility Issues

The interoperability and compliance with evolving grid interconnection standards pose a major challenge for the growth of the North America power inverter market. Inverters must adhere to regulations such as IEEE 1547-2018, which defines performance, operation, testing, and safety criteria for distributed energy resource (DER) systems.

The Tennessee Power Distribution Company would then sell that power to TVA to be distributed where it’s needed.
Ultimately, Knotts said the project would need a binding letter of intent and then a long-term lease agreement for the land from the Megasite Authority.
Several Megasite Authority board members posed questions about the proposed facility’s impact, including potential nitrous oxide emissions.
The Megasite Authority board did not take formal action on the issue Wednesday, but each member of the board expressed interest in learning more about the proposal at a September meeting.","A group of Tennessee electricity providers is taking early steps toward turning part of the West Tennessee Megasite into a power plant designed to generate extra power when demand peaks.

The cooperative has its eye on about 100 acres located near a new substation the Tennessee Valley Authority built to help power the megasite and its tenants, including Ford’s massive BlueOval City electric vehicle and battery manufacturing campus.

The group wants to resurrect the Tennessee Power Distribution Company, a nonprofit, tax-exempt electricity generation and transmission “co-op of co-ops” created in 1999 in case local electricity distribution became an open market.

The power industry didn’t experience such a transition, so co-ops are considering other uses for the company, according to Mike Knotts, CEO of the Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, a group of 23 nonprofit electric co-ops that serve more than 2.5 million Tennesseans. The co-ops purchase their energy from TVA and distribute it locally to customers, accounting for about 25% of the federally-owned public utility’s annual revenue, Knotts said.

“This started back at Christmas Eve of 2022 when we experienced a first for our area — which was rolling blackouts — where there was simply not enough capacity to produce energy in the TVA service territory,” said Knotts, who also serves as Tennessee Power Distribution Company president. “So we as local utilities were called upon to, in rolling increments … turn your power off.”

Affordable, reliable and sustainable: report compares utility performance

Winter Storm Elliott plunged much of Tennessee into single-digit temperatures that year, and mechanical failure combined with historically high electricity demand resulted in the rolling blackouts. The utility made multiple changes to its emergency communications procedures and fortified its facilities to try to withstand frigid conditions the following year.

Knotts told members of the West Tennessee Megasite Authority on Wednesday that the group sought to ensure this would never happen again and landed on the idea of building a “peaking facility” themselves.

Such facilities are intended to operate only when electric consumption needs reach extreme highs, running about 10-20% of the year, Knotts said. The site would generate power using simple cycle combustion turbines powered by natural gas. These turbines do not generate steam and as a result have little discharge water.

The Tennessee Power Distribution Company would then sell that power to TVA to be distributed where it’s needed.

The long process ahead

The Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, with TVA’s cooperation, completed a site selection study to determine how and where the cooperative could “build assets to produce energy that could complement what TVA does and not disturb the contractual relationship between our cooperatives and TVA,” Knotts said.

The study focused on the Megasite property adjacent to the TVA substation — it’s close to transmission infrastructure, the interstate and a natural gas pipeline installed to serve BlueOval City.

Knotts said the group has had “fruitful” conversations with state officials, and it’s time to move on to more formal arrangements. The cooperative is negotiating with TVA, he said, and will soon start the roughly two-year process of applying to connect to the power transmission grid.

Ultimately, Knotts said the project would need a binding letter of intent and then a long-term lease agreement for the land from the Megasite Authority. The project also would need the blessing of the State Building Commission and must clear a federal interconnection study.

Several Megasite Authority board members posed questions about the proposed facility’s impact, including potential nitrous oxide emissions. Knotts said the facility would require an air quality permit from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.

The Megasite Authority board did not take formal action on the issue Wednesday, but each member of the board expressed interest in learning more about the proposal at a September meeting.

Knotts said while he does not speak for TVA, the utility has “stated publicly that it has a deficit for capacity,” in addition to a debt cap set by federal law limiting how many new generation projects TVA can take on.

“Plants like this are going to be built, so our members decided, jointly, we would rather do this, given our service mission, given we are nonprofit entities … than outsource it to a for-profit company,” he said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Power-line.jpeg,N,,2025-07-28 11:04:32.928817

These technologies are precisely what’s needed to power the mining zones that feed the world’s energy transition, while also extending services to local communities long left off the grid.","The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is home to over 70% of the world’s cobalt supplies and a significant share of copper and lithium – minerals essential for the clean energy transition. Yet grid access remains severely limited, with only around 20% of the population connected, while the vast majority of the DRC’s mineral-rich zones remain underserved by grid infrastructure.

In areas like Katanga, even large-scale industrial miners continue to rely on diesel generators and costly fuel imports, while smaller operators are excluded altogether from meaningful energy access. Despite global dependence on the DRC’s mineral output, the country’s power sector has long struggled with limited generation, aging transmission systems and fragmented oversight.

This year, momentum is building for a long-overdue transformation. In January 2025, the World Bank’s Mission 300 initiative reignited momentum around electrification across Africa. Among the countries pledging to dramatically scale up electricity access was the DRC, where new political will has converged with commercial opportunity. That same month, regional instability in the eastern provinces underscored how critical it is to invest not only in generation, but in resilient, distributed energy systems that can serve fragile communities and high-value industrial corridors alike.

In June, the World Bank greenlit a $250 million credit to support the first phase of the Inga 3 development program. Framed as the foundation of a $1 billion long-term initiative, the project aims to expand electrification from the current rate of 21% to 62% by 2030, with a focus on industrial corridors and under-served provinces. The announcement has brought renewed investor interest, not just in big hydro, but in smaller, scalable technologies that can plug directly into critical mining zones.

At the same time, new regional transmission deals are taking shape. In May 2025, the DRC and Zambia finalized plans for a 200-km cross-border power line to bring more hydropower into the Congolese Copperbelt. Shortly after, U.S.-based Hydro-Link and Mitrelli Group signed a $1.5 billion agreement to build a 1,150-km transmission line connecting Angola to southern DRC, aimed specifically at supplying mining and smelting operations. With construction expected to run through 2029, the project reflects a growing understanding that the DRC cannot grow its role in global supply chains without modern energy infrastructure to match.

It’s within this context that the U.S.–Africa Energy Forum (USAEF) takes place in Houston next month, bringing renewed attention to the role American firms can play in transforming Africa’s energy future – beginning in the DRC. The forum will feature the participation of DRC’s Minister of Hydraulic Resources and Electricity, Teddy Lwamba, who is expected to showcase the country’s ambitious new strategy to drive both industrial growth and universal electrification.

For Houston’s energy sector, diversifying and playing a leading role in grid resilience, clean technology and critical minerals is both natural and strategic. U.S. firms serve a role as key players in modular hydropower, battery-backed solar systems and microgrid development, which are not only faster to deploy than traditional utility-scale plants, but often more resilient in remote or unstable environments.

The Shenandoah floating production system (FPS), located approximately 241km off the coast of Louisiana at a water depth of around 5,800ft, is now operational. This facility has a nameplate capacity of 120,000bopd and 140 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd).

Designed to support regional resource development, the Shenandoah FPS will also accommodate resources from the Monument and Shenandoah South discoveries. Together with Shenandoah, these fields are projected to contain nearly 600 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe).

Beacon chairman and CEO Scott Gutterman said: “The Shenandoah first production milestone demonstrates Beacon’s ability to safely deliver industry leading developments in a cost-effective fashion. I would like to personally congratulate and thank our employees, contractors, and vendors for their tenacity, dedication, and technical expertise in delivering this important project.”

The Shenandoah FPS departed from HD Hyundai Heavy Industries’ shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, in December 2024 and subsequently arrived in the Gulf of America. In the same month, Beacon and its partners approved the next development stage at Shenandoah, termed Phase 2.

This second phase will involve drilling two additional wells, increasing throughput capacity to 140,000bopd through debottlenecking by early 2026, and installing a subsea booster pump to reduce well back pressure.

Additionally, Beacon has announced the approval of developing the Shenandoah South discovery in Walker Ridge 95, positioned in water depths of 5,800 to 6,000ft.

According to Beacon, the proximity to the Shenandoah FPS allows for cost-efficient development through a 4.8km flowline and riser connection. Initial production from the first well in Shenandoah South is anticipated in Q2 2028.",https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/07/FPS.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:59:38.105966

“We need clarity on the Building Energy Act’s future as quickly as possible,” Staudt said, adding that the government must not wait for upcoming EU regulation on building energy expected in 2026 before charting a course. Customers needed clarity on the future of emissions trading in the bloc, which will include the heating sector by 2027, and municipal heating plans, which are currently being drawn up across the country to adapt the use of climate-friendly technologies to local conditions.

Wildfire seasons are lengthening across Canada, and peat-rich regions sit near former industrial sites where pollution has already built up.","In short:

The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would overturn the “endangerment finding,” which has served as the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Former EPA officials and scientists warn that reversing the finding ignores mounting evidence of harm, including more frequent heatwaves, wildfires and billion-dollar disasters since 2009.

Environmental groups are expected to challenge the rule in court, citing a 2007 Supreme Court decision that established the EPA’s duty to regulate greenhouse gases.

Key quote:

“The science is clearcut, the impacts are clearcut and the law is clearcut. The challenge should be how we reduce emissions rather than debate whether there’s a problem.”

— Jason Burnett, former associate deputy administrator of the EPA during the George W. Bush administration

Why this matters:

Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in the atmosphere, driving rising temperatures, stronger storms, and widespread drought. In the United States, these shifts have fueled catastrophic floods, wildfires and crop failures that damage communities and strain public health systems. The endangerment finding has been the cornerstone of federal climate policy for more than a decade, enabling limits on pollution from vehicles and power plants. Rolling it back would remove one of the few nationwide tools for curbing emissions at a time when extreme weather is becoming more destructive and costly, and when scientists say warming trends are accelerating faster than earlier projections suggested.

In short:

The project aimed to reconnect the Mississippi River to wetlands in Plaquemines Parish, mimicking natural sediment flows to rebuild 20 square miles of land over 50 years.

Governor Jeff Landry opposed the plan, citing harm to local fisheries and costs; litigation and rising expenses also contributed to its cancellation.

Environmental advocates warn the decision weakens Louisiana’s defense against storms and sea-level rise as the Gulf’s water levels climb at twice the global rate.

Key quote:

“It shows that having good science, impeccable science — that isn’t enough anymore. Politics still trump the day.”

— James Karst, communications director for the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana

Why this matters:

Louisiana’s wetlands act as a natural shield against hurricanes and storm surges, absorbing energy before it reaches populated areas. Yet these marshes have been disappearing for decades as levees trap sediment upstream and seas rise faster than the global average. Without large-scale restoration, projections show the state could lose thousands of additional acres, eroding both ecosystems and cultural lifeways tied to fishing and oyster harvesting. As climate change accelerates land loss, decisions to cancel major projects highlight the tension between short-term economic concerns and the long-term survival of coastal communities and habitats.

In short:

The bill, introduced by four House members from both parties, would elevate FEMA to a Cabinet-level agency while allowing states more flexibility in handling smaller disasters.

The legislation proposes lump-sum disaster payments to states and a single streamlined assistance application to reduce bureaucracy.

The proposal comes as the Trump administration considers major changes to FEMA, including potential elimination of the agency.

Key quote:

“The solution is not to tear FEMA down — it’s to work across the aisle to build FEMA up.”

— Rep. Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.)

Why this matters:

FEMA plays a central role in responding to hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other disasters that are increasing in frequency and cost as the climate warms. Its structure determines how quickly aid reaches communities and how well federal and state governments coordinate in crises. Elevating the agency could give it more direct access to the president but may also raise questions about funding priorities and oversight, especially as Washington debates whether to shrink or reshape federal disaster programs. The outcome could affect not just emergency response but also how resilient communities are to future storms and heat waves, which have become more disruptive and deadly in recent years.

In short:

Federal hazard mitigation funds, which help states pay for warning systems and flood prevention, were denied in 16 of 18 disaster declarations under President Trump, including after deadly July floods in Texas.

A coalition of 20 states is suing the federal government over cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which lost $1 billion for flood control projects.

Experts warn that as climate-driven extreme rainfall grows more frequent, cutting proactive funding increases financial and human risks, especially in areas with unmapped floodplains.

Key quote:

“Mitigation is a lifeline. It’s a way out of a really bad cycle of disaster, damage, repair, damage that a lot of folks of modest means really can’t escape.”

— Chad Berginnis, head of the Association of State Floodplain Managers

Why this matters:

Hazard mitigation funding is one of the few tools communities have to prepare for disasters before they strike, rather than scrambling afterward. Without it, towns in flood-prone areas face spiraling cycles of destruction and rebuilding that drain public budgets and displace families repeatedly. Flood damages already cost the United States tens of billions each year, and scientists expect that price to climb as warming temperatures fuel heavier downpours. Pulling back on mitigation not only shifts costs to states and local governments but also deepens exposure for residents who can least afford recovery.

In short:

The Delaware River Basin Commission banned fracking in 2021, citing risks to drinking water for about 15 million people; activists say new federal and congressional actions threaten that protection.

A Republican lawmaker from Pennsylvania introduced legislation calling for a federal review of the commission, while the Army Corps of Engineers recently ended federal funding for its climate and equity programs.

The gas industry argues the ban violates landowners’ rights and ignores decades of regulated shale development, but studies show the region’s drinking water and forests are far more valuable than its gas reserves.

Key quote:

“The value, not just economic but civic and ecological, is many times more than the small amount of gas that’s up there.”

— Jerry Kauffman, director of the University of Delaware’s Water Resources Center

Why this matters:

The Delaware River Basin supplies drinking water to major cities including Philadelphia and Trenton, making it one of the East Coast’s most vital watersheds. Fracking brings high-volume water use, toxic chemical mixtures, and wastewater disposal challenges that have been linked to groundwater and air contamination in other shale regions. Even small leaks can spread across interconnected aquifers and rivers, threatening fish, farms, and downstream communities. Beyond local pollution, expanded gas drilling adds methane to the atmosphere, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. The basin’s forests and wetlands also buffer floods and filter pollutants, meaning any degradation could ripple through public health, ecosystems and regional economies for generations.

In short:

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump, repeals credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, ending most consumer clean energy incentives by Dec. 31.

Buyers of new and used EVs have until Sept. 30 to claim credits worth up to $7,500, while credits for rooftop solar, heat pumps and insulation expire at year’s end.

Experts warn that rushing purchases to beat deadlines can lead to poor decisions, but waiting may mean missing out on significant savings.

Key quote:

“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late. People are going to miss the chance.”

— Madeline Fleisher, energy attorney and co-founder of Electrify Central Ohio

Why this matters:

Federal tax credits have played a central role in helping families afford clean energy technologies like rooftop solar, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. Without them, upfront costs could become prohibitive for middle-class households, slowing the shift away from fossil fuels that drive climate change and air pollution. The sudden rollback comes as demand for clean energy is rising and utilities struggle to meet carbon reduction goals. Ending incentives mid-transition risks stalling new projects and straining industries built around these credits, while leaving consumers caught between high energy bills and fewer affordable options for reducing their carbon footprint.

In short:

Peatlands in northern Manitoba store carbon and toxic metals, including mercury, lead and arsenic, from a century of mining activity.

As climate change dries these wetlands, wildfires may unlock pollutants long trapped in the soil, potentially exposing residents to harmful smoke.

Scientists call for new studies and better air monitoring to understand and track health risks from this “pollution time bomb.”

Key quote:

The particles ""are literally the Trojan horse."" The smoke's ""health effects are much greater.""

— Michael Schindler, professor of earth sciences at the University of Manitoba

Why this matters:

Peatlands act like vaults, locking away carbon and metals accumulated over centuries. When they burn, those stores can vaporize into smoke, carrying toxins far beyond the fire zone. Wildfire seasons are lengthening across Canada, and peat-rich regions sit near former industrial sites where pollution has already built up. Toxic metals like mercury and lead pose neurological and cardiovascular risks, especially for children and pregnant women. Once airborne, they can travel thousands of miles, mixing with other urban pollutants and settling into waterways and soil. That means exposure isn’t just a local problem; it’s a continental one that ties climate-driven wildfires to public health far downstream.

China's rapid growth in green transition industries such as solar panel, wind turbine and electric vehicle manufacturing provides global consumers with access to affordable green technologies.
The future for China's green transition Will geopolitics hinder China's green transition or accelerate it?","Over the past 15 years, China has made significant progress towards meeting its green transition goals.

In 2024, China accounted for over 40% of global renewable energy capacity and invested $818 billion in its energy transition – more than double any other economy.

While geopolitics, regional conflicts, trade barriers and a shaky global economy have recently weakened global resolve on the green transition, experts believe China's transformation will continue.

""China is the birthplace of the global green industrial revolution,"" Professor Elizabeth Thurbon of the University of New South Wales in Sydney told me at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Tianjin in June 2025.

Thurbon heads up the Green Energy Statecraft Project, which brings together Australia's leading universities to explore ""a more ambitious, strategic approach"" to energy transition governance.

The idea of China as the cradle of the global green industrial revolution would have seemed far-fetched in 2013. I still remember standing atop an office tower in Beijing's Central Business District that year, unable to see across the street due to thick smog.

Fast forward a dozen years and China's green transformation has been remarkable.

Numbers tracked by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) show that in 2024, China accounted for over 40% of global renewable energy capacity and nearly 77% of Asia's total. BloombergNEF calculates that the Chinese mainland invested $818 billion in its energy transition in 2024 – more than double any other economy. By any measure, China is going big on green.

I asked Thurbon whether such massive investments are sustainable. She believes they are, noting that these investments build industries, generate revenues and create jobs.

Also at the Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions, China's Special Envoy for Climate Change, Liu Zhenmin, told me that China's commitment to its green transition is ""very solid and very firm"", regardless of global changes.

But even the firmest resolve does not make an arduous journey any less complex.

China's green transition goals

While many developed economies have 40 to 70 years to move from peak emissions to carbon neutrality, China aims to achieve this within 30 years – peaking before 2030 and reaching net zero before 2060.

China needs to get to net zero while maintaining energy security for 1.4 billion people and transforming the energy demands of the world's largest industrial base. It must continue urbanizing, reach modernization targets by 2035, phase down a coal-rich resource base and meet growing energy needs as living standards rise.

If the world's largest energy consumer can navigate these complexities and achieve its carbon goals, its entire energy system will be transformed. As Special Envoy Liu reminded participants at the Forum meeting, China wants non-fossil energy consumption to make up over 80% of its total energy mix by 2060.

Powerful forces are propelling China towards carbon neutrality.

Wider benefits of China's green transition

Thurbon believes the Chinese government sees the green energy transition as a ""massive national security multiplier"". This process is about more than cutting carbon emissions; it's about strengthening China's energy, economic, environmental, social and geostrategic security. These are strong incentives for China to achieve its dual carbon goals.

In her new co-authored book, Developmental Environmentalism, Thurbon describes North-East Asia's green transitions as a form of Schumpeterian ""creative destruction"", in which traditional processes are dismantled to make way for more innovative methods.

China is rapidly building up green energy industries – the ""creative"" side – while phasing down fossil fuels – the ""destructive"" side. This contrasts with many developed economies, which often debate phasing down fossil fuels without first investing in renewable systems.

China has an official term for this approach: xian li hou po (先立后破), meaning ""build first, break later"".

When we spoke at the Annual Meeting, Thurbon highlighted the challenge of sequencing, noting that balancing emissions reduction and energy security remains a delicate act. But China has learned to navigate this dynamic by rapidly expanding renewables capacity, accelerating hydropower and nuclear construction, and improving energy sector efficiency.

Global green transition progress

Although China's green transition is proceeding robustly, assessing the progress of the global green transition is becoming more difficult. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement on climate change. As he told me during meeting, China's climate envoy believes the international community can take pride that, for the first time, so many countries have committed to global carbon neutrality.

But was 2015 the apogee of international cooperation? Today, the storm clouds of geopolitics, regional conflicts, trade barriers and a shaky global economy are weakening resolve to act on climate change. Near-term challenges appear more pressing than distant targets.

Climate financing from developed economies plays a key role in crowding in private investment for climate projects in developing countries. Liu said that the upcoming COP30 in Belém, Brazil, might be one of the most difficult of the past 30 years. If the world fails to use the next three to five years to accelerate the green transition, he warned that the global cost will rise significantly.

China has made the global green transition more cost-effective. Yet affordable Chinese clean tech is sometimes viewed as an ""overcapacity"" problem. China's rapid growth in green transition industries such as solar panel, wind turbine and electric vehicle manufacturing provides global consumers with access to affordable green technologies. But the lower prices of these products compared to those made in the US or EU, for example, have triggered investigations, higher tariffs and market access restrictions in response to perceived trade imbalances.

Competitive tensions are one explanation for this. From a climate perspective, however, Thurbon argues: ""There is no overcapacity in cheap renewables until we reach 100% renewables globally"". When we spoke during the Forum conference, she noted that the demands of the energy transition are so enormous that countries will inevitably find opportunities for themselves – or as partners with China – to support their own green transitions.

The future for China's green transition

Will geopolitics hinder China's green transition or accelerate it? On one hand, technology and trade restrictions pose obstacles. On the other, they might motivate Beijing to speed up its green transformation.

Thurbon believes the evidence suggests these factors are acting as a motivating force. ""Since the eruption of the trade wars, we have seen China double down on its green transition,” she said.

When I asked her if a country as large and complex as China could become carbon negative – removing more CO₂ from the air than it emits – after achieving its carbon neutrality goal, she said she could only speculate. But she added: ""What I can say is that, when China has committed to a goal in the past, it has tended to reach it. So, while it would be hugely ambitious, it would not surprise me.”",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_f4yZ2KbWmfnqG38inooSNyBW2h25Vfv3me1Z8enwzZc.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 11:03:39.117385

The deal forms part of Meta’s broader strategy to power its data centre footprint with 100% renewable energy, while giving Enbridge a major boost in expanding its low-carbon energy portfolio.

The Clear Fork solar project, located near San Antonio, is currently under construction and is expected to operate by summer 2027.

Enbridge estimates the cost of the facility at US$900 million and will retain ownership of the asset. Under the agreement, Meta will offtake all electricity generated to support the company’s expanding data centre operations in the region.

“We are thrilled to partner with Enbridge to bring new renewable energy to Texas and help support our operations with 100% clean energy,” says Urvi Parekh, Meta’s Head of Global Energy.

The exact duration of the contract has not been disclosed. However, the structure provides long-term revenue certainty for Enbridge while also giving Meta a guaranteed renewable power source in a state that already hosts some of its largest hyperscale campuses.

Enbridge targets growth in data centre power markets

For Enbridge, best known for its natural gas infrastructure, Clear Fork reflects a growing pivot toward renewables and utility-scale power projects aligned with digital infrastructure customers.

""Clear Fork demonstrates the growing demand for renewable power across North America from blue-chip companies who are involved in technology and data centre operations,” says Matthew Akman, EVP Corporate Strategy & President of Renewable Power at Enbridge.

“Enbridge continues to advance its world-class renewables development portfolio using our financial strength, supply chain reach and construction expertise under a low-risk commercial model that delivers strong competitive returns.”

The project will add to Enbridge’s expanding renewable energy footprint in Texas. Earlier this year, the company brought online a 130MW solar project in Jim Wells County, also backed by a long-term PPA, this time with AT&T.

In addition to Clear Fork and the Jim Wells project, Enbridge is currently constructing another large-scale development in Texas. The Sequoia Solar project, located near Abilene, is expected to deliver 815MW once complete, making it one of the largest photovoltaic installations in the country.

Texas emerges as a critical renewable hub for hyperscalers

Meta’s investment is part of a wider trend across the data centre industry, as operators seek to manage soaring energy demand from AI and cloud workloads while meeting corporate sustainability targets.

In the past year alone, Meta has announced a string of solar power deals across Texas and other US states to secure clean energy for its data centre infrastructure.

In May, Meta signed two power agreements to offtake 650MW of solar capacity across AES sites in Texas and Kansas.

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) for the second quarter of 2025 substantially increased by around 64.3 percent to EUR 108.2 million (Q2/2024: EUR 65.8 million) with an improved EBITDA margin of 5.8 percent (Q2/2024: 3.5 percent).

""We delivered a strong second quarter, continuing our positive momentum from the beginning of the year. Our profitability levels further improved and we closed the quarter with a strong free cash flow, significantly up from last year. Looking ahead, I am confident for the remainder of the year. So far, our order intake momentum remains strong, reflecting consistent customer demand and confirming our solid competitive position in our markets. We are well prepared for the future, and our sustained performance we have achieved so far reinforces my confidence that we will maintain this positive trajectory and continue progressing toward our mid-term margin target,” explains José Luis Blanco, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Nordex Group.

Operational performance

In the second quarter of 2025, the Nordex Group secured 2,310 MW of order intake in the Projects segment (excluding service business), growing by 81.7 percent compared to previous year’s figure of 1,271 MW. Total value of new orders reached EUR 2.2 billion (Q2/2024: EUR 1.2 billion) and were received from 9 countries and span various turbine variants. The overall pricing remained stable with an ASP of EUR 0.97 m/MW in Q2/2025 (EUR 0.96 m/MW in Q2/2024). The rise in ASP reflects a shift in scope and regional composition, not an increase in underlying pricing.

As of the end of June 2025, the Nordex Group’s order book stood at EUR 14.3 billion, compared to EUR 11.0 billion in June 2024. The order book comprises EUR 8.9 billion (June 2024: EUR 6.9 billion) in the Projects segment and EUR 5.5 billion (June 2024: EUR 4.1 billion) in the Service segment.

Turbine production reached 1,586 MW in the second quarter of 2025, marking a decrease of 14.4 percent compared to last year (Q2/2024: 1,852 MW) driven by project scheduling. Rotor blade production increased by 8.1 percent to 1,399 units (Q2/2024: 1,294 units). Of these, 466 rotor blades were produced in-house (Q2/2024: 405), while 933 (Q2/2024: 889) were sourced from external suppliers.

The Nordex Group installed 337 wind turbines across 16 countries, totaling 1,959 MW in the second quarter of 2025. This compares to 365 wind turbines in 19 countries with a total output of 1,869 MW in Q2/2024. Of the installations carried out in the period under review (in MW), 87 percent were attributable to Europe, 10 percent to Latin America and 2 percent to the region “Rest of the World”.

Sales in the Projects segment were at around EUR 1.7 billion in the second quarter of the year and in line with Q2/2024. The Service segment experienced growth with sales increasing by 16.9 percent to EUR 206.9 million (Q2/2024: EUR 176.9 million).

Key financial figures at a glance

As of the end of June 2025, total assets remained on a steady level of approximately EUR 5.7 billion, consistent with year-end 2024. The equity ratio stood at 18.0 percent compared to 17.7 percent as of 31 December 2024. As of the reporting date, the Group cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 1,241.7 million (31 December 2024: EUR 1,151.4 million), leading to a healthy net cash position of EUR 941.9 million (31 December 2024: EUR 848.2 million). The working capital ratio as a percentage of consolidated sales was minus 7.5 percent (31 December 2024: minus 9.1 percent). In Q2/2025, the Nordex Group generated a positive free cash flow of EUR 145.1 million (Q2/2024: EUR 94.0 million) driven primarily by strong operational business.

Carbon sequestration involves the capture of carbon dioxide produced through industrial facilities and its injection deep underground into porous rock, with the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2022, the Indiana General Assembly passed legislation (HEA 1209-2022) to allow for carbon sequestration projects in Indiana, and in 2023, passed legislation (HEA 1626-2023) directing the DNR to adopt rules for their implementation.

The adopted rules establish permitting processes, operational requirements, and compliance standards for industry participants, as well as protections for neighboring landowners.

Currently, carbon sequestration projects in Indiana must be reviewed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for matters including safety and water quality protections before receiving federal Class VI construction and injection permits. These federal permits are required before companies can receive a carbon sequestration permit or a pipeline certificate of authority from the DNR.

The rules include:

Establishing application requirements for carbon sequestration project permits and carbon dioxide transmission pipeline certificates of authority, and defining timelines for review, approval, modification, and transfer of permits, as required by Indiana code.

Providing regulations that allow agreements between pore space owners and potential operations.

Ensuring alignment with the EPA’s Class VI well regulations to streamline federal and state permitting.

The Shenandoah development is being carried out in phases, with phase one consisting of the initial four wells.
Furthermore, Beacon has sanctioned the development of the Shenandoah South discovery, located in Walker Ridge 95 in water depths of 5,800–6,000ft.
The development plan for Shenandoah South includes drilling and completion of two wells, with the first expected to begin production in Q2 2028.
Beacon estimates that Shenandoah South holds 74mboe of proven and probable resources.","Beacon Offshore Energy has started oil and natural gas production from the Shenandoah field, offshore Louisiana, US.

The first of four wells began production on 25 July, with plans to increase phase one output during the third quarter (Q3) to an expected 100,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd).

The Shenandoah development is being carried out in phases, with phase one consisting of the initial four wells.

Phase two includes the addition of two more wells and a subsea booster pump. The fifth producer well is scheduled to be drilled and completed by mid-2026.

The Shenandoah floating production system (FPS) in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), with a nameplate capacity of 120,000bopd and 140 million cubic feet per day, is now operational.

Situated on Walker Ridge 52, around 150 miles offshore Louisiana in 5,800ft of water, the FPS is designed to act as a regional host facility.

It is expected to facilitate the development of additional resources including the Beacon-operated Monument and Shenandoah South discoveries. Combined, these resources are estimated to contain nearly 600 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe).

Located at reservoir depths of approximately 30,000ft true vertical depth, the Shenandoah reserves are being developed using high-pressure 20,000psi technology.

This approach is expected to aid in the development of other fields within the Inboard Wilcox trend.

Furthermore, Beacon has sanctioned the development of the Shenandoah South discovery, located in Walker Ridge 95 in water depths of 5,800–6,000ft.

This field is in close proximity to the Shenandoah FPS, allowing for a cost-effective subsea tieback development through a three-mile flowline and a dedicated riser connection.

The development plan for Shenandoah South includes drilling and completion of two wells, with the first expected to begin production in Q2 2028.

Beacon estimates that Shenandoah South holds 74mboe of proven and probable resources.

In this venture, Beacon is collaborating with Houston Energy, HEQ Deepwater and Navitas Petroleum.

Beacon chairman and CEO Scott Gutterman said: “The Shenandoah first production milestone demonstrates Beacon’s ability to safely deliver industry-leading developments in a cost-effective fashion.

“I would like to personally congratulate and thank our employees, contractors and vendors for their tenacity, dedication and technical expertise in delivering this important project. We further appreciate the shared vision and support from our partners Navitas and HEQ, as well as our capital providers.”",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2025/07/Oil-field-shutterstock_1687308142.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 08:04:02.397652

The massive computing facilities have a sprawling footprint in Northern Virginia that has quickly inflated power demand in that region.","Last week’s energy auction by multistate power grid operator PJM will cause most Marylanders’ monthly electric bills to go up $2 to $5 next summer — but that’s on top of other costs, for transmission, fuel and more, that one advocate calls “death by a thousand cuts.”

It’s also the latest evidence, say ratepayer advocates and policymakers, that policies of PJM, the grid operator in a 13-state region that includes Maryland, are out of whack.

The latest of the “thousand cuts” is mostly the result of energy-guzzling data centers, David Lapp, the Maryland People’s Counsel, who is charged with representing state ratepayers. Predictions for their proliferation are largely behind inflated projections of energy demand in PJM states, pushing demand past supply in the auction process, sending the price skyward.

And ultimately, consumers pay the price.

“It’s fundamentally unfair,” Lapp said. “Why should residential customers be responsible for costs being driven by some of the biggest and wealthiest corporations in the world?”

At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with a backlogged queue for energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.

“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.

All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.

This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.

Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was behind a new cap on the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) supported Shapiro’s appeal.

As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”

During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.

But Peltier said that ignores key context.

“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.

When it comes to bill increases from the capacity auction, BGE customers are the exception. The segment of their bills tied to the auction will actually go down an estimated $3.36 per month, according to Office of People’s Counsel calculations.

But that’s really only because their rates soared so high after last year’s capacity auction at PJM.

PJM forced a Baltimore-area coal-fired plant, Brandon Shores, and oil-burning plant, H.A. Wagner, to keep running beyond their announced closure dates. But PJM’s rules kept that power out of the 2024 auction, suppressing expected supply at a time of surging demand.

This time, after urging from Lapp’s office and others, the rules were changed so that power from the two older plants was counted. And BGE customers will actually receive a credit for any revenue that the plants’ owner, Talen Energy, receives from the auction, Lapp said, lowering their bills, contrary to initial predictions from PJM.

But their monthly electric bills will still be up $16 from two auctions ago.

Changes inside PJM?

In a July 16 letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Moore and Shapiro — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.

With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.

“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.

In a July 18 response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.

“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”

He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.

In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”

Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.

“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”

Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.

Maryland fires back against EPA claims about its offshore wind permit

“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.

In a statement Thursday, Moore spokesman Carter Elliott IV wrote that Moore is “demanding reform and a meaningful voice for states in PJM governance, which is why a bipartisan group of governors’ staff met with PJM members” on Wednesday, including Moore’s staff.

A spokesman for PJM pointed to a fact sheet describing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.

Data center debacle

When she hears ominous predictions for data center demand on the PJM grid, Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) is skeptical.

The massive computing facilities have a sprawling footprint in Northern Virginia that has quickly inflated power demand in that region. But it remains an open question how widespread they will become, she said.

“You have the data centers that are sort of playing the field. There’s a real question right now about: Are we overcounting data center load? If the same data center is checking out five different locations, how are we sure?” said Charkoudian, who closely studies energy issues and is frequently behind energy legislation in the General Assembly.

It’s part of the reason she was dismayed to see Moore veto two bills that would have studied energy issues, citing their cost. One bill created a Strategic Energy Planning Office in Maryland, focused on predicting future energy issues without relying on PJM and utility companies; the second studied data centers specifically.

“Right now we’re continually caught flat-footed,” said Charkoudian, who added that she supports veto overrides for those bills.

Lapp said he also worries that data center projections are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.

That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.

“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.

It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.

“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-101/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/24939291736_45f49745b0_o1753701626.jpg?h=0e753701&itok=wcD8zWkv,N,,2025-07-28 08:03:36.668664

Wildfire seasons are lengthening across Canada, and peat-rich regions sit near former industrial sites where pollution has already built up.","In short:

The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would overturn the “endangerment finding,” which has served as the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Former EPA officials and scientists warn that reversing the finding ignores mounting evidence of harm, including more frequent heatwaves, wildfires and billion-dollar disasters since 2009.

Environmental groups are expected to challenge the rule in court, citing a 2007 Supreme Court decision that established the EPA’s duty to regulate greenhouse gases.

Key quote:

“The science is clearcut, the impacts are clearcut and the law is clearcut. The challenge should be how we reduce emissions rather than debate whether there’s a problem.”

— Jason Burnett, former associate deputy administrator of the EPA during the George W. Bush administration

Why this matters:

Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in the atmosphere, driving rising temperatures, stronger storms, and widespread drought. In the United States, these shifts have fueled catastrophic floods, wildfires and crop failures that damage communities and strain public health systems. The endangerment finding has been the cornerstone of federal climate policy for more than a decade, enabling limits on pollution from vehicles and power plants. Rolling it back would remove one of the few nationwide tools for curbing emissions at a time when extreme weather is becoming more destructive and costly, and when scientists say warming trends are accelerating faster than earlier projections suggested.

In short:

The bill, introduced by four House members from both parties, would elevate FEMA to a Cabinet-level agency while allowing states more flexibility in handling smaller disasters.

The legislation proposes lump-sum disaster payments to states and a single streamlined assistance application to reduce bureaucracy.

The proposal comes as the Trump administration considers major changes to FEMA, including potential elimination of the agency.

Key quote:

“The solution is not to tear FEMA down — it’s to work across the aisle to build FEMA up.”

— Rep. Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.)

Why this matters:

FEMA plays a central role in responding to hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other disasters that are increasing in frequency and cost as the climate warms. Its structure determines how quickly aid reaches communities and how well federal and state governments coordinate in crises. Elevating the agency could give it more direct access to the president but may also raise questions about funding priorities and oversight, especially as Washington debates whether to shrink or reshape federal disaster programs. The outcome could affect not just emergency response but also how resilient communities are to future storms and heat waves, which have become more disruptive and deadly in recent years.

In short:

Federal hazard mitigation funds, which help states pay for warning systems and flood prevention, were denied in 16 of 18 disaster declarations under President Trump, including after deadly July floods in Texas.

A coalition of 20 states is suing the federal government over cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which lost $1 billion for flood control projects.

Experts warn that as climate-driven extreme rainfall grows more frequent, cutting proactive funding increases financial and human risks, especially in areas with unmapped floodplains.

Key quote:

“Mitigation is a lifeline. It’s a way out of a really bad cycle of disaster, damage, repair, damage that a lot of folks of modest means really can’t escape.”

— Chad Berginnis, head of the Association of State Floodplain Managers

Why this matters:

Hazard mitigation funding is one of the few tools communities have to prepare for disasters before they strike, rather than scrambling afterward. Without it, towns in flood-prone areas face spiraling cycles of destruction and rebuilding that drain public budgets and displace families repeatedly. Flood damages already cost the United States tens of billions each year, and scientists expect that price to climb as warming temperatures fuel heavier downpours. Pulling back on mitigation not only shifts costs to states and local governments but also deepens exposure for residents who can least afford recovery.

In short:

The Delaware River Basin Commission banned fracking in 2021, citing risks to drinking water for about 15 million people; activists say new federal and congressional actions threaten that protection.

A Republican lawmaker from Pennsylvania introduced legislation calling for a federal review of the commission, while the Army Corps of Engineers recently ended federal funding for its climate and equity programs.

The gas industry argues the ban violates landowners’ rights and ignores decades of regulated shale development, but studies show the region’s drinking water and forests are far more valuable than its gas reserves.

Key quote:

“The value, not just economic but civic and ecological, is many times more than the small amount of gas that’s up there.”

— Jerry Kauffman, director of the University of Delaware’s Water Resources Center

Why this matters:

The Delaware River Basin supplies drinking water to major cities including Philadelphia and Trenton, making it one of the East Coast’s most vital watersheds. Fracking brings high-volume water use, toxic chemical mixtures, and wastewater disposal challenges that have been linked to groundwater and air contamination in other shale regions. Even small leaks can spread across interconnected aquifers and rivers, threatening fish, farms, and downstream communities. Beyond local pollution, expanded gas drilling adds methane to the atmosphere, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. The basin’s forests and wetlands also buffer floods and filter pollutants, meaning any degradation could ripple through public health, ecosystems and regional economies for generations.

In short:

The AI action plan would exempt AI data centers from National Environmental Policy Act reviews and streamline permits under major environmental laws, while opening federal lands for their construction.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright framed the initiative as a “next Manhattan Project,” while groups like Food & Water Watch and the Southern Environmental Law Center warned it would extend reliance on fossil fuels and reduce community oversight.

Data centers already consume vast energy and water, and studies project their pollution could cause over 1,300 premature deaths annually by 2030, with disproportionate impacts in Black communities near facilities such as Elon Musk’s xAI site in Memphis.

Key quote:

“All too often, big corporations like xAI treat our communities and families like obstacles to be pushed aside. We cannot afford to normalize this kind of environmental injustice.”

— Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People

Why this matters:

Artificial intelligence development depends on sprawling data centers that devour power and water, often tethered to fossil fuel grids. These facilities can release air pollutants linked to respiratory illness and greenhouse gases that drive climate change. Communities near such sites — frequently low-income or minority neighborhoods — face heightened exposure without clear avenues to challenge siting decisions. The federal move to relax environmental review could speed construction but risks sidelining public health protections as the industry’s energy demands surge. By 2028, projected electricity use and water needs for AI servers could rival those of entire nations, amplifying tensions between technological ambition and environmental limits.

In short:

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump, repeals credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, ending most consumer clean energy incentives by Dec. 31.

Buyers of new and used EVs have until Sept. 30 to claim credits worth up to $7,500, while credits for rooftop solar, heat pumps and insulation expire at year’s end.

Experts warn that rushing purchases to beat deadlines can lead to poor decisions, but waiting may mean missing out on significant savings.

Key quote:

“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late. People are going to miss the chance.”

— Madeline Fleisher, energy attorney and co-founder of Electrify Central Ohio

Why this matters:

Federal tax credits have played a central role in helping families afford clean energy technologies like rooftop solar, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. Without them, upfront costs could become prohibitive for middle-class households, slowing the shift away from fossil fuels that drive climate change and air pollution. The sudden rollback comes as demand for clean energy is rising and utilities struggle to meet carbon reduction goals. Ending incentives mid-transition risks stalling new projects and straining industries built around these credits, while leaving consumers caught between high energy bills and fewer affordable options for reducing their carbon footprint.

In short:

Peatlands in northern Manitoba store carbon and toxic metals, including mercury, lead and arsenic, from a century of mining activity.

As climate change dries these wetlands, wildfires may unlock pollutants long trapped in the soil, potentially exposing residents to harmful smoke.

Scientists call for new studies and better air monitoring to understand and track health risks from this “pollution time bomb.”

Key quote:

The particles ""are literally the Trojan horse."" The smoke's ""health effects are much greater.""

— Michael Schindler, professor of earth sciences at the University of Manitoba

Why this matters:

Peatlands act like vaults, locking away carbon and metals accumulated over centuries. When they burn, those stores can vaporize into smoke, carrying toxins far beyond the fire zone. Wildfire seasons are lengthening across Canada, and peat-rich regions sit near former industrial sites where pollution has already built up. Toxic metals like mercury and lead pose neurological and cardiovascular risks, especially for children and pregnant women. Once airborne, they can travel thousands of miles, mixing with other urban pollutants and settling into waterways and soil. That means exposure isn’t just a local problem; it’s a continental one that ties climate-driven wildfires to public health far downstream.

The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would overturn the “endangerment finding,” which has served as the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Former EPA officials and scientists warn that reversing the finding ignores mounting evidence of harm, including more frequent heatwaves, wildfires and billion-dollar disasters since 2009.

Environmental groups are expected to challenge the rule in court, citing a 2007 Supreme Court decision that established the EPA’s duty to regulate greenhouse gases.

Key quote:

“The science is clearcut, the impacts are clearcut and the law is clearcut. The challenge should be how we reduce emissions rather than debate whether there’s a problem.”

— Jason Burnett, former associate deputy administrator of the EPA during the George W. Bush administration

Why this matters:

Greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane trap heat in the atmosphere, driving rising temperatures, stronger storms, and widespread drought. In the United States, these shifts have fueled catastrophic floods, wildfires and crop failures that damage communities and strain public health systems. The endangerment finding has been the cornerstone of federal climate policy for more than a decade, enabling limits on pollution from vehicles and power plants. Rolling it back would remove one of the few nationwide tools for curbing emissions at a time when extreme weather is becoming more destructive and costly, and when scientists say warming trends are accelerating faster than earlier projections suggested.

The project aimed to reconnect the Mississippi River to wetlands in Plaquemines Parish, mimicking natural sediment flows to rebuild 20 square miles of land over 50 years.

Governor Jeff Landry opposed the plan, citing harm to local fisheries and costs; litigation and rising expenses also contributed to its cancellation.

Environmental advocates warn the decision weakens Louisiana’s defense against storms and sea-level rise as the Gulf’s water levels climb at twice the global rate.

Key quote:

“It shows that having good science, impeccable science — that isn’t enough anymore. Politics still trump the day.”

— James Karst, communications director for the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana

Why this matters:

Louisiana’s wetlands act as a natural shield against hurricanes and storm surges, absorbing energy before it reaches populated areas. Yet these marshes have been disappearing for decades as levees trap sediment upstream and seas rise faster than the global average. Without large-scale restoration, projections show the state could lose thousands of additional acres, eroding both ecosystems and cultural lifeways tied to fishing and oyster harvesting. As climate change accelerates land loss, decisions to cancel major projects highlight the tension between short-term economic concerns and the long-term survival of coastal communities and habitats.

In short:

The bill, introduced by four House members from both parties, would elevate FEMA to a Cabinet-level agency while allowing states more flexibility in handling smaller disasters.

The legislation proposes lump-sum disaster payments to states and a single streamlined assistance application to reduce bureaucracy.

The proposal comes as the Trump administration considers major changes to FEMA, including potential elimination of the agency.

Key quote:

“The solution is not to tear FEMA down — it’s to work across the aisle to build FEMA up.”

— Rep. Greg Stanton (D-Ariz.)

Why this matters:

FEMA plays a central role in responding to hurricanes, wildfires, floods and other disasters that are increasing in frequency and cost as the climate warms. Its structure determines how quickly aid reaches communities and how well federal and state governments coordinate in crises. Elevating the agency could give it more direct access to the president but may also raise questions about funding priorities and oversight, especially as Washington debates whether to shrink or reshape federal disaster programs. The outcome could affect not just emergency response but also how resilient communities are to future storms and heat waves, which have become more disruptive and deadly in recent years.

In short:

Federal hazard mitigation funds, which help states pay for warning systems and flood prevention, were denied in 16 of 18 disaster declarations under President Trump, including after deadly July floods in Texas.

A coalition of 20 states is suing the federal government over cuts to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which lost $1 billion for flood control projects.

Experts warn that as climate-driven extreme rainfall grows more frequent, cutting proactive funding increases financial and human risks, especially in areas with unmapped floodplains.

Key quote:

“Mitigation is a lifeline. It’s a way out of a really bad cycle of disaster, damage, repair, damage that a lot of folks of modest means really can’t escape.”

— Chad Berginnis, head of the Association of State Floodplain Managers

Why this matters:

Hazard mitigation funding is one of the few tools communities have to prepare for disasters before they strike, rather than scrambling afterward. Without it, towns in flood-prone areas face spiraling cycles of destruction and rebuilding that drain public budgets and displace families repeatedly. Flood damages already cost the United States tens of billions each year, and scientists expect that price to climb as warming temperatures fuel heavier downpours. Pulling back on mitigation not only shifts costs to states and local governments but also deepens exposure for residents who can least afford recovery.

In short:

The Delaware River Basin Commission banned fracking in 2021, citing risks to drinking water for about 15 million people; activists say new federal and congressional actions threaten that protection.

A Republican lawmaker from Pennsylvania introduced legislation calling for a federal review of the commission, while the Army Corps of Engineers recently ended federal funding for its climate and equity programs.

The gas industry argues the ban violates landowners’ rights and ignores decades of regulated shale development, but studies show the region’s drinking water and forests are far more valuable than its gas reserves.

Key quote:

“The value, not just economic but civic and ecological, is many times more than the small amount of gas that’s up there.”

— Jerry Kauffman, director of the University of Delaware’s Water Resources Center

Why this matters:

The Delaware River Basin supplies drinking water to major cities including Philadelphia and Trenton, making it one of the East Coast’s most vital watersheds. Fracking brings high-volume water use, toxic chemical mixtures, and wastewater disposal challenges that have been linked to groundwater and air contamination in other shale regions. Even small leaks can spread across interconnected aquifers and rivers, threatening fish, farms, and downstream communities. Beyond local pollution, expanded gas drilling adds methane to the atmosphere, a potent greenhouse gas that accelerates climate change. The basin’s forests and wetlands also buffer floods and filter pollutants, meaning any degradation could ripple through public health, ecosystems and regional economies for generations.

In short:

The AI action plan would exempt AI data centers from National Environmental Policy Act reviews and streamline permits under major environmental laws, while opening federal lands for their construction.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright framed the initiative as a “next Manhattan Project,” while groups like Food & Water Watch and the Southern Environmental Law Center warned it would extend reliance on fossil fuels and reduce community oversight.

Data centers already consume vast energy and water, and studies project their pollution could cause over 1,300 premature deaths annually by 2030, with disproportionate impacts in Black communities near facilities such as Elon Musk’s xAI site in Memphis.

Key quote:

“All too often, big corporations like xAI treat our communities and families like obstacles to be pushed aside. We cannot afford to normalize this kind of environmental injustice.”

— Derrick Johnson, president and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People

Why this matters:

Artificial intelligence development depends on sprawling data centers that devour power and water, often tethered to fossil fuel grids. These facilities can release air pollutants linked to respiratory illness and greenhouse gases that drive climate change. Communities near such sites — frequently low-income or minority neighborhoods — face heightened exposure without clear avenues to challenge siting decisions. The federal move to relax environmental review could speed construction but risks sidelining public health protections as the industry’s energy demands surge. By 2028, projected electricity use and water needs for AI servers could rival those of entire nations, amplifying tensions between technological ambition and environmental limits.

In short:

Peatlands in northern Manitoba store carbon and toxic metals, including mercury, lead and arsenic, from a century of mining activity.

As climate change dries these wetlands, wildfires may unlock pollutants long trapped in the soil, potentially exposing residents to harmful smoke.

Scientists call for new studies and better air monitoring to understand and track health risks from this “pollution time bomb.”

Key quote:

The particles ""are literally the Trojan horse."" The smoke's ""health effects are much greater.""

— Michael Schindler, professor of earth sciences at the University of Manitoba

Why this matters:

Peatlands act like vaults, locking away carbon and metals accumulated over centuries. When they burn, those stores can vaporize into smoke, carrying toxins far beyond the fire zone. Wildfire seasons are lengthening across Canada, and peat-rich regions sit near former industrial sites where pollution has already built up. Toxic metals like mercury and lead pose neurological and cardiovascular risks, especially for children and pregnant women. Once airborne, they can travel thousands of miles, mixing with other urban pollutants and settling into waterways and soil.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump, repeals credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, ending most consumer clean energy incentives by Dec. 31.

Buyers of new and used EVs have until Sept. 30 to claim credits worth up to $7,500, while credits for rooftop solar, heat pumps and insulation expire at year’s end.

Experts warn that rushing purchases to beat deadlines can lead to poor decisions, but waiting may mean missing out on significant savings.

Key quote:

Why this matters:

Federal tax credits have played a central role in helping families afford clean energy technologies like rooftop solar, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. Without them, upfront costs could become prohibitive for middle-class households, slowing the shift away from fossil fuels that drive climate change and air pollution. The sudden rollback comes as demand for clean energy is rising and utilities struggle to meet carbon reduction goals. Ending incentives mid-transition risks stalling new projects and straining industries built around these credits, while leaving consumers caught between high energy bills and fewer affordable options for reducing their carbon footprint.

At the same time, consumer advocates say PJM policies have restricted supply, with a backlogged queue for energy projects, many of them renewable energy proposals.

“Until there’s actual queue reform, there’s not going to be real relief,” said Emily Scarr, a senior adviser for Maryland PIRG, or Public Interest Research Group.

All eyes were on this year’s auction because last year’s was a blockbuster: The clearing price jumped 800% compared to the 2023 auction, setting a record for the most expensive such auction in PJM history.

This year’s auction surpassed that record, but it was offset by policies that consumer advocates — and some governors — pushed PJM to adopt.

Energy bills likely to tick up again in 2026 after electricity auction clears at maximum price

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) was behind a new cap on the auction’s clearing price. The auction hit the cap, saving consumers about $2.9 billion in total costs on their bills. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) supported Shapiro’s appeal.

As various parts of energy bills increase, grid decision-makers don’t seem to be asking a key question, says Laurel Peltier, a low-income ratepayer advocate for the AARP: “Can people afford this?”

During a news conference Tuesday, Stu Bresler, a PJM executive vice president of market services and strategy, said that auction costs are a “small part of retail bills, and it also varies” how auction costs translate into rate changes for consumers.

But Peltier said that ignores key context.

“That’s like being in a bakery, and you know that the flour got more expensive, the butter got more expensive, the labor got more expensive, and you’re the egg maker, and your eggs are 800% more, and you’re like, ‘It’s OK. It’s just a little part,’” Peltier said.

When it comes to bill increases from the capacity auction, BGE customers are the exception. The segment of their bills tied to the auction will actually go down an estimated $3.36 per month, according to Office of People’s Counsel calculations.

But that’s really only because their rates soared so high after last year’s capacity auction at PJM.

PJM forced a Baltimore-area coal-fired plant, Brandon Shores, and oil-burning plant, H.A. Wagner, to keep running beyond their announced closure dates. But PJM’s rules kept that power out of the 2024 auction, suppressing expected supply at a time of surging demand.

This time, after urging from Lapp’s office and others, the rules were changed so that power from the two older plants was counted. And BGE customers will actually receive a credit for any revenue that the plants’ owner, Talen Energy, receives from the auction, Lapp said, lowering their bills, contrary to initial predictions from PJM.

But their monthly electric bills will still be up $16 from two auctions ago.

Changes inside PJM?

In a July 16 letter to PJM, a bipartisan group of nine governors in PJM’s 13-state territory — including Moore and Shapiro — said the moment presents an opportunity for change.

With the “abrupt termination of two long-standing members of the Board of Managers and the imminent departure of the CEO,” their replacements must “understand the concerns of ratepayers facing rising costs,” and create “a more collaborative and more effective ethos” at PJM, the governors wrote.

“In the past, other regions looked to join PJM due to its many strengths; today, across the region, discussions of leaving PJM are becoming increasingly common,” read their letter.

In a July 18 response, PJM Board of Managers Chairman David Mills pushed back.

“Our operators are keeping the lights on through some of the most challenging circumstances that any grid operator, anywhere, has faced in its history,” he wrote. “We also continue the necessary function of operating regional markets as well as planning for a grid that is seeing an explosion of demand growth at the same time that state and federal policies have pushed a meaningful amount of generation capacity into retirement.”

He listed a number of changes PJM has made to its auction “to address concerns raised by our states,” including the “temporary” cap.

In a statement announcing the auction results Tuesday, PJM wrote that it “continues to focus on enhancing its process for connecting new generation resources onto the system, which includes clearing all the projects in its transition queue over the next 18 months, opening its new cycle process in spring 2026, and leveraging artificial intelligence through our partnership with Google to reduce processing time.”

Regime change may help, but some advocates warn that more transformative change may be necessary to lower prices. That includes changing how the organization is governed, Lapp said.

“We and the 13 other state consumer advocate offices in PJM — we get one vote. There are transmission-owning utilities that have more votes than us together,” Lapp said. “It’s the transmission owners that wield the most influence at PJM.”

Those same companies generally lose out when more power generation comes online, Scarr said.

“The legacy power plants lose out when that happens — but they’re the ones managing the ship,” Scarr said.

In a statement Thursday, Moore spokesman Carter Elliott IV wrote that Moore is “demanding reform and a meaningful voice for states in PJM governance, which is why a bipartisan group of governors’ staff met with PJM members” on Wednesday, including Moore’s staff.

A spokesman for PJM pointed to a fact sheet describing the grid operator’s governance structure, which highlights that PJM’s 10-member Board of Managers must not be financially tied to any PJM member. But on the member’s committee, which includes about 1,000 members, votes are divided between five industry sectors. State consumer advocates are the other voting members.

Data center debacle

When she hears ominous predictions for data center demand on the PJM grid, Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) is skeptical.

The massive computing facilities have a sprawling footprint in Northern Virginia that has quickly inflated power demand in that region. But it remains an open question how widespread they will become, she said.

“You have the data centers that are sort of playing the field. There’s a real question right now about: Are we overcounting data center load? If the same data center is checking out five different locations, how are we sure?” said Charkoudian, who closely studies energy issues and is frequently behind energy legislation in the General Assembly.

It’s part of the reason she was dismayed to see Moore veto two bills that would have studied energy issues, citing their cost. One bill created a Strategic Energy Planning Office in Maryland, focused on predicting future energy issues without relying on PJM and utility companies; the second studied data centers specifically.

“Right now we’re continually caught flat-footed,” said Charkoudian, who added that she supports veto overrides for those bills.

Lapp said he also worries that data center projections are overblown because technology could be advancing to increase power efficiency at the facilities, which are full of computer servers that require immense amounts of energy to run and to keep from overheating.

That’s a major reason why data centers themselves should be footing the bill for their own power demand, and the upgrades to the power system they may require, Lapp said.

“If the data centers aren’t responsible for paying for all the costs that they are driving, they have much less incentive to find more computer chips, to operate more efficiently, to reduce their own costs,” he said.

It’s PJM’s job to change the paradigm, wherein ratepayers pay for enhancing the electric system, he said.

“It’s an unprecedented period of time in the industry, when you have city-sized demand being built up in just a few years,” Lapp said. “You can’t treat that the same as load growth gradually occurring over time.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/24939291736_45f49745b0_o.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 11:04:41.284669

Dan Gearino reports for Inside Climate News.

In short:

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump, repeals credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, ending most consumer clean energy incentives by Dec. 31.

Buyers of new and used EVs have until Sept. 30 to claim credits worth up to $7,500, while credits for rooftop solar, heat pumps and insulation expire at year’s end.

Experts warn that rushing purchases to beat deadlines can lead to poor decisions, but waiting may mean missing out on significant savings.

Without them, upfront costs could become prohibitive for middle-class households, slowing the shift away from fossil fuels that drive climate change and air pollution.

Oliver Milman reports for The Guardian.

In short:

The Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal would overturn the “endangerment finding,” which has served as the legal basis for regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act.

Former EPA officials and scientists warn that reversing the finding ignores mounting evidence of harm, including more frequent heatwaves, wildfires and billion-dollar disasters since 2009.

Environmental groups are expected to challenge the rule in court, citing a 2007 Supreme Court decision that established the EPA’s duty to regulate greenhouse gases.

Announced earlier this month, the ECG has been introduced as a way of stimulating EV sales in the UK, following a period of stagnation since the previous government’s Plug-in Car Grant (PiCG) was pulled in 2022.

The new ECG, backed by £650 million of government funding, will yield a discount for qualifying cars of either £1500 or £3750, depending on their environmental impact.

To qualify, car manufacturers themselves must meet science-backed emissions targets, while the individual model lines must start at below £37,000 in entry-level trim.

Which discount a model receives is determined by how much CO2 is emitted in an EV's production, assessing the energy used in vehicle assembly as well as battery manufacturing. Threshold levels have yet to be made public.

While any manufacturer can apply for their car to be included in the scheme, it's thought that, due to this criteria, cars produced in Asian countries, such as China, South Korea and Japan, will not be eligible for the ECG.

This would include cars from Hyundai, MG and GMW – all three of which have already launched their own equivalent discounts, likely pre-empting that their cars will be denied access to the ECG.

Below are the discounts already being offered by car makers as they await the results of the ECG applications.

Alfa Romeo

The Alfa Romeo Junior Elettrica – the Italian marque’s first EV – can now be had with £1500 off its list price. This leaves the Polish-made compact crossover retailing for £32,405.

“Slate taps into that.” Traditional carmakers and start-ups have found mixed success rolling out larger electric pickup trucks in recent years.","When Will Haseltine saw images online of a small, boxy electric pickup from start-up Slate Auto earlier this year he immediately got onto the waiting list. The sparse interior and crank windows reminded him of the no-frills pickups he grew up with in Memphis, Tennessee — but he was most enamoured with the sub-$20,000 (R357,069) price tag.

That price, though, factored in a $7,500 (R133,904) federal tax break, which is set, a casualty of the budget package US President Donald Trump signed into law earlier this month. Now Haseltine isn’t sure the truck will fit his budget when it comes out, expected late next year.

“The Slate was the first time I looked at a car, wanted it, and could also make it happen,” said Haseltine, a 39-year-old musical instrument technician. Without the tax credit, he said: “That's just plain too much.”

Michigan-based Slate has raised $700m (R12.49bn) from investors, including Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, and has racked up more than 100,000 reservations for its cars. But the company is launching into a tough US market.

A few years ago hopeful entrepreneurs were looking to cash in on the global transition to electric cars. But US electric vehicle (EV) sales growth has cooled as consumer interest has faded. The loss of federal tax breaks will further hurt demand, car executives and analysts predict.

Like other EV start-ups, Slate probably faces a long road to profitability. The EV business has proven to be a money loser for most industry players, partly because batteries remain relatively expensive. Even in China, where smaller, inexpensive EVs have proliferated and companies enjoy a cost advantage over Western carmakers, most are unprofitable.

Slate founders believe the company can overcome those obstacles by offering something that is in short supply in today’s US car market: affordability. The average new vehicle selling price is above $45,000 (R803,504).

“We are building the affordable vehicle that has long been promised but never delivered,” Slate CEO Chris Barman said at a Detroit conference in July.

The company has a chance to fill a void left by Tesla, on plans to introduce a mid-$20k EV.

The start-up has taken a bare bones approach to its two-seat pickup, which is slightly smaller than a Honda Civic hatchback. How bare bones? A music system and power windows will cost extra. Slate hasn't disclosed the cost of such add-ons.

Slate’s creation started with an idea from Miles Arnone, the CEO of Re:Build Manufacturing, a Massachusetts-based start-up that includes several former Amazon employees.

Arnone believed workers needed better access to affordable vehicles.

Arnone shared his idea with Jeff Wilke, the company’s chairman and a former Amazon executive, and eventually, a small team was formed. The group hired Barman, who spent most of her career as an engineering executive at Fiat Chrysler, now part of Stellantis.

Barman told Reuters recently Slate will be able to absorb tax credit because the pickup's price will still undercut competitors.

The company plans to build the pickup at an old catalogue factory in Warsaw, Indiana. Executives are taking steps to hold down costs, starting with a simplified design that uses about 500 parts in the pickup's assembly, compared with a few thousand for a traditional pickup.

The plan to build all its pickups in a basic package — what the company calls an “SKU of one” — allows customers to choose to add a music system, centre console, special lighting and other features later.

The pickup will be built with composite body panels in grey, with an option for a vinyl wrap. That will sidestep the need for a paint shop, which is one of the most expensive investments in a typical car factory.

Slate’s minimalist approach is a leap of faith that Americans will forgo creature comforts they have been increasingly willing to splurge on. Last year, US buyers spent 33% above the base price on average, springing for higher-end trim packages and extra features, according to Edmunds.com. That was up from 28% in 2014.

But there is mounting evidence that new cars are becoming out of reach for many Americans. That could worsen under the effects of the Trump administration’s tariffs, which threaten to increase prices on popular budget cars from Korea and elsewhere.

From that standpoint, Slate’s price conscious pickup might be hitting at the right time, said Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific.

“There's a growing appetite, especially among younger drivers, for vehicles that are more honest, more modular and less over-engineered,” he said. “Slate taps into that.”

Traditional carmakers and start-ups have found mixed success rolling out larger electric pickup trucks in recent years. Now start-ups such as Slate and California-based Telo are focusing on smaller electric pickups.

In a town-hall meeting in early May, Ford CEO Jim Farley and executive chair Bill Ford told employees they admired the company's customer-centred ethos and focus on affordability.

Tim Kuniskis, Stellantis' head of American brands, called Slate “super interesting” at a June event, while also questioning how affordable it would be for some shoppers once they added all the options they wanted.

“The idea behind it, we've talked about that idea a million times,” he said. “It's a cool idea.”",https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9czlp0uSemYPgw54X_ETTCqcYx5F84m2orfxOF6GvhH1_HF-decNoGpPElbQuiV3W5qFS1Ae5eHbL2_mbqFQdEKMk5ukQQF18i0=s1000,N,,2025-07-28 08:03:28.655334

Both Williams Cos. and Mountain Valley Pipeline are trying to lay new pipe along Williams’ existing Transco line in southern Virginia and North Carolina to meet growing energy demand.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could approve both. But Williams has argued that its pipeline is big enough to handle all planned volumes of natural gas — prompting Mountain Valley to bristle at the implication that its Southgate project isn’t necessary.

“It seems as though Transco is attempting to undercut MVP Southgate,” Ian Heming, a natural gas analyst at East Daley Analytics, said in a recent interview.

That is noteworthy in the world of energy permitting. While FERC is required to consider whether a pipeline is needed, the agency generally defines need as whether companies have committed to buying the gas the line would carry. Williams has cast a broader net, telling FERC in a short filing this month that the company could tack on Southgate’s “incremental” volumes by adding meter tubes and regulation at an existing station.

The companies’ push to build the pipelines comes as electricity demand across the United States is forecast to surge in the coming years. That includes the Southeast, where utilities are looking to build new fossil fuel plants to power a growing population and planned data centers. Both Williams’ and Mountain Valley’s projects cite that demand at the heart of their proposals.

Both companies are proposing to build about 30 miles of pipe along Williams’ massive Gulf-to-New York Transco gas pipeline system. Both pipelines — MVP Southgate and the Eden Loop segment of Williams’ Southeast Supply Enhancement Project (SSEP) — would start at the same point near Chatham, Virginia, and end near Eden, North Carolina.

FERC is planning to release environmental assessments of both projects this fall, with the review for Williams’ SSEP slated for November and the analysis for MVP Southgate scheduled for October.

What’s not being considered is the interest of ratepayers, said Shelley Robbins, senior decarbonization manager at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy.

Her group doesn’t think either pipeline is needed — and has safety concerns about plans to have the two lines repeatedly cross each other and the Transco main line. But Robbins said regulators don’t seem to be looking at any advantages of building one pipe instead of two.

“In theory, that’s cheaper,” Robbins said.

But, she added, “the utilities and the pipeline companies make money building big things.”

Dueling projects

Building both pipelines would create a 30-mile corridor with up to six high-pressure gas lines running next to each other. The Transco system already includes as many as four parallel pipelines in that area.

The MVP Southgate project aims to move gas from the end of the main Mountain Valley pipeline — where it connects to Transco in Virginia — to Eden, North Carolina. Another company is building a 45-mile pipeline from that point east to a planned Duke Energy natural gas-fired power plant near Roxboro, North Carolina.

FERC approved Southgate in 2020, but Mountain Valley submitted an application in February to amend the expansion project by shrinking the pipeline’s length and increasing its diameter.

The entire length of the proposed Southgate project now runs next to Williams’ Transco pipeline.

In total, Williams’ Transco Southeast Supply Enhancement project would add approximately 55 miles of new pipe in two segments in parts of Virginia and North Carolina, as well as new compressor units. One 24-mile segment, the Salem Loop, cuts between the North Carolina cities of Winston-Salem and Greensboro.

The other, the 30-mile Eden Loop, straddles the North Carolina-Virginia border and follows the same path of MVP Southgate.

It’s unclear if Williams will ultimately decide to expand the capacity of the Eden Loop. But the company is essentially arguing in its FERC filings that it has the ability to expand and then “would be able to essentially hold its almost full monopoly on gas into North Carolina, and that’s what its goal is here,” said Heming at East Daley Analytics.

Mountain Valley, however, is asserting that the Southgate project would provide a needed redundancy to utilities that are supplying gas to North Carolina residents.

“The market has spoken, and shippers are asking for a pipeline alternative to Transco to support increased competition for transportation services in the region, and to provide critically needed natural gas pipeline capacity and diversity of supply to the region,” Mountain Valley told FERC in a July 11 letter.

Mountain Valley included supportive comments from the Public Service Co. of North Carolina and Duke Energy, two utilities that have signed contracts for the project’s full capacity.

MVP Southgate spokesperson Shawn Day said the amended project gives North Carolina a diverse energy supply and resilience.

“While Transco may not like competition, the market does,” Day said in a statement.

“The vast majority of North Carolina’s natural gas supply has historically been controlled by a single provider,” Day said. “For years, the North Carolina Utilities Commission has recognized the state needs an additional interstate natural gas transmission provider to diversify the state’s natural gas supply and promote competition.”

Williams said it will continue to engage with parties like Mountain Valley to ensure the Southeast Supply Enhancement Project can deliver energy.

“We acknowledge that there is a market desire for a second interstate pipeline to bring supplies into North Carolina,” Williams said in an emailed statement. The company did not respond to subsequent questions for clarity on whether it believes the Southgate line is necessary.

A demonstrated need?

The Trump administration’s pro-fossil-fuel agenda makes it more likely that FERC would green-light MVP Southgate and “provide that redundant gas supply, rather than have it be integrated into Transco’s Southeast Supply Enhancement,” Heming said.

FERC, though, has stayed mum.

Asked after last month’s FERC meeting whether both pipelines are needed, Chair Mark Christie (R) said he couldn’t comment because the applications for the two pipeline projects are still pending.

“The question of need under the Natural Gas Act is always a central question of any NGA application, so I can’t talk about either one of them,” Christie said.

FERC spokesperson Celeste Miller subsequently declined to comment on questions about the two pipeline projects.

At least one environmental group, meanwhile, said both pipeline projects are unnecessary.

“We don’t accept that there is a shown need for the projects, and it’s part of this broader over-expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure to serve data centers and [artificial intelligence],” said Jessica Sims, Virginia field coordinator for the group Appalachian Voices.

Sims, who was involved in the fight against the main Mountain Valley pipeline, said she hopes that neither project will get approved.

Brady Dennis reports for The Washington Post.

In short:

The project aimed to reconnect the Mississippi River to wetlands in Plaquemines Parish, mimicking natural sediment flows to rebuild 20 square miles of land over 50 years.

Governor Jeff Landry opposed the plan, citing harm to local fisheries and costs; litigation and rising expenses also contributed to its cancellation.

Environmental advocates warn the decision weakens Louisiana’s defense against storms and sea-level rise as the Gulf’s water levels climb at twice the global rate.

Key quote:

“It shows that having good science, impeccable science — that isn’t enough anymore. Politics still trump the day.”

— James Karst, communications director for the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana

Why this matters:

Louisiana’s wetlands act as a natural shield against hurricanes and storm surges, absorbing energy before it reaches populated areas. Yet these marshes have been disappearing for decades as levees trap sediment upstream and seas rise faster than the global average. Without large-scale restoration, projections show the state could lose thousands of additional acres, eroding both ecosystems and cultural lifeways tied to fishing and oyster harvesting.

Fifty-five percent of subscribers in the Abbott Northwestern garden qualify as low- or moderate-income.
The Abbot Northwestern project illustrates the potential for creative uses of a solar garden in an urban environment.
And despite tightening municipal budgets, some Minnesota cities offer generous incentives for residential and commercial solar projects.
Even without federal subsidies, solar and backup batteries increasingly make financial sense for utility customers, said Michael Allen, cofounder and CEO of All Energy Solar.","More than 180 local households will see significantly lower energy bills after the solar array atop Abbott Northwestern Hospital’s new parking ramp powers up later this year.

Abbot Northwestern — Twin Cities’ largest private hospital — will enjoy similar savings while hosting Minneapolis nonprofit Cooperative Energy Futures’ newest community solar garden for at least the next 25 years.

It’s CEF’s second ramp-top solar garden — after the 3,760-panel installation at Ramp A in downtown Minneapolis — and one of its largest yet. Community solar garden subscribers typically save 20% to 30% on their monthly electricity bills, CEF says. Fifty-five percent of subscribers in the Abbott Northwestern garden qualify as low- or moderate-income. Canopy-style arrays like this one provide shade for people and cars in summer and reduce snow removal crews’ workloads come winter.

Perks like these helped CEF find long-term hosts for and draw nearly 1,000 subscribers to its 10 existing community solar gardens, a mix of rooftop and canopy arrays in the Twin Cities and ground-mounted installations farther out. CEF plans to energize at least three more gardens this year and has five projects in earlier stages of development, according to its 2025 annual report.

The future of projects like these are in doubt since the election of President Donald Trump, which has ushered in a federal government bent on making it harder for Americans to access affordable, non-polluting electricity.

Trump signed a partisan budget law on July 4 that sunsets federal solar tax credits years ahead of schedule while boosting already-generous fossil fuel subsidies, sending solar developers scrambling to grandfather as many projects as possible under the current rules. Days later, Trump made good on an apparent side deal with congressional conservatives and ordered the U.S. Treasury Department to take a hard line on those rules, possibly by increasing the amount of early investment projects need before they can qualify. Developers expect final guidance sometime next month, soon after Trump’s latest tariffs take effect (or not).

“Our lawyers are really trying to define our deadlines and we’re going to push as much as we can before we have to reorient,” CEF’s Dan Grantier told The Reformer at the Abbot Northwestern ribbon-cutting event.

The Abbot Northwestern project illustrates the potential for creative uses of a solar garden in an urban environment. Hospital owner Allina Health approached CEF in 2019 as part of a campaign to endear its Midtown Minneapolis neighbors to the new parking ramp it needed for a major campus expansion, Allina Vice President of Facilities Tony LaCroix-Dalluhn recently told The Reformer.

“A parking structure is not exactly a welcome addition to the neighborhood, so we came up with a community solar garden to make it more appealing,” along with less conspicuous nods to sustainability, like a “maxed out” 200-stall bike parking area with showers and a pollinator garden along the Midtown Greenway, LaCroix-Dalluhn said.

“There’s not much benefit for us, but it’s great for the community,” he said.

Minnesota helped kickstart the American community solar movement thanks in large part to legislation championed by the late State Rep. Melissa Hortman and the doggedness of homegrown developers like CEF, which began weatherizing older Minneapolis homes in the late aughts. With more installed community solar capacity than all but three other states — more than 900 times the maximum output of the Abbott Northwestern system — Minnesota continues to punch well above its weight.

Despite Trump’s war on decarbonization, states and municipalities that care about climate change and energy access will continue to support solar development. Minnesota needs to add a lot more solar panels — as well as wind turbines and other carbon-free sources and batteries to provide grid stability — to meet its mandate for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, giving developers like CEF and dozens of smaller rooftop solar installation businesses clarity on long-term demand. House Democrats gave the industry another boost in the June special legislative session when they killed a budget provision that would have ended Minnesota’s community solar program in three years.

And despite tightening municipal budgets, some Minnesota cities offer generous incentives for residential and commercial solar projects. Businesses qualify for up to $50,000 and residential buyers’ groups up to $175,000 from the Minneapolis Green Cost Share program, for example.

“If you’re looking to build a parking ramp in Minneapolis, we want to talk to you,” Grantier said.

Even without federal subsidies, solar and backup batteries increasingly make financial sense for utility customers, said Michael Allen, cofounder and CEO of All Energy Solar.

But the slow, cumbersome process of getting new systems approved and connected to the grid — typically a 40-to-60-day wait for Xcel Energy customers “if everything goes smoothly,” he said — scares some prospects off and raises costs for the rest. Larger arrays can take many months or years to get utility approval, though Grantier said urban neighborhoods like Midtown tend to have more slack in the grid.

“Where legislators and regulators can really make a difference is by holding (utilities’) feet to the fire and taking a stand to improve things for Minnesotans,” Allen said.

Otherwise, he warned, more utility customers may take matters into their own hands and look for ways to reduce their reliance on the grid.

“The more we fight each other, the greater the desire there is to do something different,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-87/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/solar-garden-2-1024x5781753700951.jpg?h=098dea43&itok=s4cjbSpQ,N,,2025-07-28 08:03:45.351428

On federal lands specifically, four wind power projects are in the permitting pipeline and are now in limbo.
“These attacks on wind power from the administration and Congress are costing Americans jobs and hurting local economies.
“The Trump administration’s actions and the OBBBA threaten the growth of the wind energy sector, jeopardising jobs,” said the authors of the report.
The order also temporarily banned leasing for offshore wind projects in federal waters and froze an onshore wind project that had already received its federal permits.","Highlighting the adverse effect on the wind energy industry of executive orders pausing federal wind permits, and the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which ends tax credits for wind and solar energy unless projects start construction within 12 months of the bill’s enactment, the CAP said the Trump administration and congressional Republicans are ""squeezing wind power from both sides.""

“With the temporary block on permitting progress still in place, many projects will not be able to start construction, leaving them unable to meet new deadlines for tax credits they may have been counting on,” it said.

According to analysis by CAP, more than 17,000 jobs are connected to offshore wind power projects that are already cancelled, on hold, or at risk from the Trump administration’s attacks on wind power. A subset of these projects are also at risk of losing funding because of the OBBBA. Thousands more could be at risk in the onshore wind industry.

The CAP’s analysis said the 17,000 jobs at risk in the offshore wind industry are tied to about a dozen projects that have been paused or are at risk of being paused due to the Trump administration’s executive orders attacking wind power. These projects are connected to more than 12,000 direct jobs and 5,000 indirect jobs, and more than 75% of these jobs combined are connected to projects that have all their federal permits or are under construction.

In the offshore wind sector alone, said CAP, more than 10,000 union jobs are at risk because of the Trump administration’s attacks. “Many of those jobs, whether part of the supply chain or working on a project itself, will not materialise unless the temporary ban is lifted and may never materialise if the temporary ban lasts too long or if the project loses eligibility for tax credits,” CAP said.

CAP estimates close to 25,000 additional direct and indirect jobs in the onshore wind industry are also associated with projects either under development or construction, although not all of those projects require federal permits. On federal lands specifically, four wind power projects are in the permitting pipeline and are now in limbo. According to CAP analysis, these projects are associated with more than 1,900 direct and indirect jobs.

“These attacks on wind power from the administration and Congress are costing Americans jobs and hurting local economies. And while Trump and Congress kneecap the wind energy sector, the oil and gas sector benefits from the hurdles imposed on a competing energy industry,” said the CAP.

“The Trump administration’s actions and the OBBBA threaten the growth of the wind energy sector, jeopardising jobs,” said the authors of the report. “Despite the strength and promise of the wind power sector when President Trump took office, the Trump administration and Congress keep making it harder to build wind power projects.”

It noted that in January, the administration issued an executive order blocking all federal approvals for wind power projects, including permits, loans, and rights of way, until an assessment of federal permitting processes has been conducted. However, the administration has not set a timeline for completing this assessment.

The order also temporarily banned leasing for offshore wind projects in federal waters and froze an onshore wind project that had already received its federal permits. A total of 17 states have sued, but the executive order temporarily blocking wind permitting progress remains in place.

“Congressional Republicans have doubled down on their attacks, passing a budget plan that strips clean energy tax credits, making it significantly harder to finance renewable projects, including wind power projects,” the CAP said. “It is estimated the repeal of these incentives in the OBBBA will stunt the growth of clean energy installations by 41% over the next decade.

“A ‘safe harbor’ provision allows projects to still receive credits if they begin construction in the next 12 months, but the executive order issued in July 2025 may make it more difficult to qualify. Together, these actions provide a one-two punch against wind energy: projects need to start construction as soon as possible to retain critical tax credits, but the administration’s pause on permits may prevent them from doing so.

“On top of this, a new DOI directive hit an even broader swath of projects with a bureaucratic review by requiring high-level approval for decisions regarding wind and solar projects, potentially including those on private and state lands. Ultimately, if these projects go under, it will mean lost jobs and higher household energy costs – all to provide tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans.”",https://dvzpv6x5302g1.cloudfront.net/AcuCustom/Sitename/DAM/162/OWJ50Grid02_NOAA_Brooke_Carney_Block_Island_30562501165_a800_Main.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:02:28.473936

""Right now, Cadillac's EV lineup is surprisingly competitive — distinctive design, improved interiors, and the right tech like Super Cruise are helping the brand punch above expectations.","With an influx of new models arriving in market, Cadillac is wearing the crown as America's top-selling luxury electric vehicle company, beating out the likes of Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. It's a level of popularity that has led to what the brand's global vice president, John Roth, calls, ""a pretty good run.""

That run is the product and financial realization of years of planning. The company has been on a quest to leverage strategic and creative marketing, as well as its motorsports and performance credentials, to conquest new, younger customers as part of its efforts to make Cadillac, ""the most prestigious luxury brand here in America,"" Roth told Newsweek.

The changes kicked off in 2015 and have continued through today. ""As we come into 2025 this is really the epicenter of when the plan comes completely together as it relates to our product portfolio, the work that we've done around the dealer network, our marketing and advertising, what our investment in customer experience looks like, essentially everything we can do to elevate the overall brand,"" Roth said, noting that the plan isn't complete and that Cadillac continues to look at the horizon.

Cadillac claims to be the top-selling luxury electric vehicle manufacturer. Using Cadillac-provided parameters, Newsweek was unable to confirm that claim.

Fresh additions to the Cadillac lineup include the battery-electric Vistiq, Optiq and Escalade IQ SUVs. The Lyriq SUV went on sale two years ago and is slated to get a high-performance variant, Lyriq-V, soon. The forthcoming Optiq-V and Escalade IQL were revealed recently.

""Cadillac isn't just talking about transformation — it's aggressively launching products at a pace unseen from the brand in decades. Four EVs across multiple segments in quick succession is no small feat. Cadillac is finally starting to behave like a brand with something to prove and something worth chasing,"" Paul Waatti, director of industry analysis at AutoPacific, told Newsweek.

Roth echoed that sentiment, saying, ""I got to tell you, this is one of the best product portfolios I've ever had to work with in my 30 plus years here at General Motors and Cadillac.""

Along with the introduction of new EVs, Cadillac has enhanced its existing portfolio, updating its CT5 and Escalade with a fresh suite of technology and refined looks. It's part of a pledge to keep its combustion engine vehicles in service for a while longer, giving buyers preference to choose gas or electric when they start their new car shopping.

Outside the U.S., Cadillac continues to gain momentum as well. The company has launched its Lyriq in China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Sweden, France and Germany, among other international markets.

""Models like Optiq and Vistiq show a clear intent to grow Cadillac's global EV presence beyond flagship products. While not positioned as headline-grabbers today, they serve a strategic role in normalizing Cadillac as an electric luxury brand in the market, forming the backbone of Cadillac's EV volume story,"" Waatti said.

Seventy-nine to 80 percent of people who buy a Lyriq are conquested customers. For Optiq, that number is 76. Those customers, Roth said, are seven to eight years younger than the average age of a new car buyer in the auto industry.

""Right now, Cadillac's EV lineup is surprisingly competitive — distinctive design, improved interiors, and the right tech like Super Cruise are helping the brand punch above expectations. But the window to stand out may narrow quickly. German rivals, in particular, are about to unleash their next-gen EV platforms with faster charging, better efficiency, and smarter software. Cadillac must keep up and prove that it can maintain momentum beyond the early sales success of its fresh models, amid added competitive pressure,"" Waatti said.

""The Escalade IQ is Cadillac at its best: unapologetically bold, effortlessly recognizable, and designed with customer expectations in mind. It's poised to be a runaway success and a key bridge for loyalists transitioning to EVs. Its presence also reinforces Cadillac's role as GM's crown jewel, raising fundamental questions about whether Hummer, with its more polarizing identity and shrinking momentum, can remain viable as a parallel flagship,"" he continued.

Cadillac also sells Celestiq, a hand-built, made-to-order, electron-powered sedan that is meant to be a showcase of the company's luxury prowess. The car debuted in 2022 and just went into production a few months ago.

""The Celestiq won't move the sales needle, but it's Cadillac's most daring brand statement in decades. It's a deliberate, high-stakes bet meant to shift perception and prove the brand still knows how to lead, not follow. That kind of symbolic swing can be invaluable — or it can land with a thud if not backed by broader relevance. Right now, it's a brand-defining risk. Whether it becomes a turning point or a footnote depends on what comes next,"" Waatti said.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2688972/2026-cadillac-vistiq.png,N,,2025-07-28 08:03:33.643186

LG ES, which listed on the Korea Exchange (KRX) in early 2022 through a US$10.8 billion IPO, does not break out its financials between EV and ESS division numbers.
The company has been rebalancing production capacity utilisation between those two segments of its business.
It decided to retool EV cell lines at its existing production complex in Holland, Michigan, rather than proceed with an all-new gigafactory complex in Arizona, investing US$1.4 billion into the four new ESS cell production lines.
In March, ESN Premium discussed the Holland plant’s repurposing and the parent company’s manufacturing strategy in the US with Jaehong Park, CEO of LG ES Vertech, the battery maker’s battery energy storage system (BESS) integrator arm.","“In the second quarter, we secured stable EV battery sales and also started production at our new ESS battery facility in North America,” Chang-Sil Lee, CFO for LG ES, said.

“However, constrained customer purchase sentiment, coupled with the reflection of metal price decline to our average selling price (ASP) affected our quarterly revenue.”

Almost all the profits (US$491 million) came from production incentives in North America and LG Energy Solution emphasised the start of production earlier this year, with an official opening held 24 June, as a key achievement in the quarter.

While a slowdown in growth in the electric vehicle (EV) market continues—although LG Energy Solution (LG ES) said sales were “stable” in the second quarter—the company said it expects demand for energy storage to continue to increase, with rising renewable energy adoption and AI data centres as the main drivers.

The company also noted the likelihood that new restrictions on the eligibility of energy storage projects that use foreign entity of concern (FEOC) Chinese equipment to qualify for investment tax credit (ITC) incentives would benefit non-Chinese players.

It decided to retool EV cell lines at its existing production complex in Holland, Michigan, rather than proceed with an all-new gigafactory complex in Arizona, investing US$1.4 billion into the four new ESS cell production lines. In March, ESN Premium discussed the Holland plant’s repurposing and the parent company’s manufacturing strategy in the US with Jaehong Park, CEO of LG ES Vertech, the battery maker’s battery energy storage system (BESS) integrator arm.

Park claimed at the time that the full capacity output of the lines was fully booked for the next three to five years by large-scale project developers, and added that the ability to switch from EV to ESS cell production gave LG ES an early-to-market advantage over rivals’ greenfield developments.

“When it comes to timing, if a company builds a factory from scratch, from a greenfield facility, it takes a minimum of three to four years because it requires permitting, it requires water and utilities, and it requires road access,” Park said, while adding that the cost of building from scratch has risen significantly since the COVID-19 pandemic.

While LG ES is hoping the availability of existing EV cell production lines for conversion to ESS applications will give it a competitive edge in the US, market intelligence firm Clean Energy Associates recently highlighted that nearly 21GWh of new stationary storage battery cell manufacturing capacity planned to come online in the country by 2028 has been cancelled since the beginning of this year. Those are represented by three companies: KORE Power (9.8GWh), FREYR Battery (now know as T1 Energy and looking to manufacture solar PV instead, 10.2GWh) and IMENY (0.8GWh).

Meanwhile, close to the same amount (19.2GWh) has been postponed from Our Next Energy (1GWh), Kontromatik (3GWh), Microvast and Gotion (4GWh each) and American Battery Factory (7.2GWh).

Although EVs look set to remain the much bigger overall market, in the short term, LG ES identified recent policy changes that presented uncertainties, including the phaseout of the consumer EV subsidy in the US by the end of September and import tariffs creating cost pressures for OEMs.

For the rest of 2025, its investment activities in the EV space are more R&D-focused. The company hopes to develop EV batteries that can be charged in under ten minutes and lithium manganese-rich (LMR) batteries with 30% higher energy density than LFP to be used in next-generation EV models by a “strategic customer” by 2028.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/09.-LG-Energy-Solution-Michigan-ESS-facility_production-line_electrode_02.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:02:32.658853

More than 70 percent of Germans cited rising living costs as their main concern, with energy prices at the forefront of this worry1. Electricity demand in Germany is forecast to grow rapidly from 96 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024 to 236 TWh by 20352, driven by AI, data centers and the electrification of key industries including vehicles, heat pumps and hydrogen.

Transformers are crucial to enable the efficient transmission and distribution of electricity. There is currently a major global shortage and Hitachi Energy is executing the largest investment plan in the global industry with $9 billion USD to scale up manufacturing capacity across the world. Germany is integral to the program, having recently announced the expansion of its transformer factory in Bad Honnef. The company holds deep roots in Germany, employing over 2,000 people across eight locations, including three key manufacturing sites in Bad Honnef, Brilon and Roigheim.

The Bundesnetzagentur, and other German utilities and grid operators, urgently need transformers to prevent a delay in grid connections, blocks to new routing, and threats to ambitious expansion plans designed to support clean power and electrification3. As part of the framework agreement with E.ON, Hitachi Energy will deliver a considerable part of the transformers by reserving manufacturing capacity to support the accelerated expansion and modernization of the German power grid.

“The growing importance of power grids demands bold investments and breakthrough innovations to shape the energy systems of the future,” said Andreas Schierenbeck, CEO of Hitachi Energy. “Our expansion goes beyond business – it reflects our responsibility as a global leader to accelerate capacity and deliver the critical equipment our customers urgently need. Strategic partnerships like this one empower TSOs, utilities, and industry to build a more sustainable, secure, resilient, and affordable energy system for Germany.”

Encouraged by the response, the Decuzzi’s continued developing their electric ATV, believing it would be a boon for public safety and military purposes.
Electric ATVs generally can be several thousand dollars more expensive than gas-powered.
The program taps resources from the Ohio Small Business Development Center Export Assistance Network, the U.S. Commercial Service and other regional and international organizations.
“There are not very many manufacturers of electric ATVs,” he said.","In 2000, Kim and Lou Decuzzi began making their mark in ATV racing for kids with a gas-powered vehicle that featured innovative performance and safety features.

These days, their company, DRR USA in Brunswick, is again at the forefront of innovation with adult electric all-terrain vehicles that customers value for their quiet operation, low maintenance and zero carbon emissions. The customer list includes vineyards, farmers, hunters, governments and eco-tourism businesses in and outside the United States. Last year, DRR was named a U.S. Chamber of Commerce Top 100 Small Business of the Year for its work “setting new industry standards for safety and sustainability while expanding into international markets and advancing environmentally responsible off-road solutions.”

DRR, short for Dirt Road Racing, is bursting at the seams of its 10,000-square-foot space in an industrial park east of Interstate 71. The small company’s evolution is a testament to hard work, timing, and the importance of connecting with the area’s small business development network. In the Decuzzis’ case, that included an export business accelerator at Cleveland State University.

Lou Decuzzi, a New Jersey native who’s quick with a quip and a grin, captures the small company’s plucky culture when he says, “I’m smart enough to know what I’m doing but dumb enough to think I can do it.”

Lou grew up with a passion for racing and tinkering with go-karts and dirt bikes. He and Kim rode with and encouraged their three sons to get into go-kart and ATV racing. That meant watching them in competitions, including one in which their oldest son was injured.

Safety first

That got Kim thinking: Can’t high-performance ATVs for kids be built more safely? Outside their corporate jobs, the Decuzzis began to research and build ATVs with lower seats, wider bases and better handling. Other parents asked about buying them. Kim quit her job to launch DRR in 2000 and Lou joined soon after, with the company initially immersed in off-road racing. The youths driving their gas-powered, high-performance dirt bikes and ATVs – known as mini-ATVs and mini-quads – began pulling down championships nationwide.

“We knew how to break things and make them better, right?” Lou Decuzzi said of the constant tinkering and design advances in their off-road vehicles for youths. “There's a ton of aftermarket support out there from small race shops all over the country, which is a big plus. It's like we're the Ferrari of kids’ mini-ATVs.”

Josh Lane, owner of Mud Motorsports, an ATV dealer in Martinsville, Indiana, that caters to ATV and dirt bike racers, confirmed that DRR mini-quads are considered a top performer. “If you’re going to go to a national event … they are all on DRRs,” said Lane, whose own children raced on DRRs when they were younger.

Over the years, DRR’s gas-powered product line grew beyond racing to include ATVs for adults, utility terrain vehicles and motorcycles. But the business took an unexpected turn when a search-and-rescue need arose in rural North Carolina in 2018.

The DeCuzzis watched media coverage of a lost boy with autism and believed the din of ATVs, helicopters and search equipment could startle the boy into hiding. Kim asked if Lou could convert a gas-powered ATV to electric power to run more quietly. Lou quickly adapted a battery from a next-door business that reconditions batteries for forklifts. The boy, unfortunately, didn’t survive, but the Decuzzis reached out to North Carolina safety officials to get their perspective on quieter ATVs.

Encouraged by the response, the Decuzzi’s continued developing their electric ATV, believing it would be a boon for public safety and military purposes. Red Bull, a sponsor of off-road racing, posted a story about DRR’s electric venture in May 2019.

“They put it on their (website) main page and tweeted about it,” Lou Decuzzi said. “Within five minutes, we had 25,000 hits on our website.” They saw a fledgling yet viable market – few ATV manufacturers had explored electric power, despite the growth of electric vehicles in the auto industry.

Electric ATVs generally can be several thousand dollars more expensive than gas-powered. But EATVs are cheaper to maintain, with many fewer parts, and have zero emissions. Electric motors deliver instant torque but power can drop as batteries drain. Gas ATVs have higher top speeds, a wider range and the convenience of gas refueling, compared to EATVs, which need time for battery recharge.

Believing pros outweighed the cons for their targeted markets, the Decuzzis jumped into EATV production. But they quickly ran into supply problems with lithium-ion battery manufacturers who were overseas. “The EATV market did not exist and getting suppliers to do small batch runs is very difficult,” Decuzzi said.

“So no one wants to do 18 or 20 pieces for you,” said Decuzzi. “So that was the most difficult challenge.”

Other challenges included governmental red tape and the business-killing effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, which knocked out a significant amount of pre-sales, DeCuzzi said.

Flourishing overseas

Dealing with overseas markets led the Decuzzis in 2022 to the GlobalTarget Program, an export accelerator for small businesses created 20 years ago and operating at the Monte Ahuja College of Business Global Business Center at Cleveland State University.

Each year, 10 businesses doing at least $2 million in annual sales pay to join a seven-month program that supplies mentors, market analysis, business strategy, and a trade mission, as well as workshops and subject experts. The program taps resources from the Ohio Small Business Development Center Export Assistance Network, the U.S. Commercial Service and other regional and international organizations.

Nathan Ward is the GlobalTarget director and a trade advisor for the state of Ohio. He said DRR paired with a mentor who was a supply chain manager at Lubrizol, who helped the Decuzzis tackle their supply chain challenges.

Ward oversaw a global market study for DRR that identified eco-tourism as a potential market. The EATVs’ quiet, pollution-free operation are a plus for sensitive ecological areas. “You’re not going to spook animals that are around,” Ward said. “Not only that, but the operators don’t have to fiddle with the messiness of fuel and things like that.”

DRR recently sold 28 of its Safari EATVs (priced at $14,999 on the website) to Mystic Mountain adventure park in Jamaica, which offers ATV eco-tours. The Safari’s four-wheel drive makes it a popular choice for tackling trails and steep terrain. The park was an early DRR customer, having purchased its first batch of EATVs five years ago.

Park General Manager Dewald van der Walt said a DRR employee spent several days on site instructing employees, riding the rainforest trails and troubleshooting any problems. The Mystic Mountain EATVs are custom made, with larger batteries that accommodate power steering and a 65-mile range before charging. For tourist safety, the vehicles are fitted with fenders and limited to a top speed of 25 mph.

Van der Walt, who came to the park in 2023, said he was initially skeptical of EATVs. “There are not very many manufacturers of electric ATVs,” he said. “There are very few available that seem to be a good quality unit. In our view, DRR USA is one of the best. … They are performing very well and reliably.”

Besides the market analysis, CSU’s GlobalTarget program hooked DRR up with the Ohio Export Internship Program, which covers half the salaries for interns to help small businesses with overseas markets. That brought CSU graduate Rosalina Keglovic to DRR in 2022, and she has since joined the company full-time as an International Business Specialist.

DRR is doing a second, seven-month stint with the GlobalTarget program and is using intern Elijah Pearson, a Baldwin Wallace University student, to analyze potential distributors and markets in Mexico.

Decuzzi said interns have done vital work for DRR. “It's such a low cost for such a high-value program, right? It's crazy,” said Decuzzi, who has helped lure other small businesses to the GlobalTarget program.

The Decuzzis have taken advantage of other business-development programs in and outside the area, including the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses program through Cuyahoga Community College and the Entrepreneurs Organization, an international support network for business owners.

DRR’s future – and challenges

The popularity of EATVs has surprised even the Decuzzis. In recent years, EATVs have gone from 20 percent of the company’s overall sales to 60 percent. DRR had 500 pre-orders for its products, Decuzzi said in late May, with the ability to assemble up to 18 gas- and electric-powered vehicles a week. The company has eight full-timers and uses a contractor to supply an assembly crew.

Sometimes, assembly is done in the parking lot outside their cramped industrial space in Brunswick. A top priority is finding more room, but high interest rates and soaring prices for commercial square footage are a challenge, Decuzzi said.

“There’s a lot of inefficient movement here,’’ Decuzzi acknowledges. “We keep looking.”

Competition is rising as ATV makers move into electric power. The global market for electric all-terrain or utility terrain vehicles is expected to increase by double digits annually into the 2030s, according to several industry and market research reports.

Decuzzi described DRR as the scrappy underdog in the EATV market. “We work weekends and overnights,” he said. Engineers with large competitors “make too much money, and they leave at 2 o’clock on a Friday. If we don’t finish our stuff, we don’t eat.”

Tariffs are the latest challenge. Larger competitors can better handle tariffs set by President Donald Trump’s administration. “It means a cost increase of maybe 30 percent,” Decuzzi said. “We’re not big enough to absorb it, so it means prices will be going up.”

Small companies like DRR have few choices when it comes to tariffs, GlobalTarget’s Ward said.

“The only way for them to cut costs is by laying people off,” Ward said. “It hurts their ability to function, so they’ll have no choice but to pass those costs onto the consumer.”

The Decuzzis considered retiring earlier this year but decided to go after opportunities in the electric ATV market, Lou said. There have been offers to buy the company from some suppliers and government contractors, Decuzzi said. “They haven’t been what we would go for,” he said.

For now, DRR has found a niche offering quality products and personal service, Ward said.

“They can have wins and gain satisfied customers in places where the big people can’t give that level of attention,” Ward said. “The biggest companies can’t be everywhere all the time.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8317296/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+276/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2F59%2Fe5025aad4d42b21fff06e3e87a94%2Fdsc05981.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 12:16:49.278043

The International Energy Agency predicts that data centers’ electricity and water consumption will both double by 2030, driven largely by AI-related demand.
Data and drought Thirsty data centers are sprouting like weeds in parts of the West that are already arid and now gripped by severe drought.
And power generation generally guzzles water, too, thereby increasing data centers’ indirect water use.
Data centers need water for cooling, and because AI-processing facilities work harder, they need more cooling and even more water.","This May, STaX Capital Partners applied for a permit to install turbines fueled by methane from oil wells on Alaska’s North Slope. The temporary facilities would serve as a proof of concept for a much larger gas-fired power plant — with an output equal to that of the state’s largest coal-fired plant — all of whose electricity would go to a planned bitcoin-mining data center located nearby.

The Alaska-based company told Northern Journal it hopes to “create the playbook for sustainable, at-scale Bitcoin mining in Alaska.”

But “sustainable” bitcoin mining is an oxymoron, given the enormous amounts of power and water data centers consume. The massive server banks that run nearly every aspect of our digital world churn away in warehouse-like buildings in Phoenix, Las Vegas, rural Washington and Wyoming, each gobbling as much electricity as a small city to process AI queries, cryptocurrency extraction and other aspects of our increasingly cloud-based society. The harder they work, the hotter they get, and the more power and water they need to cool off.

“Sustainable” bitcoin mining is an oxymoron, given the enormous amounts of power and water data centers consume.

The International Energy Agency predicts that data centers’ electricity and water consumption will both double by 2030, driven largely by AI-related demand. That in turn threatens to max out existing electricity generation, strain power grids, and — if fossil fuels are used — increase carbon emissions. Even when data centers employ dedicated solar, wind or geothermal, they’re taking resources from other users, upending utilities’ planning and prompting them to build yet more natural gas plants while keeping nuclear and coal plants running — and polluting — well past their scheduled retirements.

Some states, including Oregon, want to make data centers pay their fair share of electricity and infrastructure costs rather than pass them on to other customers. At the same time, several Western states and local governments offer taxpayer-funded incentives to attract more data centers, even to water- and grid-constrained areas, while utilities welcome the additional profits increased demand will bring. Both the Biden and Trump administrations eagerly offered up federal land and resources for new data centers and the power-

generating facilities they need.

The Big Digital Buildup is underway and shows no signs of stopping. The question is how — and whether — we can mitigate its inevitable impacts.

Data center hot spots

Tax credits and other incentives in seven Western states, along with their lower electricity rates, have lured data center developers to Nevada, Utah, Wyoming and Arizona.

The growth of data center capacity is highest in the West.

Some of the nation’s fastest-growing server-farm hubs are in the region. Google is investing $400 million to expand its Nevada data centers, driving exponential growth in Las Vegas and Reno. The facility’s total power demand is expected to exceed 3,800 MW — enough to power more than 3 million homes.

Data and drought

Thirsty data centers are sprouting like weeds in parts of the West that are already arid and now gripped by severe drought. In the greater Phoenix area, proposed housing developments have died due to a lack of available groundwater. Yet data centers, each of which can consume an entire sprawling subdivision’s worth, face no such requirements or water restrictions.

Data centers use energy to run their servers, and energy and water to cool the processors. Evaporative chillers that work in low humidity use less energy but more water, while refrigerated cooling uses less water but requires more energy on-site. And power generation generally guzzles water, too, thereby increasing data centers’ indirect water use.

Most of the water used by Google’s data centers in 2023 was drinkable.

Google’s data centers withdrew 8.65 billion gallons of water in 2023 worldwide. Meta’s withdrew 1.39 billion.

A Microsoft data center in Goodyear, Arizona, directly uses about 56 million gallons of municipal potable water annually — about the same as 670 homes. Still, it’s substantially less than what the nearby alfalfa fields drink.

The cloud and climate

Some data centers have built dedicated solar installations, others plan to purchase wind and geothermal power, while still others want to install their own modular nuclear reactors to run the “hyperscale” centers needed to process AI. Meanwhile, most server farms get at least some of their power from the local grid, typically paying industrial rates far lower than what residential customers pay.

The carbon intensity of a specific center hinges on the energy mix of its grid. Coal and natural gas generation still dominate the Interior West’s grid, meaning its data centers are responsible for larger greenhouse gas emissions and water use for power generation. In the Pacific Northwest, myriad server farms are powered mostly by hydroelectricity, which is low-carbon but hurts rivers and fish. California’s grid runs increasingly on solar power.

Comparing data’s hunger for energy and water

AI-powered search models use 10 times more energy than a standard Google search.

Data centers need water for cooling, and because AI-processing facilities work harder, they need more cooling and even more water.

TIP: include “-ai” after your Google search terms to exclude Al-powered results

The profound damage done by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to nearly every sector of American life has made a target out of the businesses of its mastermind, Elon Musk. A wave of anti-Tesla legislation has washed over the states, along with campaigns to pressure local governments and other entities to divest from the company Musk controls as CEO.

Musk, who retains influence throughout the government through his loyal allies and federal contracts even after his formal departure from Washington, is now desperate to detoxify Tesla. Here’s why he may succeed.

Despite his embrace of Donald Trump and far-right parties in Europe, and despite draconian DOGE cuts to foreign aid that Bill Gates described as “the world’s richest man killing the world’s poorest children,” Musk continues to enjoy the services of lobbyists for progressive causes, both in Congress and in states such as California, New York, Colorado, Maryland, and Oregon. These lobbyists have been pulling off the neat, sick trick of working for Musk while simultaneously working for organizations harmed by DOGE, Musk, and Trump.

Los Angeles, San Francisco, Boulder, Colorado, and Eugene, Oregon, all saw huge “No Kings” protests on Trump’s birthday. Yet these four cities have been spending public funds to retain four different lobbying firms that also work for Musk, even as DOGE drastically cut jobs and funding for social services in each of these cities and Trump’s recently passed mega-bill threatened further cuts.

New disclosures from congressional and state-level firms that stuck with Musk even after he took over Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign tell a sordid tale. These Musk firms have been getting paid to solve problems that were either caused or made worse by DOGE, Musk, and Trump.

In Congress, the most striking example of a firm profiting from Musk cleanup duty may be Cassidy & Associates, which represents Tesla in addition to numerous environmental nonprofits and philanthropies. Since Trump’s inauguration and America’s DOGE-ification, one of these clients used the firm to lobby for “wildland fire mitigation technology,” even as DOGE cuts to the U.S. Forest Service weakened its ability to respond to wildfires.

Another client used Cassidy to lobby on the ReSCUE Oceans Act, even as DOGE slashed NOAA programs that support marine life conservation and Trump opened the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument to commercial fishing. Cassidy also represents one of the most effective, courageous environmental organizations in the country, the Southern Environmental Law Center, which is suing Musk’s xAI on behalf of the NAACP over illegal air pollution from xAI’s data center in Memphis, Tennessee.

How do these lobbying firms retain their credibility even as they lobby for seemingly inimical interests? Because respectable people and companies continue to hire them—and power, as much as anything, is about perception. Bill Gates called out Musk for DOGE’s cruel foreign aid cuts in May, three and a half months after a man named Bill Gates said that DOGE could be “a valuable thing.” And right after Gates gave DOGE his blessing, Microsoft (which Gates co-founded, and where he remains a shareholder and technology adviser) and Google signed with the congressional lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, which represents Tesla and some of Trump’s biggest fossil fuel backers, among them ExxonMobil.

Musk’s desperate plan to detoxify Tesla also depends on progressive lobbyists in blue, DOGE-stricken states. In Massachusetts, as Trump attempted a hostile takeover of Harvard, Harvard’s lobbying firm Tremont Strategies continued to represent Tesla. In Oregon, the firm CFM Advocates made the extraordinarily cynical decision to add Tesla as a client one week before the 2024 election, at a time when a Trump victory threatened profound harm to many of the firm’s other clients, such as Portland Public Schools and Oregon Public Broadcasting. Yet after CFM’s work for Musk and these Musk victims was exposed in March, the firm scrambled to create a firewall between Tesla and one of its clients, the progressive Portland suburb of Tigard.

Some lobbying firms ditched Musk much earlier. In May 2024, the progressively aligned congressional firm Pioneer Public Affairs cut ties with Tesla, recognizing that Musk, despite being the CEO of an electric car company, had already become a destructive force in American politics. The practice of representing Musk and DOGE victims has only become more indefensible over time. Other firms are likely to crumble in the face of public pressure.

Pressure is mounting in California, where anti-Tesla activists pushed CalPERS to sell half of its Tesla stock last November, and the state assembly is now considering a bill (AB 33) that would ban driverless vehicles from delivering commercial goods. Shamefully, the lobbying firm Shaw Yoder, which represents more than 40 DOGE-damaged local governments in California, including 11 local transit agencies, is opposing the bill on Tesla’s behalf.

Meanwhile, lawmakers in New York are considering legislation that would shut down Tesla showrooms. Yet Tesla’s New York firm Ostroff Associates also represents eight disability rights groups whose members are losing housing and employment protections because of DOGE cuts to the Department of Housing and Urban Development and other federal agencies.

The dissonance of these lobbying firms working for Musk’s company and the object of his destructive tour through government is only growing. And if the firms don’t drop Musk, they run the risk of having Musk’s victims drop them.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23289/download/RDP%20072825.jpg?cb=27d5c3eaf6d602903cb386ef8036b687&w=1024,N,,2025-07-28 08:02:37.935463

The cooperative has its eye on about 100 acres located near a new substation the Tennessee Valley Authority built to help power the megasite and its tenants, including Ford’s massive BlueOval City electric vehicle and battery manufacturing campus.

The group wants to resurrect the Tennessee Power Distribution Company, a nonprofit, tax-exempt electricity generation and transmission “co-op of co-ops” created in 1999 in case local electricity distribution became an open market.

The power industry didn’t experience such a transition, so co-ops are considering other uses for the company, according to Mike Knotts, CEO of the Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, a group of 23 nonprofit electric co-ops that serve more than 2.5 million Tennesseans. The co-ops purchase their energy from TVA and distribute it locally to customers, accounting for about 25% of the federally-owned public utility’s annual revenue, Knotts said.

“This started back at Christmas Eve of 2022 when we experienced a first for our area — which was rolling blackouts — where there was simply not enough capacity to produce energy in the TVA service territory,” said Knotts, who also serves as Tennessee Power Distribution Company president. “So we as local utilities were called upon to, in rolling increments … turn your power off.”

Affordable, reliable and sustainable: report compares utility performance

Winter Storm Elliott plunged much of Tennessee into single-digit temperatures that year, and mechanical failure combined with historically high electricity demand resulted in the rolling blackouts. The utility made multiple changes to its emergency communications procedures and fortified its facilities to try to withstand frigid conditions the following year.

Knotts told members of the West Tennessee Megasite Authority on Wednesday that the group sought to ensure this would never happen again and landed on the idea of building a “peaking facility” themselves.

Such facilities are intended to operate only when electric consumption needs reach extreme highs, running about 10-20% of the year, Knotts said. The site would generate power using simple cycle combustion turbines powered by natural gas. These turbines do not generate steam and as a result have little discharge water.

The Tennessee Power Distribution Company would then sell that power to TVA to be distributed where it’s needed.

The long process ahead

The Tennessee Electric Cooperative Association, with TVA’s cooperation, completed a site selection study to determine how and where the cooperative could “build assets to produce energy that could complement what TVA does and not disturb the contractual relationship between our cooperatives and TVA,” Knotts said.

The study focused on the Megasite property adjacent to the TVA substation — it’s close to transmission infrastructure, the interstate and a natural gas pipeline installed to serve BlueOval City.

Knotts said the group has had “fruitful” conversations with state officials, and it’s time to move on to more formal arrangements. The cooperative is negotiating with TVA, he said, and will soon start the roughly two-year process of applying to connect to the power transmission grid.

Ultimately, Knotts said the project would need a binding letter of intent and then a long-term lease agreement for the land from the Megasite Authority. The project also would need the blessing of the State Building Commission and must clear a federal interconnection study.

Several Megasite Authority board members posed questions about the proposed facility’s impact, including potential nitrous oxide emissions. Knotts said the facility would require an air quality permit from the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation.

The Megasite Authority board did not take formal action on the issue Wednesday, but each member of the board expressed interest in learning more about the proposal at a September meeting.

Knotts said while he does not speak for TVA, the utility has “stated publicly that it has a deficit for capacity,” in addition to a debt cap set by federal law limiting how many new generation projects TVA can take on.

“Plants like this are going to be built, so our members decided, jointly, we would rather do this, given our service mission, given we are nonprofit entities … than outsource it to a for-profit company,” he said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-97/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/power-line-1024x6821753697079.jpeg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=BFkiolpe,N,,2025-07-28 07:01:38.920410

ABC News quotes an expert saying of the toxic bloom that recent government reports “say quite clearly the primary cause is climate change”.","Major wildfires are burning across Greece and Turkey amid extreme heat, BBC News reports, adding that the south-eastern Turkish city of Silopi had just posted a national record temperature of 50.5C. Sky News says neighbouring Albania and Kosovo are also battling wildfires. The Associated Press says fires are threatening Turkey’s fourth city, Bursa, adding that Bulgaria and Montenegro are also tackling blazes. Separate Reuters articles cover wildfires in Sardinia, Bulgaria, Albania and Turkey. The Guardian, Time, Sun, MailOnline, Independent and Daily Telegraph are among the many outlets covering the events, often with a focus on the impact on holiday destinations and British tourists. Another BBC News piece begins: “Parts of southern Europe have been in the grip of extreme heat with wildfires threatening tourist locations.” The Daily Telegraph runs the headline: “As Med temperatures soar, prepare for underground hotels and air-conditioned beaches.”

Various outlets report links between the wildfires and climate change. The New York Times says Greece “faces a challenge as it tries to preserve its image as an idyllic tourist destination while also facing the growing threat of wildfires”. It adds: “Authorities say there has been an uptick in both the number and the intensity of blazes in recent years, which many experts attribute to climate change.” The Times reports: “The government in Athens has repeatedly attributed rising rates of wildfires to climate change.” Reuters coverage of the Greek fires says: “Greece and other Mediterranean countries are in an area dubbed ‘a wildfire hotspot’ by scientists, with blazes common during hot and dry summers. These have become more destructive in recent years due to a fast-changing climate, prompting calls for a new approach.” Le Monde says: “Greece, like many countries, is experiencing hotter summers stoked by human-induced climate change, which increases the length, frequency and intensity of heatwaves, which favors wildfires.” Axios quotes the World Meteorological Organization saying that extreme heat is becoming “more frequent and intense” as a result of global warming, leading to a “big risk of wildfires”. Pointing to a report from the EU’s Copernicus climate service, it says that “Turkey and the Balkans are experiencing intensifying extreme dry conditions”.

Heavy rains hit a number of northern provinces in China throughout the weekend, “intensif[ying] around Beijing and nearby provinces on Monday”, Reuters reports, with at least “four people killed in a landslide in northern Hebei and eight people missing”. Heavy rains on the outskirts of Beijing saw several thousand people evacuated as “colossal rain” caused flash floods and landslides and led to widespread power cuts. The northern provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi were also heavily impacted by extreme rainfall, the report adds. The state newspaper China Daily covers an initial report of the flooding in Hebei. A minibus carrying 12 people went missing in Shanxi province as “heavy rainfall…caused flooding in multiple rivers”, with flood control measures activated across several cities, says another China Daily report. State news agency Xinhua reports that Premier Li Qiang held a State Council meeting to assess the “current progress of flood and drought prevention and control efforts”.

More than 100 million people in central and eastern parts of the US are “facing blistering temperatures to start the week”, Bloomberg reports, adding that the demand for cooling is “putting a strain on the energy grid”. The Guardian says: “While heat domes cause heatwaves – which are becoming more frequent thanks to the climate crisis – there can be heatwaves without heat domes. Climate scientists have found that heat domes are getting hotter due to global heating caused by humans burning fossil fuels.” Scientific American, CBS News and the Independent all cover the story.

CNN says toxic algae are “turning South Australia’s coral reefs into underwater graveyards”, adding that this is “a stark warning of what happens when climate change goes unchecked”.

ABC News quotes an expert saying of the toxic bloom that recent government reports “say quite clearly the primary cause is climate change”.

In a comment for the Guardian, former independent politician Zoe Daniel criticises Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack, former leaders of the opposition National party, over their “reckless and gutless” attacks on net-zero.

For the Sydney Morning Herald, environment and climate editor Nick O’Malley writes under the headline: “Why Barnaby’s war on net-zero’s already sunk.”

US president Donald Trump has visited his two Scottish golf resorts, the Financial Times reports, drawing protests. The newspaper says Trump is due to meet UK prime minister Keir Starmer and Scottish first minister John Swinney, with both expected to face “questions over UK energy policy, a favourite topic of the president”. The Guardian says he used a meeting with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen yesterday to say the bloc should “stop the windmills”. [Wind power is the EU’s second-largest source of electricity.] The Los Angeles Times notes in its coverage that Trump’s company unsuccessfully tried to prevent a windfarm being built near one of his golf courses. The Times and the Daily Telegraph cover Trump’s claims at a press conference with von der Leyen, where he said wind power was a “con job”. Both newspapers fail to correct a series of his false assertions, including that wind power is the “most expensive form of energy” [the average onshore windfarm built in 2024 was 53% cheaper than the cheapest new fossil-fueled power plant] and that “almost all” turbines are made in China [four of the world’s top 10 manufacturers are from Europe or the US, whereas Chinese firms mostly supply their domestic market].

“As people continue to purchase EV vehicles, they're gonna demand that those EV chargers are up and running all the time,” he said.
A report by Clean Jobs Colorado, an advocacy group, found that the state’s clean energy workforce — people who work on EVs, solar projects and more — grew at more than double the rate of the state’s overall job growth in 2023.
Smith works for ChargerHelp, a company that focuses on maintaining EV chargers and developed the training curriculum.
Goodwill of Colorado said in a press release that trainees could earn up to $80,000 as technicians after the course.","Last Tuesday, 15 trainees armed with electrical tools and wires hunched over work benches in an Aurora strip mall, about to begin “Crimpin’ My Style.”

Crimping — or attaching an electrical component to a wire — is a key skill when repairing electronics and electric vehicle chargers.

“Crimpin’,” on the other hand, is an exercise that’s part of Goodwill of Colorado’s new “Clean Tech Accelerator,” a four-week course in Aurora designed to prepare trainees to become EV charger technicians.

The program is part of a recent nationwide effort by Goodwill Industries International and the consulting firm Accenture to prepare thousands of workers for jobs in the green energy economy — whether that be repairing EV chargers or installing solar panels and heat pumps.

The Colorado version, which launched in July, is funded through Goodwill’s retail store sales and offers stipends, bus passes to get to the center, and job-placement help afterwards. The first cohort – who ranged from 20 to 50 years old – will graduate on Aug. 1.

Goodwill and its partners say that while installing EV chargers might require an electrician with years of experience, repairing them requires just a few weeks of training in a booming market.

“If you went to gas station after gas station … and they were all down because the pumps were broken, people would be furious,” said James Sanchez, director of education and training for Goodwill of Colorado.

“As people continue to purchase EV vehicles, they're gonna demand that those EV chargers are up and running all the time,” he said.

A report by Clean Jobs Colorado, an advocacy group, found that the state’s clean energy workforce — people who work on EVs, solar projects and more — grew at more than double the rate of the state’s overall job growth in 2023.

But that was before the second Trump administration, which has frozen funding for EV chargers, rolled back subsidies to buy EVs, and declared climate-friendly programs a “green new scam.” For now, Coloradans continue to buy EVs, and the state has more than 5,000 public EV charging plugs and counting.

“ I honestly don't feel like the industry is going anywhere,” said Brandon Smith, who led the “Crimpin” training.

Smith works for ChargerHelp, a company that focuses on maintaining EV chargers and developed the training curriculum.

“It’s a slight pause, but we're still gonna sit here and educate people so they can be ready for the future no matter what,” he said.

Jobs could pay $80K … if you can get one

The accelerator’s first week certifies trainees on CPR, workplace safety, and basic construction skills. The next three weeks dive into the literal nuts and bolts of fixing an EV charger.

Last week, trainees watched as Smith worked inside the guts of a hulking fast-charger installed in a classroom. Smith demonstrated how to use a torque wrench and recited some safety basics with the class.

“Lock-out, tag-out!” they yelled, referring to a way to “de-energize” chargers so technicians don’t get electrocuted.

The program is specifically aimed at Coloradans who are “underemployed, unemployed, unskilled but also interested in entering the trades industry,” Sanchez said.

Goodwill of Colorado said in a press release that trainees could earn up to $80,000 as technicians after the course. A spokesperson later attributed that salary figure to a quote from ChargerHelp’s CEO.

Jessica Hutcheson, vice president of learning and development at ChargerHelp, said in an email to CPR News that technician salaries can range widely depending on the region, employer and type of work.

According to ZipRecruiter, the average salary is closer to $57,000 in Colorado, with $80,000 being the upper end and representing only three percent of such jobs.

Hutcheson wrote that ChargerHelp’s own full-time technicians start at $30/hour with benefits, and that technicians could earn $80,000 with a few years of experience in “high-demand markets and with overtime or specialized roles.”

Trainees will need additional certifications before they start working, though, because each charger manufacturer uses different software. Those additional sessions can take around a week or two each, according to Smith.

Program has mixed results, but Goodwill says job placements are growing

But despite the promise of high salaries, the program has had mixed success in other cities.

Goodwill Industries International launched the accelerator program in 2024 in Nashville, Detroit, Atlanta and Houston, backed by private funds mainly from Accenture and GM.

But a few months after those initial cohorts wrapped, less than 40 percent found work in clean energy jobs, according to a September 2024 report by Bloomberg News. That data excludes placements from Detroit.

In an email to CPR News, a spokesperson for Goodwill Industries International said it’s currently seeing placement rates closer to 70 percent in clean tech jobs across its programs, which have expanded to multiple other cities.

The Aurora accelerator ends with a graduation ceremony and a job fair, where companies including Namaste Solar, My Electric Home and the Colorado Building and Construction Trades Council can start interviewing trainees.

Sanchez said he hopes that around 75 percent of students will be placed in jobs within a year.

He said that rate is similar to other programs in Goodwill of Colorado’s Excel Center, which hosts the EV training and also operates a high school for adults.

Benjamin Colorado Jr., a trainee in the program, graduated from the Excel Center high school a few weeks ago and was accepted into the accelerator. He previously worked on neon signs, so has some electrical experience, but said that working on EV chargers is “a whole different beast.”

Colorado Jr. said he was excited to become a technician, to diagnose issues with a charger as soon as he opens it.

“These EV stations are here to stay, and they need employees to go out there and fix them, and keep them maintenanced,” he said.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/20250724-goodwill-it-hwv008.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:03:13.025655

It is the largest binding agreement of its kind in Europe between an energy company and a developer of these technological infrastructures.

Iberdrola will have a 20% stake in the joint venture through its subsidiary CPD4Green. It will be responsible for identifying and securing land with connectivity to the electricity grid where the centres can be developed. In addition, it will supply electricity 24/7 to the centres.

Echelon will own 80% of the company and will be responsible for the development, design, marketing and day-to-day management of the joint venture.

Echelon’s major shareholder is Starwood Capital Group, a global private investment firm with approximately $115bn in assets under management in North America, Europe and Asia.

The first of the projects in this joint venture will be Madrid Sur, a 160,000-square metre complex that will offer 144MW of data processing and which already has a 230MW electricity connection secured.

This centre, which will create around 1500 jobs and is expected to be operational before 2030, will involve a demand of 1TWh that will be covered by a photovoltaic solar plant which will be built on-site, complemented by additional clean energy capacity from Iberdrola.

“This agreement reinforces Iberdrola's strategy of facilitating the development of data centres, which have already become a key vector for the growth in electricity demand,” said David Mesonero Molina, corporate development director of Iberdrola.

“The alliance signed with Echelon will allow us to value our portfolio of sites with access to electricity connection and our ability to offer these infrastructures secure, clean and competitive energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.”

David Smith, chief investment officer at Echelon Data Centres, said: “Entering the Spanish data centre market has been a strategic goal for Echelon for several years.

“Spain has material benefits for our customers: access to large-scale renewable energy with some of the lowest prices in Europe and large construction and operation capacities.

“Our partner, Iberdrola, is a global energy leader and we are delighted to have this opportunity to partner to offer the best data processing infrastructures to our customers.”

Iberdrola already sells more than 11TWh to technology companies and operators of these infrastructures worldwide, which makes it a leader in the supply of electricity to data centres.

This partnership—originally launched in 2021—focuses on addressing deforestation risks and the broader environmental, social, and economic challenges that smallholders face.

At the heart of the collaboration is the Subulussalam Smallholders Hub, a landscape-based initiative by Musim Mas that trains smallholders and Village Extension Officers (VEOs) on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and NDPE (No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation) principles. VEOs serve as local trainers and knowledge multipliers in their communities.

Over the past three years, the program has exceeded expectations, training 1,581 smallholders (original target: 1,250) and 117 VEOs (original target: 60). In the second phase, 20 top-performing VEOs received advanced retraining aligned with Indonesia's ISPO certification, including modules on home composting to reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers.

With the renewed 2025 partnership, the initiative will directly train an additional 500 smallholders and 20 more VEOs through the advanced training track. This will bring the program's total reach to over 2,000 smallholders and 40 VEOs with advanced skills.

Beyond environmental outcomes, the partnership aims to build long-term community resilience. Musim Mas plans to introduce new advanced training modules covering its women smallholders' program, youth engagement, and financial literacy. Women will continue receiving support in nutrition and business management, with efforts to involve male family members to foster an inclusive and supportive environment.

Recognizing the importance of engaging the next generation, the program will include youth-focused outreach on sustainable agriculture, NDPE practices, and market expectations. Tailored capacity-building platforms will be developed to inspire innovation and commitment among young farmers.

The initiative also addresses the need for financial planning, particularly as smallholders prepare for palm replanting cycles. Training in financial management will empower them to make informed decisions and ensure long-term self-sufficiency.

Musim Mas, Nestlé, and AAK reaffirm their shared vision of inclusive, sustainable palm oil production in Aceh. As EUDR implementation nears, the partnership also offers a critical support mechanism to help smallholders overcome compliance challenges and remain active participants in global supply chains.

Yes, we meet today to discuss greenhouse gas emissions and clean energy targets.
That path is never straight: until now, fossil fuels still supply more than three-quarters of Indonesia’s energy for power and transport.

Not only to lead in Southeast Asia — but to help shape the world’s clean energy future.","Below is a speech from UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell, at the Indonesia Net-Zero Summit in Jakarta on Saturday 26 July 2025.

Your Excellencies,

Distinguished guests,

Colleagues and friends,

Allow me to begin by thanking our host, the Foreign Policy Community of Indonesia, for convening this important Summit at such a pivotal moment – not only for Indonesia, but for the world. It is a true honour to stand with you here today in Jakarta.

Indonesia is showing the world that climate ambition and economic development are not competing priorities.

They are not opposing paths.

They are two sides of the same coin – a single, unified strategy to deliver prosperity, resilience, and dignity for your people. For all people.

Yes, we meet today to discuss greenhouse gas emissions and clean energy targets.

But let me be clear: the real heart of climate action is not numbers. It is people.

You, me, our families.

Our communities.

The workers building your industries, the farmers tending your sawah, the ojek drivers navigating your cities, the entrepreneurs creating new businesses, and the children dreaming of a safer, better life.

And in this context, climate action is an opportunity.

Not the price of progress, but the path to progress.

That path is never straight: until now, fossil fuels still supply more than three-quarters of Indonesia’s energy for power and transport.

This remains far from what the science tells us is needed for a 1.5-degree future.

But the next steps you take – to be charted by your next national climate plan – can be game-changing.

Done right and on time - with bold and ambitious commitments - your next NDC can become the blueprint for Indonesia’s net-zero future:

A future for more than 270 million people where growth is green, development is inclusive, and prosperity is shared by all.

Where more investment, more jobs, and higher economic growth are unlocked and enjoyed at scale by all.

Accelerating Indonesia’s just and clean energy transition will create huge numbers of new jobs, and attract billions of new investment.

And the vital signs are encouraging – in renewable energy alone, your capacity has surged by 40% since 2019 – with nearly 1,000 megawatts added in this year alone.

And you have the talent, here in this room.

You have the resources.

And you have the momentum.

Not only to lead in Southeast Asia — but to help shape the world’s clean energy future.

This is not leadership newly found. It is leadership long demonstrated.

Since launching your national Emissions Trading System last year, you have once again shown your commitment to driving real change.

And as the new Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism comes online, I am confident that it will help Indonesia raise the ambition of your climate plans.

At UN Climate Change, we stand ready to support you in seizing this opportunity.

Because systems and credits matter – as part of a choice to seize a better future.

And in framing that future, I want to acknowledge the leadership of President Prabowo.

Indonesia’s commitment to net-zero – and the President’s bold call to go earlier – sends a powerful message to the world – the future will be built differently.

And his commitment is to vastly accelerate the build out of clean energy and to ensure that more of the profits of that transition remain here in Indonesia, can be a model for every emerging economy.

Seventy years ago, in Bandung, Indonesia helped pioneer a new approach to international cooperation, grounded in solidarity among developing nations, in their mutual self-interest.

I see a similar opportunity now.

I do not underestimate the challenge – but I’m excited by your leadership.

Indonesia’s strengths are undeniable: your beautiful forests, your rich biodiversity, your powerful renewable energy, and most of all, your people.

Let us never forget: this is not just a transition away from emissions. It is a transformation towards hope.

This is the decisive decade.

In today’s rapidly evolving energy landscape, corporations are increasingly turning to renewable energy as a cornerstone of their sustainability and business strategies. The transition to clean power has moved beyond environmental altruism to become a fundamental business imperative, driven by economic advantages, stakeholder expectations, and regulatory pressures.

The Rise of Corporate Power Purchase Agreements

Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (vPPAs) have emerged as a transformative tool for corporations seeking to decarbonize their operations while maintaining financial discipline. These agreements allow companies to support renewable energy development without physically receiving the electricity generated, creating a win-win scenario for both energy producers and corporate buyers.

The strategic advantages of vPPAs are particularly compelling for multinational corporations. These agreements enable geographically flexible decarbonization, allowing companies to match renewable energy procurement with their global footprint. This has made vPPAs especially attractive for organizations looking to implement centralized procurement strategies across dispersed operations.

Technology Driving Renewable Adoption

The renewable energy sector is experiencing unprecedented technological innovation. Solar’s exponential growth continues to reshape the global power system, with its share in the electricity mix rising rapidly. Improvements in panel efficiency, manufacturing processes, and installation techniques have dramatically reduced costs, making solar increasingly competitive with conventional energy sources.

Artificial intelligence is accelerating this transition by optimizing operational efficiency and driving technological innovation. AI applications range from predictive maintenance for wind turbines to optimizing grid integration of intermittent renewable resources. These technological advancements are making renewable energy more reliable, efficient, and cost-effective for corporate adopters.

Manufacturing and Supply Chain Transformation

The clean energy manufacturing sector is experiencing significant growth, particularly in battery and solar manufacturing. New facilities are being developed across North America and Europe, reducing dependence on concentrated supply chains and creating more resilient networks for renewable energy components.

However, challenges remain. The sector faces headwinds from tariff escalations, uncertain policy outlooks, and broader macroeconomic pressures. These challenges highlight the complex interplay between policy, economics, and corporate strategy in the renewable energy transition.

Strategic Implementation Frameworks

For corporations looking to implement renewable energy strategies, a structured approach is essential. Energy experts identify several overarching energy transition strategies:

Increasing renewable energy capacity to match rising electricity demand

Shifting from coal and oil to natural gas-fired power plants that can be decarbonized

Upgrading and expanding power grids for resilience and renewable integration

Building hydrogen markets for hard-to-abate sectors

Engaging society in the energy transition

Leading corporations are implementing these strategies through a combination of on-site generation, power purchase agreements, renewable energy certificates, and community investment. The most successful approaches integrate renewable energy procurement with broader sustainability goals, creating synergies across environmental initiatives.

Data Centers Leading Corporate Adoption

Data center operators have emerged as pioneers in corporate renewable energy adoption. The energy-intensive nature of these facilities, combined with the tech sector’s ambitious climate commitments, has driven unprecedented investment in renewable energy projects. Major cloud providers have made commitments to power their operations with clean energy, driving innovation in procurement models and grid integration.

Looking Ahead

As we move through 2025, the momentum for clean energy continues to build despite geopolitical and economic headwinds. The transition appears unstoppable, driven by improving economics, technological innovation, and growing stakeholder pressure.

For corporations, the message is clear: renewable energy is no longer just an environmental consideration but a strategic business opportunity. Those who develop comprehensive renewable energy strategies—leveraging tools like vPPAs, embracing technological innovation, and implementing structured frameworks—will be best positioned to thrive in the clean power era.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/23mxK5sv286fwT6KuOLIYYNVDnn9gCTbBZUzzV1Df7o/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZW5fQUlfc29sYXJfcGFuZWxzX0Fkb2JlU3RvY2tfMTMxNzYwMTU5Mi0xMDQweDYxNl84Nzk3XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-07-28 07:02:03.266790

Fuel Cells: Powering the Future of Data Centers For onsite power generation at the scale required by modern data centers, few options are cost-competitive.","Securing clean, reliable and sustainable power at scale has become one of the most urgent and complex challenges facing the data center industry. Between 2015 and 2019, data center workloads tripled. During that time, energy efficiency initiatives — including improved resource management, advanced cooling technologies and automation — helped balance the growing demand. However, those efforts alone won’t suffice as artificial intelligence (AI) applications dramatically increase power requirements in the coming years.

Experts project that data center power demand will surge 160% by 2030, more than doubling the sector’s current electricity consumption. This immense growth will be driven mainly by AI workloads, which require extraordinary computational power and massive amounts of electricity.

To better understand how the industry is responding to the evolving power landscape, Bloom Energy surveyed approximately 100 data center leaders, including hyperscalers, colocation developers and GPU service providers. Their insights reveal a significant shift in priorities: access to reliable power is now their primary concern when it comes to site selection.

These insights are captured in Bloom Energy’s 2025 Data Center Power Report, which highlights five key trends reshaping how data centers plan, build and power their operations.

Trend 1: Power availability unseats fiber as the top factor in site selection.

In 2024, proximity to high-speed fiber optic networks — essential for delivering the low-latency, high-throughput connections modern applications demand — was the leading site selection priority. This year, however, access to power eclipsed all other factors. A striking 84% of respondents ranked power among their top three considerations, far ahead of proximity to customers, network connectivity, local regulations or weather risks.

The shift is driven by a simple reality: sites with immediate or guaranteed access to scalable power enable developers to bring AI infrastructure online more quickly. In competitive markets where power scarcity creates bottlenecks, the ability to secure power quickly offers a significant competitive advantage.

Trend 2: Data center developers and utilities aren’t on the same page when it comes to power availability timelines.

The survey uncovered a notable misalignment between data center developers and utilities regarding power availability timelines. In key markets, there can be a one- to two-year gap between developers’ expectations for power delivery and when utilities can realistically provide the necessary capacity. This disconnect creates friction in a market where time to power is critical.

Utilities are increasingly accelerating time to power with onsite power generation solutions, such as fuel cells. Fuel cells allow utilities to position themselves as strategic partners for data center operators by quickly providing clean, resilient electricity, without impacting affordability for other ratepayers. For example, American Electric Power (AEP) is partnering with Bloom Energy to deploy fuel cells to meet the immediate power needs of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cologix data centers in Central Ohio.

“These onsite solutions enable data centers to begin operations quickly while utilities work to build the next generation of grid infrastructure,” said Natalie Sunderland, chief marketing officer at Bloom Energy.

Trend 3: Power-intensive AI chips will drive the development of mega-scale data centers.

The size and power demands of data centers are growing exponentially to keep pace with the increasing complexity of AI workloads. A few years ago, 30 MW data centers were the norm. Today, a single data center typically requires 200 MW —one-fifth the capacity of a typical nuclear power plant — and that number is climbing as data centers grow larger and more complex.

For instance, Nvidia’s latest rack-scale system may require up to 120 kW each, so the power demands of a fully populated data center would be enormous. Industry leaders anticipate median data center size will reach between 250 MW and 300 MW by 2030 and between 350 MW and 400 MW by 2035. This explosive growth puts unprecedented pressure on energy infrastructure and grid capacity.

Trend 4: Data center developers are increasingly concerned about grid availability and looking to establish their own generation capacity.

Given increasing worries about grid availability, more data center developers are exploring onsite power generation. Survey results show:

38% of data centers expect to adopt onsite power generation by 2030, with that number rising to nearly 50% by 2035.

27% of data centers are projected to rely entirely on onsite generation for their primary power by 2030 — a dramatic increase from just 1% a year ago.

This trend highlights the need for reliable, scalable onsite power solutions. Industry leaders like Equinix are already embracing this shift, with Bloom Energy’s fuel cell systems providing more than 100 MW of electricity across Equinix’s U.S. data centers.

Trend 5: Reliability, cost, and sustainability continue to drive onsite power architecture decisions.

When selecting onsite power solutions, survey respondents identified reliability and cost as their top priorities, along with meeting sustainability goals. Fuel cells have emerged as a leading choice because they effectively balance these requirements.

Although fuel cells may have higher upfront capital costs, their operational advantages, particularly in terms of fuel efficiency, offset those initial expenses over time. When considering the total cost of ownership, including capital, operating, and environmental compliance costs, fuel cells become highly competitive. Moreover, they match or exceed the reliability of traditional onsite power solutions.

Additionally, their cleaner emissions profile accelerates permitting and deployment. Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) generate electricity through a combustion-free, high-temperature electrochemical process, producing no nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), even when operating on natural gas. This makes them ideal for data centers in regions with strict air quality regulations. Additionally, fuel cells require no additional water during normal operation, an important advantage in drought-prone areas where water permits can be difficult to obtain.

“Once the cost-effectiveness of fuel cells is understood, developers find that these systems check all the boxes: fast time to power, high reliability, and compliance with increasingly stringent environmental standards,” Sunderland said.

Fuel Cells: Powering the Future of Data Centers

For onsite power generation at the scale required by modern data centers, few options are cost-competitive. Nuclear power shows promise, but small modular reactors (SMRs) are still in development, and conventional facilities have long lead times that are incompatible with the rapid deployment of AI infrastructure. Gas turbines face similarly long timelines, while reciprocating engines such as diesel generators, though quick to install, often fail to meet environmental standards.

Fuel cells stand out as a uniquely effective solution. Bloom Energy’s SOFC Energy Server® power systems can be deployed behind or in front of the meter in various configurations and contracting models. With over 1.5 GW of installed capacity, leveraging over $6 billion in project financing, Bloom’s modular architecture enables rapid, scalable deployment with proven reliability and efficiency.

“In today’s environment, fuel cells are gaining traction because they combine scalability, reliability and high performance,” Sunderland said. “Most importantly, they are a relatively cost-effective solution, making them an ideal choice for utilities and data centers alike.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/38315YMn4ee6dH9qp1zP7ZewrSI7q9uPECOl9R81Gnc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMTkxMDU4MTcyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-28 07:01:58.455046

Customers of the biggest regional power grid operator in the US could see their bills go up next year, largely due to skyrocketing demand for electricity coming from AI data centers.

Last week, PJM Interconnection closed its annual capacity auction with prices for wholesale electric capacity up 22% from 2024, another record-breaking year. As a result, monthly electric bills in PJM's territory, which covers 67 million customers, could increase up to 5% next year, the grid operator said.

PJM Interconnection territory spans thirteen states from the Midwest to the East Coast— including all or parts of Delaware, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C.

Every year, PJM's summer auction determines the cost of wholesale electricity for the following year. Though its territory doesn't cover the entire US, the energy industry looks at the PJM auction as a bellwether for electricity prices for the entire country.

PJM's territory includes Data Center Alley in Northern Virginia, home to the world's biggest concentration of data centers. It also includes areas of the country where data centers are rapidly expanding, such as Columbus, Ohio. The grid operator identified data center expansion as the primary driver of demand in its territory, which caused the jump in wholesale electricity prices.

Impacts on Vermont’s residential solar industry

A typical residential rooftop solar array costs between $20,000 and $30,000, said Peter Sterling, with the trade group Renewable Energy Vermont.

The federal tax credit for residential rooftop solar projects has been around in some form since the early 1990s, but was expanded under the Biden administration so that homeowners could recoup 30% of the cost of a project in tax breaks, and more if they also installed batteries.

Under the new law, those credits will go away altogether at the end of this year, repealing decades of incentives that previously enjoyed bipartisan support. (The commercial solar tax credit is set to sunset in 2027, and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act also restricts tax incentives for batteries starting next year.)

Alexander Mintz owns Power Guru, a Bennington-based company that installs solar arrays and battery systems in Southern Vermont. He expects many small and medium-sized solar developers in Vermont will go out of business or have to turn away rooftop solar customers.

Power Guru is anticipating a pretty serious blow to their business in 2026, Mintz said, and will face tough choices that could affect their 10 employees.

“They are not limited to downsizing,” Mintz said. “We’re going to try to avoid that by training quickly on other technologies that we might be able to offer, but there is a lot of uncertainty about whether or not those transitions will amount to sustainable revenue.”

He said the company could pivot to installing heat pumps and doing HVAC work — though federal incentives for those efficiency technologies are also targeted by the new law.

The removal of tax credits could also have broader implications for the state’s economy: The renewable energy sector employs about 18,000 people in the state, or about 6% of Vermont’s workforce. That’s the highest per capita share of any state in the country.

Jarred Cobb of Randolph’s Catamount Solar said the changes will also make it harder to find developers willing to work on projects that serve lower-income households and affordable housing developments.

“Solar companies will have to focus on their profitability,” he said. “Those projects that have complications, have longer lead time, have more bureaucracy to get through … will suffer.”

On the flip side, many local solar companies have seen growth in recent years, and could see a very good 2025, as people scramble to leverage federal tax credits before they expire by the end of the year.

Impacts to programs for low-income solar

The loss of federal tax credits also has a ripple effect on the Solar For All program, which is meant to help low-income households get solar for free and make affordable housing developments more energy efficient.

It’s part of a $7 billion nationwide effort to lower household energy costs for families that spend a high share of their income on their energy bills.

Vermont received $62 million in federal funds to launch its program this year.

But state Solar For All director Melissa Bailey said federal solar tax credits were a critical part of how the state planned to stretch those federal funds.

“The unfortunate impact there is we’ll just be able to have fewer participants in the program,” Bailey said.

Because many lower-income households don’t have the tax liability to benefit from a tax break, the program hoped to recruit investors to take on the liability, allowing those households to get solar installed for free or at a very low cost.

Absent that financing tool, she said the state could be forced to cut the number of individual households it serves through that aspect of Solar for All by between a quarter and a third.

Meanwhile, the elimination of the commercial tax credit in 2027 could put a damper on solar installations for affordable housing projects, which often take longer to build and permit.

Impacts for all ratepayers

And while small businesses and low-income households will feel a more immediate impact, the loss of solar and battery tax credits will put financial pressure on all electric ratepayers.

Vermont has committed by law to source 100% of its electricity from renewable resources by 2035, with 20% of that power coming from new renewables in the region by 2035. Most of that is expected to come from new solar — much of it installed by utilities, who are also poised to lose out on solar tax credits by the end of 2027.

TJ Poor, with the Department of Public Service, said eliminating the federal tax credits for residential and commercial solar will make it more expensive for Vermont to reach its climate commitment in the electric sector.

“Those are costs that would otherwise have been borne by the federal government, which are not the shared responsibility of solar developers and ratepayers,” Poor said.

The Department estimates electric rates will increase by 25% by 2030. Poor said the elimination of federal incentives for solar will only put more pressure on rates.

So too will uncertainty about offshore wind, at a time when many utilities in the state are preparing to renegotiate their long-term contracts for purchasing power from generators in southern New England and Hydro-Québec.

Demand for power in New England is expected to increase by about 10% over the next decade. Poor says the elimination of tax credits won’t slow the deployment of renewables in Vermont, thanks to state regulations requiring them.

But it could decrease supply region-wide at a time when demand is going up, as people install heat pumps and electric vehicle chargers.

Renewable developers would like to see Vermont step in to subsidize residential solar as some other states have done, including neighboring New York — whether through state tax credits or increasing the credit that rooftop solar customers get on their electric bills.

But Poor and other Scott administration regulators predict there will be limited appetite for such a solution.

“Vermont is facing cost pressures across the board,” Poor said. “You can just go down the list right now, and adding a one-for-one replacement of these tax credits would be a challenge because it would be more cost for either ratepayers or taxpayers, depending on how you structure it.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f860366/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2117+0+454/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc7%2F34%2Ffb81e8404a0f846007f506f7278c%2Fsolar-array-vermont-law-school-south-royalton-closeup-vermontpublic-giles-20250310.JPG,N,,2025-07-28 07:01:21.718149

The Big Beautiful Bill Could Change That,"Anika Jane Beamer, Dan Gearino",,,,,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/28072025/big-beautiful-bill-iowa-data-centers/,"But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could undermine Iowa’s status as a growing destination for data centers.
In 1993, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sponsored the Wind Energy Incentives Act, the first nationwide tax credit for wind energy production.
In Iowa, where wind energy already comprises a majority of generated electricity, clean energy has been easy to come by.
Congress’ rollback of incentives for renewable energy expansion will push costs up, said O’Brien, the Energy Innovation analyst.
Alliant will be powering two new data centers under construction in Cedar Rapids, owned by Google and QTS.","A line of gnarled elm trees separates Willow Creek Street in West Des Moines from a quintessentially Iowan corn field, deep green at the height of mid-summer.

Across the road, a barbed wire fence borders a sprawling, 10-building Microsoft data center. More and more, this sight is also quintessentially Iowan.

The grid of white warehouses is Microsoft’s Project Alluvion, one of six data centers the tech giant has built in the city of West Des Moines since 2009. Microsoft has invested between $5 billion and $6 billion in these data centers and, last year, announced plans to build a seventh in the region.

Microsoft’s growing West Des Moines empire is part of a larger trend in Iowa, one in which big name cloud-computing companies have flocked to a state rich in corn, hogs and wind energy.

But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could undermine Iowa’s status as a growing destination for data centers. Cuts to renewable energy incentives laid out in the newly adopted law will increase costs for industrial energy purchasers in Iowa, experts warn, potentially losing the state future investments.

“For consumers like data centers, where a majority of their operational costs go to sourcing energy, that’s going to have a huge impact on where they decide to site their centers,” said Dan O’Brien, a senior modeling analyst at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy research firm based in San Francisco.

According to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, 27 data centers are currently operating or under construction in the state. On top of the host of Microsoft centers, Iowa is home to two massive Google data center campuses, two campuses for Facebook parent Meta and, as of last year, one Apple campus. These four companies alone have invested nearly $17 billion into their data centers in Iowa, with Google announcing another $7 billion in investments in its Iowa campuses over the next two years.

What has attracted tech giants to Iowa? Open land, lower construction costs, a recently beefed-up suite of tax exemptions and, above all, cheap, renewable energy, experts said.

Iowa has led the nation in wind energy since 1983, when it became the first state to adopt a renewable portfolio standard, requiring utilities to purchase wind-generated power. In 1993, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) sponsored the Wind Energy Incentives Act, the first nationwide tax credit for wind energy production.

The state has also implemented property and sales tax exemptions for wind and solar energy equipment, as well as offering zero percent interest loans to individuals or businesses that cover up to half the cost of a renewable energy system.

Iowa’s incentives, paired with the winds that blow unobstructed across its flat, open land as air masses from the Gulf of Mexico and the north collide, led to the exponential rise of wind energy there.

In 2001, that energy accounted for just 1 percent of the state’s electricity mix. By 2010, it made up 15 percent. Wind now accounts for 60 percent of Iowa’s total energy mix—the highest percentage of any state, including Texas, the only state with greater net wind energy generation.

Iowa’s well-developed wind energy offerings draws cloud-computing companies looking to plug into clean energy, said Ryan Moffatt, community and economic development director for the city of West Des Moines, where Microsoft data centers have added $2 billion to the city tax base.

Microsoft’s investment in the area propelled West Des Moines to the third-highest assessed property value in the state, even though it ranks seventh in terms of population, Moffatt said.

Iowa’s renewable energy is appealing to tech companies looking to meet sustainability goals, said Moffatt. “These big tech companies like to have a focus on renewable energy,” he said.

Google advertises a global goal of net-zero emissions by 2030, while Microsoft aims to be carbon-negative in the same time frame and Meta reports being net-zero since 2020.

This emphasis on renewably sourced energy comes as data centers nationwide face intense scrutiny for their enormous electricity and water consumption. (Microsoft’s data centers in West Des Moines account for 2 to 7 percent of the city’s water use, while Meta centers in nearby Altoona use up to 16 percent of the city water supply. Meta’s Altoona campus consumed about 1.2 million megawatt-hours of electricity in 2023, enough to power 100,000 homes for a year, making it the company’s second most energy-intensive data center. )

In Iowa, where wind energy already comprises a majority of generated electricity, clean energy has been easy to come by.

Google’s Council Bluffs, Iowa, data center campus runs on 95 percent carbon-free electricity, said a company spokesperson. Microsoft matches 100 percent of Iowa data center energy consumption with contracted carbon-free electricity, a spokesperson told Inside Climate News, and the same is also true for Meta.

Wind energy isn’t just readily accessible to data centers, it’s cheap, too. Iowa has the eighth-lowest average electricity prices, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. As a result, most data centers in the state have opted to purchase their energy from the grid, as opposed to building their own power plants onsite, the companies told Inside Climate News.

That means they are susceptible to changing utility rates, though. Congress’ rollback of incentives for renewable energy expansion will push costs up, said O’Brien, the Energy Innovation analyst.

Energy Innovation modeled the economic effects of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s energy provisions on all 48 states in the contiguous U.S. In Iowa, the group predicted a 14 to 26 percent increase in electricity rates.

“At the top end of that spectrum are industrial consumers,” said O’Brien. “Most of the cost of their power is the actual generation cost itself.” When generation costs go up, he said, it’s industrial consumers like data centers that face the most significant price hikes.

Energy Innovation predicted drops in private investment around the country, including in Iowa.

Hampering future wind development in Iowa won’t just drive up the cost of renewable energy, it will also raise the prices of traditional gas and coal power sources as demand spikes amid sluggish supply growth, O’Brien said.

“As much as these power prices are going up, tech companies are going to look to either other states or other countries to place their data centers,” he predicted.

Moffatt, the West Des Moines development director, worries about lost development opportunities for Iowa as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill. “From my perspective, a lack of future energy generation opportunities will certainly have an effect on landing industrial economic development prospects within the state, especially to meet the desired timelines of when the prospects would like to be online and operational,” he said in an email.

Spokespeople for Google, Meta, and Microsoft declined to comment on whether the law would affect their expansion in Iowa or reliance on renewables.

Grassley, pivotal in the early development of Iowa’s wind energy, joined his GOP colleagues in voting for Trump’s massive tax bill, though not before successfully advocating to strike a proposed tax on solar and wind energy projects.

When asked about the impacts of the budget bill on Iowa’s renewable energy sector, Grassley’s office directed Inside Climate News to statements on his web site. “The One Big Beautiful Bill Delivers Massive Wins For Iowans,” the page header reads.

“Grassley fought hard to improve the transition period for planned wind and solar projects by providing a 12-month runway after the One Big Beautiful Bill’s enactment for projects to begin construction,” Grassley’s office said in a news release. “In doing so, the bill will supercharge near-term growth for the renewable energy industry and protect workable standards for projects.”

The extent of that “near-term growth” remains to be seen. But some companies may pick up the pace to get in before the deadline. The day after the budget bill passed the Senate, Alliant Energy, one of Iowa’s largest electric and gas utilities, announced plans to add up to 1,000 megawatts of wind energy generation in the state by 2028.

Alliant currently owns 1,300 megawatts of wind resources in Iowa, a spokesperson for the company said. Alliant will be powering two new data centers under construction in Cedar Rapids, owned by Google and QTS.

If approved by the Iowa Utilities Commission, Alliant’s planned timeline would ensure that its projects qualify for the full federal production tax credit, despite the budget bill’s accelerated phaseouts.

“We continue to evaluate the opportunities and limitations that come with the legislation; however, [we] remain committed to our all-of-the-above approach to energy generation, which prioritizes new, renewable and traditional sources to best serve our customers,” Alliant wrote in a statement.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/deer-outside-council-bluffs-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:02:11.941369

Andersen said the township is the first and only shore town in New Jersey that collects the discarded oyster and clam shells from local restaurants for use in a reef project.
“Oysters are coastal ecosystem engineers,” said Tim Dillingham, executive director of the American Littoral Society, a New Jersey-based coastal conservation nonprofit that is working on several oyster reef projects.
For decades, dating to the 1880s, the industry had driven local economies up and down the New Jersey coast.
The “magnificent” oyster, she said, is pointing the way for how nature can lessen the impact of climate change and sea level rise.","LONG BEACH TOWNSHIP, N.J.—Every year, hungry restaurant patrons slurp down fat, juicy oysters, their greyish-white shells cast aside with little thought. But here on this picturesque barrier island, the crusty shells are a valuable commodity and are hauled away by township workers, sorted by volunteers and destined for a whole new life.

Come September, the recycled shells collected over the last few years will become part of a new oyster reef the township is building to help protect its bayside marshland from erosion. Baby oysters, known as spat, will be added to the mix of recycled shells in a concrete “castle” in a modern-day effort to grow a new colony, which in turn will make the bay healthier.

The job for the small but mighty oysters is a good example of how scientists are turning to nature-based solutions in the struggle against climate change and rising sea levels.

“The concept is as old as the ages,” said Angela Andersen, the township’s sustainability director and project manager for the new reef.

Andersen said the township is the first and only shore town in New Jersey that collects the discarded oyster and clam shells from local restaurants for use in a reef project. But other governments and organizations are working on a variety of similar projects along the U.S. coastline.

In New York City, the Billion Oyster Project is trying to restore the oyster population that was once so vibrant that early settlers marveled at the giant natural oyster reefs that towered in what is now New York Harbor. Other states with oyster projects underway include California, Connecticut, Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama and Florida.

Some are trying to protect their shorelines, as Long Beach Township is doing, or to save property or help other marine life—such as the horseshoe crabs that need a sandy beach to lay their eggs every spring along the Delaware Bay, where the beach is eroding. And others are trying to rebuild the oyster population and revive the once-thriving oyster-based economy.

Andersen said the idea behind the township project is to mimic a natural oyster reef, which once grew into large clumps and would intrinsically protect the marshes from wind and waves. The new reef will consist of bagged and loose shells, along with modified blocks of concrete known as oyster castles, that will be strategically placed in shallow water just off the 22-acre Clam Cove Reserve marsh, which is visible from Andersen’s office at the township marine education center.

The project, which is funded and supported by a coalition of community, environmental and government groups, should help on multiple levels—keeping used shells out of landfills, protecting and enhancing local marine habitat and helping to lessen erosion. And the oyster is the star of the show.

“Oysters are coastal ecosystem engineers,” said Tim Dillingham, executive director of the American Littoral Society, a New Jersey-based coastal conservation nonprofit that is working on several oyster reef projects.

Across Barnegat Bay, in the shallow water off the Forked River bay town, a series of caged units with a mix of shells and rock form segments of oyster reef that was built in 2021 and now is being monitored by Dillingham’s organization.

“It’s very successful so far and it’s definitely meeting the objectives that we set,” said Dillingham, looking out at the reefs one day this month. He said those goals include helping protect the shoreline, which was battered during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and encouraging the growth of oysters—which will also make the bay waters cleaner.

Zack Royle, habitat restoration projects manager with ALS who is working on the $1 million project, said that 115 of the reef’s 168 units now have oysters on them, suggesting they are able to latch onto the shells and thrive.

“If you build it, they will come,” said Julie Schumacher, the Littoral Society’s senior habitat restoration coordinator who also is working on the project.

Oysters have been around for millions of years and are tiny workhorses of the water. They filter toxins, leaving their natural habitats in bays with cleaner water. And when they clump together and form reefs, they provide crucial underwater structure for crabs and juvenile fish. As scientists search for ways to blunt the impact of climate change, they also are seeing that new reefs can be specially designed to protect against coastal erosion by blunting winds and waves and providing a seawall-like buffer for marshes and beaches.

The oyster is also now helping with the nation’s defense.

At Tyndall Air Force Base in Florida, scientists from Rutgers University in New Jersey are leading a project to test whether a hybrid oyster reef will be effective in protecting the country’s coastal bases around the world from dangerously high winds. A series of concrete modules was built and installed last fall in the Gulf of Mexico near Tampa, and scientists are watching and gathering data. So far, the data is encouraging.

“We see either a reduction in the rate of erosion, or a build-back of the shoreline,” said David Bushek, the lead scientist on the project and director of Rutgers’ Haskin Shellfish Research Laboratory.

The $11.3 million project was begun after Tyndall suffered $5 billion in damages in 2018 during Hurricane Michael, with winds ripping through buildings, flipping aircraft and flinging around anything not tied down.

Bushek said there is a lot of experimentation going on among scientists about what mix of components and structure are most effective for new reefs to encourage the growth of oysters, protect them from disease and predators and get the desired environmental impact.

The industry, meanwhile, is slowly making a comeback in the Barnegat Bay and in other bays in New Jersey. For decades, dating to the 1880s, the industry had driven local economies up and down the New Jersey coast. Along the Delaware Bay, Port Norris, for example, was once said to have had more millionaires per capita than anywhere else in the United States. Back then, the oyster was the coin of the realm.

The comeback may be just in time to help ameliorate the impact of sea level rise, which is impacting coastal communities around the world as glaciers melt and ocean waters swell with rising heat. While denial remains a powerful emotion in many places, shore communities in New Jersey are trying a variety of ways to prepare for rising waters, especially along the back bays.

They are adding pumps and valves, raising roadways, shoring up infrastructure, utilities and emergency services—and turning to nature.

According to the New Jersey Climate Change Resource Center, the sea level at the Jersey Shore has risen 18 inches since the early 1900s—more than twice the global mean rate of about eight inches. And studies consistently predict that the water will continue to rise—and more quickly thanks to global warming. Estimates vary, though, for how much it will rise, with projections generally forecasting a rise of almost a foot by 2050 and perhaps five feet by the end of the century.

Andersen said communities have to pull out all stops. “Time is not on our side. We have to do all of these things cohesively and comprehensively,” she said.

The process is an all-hands-on-deck effort supported by donations, grants and volunteers. The used shells are collected from local restaurants three days a week and dumped in a yard where they sit and are “cured” by the local elements for about six months. Volunteers then put them in bags that will eventually get loaded onto a barge and taken out to the grassy green marsh.

The marshes, she said, are as protective on the bay side as sand dunes are on the ocean. “They’re absolutely the book ends holding it all together,” she said.

Local restaurants have enthusiastically agreed to the recycling effort, Andersen said, and the township has volunteers who sort and bag the shells after the shells have been cured and deemed ready for the reef.

At the nearby Delaware Avenue Oyster House, owner Toby Eisenberg said she is happy to be among the restaurants that donate the used shells. “The shore is changing—I’ve seen it in my lifetime,” said Eisenberg. “Anything that I can do, even if it’s tiny, it’s I think my responsibility.”

Andersen said the project is an example of how local communities can have a special role in helping to deal with climate change. “I hope it becomes a model,” she said.

The “magnificent” oyster, she said, is pointing the way for how nature can lessen the impact of climate change and sea level rise. “Its resurgence,” she said, “is giving us an entirely new blueprint for the future.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1039728212-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 06:00:51.608629

The Indiana Department of Environmental Management awarded the city the highest status of the program July 25. The Clean Community program is an effort to make Indiana a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable place to live, according to IDEM.

“City leadership worked earnestly on behalf of their citizens to ensure a community dedicated to environmental stewardship,” IDEM Commissioner Clint Woods said in a statement. “Being the first municipality to reach this milestone is a significant and well-deserved honor.”

The Clean Community program includes three levels of achievement — bronze, silver and gold — which increase as municipalities complete more sustainability projects.

Beech Grove has installed natural spaces in parking areas, conducted an inventory of its Brownfield sites, passed ordinances improving stormwater management, and hosted toxic substance disposal events.

The city also runs a quarterly drive-up recycling effort with the next event coming up Sept. 6.

“We are honored to work alongside IDEM to become the first city in Indiana to earn gold status, as it reflects on our community's commitment to being thoughtful stewards of our environment for generations to come,” Beech Grover Mayor James Coffman said in a statement.

Indiana Clean Community program

IDEM’s Clean Community program is voluntary, and so far 12 municipalities have signed up.

Bloomington, Evansville and New Chicago along with four other cities are in the bronze tier, while Fishers, Zionsville, Richmond and Brown County are on the silver tier. For now, Beech Grove stands alone in gold tier.

Bronze tier achievement requires a municipality to have a history of positive environmental compliance. The municipality must then create a Clean Team to prove there are dedicated resources toward sustainability.

To move into the silver tier, a municipality must meet all bronze level requirements and also implement between four and eight projects. They also must measure and report on performance metrics.

To achieve the top gold tier, a municipality must meet all bronze and silver requirements as well as implementing four to eight new projects along with monitoring requirements.

The program is aimed at helping communities become more sustainable and resilient by providing a pathway for continuous improvement, according to IDEM. The recognition doesn't come with a trophy or monetary prize, but participation earns cities recognition when applying for competitive grants and assistance programs.

The Clean Community program is open to all of Indiana’s towns, cities and counties. IDEM hosts annual meetings for participating locations.

For solar and wind projects to benefit from the tax credits before this repeal, projects must begin construction by 4 July 2026 or be placed in service by 31 December 2027. This shortens the timeline set by the IRA by 2-3 years, as previously projects had until the end of 2029 to be operational if they began construction in 2025, and 2030 if construction began in 2026. Historically, these tax incentives played a significant role in the financial structure of utility-scale wind, solar and storage projects. 1, 2

Due to this change, Wood Mackenzie estimates that there will be 100 GW less wind and solar capacity installed in the U.S. between 2025-2035 than originally anticipated under the IRA incentives. Or the equivalent to wind and solar capacity growing by approximately 25% rather than 55% growth under the IRA framework.

Implications for renewable energy developers

The elimination of the tax incentives could force developers to change their approach due to the shortened timelines. Projects that were profitable under the previous economic conditions of the IRA, may require restructuring through accelerated execution, revised financing terms or cost reductions to remain viable under the new policy. Projects in the development phase that lack permits may struggle to begin construction, putting them at risk of being ineligible for the tax credits.

The uncertainty surrounding permitting timelines, interconnection queues, and equipment procurement now carries more weight as developers must coordinate every aspect of a project's lifecycle with tighter financial and time constraints.

However, even after the tax credits are repealed, solar and wind may remain cost-competitive in comparison to fossil fuel alternatives. As co-head of private infrastructure at Partners Group in the Americas agreed, “we see opportunities all across the spectrum for new build, wind, solar and storage, which are actually competitive now on a levelised cost of energy basis with natural gas.”

Lazard’s analysis shows that the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of unsubsidised utility-scale solar ranges from $0.038/kWh to $0.078/kWh, while onshore wind ranges from $0.037/kWh to $0.086/kWh. These values demonstrate that even if unsubsidised, solar and wind could be competitive or more attractive than building new conventional generators, which have estimated LCOEs ranging from $0.048/kWh to $0.251/kWh, depending on the technology. Furthermore, new solar and wind could remain competitive relative to operating existing gas peakers (Lazard estimates a marginal cost of gas peakers between $0.047/kWh and $0.170/kWh).

Figure 2. Lazard’s estimates of LCOE of new renewable generation compared to new conventional generation

Some investors still see the opportunity presented by renewables, particularly considering the expected increase in energy demand, which some say “will act as a tailwind for the industry even in the absence of the Inflation Reduction Act’s tax incentives.” Even without the tax incentives, some investment companies remain committed to investing in utility-scale solar, onshore wind and battery storage, such as Climate Adaptive Infrastructure. Furthermore, with electricity demand increasing with the rise in Artificial Intelligence data centres and many other factors, some investors expect the industry to shift its focus away from government subsidies towards tech companies willing to pay a premium for renewable energy.

Adapt and thrive

Developers need to consider the best way forward, the implications for current and planned projects, and understand the impact of the changes the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ brings.

In the current climate, developers should consider:

Reworking financial models with updated assumptions on tax policy, capital structure, and revenue outlook to assess the Bill’s impact on projects and consider pathways forward. The assessments could help developers select projects to focus on.

Compressing timelines and accelerating critical processes, such as permitting and procurement to ensure projects begin construction before the mid-2026 deadline. This could potentially mean refocusing on low-risk projects in the short term.

Assessing supply chain strategies and cost-reduction opportunities, including sourcing materials and equipment to minimise procurement risk and contain overall project costs.

Diversifying revenue portfolio to help stabilise long-term revenues. For example, developers could consider engaging in bilateral conversations to secure Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) and participating in different markets when available (e.g. capacity market, Renewable Energy Certificates (REC), etc).

Understanding the short- and long-term implications of the Bill enables energy market players to identify and prioritise the low-risk, economically viable opportunities that the incoming legislation presents. While this requires an in-depth understanding of energy market policy and regulation; tariffs and energy purchase agreements; traditional and renewable energy infrastructure; understanding of the full value chain; and extensive experience with end-to-end project planning and implementation to ensure risks and costs are minimised, the opportunities to continue progress towards the low-carbon energy transition does not put the roll-out of clean energy out of reach.

Multiple clean energy megatrends are converging: exponential growth in deployed solar and storage capacity, along with a rapid drop in storage prices that is making batteries cost-competitive. These shifts are transforming what’s possible for developers, utilities, and grid operators, not only in scaling renewable energy, but also in how and when to integrate storage.

A prime example is the $6 billion solar-plus-storage project underway in Abu Dhabi, which aims to deliver a consistent 1 GW of solar power 24 hours a day by combining 5 GW of solar modules with 19 GWh of energy storage.

That momentum is now drawing scrutiny from researchers asking when it makes the most financial sense to attach batteries to the world’s fast-growing base of solar power, now estimated at over two terawatts globally. Their modeling suggests the United States has entered a favorable stretch of the storage cost curve, where the net present value of adding batteries has risen sharply since 2022, reaching strong returns around 2027 and peaking in the early 2030s. The forecast reflects both declining costs and the impact of the federal 30% investment tax credit.

In key markets, the researchers found that retrofitting batteries to a solar plant could boost revenue by 29% to 81%.

In The Optimal Timing of Storage Additions to Solar Power Plants, authors Aiden Hughes, Jarred King, and Dr. Eric Hittinger examine whether solar power facilities built in 2022 should include infrastructure that allows for cost-effective battery retrofits in the future. Their analysis shows that, beginning in 2027, storage pricing is expected to reach a point where most solar plants will benefit financially from battery additions. The results suggest that early investment in enabling hardware is likely to pay off.

The study also notes that while battery costs are expected to continue falling, the financial upside of retrofitting peaks in 2032, just before the scheduled expiration of the 30% U.S. energy storage tax credit.

Hittinger wrote on Bluesky that the chart above illustrates how net present value and system sizing shift depending on when storage is added. “We generally find that five to 10 years from now seems to be the optimal time to add batteries, and that a lot more batteries are added to our solar plant if we wait some time for the addition,” he said. “The figure here, for CAISO, shows NPV and inverter/battery quantity if we ‘force’ certain years for the additions.”

The paper notes that optimal retrofit timing varies by market, depending on local price signals, policy environments, and project constraints. In California, developers have already embraced solar-plus-storage at utility scale, making it the default model for new projects. Nationally, solar, storage, and hybrid systems now dominate interconnection queues, signaling that battery-paired solar is becoming the industry norm.

The model accounts for factors such as battery costs, initial inverter sizing, solar capacity and cost, regional generation profiles, and local electricity pricing.

One of the model’s more compelling findings is the value in expanding interconnection capacity, not just to match solar output, but to allow batteries to deliver power during peak-price periods. This mirrors how gas peakers earn revenue during demand spikes. In California, grid-connected batteries are already tapping into this opportunity.

However, securing additional interconnection capacity is often more difficult and expensive than adding physical hardware. In some cases, additional capacity may not be available at all.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-28-at-08.59.49-1200x546.png,N,,2025-07-28 07:02:18.005305

SPOTLIGHT ON UK RENEWABLE ENERGY

The UK’s renewable energy sector has significantly developed in recent years, most pointedly due to a change in government leadership in July 2024 that caused a shift in environmental policy, driving a step change in the country’s energy transition.

On a mission to position the UK at the forefront of global clean energy generation, the government’s Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) has introduced numerous notable measures that aim to grow the nation’s renewable energy capacity and make it secure by 2030.

Such targets comprise the key milestones of the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan (CP2030) that is purpose-driven to overcome three core obstacles to the energy transition, namely: the need for a secure and affordable energy supply; the creation of essential new energy industries that will be supported by thousands of skilled workers; and the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and limit the UK’s contributions to climate change.

Diligently working towards such targets, CP2030 plans to create an innovative clean energy system that will rapidly develop the country’s renewable energy capacity through next-generation technologies over the next five years.

In partnership with Ofgem, the government will also introduce a Long Duration Electricity Storage (LDES) cap and floor scheme, which will work to successfully deliver greater electricity interconnection by providing a minimum amount of revenue for LDES investors, facilitating greater funding for the asset whilst also providing support for its operators.

These strategies will create major positive impacts for the UK’s private sector and homeowners, who are continuously transitioning towards renewable energy sources as they become more affordable and readily accessible, which will, in turn, reduce the nationwide dependence on fossil fuels.

On top of this, the progression of renewable energies and drive for clean power will unlock thousands of jobs across the country and boost energy security, paving the way for a new age of UK renewable power.

Q&A WITH THE RENEWABLE ENERGY ASSOCIATION (REA)

As the UK’s largest renewable energy trade body, the Renewable Energy Association (REA) continues to be a driving force in the country’s clean energy transition. We return to the association and learn more about its role as advocate for a progressively environmental regulatory landscape with CEO, Trevor Hutchings.

Firstly, how would you say the UK renewable energy sector has evolved since we last spoke to the Renewable Energy Association (REA) in 2023?

Trevor Hutchings, CEO (TH): The renewable energy sector continues to grow apace. Around 50 percent of our electricity now comes from these technologies whose cost continues to fall, with renewable energy sources now being the cheapest form of new power generation.

The overall economics of moving to clean energy are compelling, with the drive to net zero being the financial opportunity of the 21st century. Indeed, the net zero economy has grown 10.1 percent since 2023, outstripping growth in other sectors.

We have a new UK government that has made net zero and clean power a central mission, which has further boosted confidence in the sector and is starting to unblock some of the barriers to greater deployment such as planning reform and grid connection.

Public support for renewable energy also remains high, with 82 percent of people supporting renewables according to the government’s latest public attitudes tracker.

At the same time, however, we are experiencing political headwinds. Opposition parties have broken the political consensus on net zero that has existed since the Climate Change Act of 2008.

This is worrying, as much of the debate is ideological rather than evidence-based, so it is essential that we continue to demonstrate the benefits of renewables and maintain momentum.

How has the REA progressed in its role as an advocate and key driver of the transition from a fossil fuel driven society to a renewable one?

TH: The REA continues to advocate for the clean energy transition – ramping up renewable technologies and weaning ourselves off fossil fuels in an orderly manner.

Whilst we will still use oil and gas for decades to come, we must significantly reduce our dependence, and there are good reasons to do so.

For example, the recent energy crisis was rooted in the UK’s dependence on international gas markets which were upended by the conflict in Ukraine. In contrast, home-grown renewable energy sources would protect UK bill payers from such disruption in an increasingly unstable world.

A renewable energy system is characterised by distributed energy, local bioenergy, solar and wind farms, and a mixture of other generating assets. This diversity reduces the risk of a single point of failure, thereby increasing national security.

Now, more than ever, the REA needs to be a strong voice for the sector to help the government not only get the job done but be prepared to hold their feet to the fire if they fall short.

We are the largest renewable energy trade body in the UK with around 500 member organisations operating across the renewables value chain, having been a prominent voice in the sector for 25 years. But we must not rest on our laurels in the face of a rapidly changing landscape and the shifting needs and expectations of our members.

Accordingly, we are strengthening our approach through our new strategic plan focused on impact and growth, ensuring we have the competencies in place to shift the dial on this agenda.

Can you update us on the progress of solar and wind power deployment across the UK over the last year?

TH: The deployment of these energies continues to grow significantly. On 6th April 2025, Great Britain set a record for solar power generation, reaching 13.2 gigawatts (GW), whilst the record for wind was set on 18th December 2024 at 22.5GW.

Annual generation from solar has increased from around 2,000-gigawatt hours (GWh) in 2013 to nearly 14,000 GWh in 2023. For wind, it increased from 29,000 GWh to over 80,000 GWh over the same period.

This is impressive growth, but we need to achieve a step change in deployment levels over the next few years if we are to decarbonise our electricity supply and realise the full benefits of renewable energy.

In your opinion, how will the CP2030 Action Plan address the challenges of the renewable energy sector?

TH: Ensuring our electricity comes from clean sources and is electrifying more of the economy is essential for achieving net zero. So, CP2030 is very welcome as it helps to focus government and industry action.

It is also important for instilling market confidence, lowering the cost of capital, and attracting inward investment. Whilst extremely challenging, it is a feasible target and even a near miss would represent a huge achievement.

I have confidence that over 50 percent of our electricity today is from clean sources. The lights haven’t gone out, and we haven’t bankrupted the country, in fact, it is quite the opposite – despite what the critics say.

Nevertheless, the government will need to utilise all levers of state in order to get the job done. Many of these levers sit outside DESNZ and therefore CP2030 needs to be a driving force across all government departments and beyond.

We know from experience that this is difficult to achieve, so the Prime Minister must be prepared to ‘bang heads together’ if this does not happen.

How is the REA helping to implement CP2030’s strategies towards the rapid deployment of clean energy?

TH: The REA works with its members to advocate for a progressive policy and regulatory landscape to support the deployment of clean energy.

Having the right policies in place, enabling effective regulation, and unblocking barriers are key to scaling renewable energy, especially in some essential but less mature technology areas like LDES. In this case, the REA has long advocated for its route to market, recognising LDES’s high upfront investment costs and long lead times.

Notably, the REA is working with its members and Ofgem on the detailed design of the government’s recently announced cap and floor scheme to encourage investment. Therefore, LDES is just one example of the value we bring to our members and other stakeholders.

The REA is uniquely positioned as the only renewable energy trade body operating across the full breadth of the value chain, covering all the major clean technologies across power, heat, transport, and circular bioresources. Through our policy and technology forums, we forge policy positions, undertake research, and run campaigns to effect change.

Through our subsidiary, Renewable Energy Assurance Limited (REAL), we operate several assurance schemes, enabling the market to operate more effectively. These include the Green Gas Certification Scheme (GGCS), supporting the market in green gas, and the Renewable Energy Consumer Code (RECC), supporting the roll out of heat pumps and solar panels.

Going forwards, how is the REA continuing to identify green jobs and help people harness the advantages of renewable energy?

TH: In 2024 there were 273,000 full-time jobs across the UK in the net zero economy. This figure rose to 951,000 when factoring in the wider supply chain, generating £83.1 billion in economic activity. Net zero jobs are 40 percent more productive than the national average, with wages 15 percent higher than the UK norm.

Many of these vacancies are evenly distributed across the country and often require re-skilling and upskilling of established professions like plumbers, electricians, and builders, rather than entirely new disciplines.

Net zero is also placing higher demand on established trades like welders as well as professional services including legal, finance, and insurance. The REA will continue to champion the need for additional skills provision as a critical enabler for clean energy.

One of the biggest advantages of renewable electricity is that it is cheaper than fossil fuels. Key technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries have seen their costs plummet – solar panels are over 90 percent cheaper than they were just a couple of decades ago, harnessing a free resource – the sun.

However, lower renewable electricity costs – the ‘net zero dividend’ – are not fully reflected in the price homeowners and businesses pay for their electricity.

This is because gas still sets the price for over 90 percent of renewable electricity due to the way the energy market is structured, leading gas to dominate our system.

Gas prices are set by international markets and, as we know from the energy crisis, have fluctuated dramatically following the conflict in Ukraine.

Energy pricing is complicated, but the quickest way to yield the net zero dividend is to increase the penetration of renewables on the system, which is exactly the focus of the REA.

Looking ahead, how do you see the UK renewable energy sector developing over the next five years?

TH: Through CP2030, we are going to see significant growth in wind, solar, and storage, as well as improvements in the electricity grid. In parallel, we will see greater electrification of the economy, moving from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles (EVs), for example, and from gas boilers to heat pumps.

Regarding parts of the economy which are difficult to electrify – namely aviation, shipping, heavy goods, and some industrial processes – we will see an expansion of other forms of renewable energy like hydrogen and green gases such as biomethane.

Biomass for electricity generation and the provision of high-grade heating will also make up the energy mix, as will the UK’s interconnectors with other countries.

Ensuring supply and demand are always balanced requires active management across the electricity grid – something which artificial intelligence (AI) will increasingly assist with.

We will also see greater innovation in flexible technologies like energy storage and, on the demand side, greater involvement from consumers and businesses through tariff usage alongside other demand measures rewarded through cheaper electricity.

This is the decentralised energy system of the future, which is more resilient, insulated from international gas markets, and with fewer single points of failure.

With this in mind, what are the REA’s future priorities in order to continue advocating for the interests of its members and communicating the needs of the renewable energy sector to the government?

TH: We will continue to represent our members’ interests as we pursue our vision of a net zero future built on renewable energy and clean technologies. Our priority is to drive our corporate strategy for impact and growth, which will, in turn, ensure we remain at the top table of government decision-making.

The REA will become more visible in its work, ensuring it is member-focused and delivering value. We will also partner with other organisations to leverage our impact and guarantee we attract, retain, and develop the best people.

On policy and advocacy, we will double down on enabling renewables deployment at scale, building on the progress we have already made towards a clean energy system.

As we need a diverse range of technologies in the energy mix, we will continue to champion and showcase emerging technology areas which perhaps hitherto have been undervalued, such as biomethane.

This is an important time for the sector, and I am determined that, under my leadership, the REA will continue to play an influential role in the journey to net zero.

The wide ranging review based on survey input from 53 private companies around the world finds that over half of the companies anticipate that they will deliver power to the grid in the early 2030s and over three-quarters by the end of that decade.

Just three companies anticipate an earlier date, with several demonstration machines expected before 2030, while one anticipates only after 2045.

This maintains the finding from 2024, with the similar clustering from the then smaller number of 45 companies surveyed and suggests the advancements made over the past year continue to project towards the 2030-2035 timeframe.

However, taken as a whole, while most respondents think the first fusion plant will deliver electricity to the grid within this period, a growing number – 14 compared with seven last year – think this will rather occur in the second half of the decade.

Looking ahead the main challenge up to 2030 continues to be achieving high enough gain in fusion power, closely followed by funding and then tritium self-sufficiency.

Tritium self-sufficiency also continues to top the list of challenges post 2030, with neutron resilient materials and full lifecycle issues including maintenance, decommissioning and recycling also top ranked.

That funding is ranked so highly is notable, given the headline finding of the report that funding was significantly up over the past year, but nevertheless reflects the significant level of funding still required for companies to bring the first plants online – very variable by company but with a median around $700 million.

The pulse duration, previously the second highest challenge up to 2030, appears to be now not regarded as such an issue, having dropped in the ranking, while fusion power efficiency previously considered as a top challenge post 2030 also has dropped down.

Newcomers to fusion

The 2025 report highlights four newcomers to fusion in 2024.

Anubal Fusion based in Hyderabad, India is pursuing inertial confinement for a 200MWe facility, with plans for an interim plant within three years and a pilot plant by 2030.

GenF, a Thales company based in Elancourt, France, was established to lead the Taranis inertial confinement development targeting a pilot plant ca 2040 towards a 1,000MWe commercial facility.

Maritime Fusion out of San Francisco is developing a tokamak to power marine vessels – the only company focussing on this market – with a pilot ca 2032 towards a 25-70MWe commercial unit.

Pranos Fusion, another Indian startup based in Bangalore, is focussed on magnetic confinement for modular 50MWe spherical tokamak reactors, with a pilot plant ca 2030.

Frontrunners

The report highlights three companies having had over $1 billion in investment, all US-based, that are obvious frontrunners and with the race very much on to be first to demonstrate the ability to produce electricity from fusion – Commonwealth Fusion Systems actually with over $2 billion, TAE Technologies and following a significant investment in the past year Helion Energy.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems, based in Devens, Massachusetts, has begun assembling its demonstration SPARC magnetic confinement tokamak expected to achieve net fusion energy (Q>1) in 2027. The company also has concluded a 200MW PPA with Google from its the first grid-scale ARC plant due in the early 2030s.

TAE Technologies in Irvine, California is advancing magnetic confinement with field reversed configuration with its Copernicus plant due to demonstrate proof-of-concept before 2030 and Da Vinci pilot plant due in the early 2030s.

Helion Energy in Everett, Washington is developing magneto-inertial fusion, with initial operations begun on its Polaris machine expected to demonstrate the ability to produce electricity from fusion by 2028. An at least 50MWe PPA from its first power plant has been signed with Microsoft.

Other front runners suggested from the information supplied are those with pilot plants or other main achievements expected in the years ahead up to 2030.

Bristol, UK-based Astral Systems, is advancing multi-state fusion for medical, component qualification and other R&D with a fusion-fission proof-of-concept planned for 2027.

KKR is making this investment from its Global Climate Transition strategy, marking the strategy’s first in Asia-Pacific and its sixth transaction globally.

The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, subject to customary regulatory approvals.

According to Neil Arora, partner and head of KKR’s Climate Transition strategy for Asia, Australia’s C&I energy market is “at an inflection point as corporates seek bankable pathways to better energy efficiency, reliability and affordability.”

Arora adds that the deal will leverage the two companies’ specialisations to help capitalise on the market opportunity for DERs in Australia.

Although CleanPeak Energy primarily operates in the DER market in Australia, it has also dipped into the utility-scale solar market.

Indeed, in October last year, CleanPeak Energy bought two solar PV plants in New South Wales from Dutch solar project developer and asset owner Photon Energy Group, with a combined generation capacity of 14.5MW.

The deal, which was worth €6 million (US$7 million), resulted in a €1.5 million loss for Photon Energy Group.

CleanPeak Energy recently completed an AU$465 million debt refinancing for its funding vehicle CPE Renewable Investment Unit Trust (CPERI), which was launched via a joint venture with Igneo Infrastructure Partners.

The refinancing will see CPERI refinance its portfolio of energy assets, which includes behind and front-of-meter solar and BESS. It will also support the development of co-located battery storage at utility-scale power plants across Australia.

Industrial warehouses could generate an excess of 500% of their energy needs

Engineering consultancy Arcadis noted the potential of DERs, specifically rooftop solar at C&I sites, as one of the primary arguments for creating a Sydney Renewable Energy Zone (REZ).

The report, developed in partnership with think tank the Committee for Sydney, distribution network company Endeavour Energy, Ausgrid and Arup, said industrial warehouses often have very low energy demands but high rooftop surface area.

By installing a solar PV system on this, an industrial warehouse can, depending on its size, generate up to 500% more energy than it needs.

However, asset owners currently tend to size a rooftop solar PV system to meet the building’s needs instead of tapping into an additional revenue stream by selling excess energy back to the grid, something that can be maximised via the installation of a small-scale BESS.

As such, the report claimed that often only 10-20% of the roof space on an industrial warehouse is needed to meet the demand.

It should be noted that commercial towers and residential flats would likely only be able to deliver 5% of their energy demand from a rooftop solar PV system, with this growing to 15% of a manufacturing facility, 20% for a medium-density residential or commercial building, and 100% for a detached residential building.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-of-australia-rooftop-solar-PV-AEMO.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 05:01:40.456599

That work helped preserve habitats along the Mississippi Flyway migration route, a large funnel traversed by birds during annual migrations and studied by scientists, Foster said.

""That's how we get more knowledge than we have,"" Foster said.

Foster was one of five speakers addressing a town hall at the Central Arkansas Library System's Fletcher Library on North Buchanan Street. The event, attended by about 35 people in person and live streamed, was put on by Citizens First Congress, a coalition of 68 member organizations representing 32,000 people, and Arkansas Public Policy Panel, which focuses on social and economic issues.

The groups aim to have people contact members of Congress as appropriations bills to fund or cut the budget for programs as outlined in the bill signed by Trump on July 4 are written between now and the fall. It was one of a series of town halls around the country as part of the Families First: 50-State Day of Peaceful Action in opposition to the legislation.

The legislation extended tax cuts enacted in his first term, funds his concepts for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico and slashes federal support for the social safety net to make up for revenue lost in the tax cuts. The full Arkansas congressional delegation backed the measure, which passed largely along partisan lines.

The Trump administration said the measure will lower the federal deficit and cut government spending. Groups such as the Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office said the tax cuts in the new law will add $2 trillion or more to the federal deficit over the next decade.

Speakers talked about how the measure would reduce food benefits for the poor, slash Medicaid and impose expanded work requirements on recipients and push more money into immigration enforcement.

Immigration attorney Badria Mryyan, who works with the California-based Social Justice Collaborative, said people will see more raids and arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents because the legislation increases funding for the agency.

The new law also allows local law enforcement, previously barred from making immigration-related arrests and conducting immigration investigations, to work more closely with ICE and make those arrests, she said.

""We're going to see more ICE raids,"" Mryyan said. ""We're going to see more ICE check-ins.""

The legislation also changes the work and reporting requirements for people on Medicaid, a joint federal-date program that helps cover costs for people with limited income and resources.

The new requirements mean Medicaid enrollees will have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month. The law will also require that people caring for a young child will have to apply for an exemption.

Those work requirements will impact 1 in 5 people nationally, said FranSha Anderson, executive director for the Arkansas State Independent Living Council.

Anderson told attendees at the town hall about her two children, who she described as disabled, noting that they both work, but may not qualify for Medicaid under the new requirements.

""Medicaid is a lifeline,"" Anderson said. ""I know it will be a harsh hit for me.""

And while benefits included in the bill, such as no tax on tips or overtime, expire in 2029, cuts to social programs have no expiration date, said Peter Gess, economic policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families.

""These Medicaid cuts are forever,"" Gess said.

In Arkansas, where 1 in 5 children are food insecure and 1 in 3 children in rural counties are in that situation, the new law will have a devastating impact, said Tomekia Moore, executive director for Arkansas Community Action Agencies Association.

The new law would remove $25 a month in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits from families, according to the Urban Institute. That's an average of $146 per month for families, the institute said in a report.

Cuts like those will hurt children who come from ""food insecure"" environments, Moore said.

""A hungry child doesn't learn. A hungry child doesn't grow,"" Moore said. ""A hungry child can't thrive.""

Protecting areas where birds migrate may not seem that important on the surface, Foster said, but Arkansas relies on tourism for parts of its economy. Across the board, the law will be bad for the state, Foster said.

Meanwhile, Australia’s A$4 billion (US$2.6 billion) Critical Minerals Facility offers concessional loans, guarantees and bonds for mining and processing ventures.
In the coming decade, countries that set the standards, finance the infrastructure, and train the workforce for critical minerals will shape the next industrial era.","At the recent Quad Foreign Ministers’ Summit in Washington, Australia, India, Japan and the United States announced a Quad Critical Minerals Initiative (QCMI) – a signal of shared intent, but one still in search of substance.

China has asserted its dominance in critical minerals – first through export controls on gallium and germanium, and more recently by curbing rare earth shipments. The US responded with executive orders to secure supply chains. Allies are moving to reshore and diversify. The logic is clear: from electric vehicles (EVs) to jet engines and semiconductors, critical minerals will shape both economic competitiveness and strategic autonomy in the 21st century.

The initiative will focus on creating “non-market policies and practices for critical minerals, certain derivative products, and mineral processing technology”. The question is whether this will result in a tangible industrial strategy – aligning policies and harmonising standards, creating patient capital for joint investments, and building cross-border research and development (R&D).

Divergence and Convergence in Quad Prioritisation

Despite growing convergence, the Quad members differ on their definitions of “critical” minerals. India lists 30 minerals, such as copper, phosphates, cadmium and potash, reflecting its strategic needs in agriculture and energy. The US list of 50 minerals emphasises aluminum, barite and graphite for the defence and tech industries. Australia, a major producer, focuses on 31 minerals, including lithium, rare earth elements (REEs) and zirconium. Japan’s list of 35 minerals highlights supply risks with its emphasis on gallium, dysprosium and yttrium.

The Quad has 20 minerals in common – including cobalt, tungsten, graphite, lithium and REEs – low-hanging fruit for alignment. Yet 36 minerals are unique to just one member, opening opportunities for swaps, co-investment and specialisation.

Structural Vulnerabilities and the China Factor

Quad supply chains remain highly vulnerable, especially graphite, copper, REEs and lithium. All members depend on China for synthetic and natural graphite. China also dominates REE refining, accounting for more than 90% of global capacity. The US lacks heavy REE separation. India, despite significant reserves, produces just 1% of global output. Even Australia’s only major non-Chinese producer, Lynas, depends on China for refining. Japan, targeted by China’s 2010 export ban, still sources more than half of its REEs from China.

India’s import dependence extends to copper, barite, potash and 100% of its lithium, cobalt and nickel needs. The US lacks refining capacity, while Japan compensates with export-grade refining expertise. Australia holds the upstream edge but relies on external processing.

India: The Missing Link and Emerging Hub

India faces dual challenges: import dependence and limited domestic processing. However, growing demand from EVs and solar energy creates incentives for integration. The government has introduced sweeping reforms, from a National Critical Mineral Mission (NCMM) to duty exemptions on critical minerals and scrap metal imports. With the right partnerships, India can emerge as a hub for minerals processing and manufacturing.

Recommendation

India’s critical minerals sector, especially beyond upstream mining, is not yet globally competitive. But a nascent market is not a novel challenge. Each Quad member has leveraged targeted industrial policy to successfully build industries from the ground up. India built a global IT services hub through telecoms investments, tax incentives, and talent development. Japan’s rise in semiconductors and automobiles was led by METI-driven co-ordination, export credit and domestic consortia. Australia gained dominance in lithium and battery minerals through exploration incentives and export infrastructure. Even China, the global EV leader, invested US$230 billion between 2009 and 2023 to build its ecosystem – from battery R&D and manufacturing to procurement mandates and consumer subsidies.

To secure critical minerals supply chains, the Quad must replicate past success: deploy a targeted, sustained strategy that reduces capital risk, creates regulatory certainty, and anchors demand through co-ordinated procurement and offtake. To do this, it must:

Standardise to Improve Co-ordination

Critical minerals policy is fragmented across nations and industries, leading to duplication, gaps and weak bargaining power. This raises geopolitical and commercial risks, and slows, complicates and raises project costs.

The QMCI could serve as a government-industry platform to align policies, share analysis, harmonise standards and co-ordinate projects. By pooling expertise and negotiating power, it can dismantle barriers to diversified supply chains.

The US-led Minerals Security Partnership has helped co-ordinate governments for 32 projects (across exploration, processing and recycling), through diplomacy and finance. Similarly, the G7 Sustainable Critical Minerals Alliance has worked to raise mining sustainability standards globally.

The QMCI should go beyond convening and work towards joint stockpiling, financing and standard harmonisation efforts that can improve offtake.

Quad Joint Investment Platform – Financing Strategic Projects

Access to patient capital remains one of the biggest hurdles for critical minerals projects, which require high investments and long development timelines. BloombergNEF estimates US$2.1 trillion in new investment will be needed by 2050 to meet global demand for energy transition metals such as lithium, copper, nickel and cobalt. This implies an annual financing requirement of about US$70 billion.

A supply-demand mismatch will threaten net-zero targets and the commercial scalability of clean energy technologies. Without a well-capitalised global investment push, the Quad risks being dependent on geopolitical rivals in the most capital-intensive resource race of this century.

To overcome this, the QMCI should create a joint Critical Minerals Investment Platform to pool concessional finance from institutions such as the US Development Finance Corporation, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Export Finance Australia, and India’s Invest India or National Investment and Infrastructure Fund. This platform could follow Canada’s C$15 billion (US$11 billion) Growth Fund, which invests in copper and zinc to boost domestic supply. The US-Qatar-backed TechMet uses US$285 million in sovereign equity to fund nickel, lithium, REE and vanadium projects worldwide, with offtakes for national reserves. Meanwhile, Australia’s A$4 billion (US$2.6 billion) Critical Minerals Facility offers concessional loans, guarantees and bonds for mining and processing ventures.

Collectively, these efforts underscore how strategically deploying public capital through joint vehicles can derisk frontier mineral ecosystems to the scale necessary to meet the Quad’s goals.

Quad Tech and Innovation Network – R&D, Skills & Platforms

The Quad must tackle the technological fragmentation and R&D underinvestment slowing mineral sector growth. Of the US$49.7 billion spent in global public R&D in 2023, only a small fraction was directed towards critical minerals, which lack dedicated national funding. This underinvestment leads to duplicated efforts and limited innovation in processing, recycling and sustainable extraction. Talent pipelines also lag demand. While the US and Australia grapple with talent shortages in mining, India’s 110 mining engineering colleges produce an exponentially higher number of graduates annually, highlighting a case for complementarity.

Without co-ordinated R&D and talent investment, the Quad may miss the productivity gains needed for value-added mineral activities.

The Quad stands at a crossroads. Past battery and semiconductor supply chain failures stemmed from policy complacency, underinvestment and prioritisation of efficiency over resilience. Today, critical minerals present a similar risk. China has demonstrated its willingness to assert its mineral dominance through export controls and capacity throttling. The Quad must act decisively or cede leverage central to 21st century power.

Unfortunately, Republican legislative leaders seem unconcerned. Rather than working with Governor Josh Stein to tackle our numerous outsized problems, they spent the recent legislative session advancing divisive culture war bills and failing even to pass a new state budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.

And now, rather than honestly owning up to and addressing their shortcomings, they’re returning to Raleigh this week to double down on them with a plan to override Stein’s vetoes of several destructive and hyper-partisan bills. And the overdue budget? It’s nowhere in sight.

The bottom line: Caring and thinking lawmakers of both parties should take a stand against this failed and divisive strategy by sustaining Stein’s vetoes and sending a message to legislative leaders that it’s past time to end the games and work together for the good of all North Carolinians.

Meanwhile, the U.S. power grid has not expanded quickly enough, increasing the risk of outages and subjecting Americans to the burden of rising utility rates, Constantine said.
“There were tens of thousands of batteries already there that just needed to get connected in a more meaningful way,” said Shannon Anderson, a policy director focused on virtual power plants at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that helps households organize to secure cheaper rooftop solar.
Nonprofit group Acadia Center estimated that rooftop solar helped avoid about $20 million in costs by driving down energy consumption and suppressing power prices.
Rooftop solar advocates have fought hard to retain net-metering programs across the country.","The rooftop solar industry is facing an unprecedented crisis. Utilities are cutting incentives. Major residential solar installers and financiers have gone bankrupt. And sweeping legislation just passed by Republicans in Congress will soon cut off federal tax credits that have supported the sector for 20 years.

But the fact remains that solar panels — and the lithium-ion batteries that increasingly accompany them — remain the cheapest and most easily deployable technologies available to serve the ever-hungry U.S. power grid.

Sachu Constantine, executive director of nonprofit advocacy group Vote Solar, thinks that the rooftop solar and battery industries can survive and even thrive if they focus their efforts on becoming ​“virtual power plants.”

Hundreds of thousands of battery-equipped, solar-clad homes across the country are already storing their renewable energy when it’s cheap and abundant and then returning it to the grid when electricity demand peaks and utilities face grid strains and high costs — in essence, acting as ​“peaker” power plants.

In places like Puerto Rico and New England, these VPPs have demonstrated their worth in recent months, preventing blackouts and lowering costs for consumers, and the approach could be scaled up dramatically. ​“If we do that, despite the One Big Beautiful Bill, despite the headwinds to the market, there is space for these technologies,” Constantine said.

Right now, there aren’t many other options for meeting soaring energy demand, he added. The megabill signed by President Donald Trump this month undermines the economics of the utility-scale solar and battery installations that make up the vast majority of new energy being added to the grid. And despite the Trump administration’s push for fossil fuels, gas-fired power plants can’t be built fast enough to make up the difference.

Meanwhile, the U.S. power grid has not expanded quickly enough, increasing the risk of outages and subjecting Americans to the burden of rising utility rates, Constantine said. State lawmakers and utility regulators are under growing pressure to find solutions.

Solar and batteries, clustered in small-scale community energy projects or scattered across neighborhoods, may be ​“the only viable way to meet load growth” from data centers, factories, and broader economic activity, Constantine said. And by relieving pressure on utility grids, they can help bring down costs not just for those who install them, but for customers at large.

Where VPPs are already saving the day

This summer has brought new proof of how customers can turn their rooftop solar systems and batteries to the task of rescuing their neighbors from energy emergencies. Over the past two months, Puerto Rico grid operator LUMA Energy has relied on participants in its Customer Battery Energy Sharing program to prevent the grid from collapsing.

“Last night we successfully dispatched approximately 70,000 batteries, contributing around 48 megawatts of energy to the grid,” LUMA wrote in a July 9 social media post in Spanish. Amid a generation shortfall of nearly 50 MW, that dispatch helped avert ​“multiple load shedding events” — the industry term for rolling blackouts.

Puerto Ricans have been installing solar and batteries at a rapid clip since 2017, when Hurricane Maria devastated the island territory’s grid and left millions of people without power, some for nearly a year.

“There were tens of thousands of batteries already there that just needed to get connected in a more meaningful way,” said Shannon Anderson, a policy director focused on virtual power plants at Solar United Neighbors, a nonprofit that helps households organize to secure cheaper rooftop solar. ​“The numbers have been really proven out this summer in terms of what it’s been able to do.”

Puerto Rico’s VPPs are managed by aggregators — companies that install solar and battery systems and control them to support the grid. Tesla Energy, one such aggregator, provides live updates on how much the company’s Powerwall batteries are contributing to the system at large.

The impacts of distributed solar and batteries aren’t always so easy to track — but clean-energy advocates are busy calculating where they’re making a difference.

During last month’s heat wave across New England, as power prices spiked and grid operators sought to import energy from neighboring regions, distributed solar and batteries reduced stress on the grid. Nonprofit group Acadia Center estimated that rooftop solar helped avoid about $20 million in costs by driving down energy consumption and suppressing power prices.

A good portion of that distributed solar operates as part of the region’s VPPs. The ConnectedSolutions programs run by utilities National Grid and Eversource cut demand by hundreds of megawatts during summer heat waves. And Vermont utility Green Mountain Power has been a vanguard in using solar-charged batteries as grid resources at a large scale, in concert with smart thermostats, EV chargers, and remote-controllable water heaters. All told, that scattered infrastructure gives the company 72 extra megawatts of capacity to play with during grid emergencies.

Mary Powell, who led Green Mountain Power’s push into VPPs before that term had caught on, left to become CEO of Sunrun, the country’s largest residential solar installer, in 2021. Choosing to hire Powell indicated the company’s growing interest in becoming something of a solar-powered utility.

This summer, Sunrun dispatched hundreds of megawatts from more than 130,000 batteries across California, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Puerto Rico. It recently expanded into Texas’ competitive energy, in partnership with Tesla.

“We are living in the future of virtual power plants in places like Puerto Rico, and California, and New England, and increasingly Texas,” said Chris Rauscher, Sunrun’s head of grid services and electrification. ​“It’s just about other states putting that in place in their territories and letting it run.”

Getting states to embrace VPPs

Sunrun, Vote Solar, and Solar United Neighbors have been working for the last year to advance state policies that support VPPs. So far this year, the groups have promoted model VPP legislation in states including Illinois, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, and Virginia.

In May, Virginia passed a law requiring that utility Dominion Energy launch a pilot program to enlist up to 450 megawatts of VPP capacity, including at least 15 MW of home batteries, Anderson said.

The legislative effort has had less luck in New Mexico and Minnesota, where bills failed to advance, Anderson said. In Illinois, a proposed bill did not pass during the regular legislative session, but advocates hope to bring it back for consideration during the state’s ​“veto session” this fall, she said.

A lot more batteries are being added to rooftop solar systems in Illinois, Anderson noted — a byproduct of the state clawing back net-metering compensation for solar-equipped customers starting this year. Similar dynamics have played out in Hawaii and California after regulators reduced the value of solar power that customers send back to the grid, making batteries that can store extra power and further limit customers’ grid consumption much more popular.

Rooftop solar advocates have fought hard to retain net-metering programs across the country. But Jenny Chase, solar analyst with BloombergNEF, noted that most mature rooftop solar markets have shifted away from rewarding customers for sending energy back to the grid at times when it’s not needed.

“In some ways that’s justified, because net metering pushes all responsibility and cost of intermittency onto the utility,” she said.

VPPs flip this dynamic, turning rooftop solar and batteries from a potentially disruptive imposition on how utilities manage and finance their operations to an active aid in meeting their mission of providing reliable power at a reasonable cost. Utilities have traditionally been leery of trusting customer-owned resources to meet their needs. But under pressure from lawmakers and regulators, they’re starting to embrace the possibilities.

In Minnesota, utility Xcel Energy has proposed a ​“distributed capacity procurement” program that would allow it to own and operate solar and batteries installed at key locations, letting the company defer costly grid upgrades. Rooftop solar advocates have mixed feelings about the proposal, given their longstanding complaints about Xcel’s track record of making it more difficult for customers and independent developers to build their own solar and battery systems.

Similar tensions are at play in Colorado, where Xcel is under state order to build distributed energy resources like rooftop solar and batteries into how it plans and manages its grid. This spring, Xcel launched a project with Tesla and smart-meter company Itron aimed at ​“taking these thousands of batteries we have connected to this system over time and [being] able to use them to respond to local issues,” Emmett Romine, the utility’s vice president of customer energy and transportation solutions, told Canary Media in an April interview.

But waiting for utilities to deploy the grid sensors, software, and other technology needed to perfectly control customers’ devices runs the risk of delaying the growth of VPPs, Anderson said. Simpler approaches like those being taken in Puerto Rico — where aggregators manage VPPs — can do a lot of good quickly. ​“Once you get that to scale, there will be a lot of learnings for the next stage,” she said

Blunting the impact of tax credit cuts

State- and utility-level incentives that encourage individuals to participate in VPPs are also a vital countermeasure against the damage incurred by the ​“big, beautiful bill” passed by Republicans this month, Anderson said. Under that law, households will lose a 30% tax credit that offsets the cost of solar, batteries, and other home energy systems by the end of this year.

However, companies such as Sunrun and Tesla will retain access to tax credits for solar systems that they own and provide to customers through leases or power purchase agreement structures, as long as they begin construction by mid-2026 or are placed in service by the end of 2027. And tax credits for batteries remain in place until 2033 for these companies.

“Folks can earn over $1,000 a summer through [some VPPs],” she said. ​“You couple in the leasing model for solar and storage, which is going to get a little more popular in the aftermath of the bill,” due to its ability to continue to earn tax credits, ​“and I think it’s a pretty good way to get batteries for low or no cost up front.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/IMG_8168-1.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=dd24df54ab975a58fd8ac2ec8785b045,N,,2025-07-28 05:01:56.761098

The energy reforms in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act protect ratepayers, restore market discipline and put America’s energy future back in American hands.","Our electric grid is under pressure — and the warning lights have been flashing for years.

Electricity demand is rising due to data centers, electric vehicles and population growth, while reliable, dispatchable power sources — like coal, nuclear and natural gas — are being forced off the grid by federal subsidies and mandates that favor intermittent wind and solar.

Even the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) — under the Biden administration —issued clear warnings. In its 2023 and 2024 reliability assessments, FERC concluded that the accelerating retirement of dependable power plants, without firm replacements, “presents serious challenges to electric reliability in the near term.”

This is not a partisan talking point. It’s a real and growing threat. Rolling blackouts have already hit places like California and Texas, and Virginia is not immune.

At the same time, ratepayers are seeing higher electricity bills. Nationwide, energy costs have outpaced inflation. Subsidies and mandates may lower the sticker price for one form of energy, but someone always picks up the tab — usually the taxpayer or the utility customer.

That’s why the energy policy reforms in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law by President Trump on July 4, are a long-overdue course correction. The act rolls back permanent subsidies and tax credits that distorted energy markets under the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. It phases out credits for wind, solar and electric vehicles — industries mature enough to stand on their own.

OBBBA does not ban renewables. It simply stops treating them as the only solution. It restores market balance by refocusing policy on reliability, affordability and national security.

The law also blocks taxpayer subsidies from flowing to foreign entities of concern, including those under the influence of China. That is not just sound policy — it’s common sense.

Here in Virginia, we should take note. The Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA) — with its arbitrary deadlines and rigid mandates — compounds the very problems OBBBA seeks to solve. When federal policy changes to reflect energy reality but state law remains frozen in ideology, ratepayers pay the price. Virginia must revisit the VCEA and bring its energy policy back in line with grid reliability and economic stability.

We’ve already seen the risks of over-promising. Dominion’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is years from delivering power. Solar development, especially at utility scale, unfairly burdens rural areas and faces regional transmission bottlenecks. Yet our utilities are legally required to hit clean energy targets, regardless of cost or feasibility.

Meanwhile, Virginians are facing a slow-moving affordability crisis, with utilities requesting and receiving significant rate increases to comply with mandates and build out politically favored infrastructure.

The better path is to build smarter — not just greener. That means supporting advanced nuclear, natural gas, geothermal and energy storage — technologies that provide firm, dependable power even when the sun isn’t shining and the wind isn’t blowing.

It also means letting private capital — not government subsidies — determine which energy sources are viable. The OBBBA restores that discipline and ensures that American tax dollars aren’t used to fund unreliable, foreign-sourced infrastructure.

Some critics have pointed to modeling that suggests potential job losses or economic impacts, but many of these estimates come from organizations with a clear preference for government-driven decarbonization. What they overlook is that employment follows investment — and investment will now shift toward domestic energy production, grid reliability and manufacturing capacity.

Take Virginia’s Southside region: Microporous LLC is investing $1.35 billion in a battery separator facility in Pittsylvania County. That kind of advanced manufacturing will thrive under OBBBA’s framework, which supports U.S.-based innovation without sending subsidies overseas.

The energy reforms in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act protect ratepayers, restore market discipline and put America’s energy future back in American hands. That’s a win for working families, job creators and the grid itself.

We cannot power a 21st-century economy with 19th-century weather patterns. It’s time to get back to what works — and OBBBA is a bold step in the right direction. Virginia would be wise to follow suit.

As a member of the Virginia Senate Commerce and Labor Committee and the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation, I’ve seen firsthand the growing disconnect between state energy mandates and the realities of grid reliability and affordability. We owe it to the people of Virginia to revisit and reform those mandates in light of today’s changing energy landscape.

Unpredictable, inconsistent and unfriendly are some of the more benign words that business leaders and credit rating agencies have used to describe Connecticut’s Byzantine regulatory approach. Connecticut consistently ranks poorly in national business climate studies when it comes to the cost of doing business and the complexity of its regulations. In recent years, investment bank UBS and Regulatory Research Associates, a unit of Standard & Poor’s, have placed Connecticut into their bottom-tier utilities regulatory environment rankings. Connecticut’s Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) is facing fierce criticism from utility companies Eversource Energy and Avangrid Inc. for recent decisions that have roiled investors and crippled the utilities’ ability to recover capital expenses. In June, Moody’s Ratings downgraded the credit ratings of Eversource subsidiary Connecticut Light and Power Co., calling Connecticut “the least credit supportive utility regulatory environment in the U.S.” Meantime, CNBC’s 2025 “America’s Top States for Business” index recently ranked Connecticut 28th overall, an improvement from No. 32 in 2024. However, the state ranked worse — No. 32 — in the business-friendliness category. According to a 2021 report by George Mason University’s Mercatus Center, greater regulatory burdens are correlated with regressive effects: increased poverty rates, higher levels of income inequality, reduced entrepreneurship and increased consumer prices. The report cites research that found, between 1997 and 2015, the effective federal regulatory burden in Connecticut increased by 56%, contributing to a 14% rise in the state’s poverty rate. Also, between 1999 and 2015, industry-level federal regulatory restrictions increased by an average of 3.78%, according to the study. Based on that average, Connecticut lost about 110 small firms and 1,541 jobs annually as a result of regulatory hurdles, the researchers found. Cumbersome regulations have been accumulating for decades, not just in Connecticut, but across the country. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader’s crusade for stronger consumer protections in the 1960s and 1970s led to a wave of landmark regulations, including in Connecticut, where the 91-year-old lawyer and political activist resides. But the robust regulatory environment that enhanced consumer protections also contributed, in the eyes of critics, to an overabundance of red tape that some view as burdensome for businesses and the economy. The regulatory environment covers everything from labor and health insurance mandates to the lawsuit/liability climate, industry oversight, permitting and overall bureaucracy. Now, many business leaders and some state officials — including Democrats — believe the pendulum has swung too far in favor of government regulations, and they are seeking to undo some of the bureaucratic constraints. “I think there was a period of time where we promulgated a lot of regulations in order to protect the environment, protect health, protect lots of different things,” said Christopher Davis, vice president of public policy at the Connecticut Business & Industry Association (CBIA). “I think that over time, those things sort of build up and calcify. … Sometimes they’re redundant, sometimes they’re unnecessary, sometimes they’re no longer relevant. And it takes a concerted effort to look back and say which things are still relevant, and which ones are not.” The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (DEEP) is one of the most notorious regulatory agencies in Connecticut — it oversees 125 state and federally mandated permitting processes. The morass of red tape has created an opportunity for improvement, which DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes has made a hallmark of her tenure at the agency. “I hear just as much from developers as from our own staff about how important it is to make these processes work better for our goals,” Dykes said. “Because when permitting works effectively, it means that someone who wants to invest in the state is getting an answer faster with less friction.” When Gov. Ned Lamont tapped Dykes to lead the agency in 2019, he asked her to make DEEP more efficient, she recalled. “He said he’d been on the campaign trail … and he heard from lots of businesses that DEEP was a black box and that it took too long to get answers, that it was really difficult to know how to navigate the process,” Dykes said. “I think some of that was a bit misplaced,” she continued, “but we rolled up our sleeves and got to work.” Dykes launched an effort to streamline DEEP’s permitting processes through an initiative she calls 20BY26. The project outlines 20 performance goals that DEEP plans to achieve by the end of 2026, with the aim of improving the transparency, efficiency and predictability of its permitting.

Uniquely complex

As a densely populated state with an industrial legacy, Connecticut has particularly complex permitting needs, Dykes said. “As we think about new infrastructure projects, new developments coming into the state, folks are often working with parcels that have been previously disturbed,” she said. “We may be looking at a brownfield. We may be looking at a location that’s close to a lot of population centers.” Those factors not only make permitting processes more involved, but underscore their necessity to “accommodate the next generation of investments while also protecting human health and the environment,” she explained. A key component of 20BY26 was establishing a business concierge service, or a “one-stop shop” for applicants, stakeholders, municipalities and developers to obtain information and status updates about applications. The concierge service debuted in 2021. “That provides a lot of benefits for the applicant in terms of having clear communication and someone that they can call all the way through the process to help them navigate the different programs within the department,” Dykes said. “It also provides a lot of benefits to our DEEP staff, so that our technical staff, our permit writers, can conserve and focus their time on processing permits.” During an internal review, DEEP discovered that about 40% of staff time was being taken up with back-and-forth correspondence with applicants about their incomplete applications, Dykes said. DEEP’s reforms also involve guiding developers toward properties where they will face the least amount of environmental hurdles. The agency has created an online database of endangered and threatened species, which developers can use to find out if a property will trigger an endangered species review, Dykes said. Also, the newly created Community Renewable Energy Siting Tool helps solar developers find the least environmentally conflicted sites for developing solar facilities. Further, DEEP has undertaken a wide-ranging review of its 125 permitting processes to determine the reasonable amount of time that it should take to issue a decision for an application for each one. “I’m really proud to say that over the several years that we’ve been implementing this, we are achieving about 90% on-time completion rates for the 55 different types of permits that we expect to take about three months,” Dykes said. She said DEEP has made adjustments by repositioning staff resources to where they’re most needed. In addition to reducing timeframes, DEEP obtained legislative approval during the recent session to consolidate multiple permit types into a single general permit category, simplifying the review process for certain regulated activities. For example, activities under individual permits from DEEP’s pesticides division were combined into one general permit. “It’s obviously a faster process for applicants, but also it helps conserve our staff time and our staff resources,” Dykes said.

Transfer Act sunset

The crown jewel of the 20BY26 initiative was developing new and less burdensome regulations to replace the antiquated and unpopular Transfer Act. The Transfer Act requires property owners to conduct site-wide environmental investigations and, if necessary, remediation whenever certain types of properties are sold. The system has been criticized for being overly broad, costly and a major obstacle to real estate transactions and economic development, especially brownfield sites. The Transfer Act will be fully phased out on March 1, 2026, and replaced by new release-based cleanup regulations, which trigger cleanup requirements by the actual discovery of a hazardous release — not by the transfer of a property or business. The new system, which has been in the works for years and was green-lighted by the legislature’s Regulations Review Committee in April, is expected to reduce costs, speed up cleanups, and encourage redevelopment of blighted or underused properties. Connecticut was one of just two states operating under the Transfer Act system. Dykes said she hopes the changes will help shift people’s perceptions about Connecticut. “I feel like Connecticut often has this problem of we’re just kind of negative on ourselves,” Dykes said. “We don’t tell our story very well, and focus on those negatives. … We’ve been making these improvements. Now we need to get the perception to change as a result of it.” CBIA applauded DEEP’s efforts to optimize its permitting processes, but says disparities between the ease of permitting in other states and Connecticut remain. “When we talk to employers who have operations in multiple states, there are certain permits, environmental permits, that are more difficult in Connecticut, but also in terms of the clarity around permits,” said Dustin Nord, director of the CBIA Foundation for Economic Growth and Opportunity, the business group’s nonprofit think tank. “To the credit of the state, I think that this has been a point of focus for DEEP in terms of making certain permit timelines more clear and trying to speed up permitting overall. But it’s still a challenge for a lot of businesses.” Some argue that regulatory reforms within DEEP need to go beyond just speeding up permitting processes. Carol Platt Liebau, president of the Yankee Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank, said lawmakers and regulators must do a better job of performing a cost-benefit analysis of regulations they are imposing on residents and businesses. She said lawmakers must also have greater oversight over how agencies are implementing public policy. “Without the proper accountability, PURA and DEEP have been able to implement flawed policies, mostly expensive and stringent green energy mandates, which have driven up energy costs for ratepayers,” Liebau said, noting that Connecticut has among the highest electricity prices in the country. “… Regulators justify their existence by regulating,” she added. “When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.” State lawmakers did consider a bill this past legislative session that would have mandated closer scrutiny on existing regulations. Rep. Lucy Dathan (D-New Canaan) proposed a bill that required all state regulations to be reviewed every seven years to make sure businesses were not facing any outdated laws that no longer make sense, or are unnecessarily burdensome. The bill passed the state House of Representatives, but was not voted on by the Senate. The CBIA said it will lobby for the legislation again in 2026.

More to be done

While Connecticut is working to improve its environmental permitting processes, the reality is, the state’s broader regulatory apparatus affects a much wider range of industries, and impacts businesses and the economy in many ways. The state, for example, has been known to have one of highest number of health benefit mandates that insurance companies are required to cover, which increases the costs of individual and employer-sponsored health insurance — a major issue for small and midsize companies. A 2014 study by UConn Health’s Center for Public Health and Health Policy noted Connecticut had 46 health benefit mandates at the time, among the most in the nation. A more recent analysis by the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Research outlined more than 70 health benefit mandates that were in effect as of Jan. 1, 2024. The report noted recently adopted coverage mandates for infertility diagnosis and treatment, and in-home hospice services. There is also an annual fight in the legislature over new labor mandates. In recent years, Connecticut has adopted a Paid Family and Medical Leave program and expanded its paid sick leave law. Lawmakers have also expanded prevailing wage requirements and fought for things like eliminating the tipped minimum wage and extending unemployment benefits to striking workers. CBIA has identified areas in which Connecticut can improve the regulatory strain on businesses, particularly in the manufacturing and construction industries. “Manufacturers, especially, face a heavy burden on regulations, whether it be environmental regulations or labor mandates, things that really make it difficult for them to compete, both nationally and, quite frankly, for a lot of these manufacturers, internationally,” Davis said. The CATO Institute, a conservative think tank, consistently ranks Connecticut among the worst states in the country for land-use regulations. Because zoning requirements can vary widely from one town to another, existing Connecticut businesses face obstacles even when expanding within the state, Davis said. However, efforts by the General Assembly to ease land-use regulations in local communities often face political backlash. In June, Lamont vetoed House Bill 5002, a major piece of legislation that aimed to address the state’s ongoing housing shortage. The bill would have required towns to plan and zone for a set number of affordable housing units, using a “fair share” formula to distribute housing needs across municipalities. Lamont, a Democrat, broke with his own party in quashing the legislation, citing opposition centered around fears that the bill would undermine local zoning control. Fred Carstensen, a professor of economics at UConn, said the state needs to look at its regulatory environment, such as restrictions on building new housing, that have led to a housing crisis. “I think sort of a comprehensive attempt to look at regulatory structure would be immensely beneficial, and it could help make us much more competitive,” Carstensen said. “… And you’ve got to do this at the granular level. You got to do it, look at each of these things closely, and you have to do it all the time.” HBJ Staff Writer Michael Juliano contributed to this story.",https://assets.hartfordbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KatieDykes__005_opt-1-e1753466965797.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 07:03:00.414421

As the number of EVs increases, so does the demand for batteries - driving the growth of battery recycling efforts.","As part of a roadmap to transition 400,000 vehicles to electric in Ho Chi Minh City, the municipal Institute for Development Studies (HIDS) has proposed building a standardized battery recycling center or plant capable of recovering up to 95% of the valuable metals in EV batteries.

This information was shared by the institute’s Center for Economic Application Consulting at a recent press meeting on the city's socio-economic situation. The meeting addressed the issue of how to handle used batteries from 400,000 electric vehicles following HCMC’s plan to begin transitioning from gasoline vehicles in 2026.

According to the plan, the city aims to convert 80% of 400,000 ride-hailing drivers to electric motorbikes during 2026-2027, equivalent to about 320,000 drivers. By 2028, the city will continue supporting the remaining 20% with policies such as VAT exemptions, registration fee reductions, and preferential loan programs.

By 2029, HCMC will propose a complete ban on gasoline-powered two-wheelers used for transportation services, shifting entirely to electric vehicles to reduce emissions and move toward a green, clean, and smart city.

However, some major questions arise: What will happen to the massive volume of used batteries once they reach the end of their lifecycle? What environmental impacts will follow?

Addressing the concern, Le Thanh Hai, director of the center, noted that Vietnam already has an electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant in the central province of Ha Tinh with a total investment of over VND6 trillion ($229.3 million). In addition, the country has signed an agreement with Li-Cycle, a leading global electric vehicle battery recycling company.

The agreement covers solutions for the supply and research of EV battery recycling at the end of their life. If Vietnam does not invest in domestic recycling infrastructure, the partner will rely on technology from Southeast Asia or global facilities for processing.

Hai further explained that EV batteries contain rare and valuable metals such as cobalt, nickel, manganese, and lithium, making recycling essential. Battery recycling technologies today have advanced significantly, allowing for the recovery of 90-95% of battery materials. As the number of EVs increases, so does the demand for batteries - driving the growth of battery recycling efforts.

In terms of extending battery life, one current approach is repurposing end-of-life batteries for solar energy storage systems, power supply for factories, or even as materials for manufacturing solar panels - an increasingly viable technological direction.

Regarding potential risks, the Department of Science and Technology has been tasked with working with the Department of Industry and Trade to develop a detailed plan. On the matter of fire and explosion risks, there has been public debate online comparing the risks between EVs and gasoline vehicles, though clear conclusions still require verification.

Nevertheless, Hai emphasized that battery technology is advancing rapidly, with increasingly strict safety standards.

Under a directive issued on July 12, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh asked Hanoi to ban gasoline-powered motorbikes from its downtown core starting July 2026, part of a sweeping plan to cut emissions and improve air quality.

The ban will apply to all fossil fuel-powered motorbikes and scooters operating within Ring Road 1, which covers the central districts, including Hanoi’s Old Quarter.

By 2028, the restrictions will expand to include gasoline-powered private cars within Ring Roads 1 and 2. By 2030, the city aims to restrict all personal fossil fuel vehicles inside Ring Road 3, which forms the outer ring of the capital and connects to major highways leading to neighboring provinces.

Meanwhile, Hanoi will roll out financial incentives for companies that build or assemble EVs.",https://t.ex-cdn.com/theinvestor.vn/560w/files/news/2025/07/28/xanh-sm-090723.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 05:00:56.881177

By embedding compute infrastructure into these local energy corridors, Armada shifts AI deployment away from conventional hubs and into areas where renewable or stranded energy can be put to immediate use.","Armada, a hyperscale edge data centre company based in the United States, has unveiled its largest modular unit to date, Leviathan, alongside securing a US$131m strategic funding round.

Designed for megawatt-scale performance and rapid deployment, Leviathan targets sustainability by pairing high-density compute with surplus energy in remote or underutilised regions.

The funding round includes backing from new strategic partners Pinegrove, Veriten and Glade Brook, with continuing investment from Founders Fund, Lux Capital and M12, Microsoft's venture capital division.

Armada’s expansion comes amid increasing pressure to reduce the environmental footprint of artificial intelligence infrastructure, while boosting energy-efficient deployment at the network’s edge.

Targeting scale and sustainability at the edge

Leviathan extends Armada’s Galleon product line of ruggedised modular data centres (MDCs), which are pre-fabricated, transportable units engineered to deliver computing power in areas without the need for extensive traditional infrastructure.

These MDCs are optimised for edge computing, a model in which data is processed closer to the location where it is generated, reducing latency and improving energy efficiency.

Each Leviathan unit delivers megawatt-scale compute capacity and supports compute-intensive tasks such as training and running artificial intelligence models.

Compared to Armada’s Triton unit, Leviathan offers 10 times the capacity while maintaining modular flexibility.

“American energy and AI dominance hinges on one thing: moving massive compute to the edge, fast, where data and low-cost power live,” explains Dan Wright, Co-Founder and CEO of Armada.

“Leviathan, the newest member of our Galleon product line, does exactly that.

""Each unit delivers megawatt-scale performance in a fraction of the time and much more flexibly than traditional data centres, due to their ability to rapidly adapt to changes in AI chips and cooling and collocate with all available land and energy, regardless of its form or location.”

The unit’s ability to operate with stranded natural gas, solar, nuclear or other alternative energy sources allows Armada to locate infrastructure in energy-rich but digitally underserved regions.

By co-locating compute infrastructure with otherwise underutilised power, Armada aims to cut energy waste and reduce the emissions associated with long-distance data transfer.

Portable compute infrastructure designed for reuse

Leviathan is powered by the Armada Edge Platform (AEP), the company's software and control layer that manages and redeploys modular compute units.

With AEP, Leviathan can be reconfigured and moved across regions, aligning computing needs with evolving demands and available energy.

Leviathan is also designed to be ""liquid-cooled"", a technique that reduces the environmental impact of data centres by using fluids to remove heat more efficiently than traditional air-cooling methods.

This helps to cut both energy usage and water consumption.

“Leviathan embodies our belief that hardware should behave like software: deployable, upgradeable and governed entirely by code,” says Pradeep Nair, Founding Chief Technology Officer of Armada.

“Paired with the turnkey Armada Edge Platform and its growing Marketplace of AI models and applications, Leviathan’s liquid-cooled, energy-agnostic modules deliver megawatt-scale training and inference in weeks, bridging the digital divide by bringing AI straight to the edge, where data and power already live.”

The may reflect a growing industry preference for decentralised data centres, which are more adaptable and environmentally aligned than traditional hyperscale builds.

Modular architecture also enables companies to scale up infrastructure incrementally, helping manage both carbon output and costs.

Powered by local energy

Armada is now installing Leviathan units through partnerships with energy sector firms Fidelis New Energy and Bakken Energy.

Deployment areas include North Dakota, Texas, West Virginia and Louisiana, regions with untapped power but historically limited access to digital infrastructure.

By embedding compute infrastructure into these local energy corridors, Armada shifts AI deployment away from conventional hubs and into areas where renewable or stranded energy can be put to immediate use.

“From day one, we backed Armada because they saw what others missed: America’s AI leadership hinges on owning the entire stack, from power and silicon to software and being able to deploy it anywhere,” says Trae Stephens, Partner at Founders Fund, one of Armada's early investors.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/cf5f8c4dd5c7237deb2967a99f1efe65:5daff2a7384f29a0c42c7ea9b21f0662/dan-wright-95b27635b2.png.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 03:58:57.186935

From setting up EV manufacturing hubs to entering battery production and launching passenger as well as commercial electric vehicles, JSW is positioning itself to compete directly with the likes of Tata Motors, Mahindra, and Ola Electric.

₹40,000 Crore EV Ecosystem in Odisha

JSW has signed a ₹40,000 crore Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Odisha government to build a vast EV and green energy ecosystem across Naraj (Cuttack) and Paradip (Jagatsinghpur). The mega project will include:

An EV and commercial vehicle plant with a production target of 3 lakh electric cars and 1 lakh commercial EVs annually

A 50 GWh battery manufacturing facility

A 6,000-tonne lithium refinery

A copper smelter for EV component supply chain integration

This is one of the most ambitious EV projects ever planned in India, set to dramatically boost domestic capacity and employment in clean mobility.

₹27,200 Crore Investment in Maharashtra

Simultaneously, JSW will invest ₹27,200 crore in Aurangabad Industrial City (AURIC), Maharashtra, to launch its own in-house EV brand. The facility will create over 5,200 jobs and manufacture both passenger and commercial electric vehicles under the JSW Green Mobility arm.

MG Motor JV and Global Partnerships

Through its joint venture with China’s SAIC, JSW MG Motor India, the company plans to scale EV production from 1 lakh to 3 lakh units per year, launching a new vehicle every 3–6 months, starting late 2024.

JSW also plans to increase its stake in MG India to 84%, as SAIC reduces its involvement in the Indian market.

In addition, JSW is in talks with international EV firms like BYD and Geely to develop electric trucks and explore hybrid technology collaborations.

Commercial Vehicles, Hybrids, and Beyond

Under the JSW Green Mobility banner, the company plans to build electric buses, trucks, and plug-in hybrids. By 2026, JSW aims for plug-in hybrids to account for 50% of its EV lineup. This diversified portfolio will cater to both consumer and industrial EV segments.

Battery Manufacturing and Strategic Capex

JSW is also entering the battery business with a potential $1.5 billion joint venture with LG Energy Solution, targeting a 10 GWh battery plant by the end of 2026. Around 70% of battery output will be used internally, while 30% will be sold to other EV players.

Kran-Annexstein noted efforts to boost clean energy, to slow climate change and reduce air pollution, pale by comparison.","Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek has signed into law the first set of statewide policies in the country supporting community-owned microgrids.

Microgrids are local, self-contained energy systems that use renewable energy sources, such as wind or solar power.

Dylan Kruse - president of Sustainable Northwest, a nonprofit involved in drafting the legislation - said microgrids can help mitigate the uptick in power outages caused by wildfires and extreme weather, especially in rural parts of the state.

""We're seeing an increased interest from small towns, from communities, from tribes,"" said Kruse, ""saying 'look, if the lights go out, we need to have options so we can continue to provide emergency services, we can provide communications.'""

Microgrids can power critical facilities, such as hospitals or fire stations, operating either connected to the main grid or independently during emergencies.

Joshua Basofin - clean energy program director with Climate Solutions - said that while some microgrids are being developed in Oregon alongside utility companies, they are most valuable when communities reap the economic and resiliency benefits.

""When communities own those systems themselves,"" said Basofin, ""they actually have the ability to control those microgrids as they need for their own purposes.""

Oregon's new law requires the state Public Utility Commission to establish clear rules for the operation and ownership of community microgrids, which Kruse said he believes will expedite their construction.

He said while other states have considered moving in this direction, Oregon is the first to take this step.

""This legislation,"" said Kruse, ""is the most ambitious, comprehensive legislation in the country of its kind.""

Rural Alaska power customers are likely to pay higher electricity rates as a result of the elimination of incentives to switch away from traditional fossil fuels.

The new Trump administration budget eliminated tax credits designed to encourage investment in wind and solar projects.

More than 90% of Alaska residents rely on power cooperatives for their electricity, which have made an effort in recent years to invest in wind and solar - especially in the most remote areas.

Alaska Energy blog author Erin McKittrick said rate payers will pay higher prices as a result of fewer alternative energy options.

""Renewable energy is holding out this promise to maybe keep rates down, but the way things are going we may not get that option, or if we get it, it might be more expensive than it is otherwise,"" said McKittrick. ""So, everybody is going to see their rates go up.""

U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-AK, tried to negotiate some alternative energy tax credits back into the bill for her state just prior to a final vote - but was not able to secure money for Alaska's indigenous whale hunters to buy equipment they rely on for subsistence hunting and fishing.

Beyond affecting larger power co-ops, McKittrick said the elimination of the tax incentives will also hurt small companies that install wind and solar power in Alaska's remote locations.

""They don't have this position where they have a huge portfolio of lots of things going on and they can handle uncertainty for one or another project,"" said McKittrick. ""Whether they exist at all in the future is questionable I would think.""

The League of Conservation Voters is working at the grassroots level in Alaska to find ways to keep wind and solar projects alive in the state as it tries to move away from a heavy dependence on diesel fuel and a dwindling supply of natural gas.

More than $7 billion in Colorado's GDP and 9,600 jobs are projected to be lost under President Donald Trump's signature tax and spending bill which cuts incentives for clean energy, according to a new report by the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation.

Solar and wind capacity is expected to drop by 340 gigawatts, raising home energy costs by an extra $170 per year.

Margaret Kran-Annexstein, director of the Colorado chapter of the Sierra Club, said the new law reverses years of work transitioning to a clean energy economy.

""We have seen how investments in clean energy programs can attract more jobs, and can help people lower their electricity costs,"" Kran-Annexstein pointed out.

Trump campaigned on promises to end climate mitigation efforts and to bring down energy costs by increasing the use of fossil fuels. Republicans critical of clean energy tax credits have argued they amount to the government picking industry winners and losers. According to a separate industry analysis, just 30% of U.S. solar and 57% of wind projects are expected to survive under the new GOP law.

Oil and gas companies have benefited from taxpayer subsidies for decades and currently receive $170 billion a year. Kran-Annexstein noted efforts to boost clean energy, to slow climate change and reduce air pollution, pale by comparison.

""This bill is going to be giving polluters an additional $15 billion tax break, while gutting clean energy programs,"" Kran-Annexstein explained. ""We need to be investing in solutions, and we also need to not be giving tax breaks to the companies that are causing these problems.""

The new GOP law cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and SNAP to finance Trump administration priorities including extending 2017 tax cuts. Kran-Annexstein worries ramping up fossil fuel production and limiting health coverage will produce dire consequences.

""If we're revoking people's access to health care, and we're going to be seeing increases in the amount of pollution, people are going to be sick and people are going to die,"" Kran-Annexstein contended.

Despite last-minute concessions in the Trump administration's budget, which removes alternative energy tax incentives, rural Alaska power providers now face huge obstacles to distributing power to the most rural and isolated parts of the state.

Investments in wind and solar power now face an uphill battle. Alaska's extreme weather and challenging geography already make power generation difficult and expensive. Now, with fewer incentives to diversify, the state's most isolated places will be forced to continue relying on fossil fuels for their electricity.

Pierre Lonewolf, board member of the Kotzebue Electric Association, said the loss of tax incentives means critical alternative energy programs are dead in the water.

""That has put the kibosh on our wind projects, which we are partnering with the local tribe to install two more megawatt wind turbines, another megawatt or so of solar,"" Lonewolf explained.

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted for the budget bill but only after she worked to secure some alternative energy tax incentives and funding for Native whale hunters back into the measure in the debate's eleventh hour.

Lonewolf added village and tribal members have worked to move away from diesel fuel for power generation and said a lack of incentives to diversify to wind and solar will fall directly on rural Alaska's consumers who need affordable power to heat their homes.

""We don't want to have to raise our prices on electricity but we have to cover our costs to pay our people,"" Lonewolf acknowledged.

Kotzebue is a gateway for the diesel fuel powering 10 villages in rural Alaska. What Lonewolf called a war on renewable energy will only cause prices to keep rising in parts of the state that can least afford it.

Federal tax incentives are being eliminated sooner than originally scheduled and a regional consultant laid out where the industry is headed, along with buying tips.

Under the new tax policy law pushed by the Trump administration, enhanced tax credits bringing down the cost of a new or used electric vehicle end Sept. 30. They were originally planned to run through 2032.

Jukka Kukkonen, chief EV educator and strategist for the EV consulting firm Shift2Electric, said it could hinder adoption rates in the U.S., but there’s still global demand to transition away from gas-powered cars.

“In general, electric transportation will be the future, there’s no question about it,” Kukkonen emphasized. “We are letting the other competitors to gain a higher market share outside (the U.S.).”

He pointed out American auto manufacturers will be at a disadvantage as China and Europe make gains and failing to push for EV adoption will keep transportation as the top carbon pollution source in the U.S.

Experts also predict a rush of EV customers before tax incentives expire, which Kukkonen noted could limit inventory. A buyer has to have possession of the car by the end date for the tax credit to apply.

The credits are up to $7,500 for qualifying new EVs, and up to $4,000 for used models. They can be transferred to the dealer to immediately knock down the purchase price, instead of waiting until tax season.

Whether you meet the deadline, Kukkonen stressed there is a body of research showing EVs are more efficient cars than traditional engines, providing long-term savings. Battery technology has improved, too.

“Nowadays, the average range for (a) new EV is over 280 miles,” Kukkonen underscored. “Even if you lose 25% of that range in the wintertime, you still have over 200 miles of range.”

The Biden administration gave states money to build charging stations along interstates to address “range anxiety” for longer trips.

In April 2022, Intel announced a target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, covering its Scope 1 and 2 emissions, by 2040.

Since then, the company has already reduced emissions by 43% from its 2019 baseline.

Intel’s global sustainability strategy not only affirms its dedication but also spearheads a transformation within the technology sector towards sustainable practices.

Sustainable computing

Intel has adopted the mantra of “sustainable computing for a sustainable future,"" which encompasses initiatives across its business, from semiconductor manufacturing to enhancing the energy efficiency of its products, platforms and software.

“We are making noteworthy progress toward our environmental goals by focusing on sustainability in several key semiconductor manufacturing areas — electricity, water, waste, our value chain and alternative green chemistry solutions,” Intel says.

These areas, it emphasises, are key to driving toward its larger goal of achieving carbon-neutral computing.

Energy efficiency is another integral element of its approach to sustainability.

“To reach our product environmental goals, we are taking a holistic approach to product sustainability,” the company says.

“We are innovating across our entire portfolio of products, platforms, software and solutions to improve energy efficiency while reducing both our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions as well as our customers’ Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions.”

Semiconductor manufacturing and sustainability

Intel's focus on semiconductor manufacturing is a key area for enhancing sustainability.

With the environmental impact of chip production under scrutiny, Intel’s ambitious plans seek to mitigate its own carbon footprint and catalyse industry-wide climate action.

Intel supports its partners and the industry by sharing best practices and driving regulatory compliance in semiconductor manufacturing sustainability.

Its accolades in this sphere include an A rating in CDP Water Security, A- ratings in Climate Change and Supplier Engagement and a rating of 1 in ISS Environment and Social Quality Score.

Intel’s former CEO Pat Gelsinger – who was replaced by Lip-Bu Tan earlier this year – said: “The impact of climate change is an urgent global threat. Protecting our planet demands immediate action and fresh thinking about how the world operates.

“As one of the world's leading semiconductor design and manufacturing companies, Intel is in a unique position to make a difference not only in our own operations, but in a way that makes it easier for customers, partners and our whole value chain to take meaningful action too.”

As it stands, as well as being just 1% away from its 100% renewable electricity by 2030 goal, Intel is water net positive in US, Mexico, Costa Rica and India, with 110% of freshwater usage returned and restored.

This is a significant step towards its global net positive water by 2030 target.

Even though construction waste rose in 2023, Intel has decreased waste sent to landfills to just 6%, advancing towards their zero waste to landfill by 2030 objective.

He holds a Ph.D. in Communication from the University of California, San Diego and is author of two books: Muddy Thinking in the Mississippi River Delta: A Call for Reclamation (University of California Press, 2024) and A State of Energy: Sustaining Petroleum in Louisiana (forthcoming with LSU Press).

In Louisiana, where low-lying landmasses extend like fingers into the Gulf of Mexico, many of the region’s oldest cultures are marine based, shaped by bayous and waterways that once provided food, transportation, and materials. But the natural scaffolding of this landscape is collapsing.

As shorelines retreat and communities huddle behind ever-higher levees, the wetlands that sustained generations are disappearing. The consequences of sea level rise and a century of oil and gas development are stark: every 100 minutes, Louisiana loses a football field’s worth of marshland. Over the next 30 years, sea levels are projected to rise by nearly two feet. At the same time, warming Gulf waters are supercharging hurricanes, making each storm more destructive along a coast already on the brink.

At the intersection of these converging threats lies the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha Tribe, whose ancestral homeland sits beyond the levees at the edge of Plaquemines Parish, where the Mississippi River dissolves into the Gulf. In this fragile territory, the nation’s newest Liquid Natural Gas export terminal now looms just upriver from their village.

“It’s like the head of an octopus, with tentacles reaching through the wetlands,” says tribal elder Rosina Philippe, who can see the terminal’s lights from her porch at night. “People don’t realize how big they are.”

The Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha Tribe calls itself the People of the Sun with a lineage claim to this coastal region that goes back 5,000 years. Their village of Grand Bayou lies beyond pavement and levees. Homesteads are reachable only by boat. The small marina where community members park their cars lies at the end of a gravel road inundated daily by tidal ponds. During storms, it’s impassable.

Change is happening fast here — too fast for nature and people to adjust, “We’re just reacting,” says Philippe, looking out over marsh ponds that in her youth were hunting grounds. Exposed roots and dead trees haunt the landscape.

Now 70 with long braided hair, Philippe has lived here her entire life. Her people once built shell mounds to survive the seasonal floods of the Mississippi River. “The floods were a gift from the Creator,” she says. “They brought sediment, plants, animals—new life.” But the river is now corseted by levees. Sediment by passes the delta into the sea.

During Katrina, the tribe moored their boats in a canal and rode out the storm in a flotilla. Today, storms are only part of the threat. Towering over the marsh is the Plaquemines LNG terminal—over a mile long, encircled by a 26-foot steel flood wall. Flames flare above the fence, a reminder of its volatile core.

I came to meet Philippe and see the LNG terminal for myself. From New Orleans, Highway 23 threads along the river past a ghostly landscape of idled refinery tanks and pipes, elevated homes, seafood shops, and RV camps of LNG workers. Eventually, the “Death Star”—as some locals call it — rises in the distance. Giant tanks tower behind the fence. Pipes arch over the highway to a mile-long dock along the river, ready to load tankers bound for Europe or Asia.

Louisiana hosts four LNG terminals that handle 61% of U.S. exports. Several more are proposed, straining water supplies and other resources, while accelerating climate change and driving up domestic gas prices. The plants are also located in a particularly fraught area of real estate that is subsiding from coastal erosion faster than anywhere else in the country and possibly the world.

Six of the country’s eight LNG terminals are located in the Gulf coast region, which sees some of the most intense hurricanes from the Atlantic. In 2020, Hurricane Laura slammed Cameron Parish in the southwest corner of the state with a 17-foot storm surge that damaged a third of the state’s industrial facilities. Two months later, Hurricane Delta swept through, causing more destruction.

A Category 4 or 5 hurricane could still breach the Plaquemines facility, despite its walls and levees. “I worry about the safety of all the new equipment. Who is monitoring it?” Philippe said. “Gas is inherently unstable. We are on a peninsula. Where do people go?” The fear, she thinks, is helping to fulfill an unstated objective of moving people out of the area for more industry.

Local officials see it differently. When the Phillips 66 refinery closed in 2021, hundreds of jobs vanished. Venture Global, the company behind the Plaquemines project, promised 250 permanent and 728 indirect jobs to fill the void. Politicians welcomed the investment with open arms.

To lure the plant, Louisiana’s Board of Commerce and Industry gave Venture Global a 10-year property tax break—worth $83.5 million in its first year alone. That’s more than the entire 2022 budget of Plaquemines Parish. Over a decade, the rebate will exceed $834 million. On top of that, the company receives $29.8 million in payroll tax rebates annually. In total, over $1 billion in public funds will subsidize the terminal.

The terminal shipped its first gas cargo in December 2024. Now, a second construction phase is underway to double capacity. Life in the region has changed. Grand Bayou’s quiet rhythms have been replaced by traffic jams, construction noise, and 24-hour operations. The fishing culture that once sustained the tribe has become harder to maintain.

Philippe refuses to give up. She’s a recipient of the 2024 Bob Gough Award for Climate Justice and helped found the First People’s Conservation Council of Louisiana. She’s working with the Water Collaborative of New Orleans on floating gardens to grow indigenous plants for food and medicine. She crafts jewelry from Alligator Gar scales and stews their meat into Garfish Boulet.

But even her most traditional skills are becoming impractical. Shrimp and crab are harder to find. After the BP Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010, female crabs were especially hard-hit. To find enough seafood, fishermen now trawl deeper, with longer nets and more fuel.

The tribe’s story reflects a broader tension of historic takings across Louisiana’s coast. Philippe recalls stories of government men going house to house in Grand Bayou, urging tribal elders to sign documents they couldn’t read. “One of our elders was a young girl and remembers a bunch of strangers standing in her kitchen. It was full of men talking American English words.”

Back then, the tribe spoke a patois of French infused with native expressions. Rosina still converses in French with her cousins.

Now 70 with long braided hair, she wants her two granddaughters to travel and learn about the world but never forget the importance of living a life of service. “We have an obligation to those who came before and those who come after – to not take for granted what others have done.” These obligations are intergenerational. “It’s not just me and it’s not just humans,” she said. “I include plants, the animals, all the other lives that make human lives possible.”

The rise of LNG marks a new chapter in fossil fuel extraction. For most of the 20th century, gas was transported via pipelines, meaning plants that used it had to be near the source. But LNG changed that. When methane is cooled to minus 260°F, it condenses into a liquid—reducing its volume by 600 times and making global shipment possible.

The first commercial LNG trade began in 1961, between Algeria and Britain. ExxonMobil, Chevron, and Shell soon entered the fray. Indonesia, Nigeria, and Qatar became major suppliers. Demand surged across Asia as countries industrialized but lacked domestic hydrocarbon reserves.

In the U.S., natural gas use rose with the decline of coal. New horizontal drilling techniques—popularized in the early 2000s—made ‘fracturing’ gas from shale deposits vastly cheaper, setting off a shale boom.

By 2016, the U.S. joined the LNG export game. Cheniere Energy retrofitted its Cameron Parish facility in Louisiana to liquefy gas for foreign buyers. Exports soared. By late 2023, the U.S. had become the world’s top LNG exporter, with capacity exceeding 11.4 billion cubic feet per day.

Liquefying gas, however, is enormously energy-intensive. Plaquemines LNG alone requires two 720-megawatt power plants—enough to power 1.4 million homes. The cooling process also emits CO₂, which Venture Global says it will eventually capture and inject underground via carbon capture and storage (CCS). Phase I includes 36 refrigeration “trains” that convert up to 2.6 billion cubic feet of gas per day into liquid—equivalent to 465,000 barrels of oil daily.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine accelerated demand as Europe cut ties with Russian energy and pivoted to U.S. LNG. With gas now decoupled from local pipelines, it can chase the highest bidder.

“If the buyer upstream is paying $3 a bucket and there’s a buyer in Japan willing to pay $10 a bucket, you’re going to sell your gas to the Japanese buyer,” said analyst Jay Hakes.

That arbitrage cost American consumers an estimated $100 billion in 2021–22, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Meanwhile, Venture Global, which owns the Plaquemines plant has drawn scrutiny. The company is being sued by investors and customers for prioritizing spot market sales over long-term contracts with BP and Shell. In January 2025, its IPO launched at $25 per share. Weeks later, TotalEnergies revealed that Venture tried to cut a backdoor deal at a lower price. The stock dropped sharply.

Despite the controversy, Venture Global has secured permits to build a second terminal near Calcasieu Pass in southwest Louisiana. The facility would export 20 million tons of gas annually and emit 8.5 million tons of greenhouse gases.

But even the strongest steel walls and earth levees will not be enough to hold back the rising tide. “Water is the strongest element,” Philippe said. “It’s persistent and patient. I tell my granddaughters, be the water. Eventually it will win.”",https://s1.stabroeknews.com/images/2020/11/diasporanew.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 03:02:51.149202

Total operating expenses were $4.80 billion, including $1.184 billion for fuel and power purchases, $1.22 billion for operations and maintenance, $1.773 billion in depreciation and amortization, and $630 million in taxes other than income taxes. The company’s operating income stood at $1.91 billion for the quarter.

First Half 2025

For the six-month period ended June 30, 2025, NextEra Energy reported a net income attributable to shareholders of $2.86 billion, with an EPS of $1.39, down from $3.89 billion, with an EPS of $1.89.

Operating revenues for 1H 2025 rose 9.72% to $12.94 billion from $11.80billion in the same period last year. Total operating expenses increased to $8.83 billion from $8.20 billion during this period.

Outlook

Looking ahead, NextEra reaffirmed its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance at $3.45 to $3.70. Forecasted EPS for 2026 and 2027 are $3.6 to $4 and $3.85 to $4.32, respectively.

The company expects to increase its dividend per share by approximately 10% annually through at least 2026.

Florida Power and Light

NextEra’s subsidiary FPL reported a net income of $1.27 billion, compared to $1.23 billion in Q2 FY 2024, representing a 3.49% increase. The company reported an EPS of $0.62, compared to $0.60 in the previous year.

The nation’s K-12 public school districts continue to struggle with deferred maintenance. Funding remains scarce, staffing is challenging and maintenance needs in many districts’ aging school buildings continue to grow. Now one big-city school district has implemented a upgrade and funding model designed to address its deferred maintenance crisis while achieving another important goal at the same time.

The Chicago Board of Education unanimously approved a resolution recently to launch a Healthy Green Schools Pilot Program that aims to invest in clean energy and building electrification projects across 12 neighborhood schools by fiscal year 2026, according to The Chicagoland Journal.

Through the program, Chicago Public Schools aims to implement clean energy systems, such as rooftop solar panels, heat pumps and geothermal technology at selected schools. These projects are expected to yield long-term cost savings by leveraging available state and federal incentives, including renewable energy credits and direct pay tax credits.

The school district will reinvest energy savings directly back into school facilities through a new Healthy Green Schools Fund, supporting critical upgrades like filtered water fountains, mold and asbestos remediation, and water damage repairs, particularly in historically disinvested areas.

One thing we know for sure: Regulatory compliance can be expensive, in some cases even exorbitant. According to the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the cost of federal regulations to the U.S. economy is over $3 trillion. Going by NAM’s calculations, the average per-employee cost of regulations for a manufacturer is $29,100, and it gets even more expensive for small manufacturers: $50,100 per worker. Keeping the workplace safe and healthy is a good thing, but why does it have to be so expensive?

That’s the question that politicians—and the constituencies that have elected them—have wrestled with for decades. The direction of the regulatory agencies historically has been subject to the whims and political postures of whichever party is in dominance at any given time. At the moment, with the Republicans firmly in control of all three branches of government, there is an obvious movement towards deregulating as many existing rules and sidelining as many proposed rules as possible, throughout all the various agencies. But let’s just focus on EHS-related regulations.

The term “common sense” is one of President Trump’s favorite expressions. For instance, in his second Inaugural Address this past January, he called for a “revolution of common sense” as part of his plan to completely restore the United States. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was created to eliminate wasteful agencies and activities that add costs but little to no benefit to the businesses being regulated.

To take one example, the regulation of “forever chemicals” (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS) has been a political hot potato for quite some time. The EPA under President Biden issued rules regulating the amount of PFAS allowed in drinking water, at a cost to industry of at least $1.5 billion (EPA’s estimate), and as much as twice that amount (industry estimates). One of the first actions taken in the Trump 2.0 Administration was to roll back those Biden-era thresholds on forever chemicals.

Explaining the rollback, EPA Commissioner Lee Zeldin stated, “We are on a path to uphold the agency’s nationwide standards to protect Americans from PFOA and PFOS in their water. At the same time, we will work to provide common-sense flexibility in the form of additional time for compliance.” Zeldin has also affirmed that protecting the environment and growing the economy are not “binary choices. We must and we will choose both.”

Common sense? That’s not how Katherine O’Brien, an attorney with environmental law firm Earthjustice, sees it. According to O’Brien, “The Trump administration’s decision to green light the continued pollution of our drinking water with toxic PFAS while crowing about their commitment to making America healthy is a sick joke.”

There is also a continuing debate on the near-elimination of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), an organization that primarily conducts research into workplace safety (in a non-regulatory fashion). The justification for eliminating NIOSH is that like other bureaucracies, its activities were seen as wasteful and inefficient. But Nicole Greeson, president of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), says that NIOSH’s activities more than justify its existence, pointing to a study from the Rand Corporation that found that three NIOSH case studies (with a cost of $5.1 million) resulted in an annual economic value of $338 million to over $1.2 billion. “NIOSH provides a significant return on investment,” she asserts.

When you get right down to it, the deregulation of US businesses, particularly as it impacts on occupational health and safety, can’t conclusively be dismissed as nonsense since there is a very real rationalization for all these efforts, and in fact President Trump was elected both for his pro-business and his government-reduction policies. But neither can it be said that all these moves reflect common sense since making the workplace and the environment less safe and less healthy is hardly in the best interests of the country’s workforce. So while it’s really neither common sense nor nonsense, it’s safe to say that deregulating EHS is a matter of dollars and cents.","https://img.ehstoday.com/files/base/ebm/ehstoday/image/2025/07/687ed8b671eef8bbfb5f0481-deregulation.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-07-28 03:02:04.118216

The planning, approving, and building of energy infrastructure has been, and continues to be, a major drag on Australia’s net-zero transformation. Slow regulatory approvals and local community opposition have made it difficult to meet targets for delivering renewable energy infrastructure.

Meeting those targets underpins the broader objective of emissions reduction, and underperformance makes it harder to plan for the closure of high-emitting and increasingly unreliable coal-fired plants without creating supply risks.

Streamlining the infrastructure build is a good idea. Yet greater economic gains could be made from another area: capital infrastructure utilisation.

The electricity transmission and distribution grid and the generation it supports are built to meet peak demand, every hour of every day. For most of the past 100 years, instantaneously balancing the production of electricity with the various patterns in the way we use it has been achieved with high reliability and acceptable affordability. During that time, electricity storage has never been a cost-effective requirement. Behind the scenes, however, the consequence is that this hugely capital-intensive system is dramatically under-utilised. Electricity demand comes within 10 per cent of the annual peak less than 20 hours per year. The cost of that low capital productivity was practically unavoidable.

By comparison, for most of the 19th and 20th centuries, our cities and towns were dotted with gasometers – big storage tanks that matched gas being made at a steady rate from coal with variable consumer demand. Modern systems for the production and distribution of natural gas do the same task with only modest storage. The gas grid was much more effectively utilised. But we have never had the capacity to use storage to balance supply and demand of electricity – until now.

For the first time in history, battery storage offers the same solution for electricity, and dramatically so for renewable electricity. Wind and solar generation sources are inherently intermittent. This means that matching demand and supply is more complicated than with fuel-based generation.

Storing electricity in batteries when it’s produced and using it when needed can be done in the distribution or transmission grids.

Storage in batteries or pumped hydro is already recognised as one way to provide dispatchable power when renewable energy supply is low or demand is unusually high. This concept is behind the federal government’s Capacity Investment Scheme that will subsidise both renewable generation and storage.

A second, not often discussed, benefit of battery storage is to dramatically increase the utilisation of the grid, and reduce the investment needed to meet future demand.

A similar benefit applies to rooftop solar and household batteries. Australians have led the world in the adoption of rooftop solar, and that success has meant that in some areas there is more power being generated than can be used by the local grid. Storing electricity near solar rooftops – where it’s produced and used – would increase utilisation of this zero-marginal-cost solar power, much of which is now increasingly dumped rather than stored to be used when needed.

The solution to unlocking the potential gains in productivity is multi-faceted, and early steps are already visible. Federal and state governments are providing financial support for home batteries, with financial benefits for individual homeowners. Energy retailers are setting up and partly financing virtual power plants that look to co-ordinate the operation of rooftop solar and battery storage across multiple homes. And electricity distribution companies are trialling larger local batteries that would store power from suburban homes during sunny periods to be supplied at other times.

Most importantly, the Australian energy market agencies are working on policies and regulations to support these initiatives.

Two examples illustrate some of the challenges. First, home batteries mean that consumers will be able to use electricity when they need it and the battery can ensure the supply is available. The battery investment will be financially attractive if the battery owner stores electricity when it is plentiful and cheap and uses or sells it when demand and prices are high. Time-varying tariffs will be essential but can be complicated. The challenge is to apply the tariffs to those who can understand and use them effectively.

Batteries connected to the distribution grid may be even more cost effective. But the networks are regulated monopolies and are not supposed to operate in the competitive retail sector. The challenge is to solve that conundrum.

The right planning, pricing, and regulations can unlock huge gains in capital infrastructure productivity. It won’t be simple, but it’s the sort of challenge our leaders should embrace at the Economic Reform Roundtable.",https://grattan.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/energy-home-battery-system-with-solar.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 05:03:13.829316

A Quad Energy Bridge can serve as a deliberate strategy to catalyze clean energy infrastructure across all four nations.","Since its inception in 2007, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue—the strategic partnership between Australia, India, Japan, and the United States—has struggled to define a clear purpose beyond counterbalancing China. Despite regular summits and growing rhetorical alignment, the grouping has largely fallen short of delivering tangible economic cooperation.

The Quad was revived in 2017 during the first Trump administration to create a more unified Indo-Pacific security strategy. The Biden administration then elevated the Quad to leader-level summits and broadened its agenda beyond security. The 2024 Wilmington Declaration marked a turning point, committing the four nations to deeper collaboration on clean energy supply chains as part of a wider focus on energy security and economic resilience.

Yet the Quad foreign ministers’ meeting in Washington this month made no mention of energy security, despite growing regional concern over the issue. Instead, the joint statement launched the Quad Critical Minerals Initiative to “strengthen economic security and collective resilience by collaborating to secure and diversify critical minerals supply chains.” It also pledged closer coordination on “critical and emerging technology.” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that the Quad must become a “vehicle for action,” citing critical minerals as a test case. But without a broader energy strategy to anchor demand and guide infrastructure investment, the initiative risks becoming disconnected from the core systems it is meant to support.

Rubio’s remarks were an inflection point. With U.S. clean energy investment facing renewed uncertainty following recent congressional efforts to roll back parts of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the Quad now stands out as one of the few platforms where energy security and economic resilience continue to draw bipartisan urgency. To fulfill that promise, the Quad must move beyond fragmented supply chain coordination and articulate a shared vision for energy cooperation. This cooperation should link critical minerals not just to technology partnerships but also to infrastructure investment, anchored demand, and cross-border deployment.

A “Quad Energy Bridge” could provide this framework, offering a practical blueprint to align upstream supply chains, clean energy innovation, and market development across all four nations.

Realizing the vision of the Quad Energy Bridge means tapping into each country’s distinct strengths.

Australia anchors the upstream supply chain with some of the world’s richest reserves of lithium, nickel, cobalt, and rare-earth minerals. The challenge, and opportunity, is to move beyond raw exports toward developing domestic capacity for refining, processing, and clean energy manufacturing. Simultaneously, Australia is looking to grow its own clean energy infrastructure, including clean energy power plants and green hydrogen facilities, to create a resilient, sustainable industrial base that can feed regional markets.

The United States provides cutting-edge innovation in geothermal power, grid modernization, energy storage, and carbon capture. Yet breakthroughs alone will not be enough, and delays in domestic deployments should not be the death knell to clean tech visions. These technologies can be deployed at scale across diverse markets with a concerted effort by private investors, developers, and governments alike.

India represents the fastest-growing clean energy market among the Quad nations. With more than 230 gigawatts of renewable capacity installed and ambitious targets to double that by 2030, India demands affordable, scalable clean energy solutions (solar, battery storage, and electric vehicle infrastructure included). Its dynamic market presents high-growth opportunities but also requires infrastructure investments tailored to local realities.

Japan plays a critical role as a financier and systems integrator. Its GX (Green Transformation) strategy, backed by $129 billion in green bonds aiming to mobilize $1 trillion in green investment, focuses on hydrogen, efficient materials, and smart grids. Japan’s industrial expertise and government backing position it as a key driver for scaling innovative clean energy infrastructure within its borders and across the region.

A Quad Energy Bridge can serve as a deliberate strategy to catalyze clean energy infrastructure across all four nations. By driving deployment not only in India but also in Australia, Japan, and the United States, it would create interconnected markets, anchor reciprocal demand, and broadly distribute the economic benefits of the energy transition. Mining and processing projects require long lead times and significant capital, both of which are dependent on predictable demand for a wide range of clean technologies. Unless the Quad can align its minerals initiative with infrastructure deployment, technology manufacturing, and procurement strategies, its efforts risk stalling at the source. Simply put, without visible and durable end-use demand, upstream investments in mining, refining, and processing—such as those emphasized by Rubio—will struggle to attract the financing they require.

Government policies and diplomatic coordination are essential, but they often move slowly. Meanwhile, institutional investors (including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and asset managers) have both the capital and the incentive to accelerate clean energy deployment across the Quad. Their early involvement can catalyze projects, foster private sector innovation, and reduce investment risk. With scale and a long-term orientation, they are well positioned to lead where policy tools lag.

It’s worth acknowledging a notable irony in this proposed Quad Energy Bridge. Much of the momentum behind clean energy deployment—particularly in solar, batteries, hydrogen, and domestic manufacturing—stems from policies enacted under the Biden administration, including the IRA. At the same time, the very administration now overseeing those programs has proposed cuts to key implementation tools such as the Energy Department’s Loan Programs Office and has supported rollbacks to the tax credits that underpin deployment. Princeton University’s ZERO Lab estimates that the recent Republican tax bill, which modifies several core provisions of the IRA, could reduce capital investment in clean electricity and fuels by $500 billion over the next decade. These contradictions reflect the political volatility of U.S. energy policy, where long-term strategy is often disrupted by shifting domestic priorities.

A Quad Energy Bridge need not rely on any single U.S. administration. It offers a pragmatic path forward, one led by institutional investors, private developers, and companies, with government diplomacy playing a supporting role. In a fractured policy environment, this model provides resilience and creates a foundation for the United States to sustain influence and credibility in the Indo-Pacific.

Encouragingly, there are elements of existing U.S. policy that align with this approach and can serve as building blocks for deeper Quad coordination. The Defense Department’s recent partnership with MP Materials exemplifies the type of action Quad leaders have now jointly called for. In their recent joint statement, the Quad foreign ministers warned of “abrupt constriction and future reliability” risks in critical mineral supply chains, citing concern over “non-market policies and practices” and dependence on a single country for refining and processing. The MP Materials agreement addresses this risk directly. It includes a 10-year offtake commitment and a government-backed price floor for rare-earth magnets—precisely the kind of long-term demand signal and market stabilization mechanism that can unlock private investment in Quad-aligned supply chains.

Many existing efforts, though initiated through bilateral channels, lay the groundwork for more integrated Quad-wide mechanisms. One example is the new “single point of entry” announcement between the U.S. Export-Import Bank (EXIM) and Export Finance Australia, which builds on the 2024 Quad Export Credit Agency Memorandum of Cooperation. That memorandum committed the four nations to collaborate on financing clean energy and infrastructure projects. The new single point of entry allows project sponsors in either country to engage with both export credit agencies through a unified channel, simplifying access to financing, improving deal coordination, and accelerating project development.

Another key building block is the Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative launched by EXIM in the final months of the Biden administration. The initiative allows EXIM to use its existing import-finance authorities to support overseas projects that enable domestic manufacturing. While its initial focus has been on critical mineral extraction, the underlying statutory authority is broad enough to support midstream and downstream segments as well, including processing, component manufacturing, and assembly. The program reflects a bipartisan push. Rubio has long championed targeted industrial policy to advance U.S. economic and national security. With creative interpretation of its existing mandate, the Resiliency Initiative could serve as a model for broader industrial coordination across the Quad.

In parallel, the U.S. International Development Finance Corp. (DFC) has committed some $500 million to scale clean energy manufacturing in India, illustrating how public financing can anchor private investment at strategic points in the regional value chain. Both DFC and EXIM are approaching reauthorization, with DFC’s due later this year and EXIM’s expected in 2026. These reauthorizations offer a timely opportunity to refine their mandates and strengthen the financial tools needed to support deeper industrial cooperation among Quad countries. Over time, instruments such as these could support minerals processed in one Quad country, components manufactured in another, and final products assembled in a third—advancing regional economic integration while reinforcing supply chain security among trusted partners.

In addition to EXIM and DFC, the Defense Production Act (DPA) offers another tool that can complement these efforts. The Defense Department issued a solicitation last year under DPA authority inviting proposals for critical minerals projects in Australia, the only allied country in the Quad currently eligible for such support. While the program is still in its early stages, it sets a useful precedent for cross-border industrial coordination within the Quad. Congress is now considering reauthorization of the DPA, with strong bipartisan support to expand its use for national security and supply chain resilience.

Most recently, the White House issued a presidential memorandum to consolidate the funding process for U.S. energy infrastructure and critical minerals projects by introducing a one-stop shop to streamline federal funding applications. While the market awaits details regarding scope and how this would be implemented, a common application would be welcomed by strategic parties and investors alike.

These multifaceted tools are beginning to form the scaffolding of a more integrated industrial strategy. Aligning them across all four countries could unlock stable investment channels and demand signals, positioning the Quad to deliver real results.

Still, meaningful cooperation will face headwinds. Regulatory and legal differences across Quad countries can slow approvals or deter cross-border investment. Political volatility continues to shape climate and industrial policy, and leadership changes could disrupt coordination. China’s dominance in critical mineral and clean energy supply chains adds further pressure. Even limited progress by the Quad could draw economic retaliation.

These challenges only strengthen the case for coordinated action. By creating a durable platform for joint investment, demand coordination, and cross-border deployment, a Quad Energy Bridge can move beyond fragmented efforts and toward long-term strategic alignment. In an era of geopolitical volatility and economic uncertainty, that alignment is both urgent and overdue.",https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/quad-washington-GettyImages-2194560653.jpg?w=1000,N,,2025-07-28 05:03:18.850185

The nation has 17 facilities, mostly in Texas and Louisiana, that produce ethylene oxide, according to the American Chemistry Council.
Chemical manufacturers say the risk of cancer from ethylene oxide is lower than some sources say.
According to data from EPA, Eastman released more than 315,000 pounds of ethylene oxide into the environment between 1998 and 2023.
Carman, the Sierra Club official, said the exemption “means no penalties and no accountability” for Eastman under the HON Rule.","President Donald Trump has granted Eastman Chemical Co. a two-year exemption from an environmental regulation requiring companies to reduce their carcinogenic emissions.

Activists say the exemption could threaten the health of people living near facilities such as the Eastman plant in Harrison County. Trump and chemical development leaders say the regulation is burdensome and that the technology required for compliance isn’t readily available.

Eastman’s Longview-area facility is one of 49 across the nation that Trump has allowed to forgo the regulation’s requirements until 2028. The law, known as the HON Rule, was implemented by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2024 and was set to take effect in 2026.

Now, Eastman and other companies have an additional two years to comply. The exemption does not apply to other environmental regulations by which the company must abide. Trump signed the exemption proclamation July 17.

The news comes as several East Texas residents have filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming that the ethylene oxide it has released into the atmosphere around Longview gave them cancer.

The HON Rule aims to reduce emissions of cancer-causing gasses, including ethylene oxide, which is used to manufacture plastics and antifreeze and is used to sterilize medical equipment – up to half of the medical equipment in the country, according to some estimates. However, there are other ways to sterilize such equipment.

The rule is geared at reducing the risk of cancer for about 10 million Americans living near ethylene oxide-producing facilities by imposing stricter pollution control measures and requiring facilities to monitor air quality. The rule is expected to reduce ethylene oxide emissions by 80%, according to Public Health Watch.

Eastman is the ninth-largest emitter of ethylene oxide in the country as of 2023, according to Public Health Watch, a nonpartisan investigative news outlet reporting on health and wellness in America. The nation has 17 facilities, mostly in Texas and Louisiana, that produce ethylene oxide, according to the American Chemistry Council.

Ethylene oxide is a known carcinogen that people are exposed to primarily through ingestion and inhalation, according to the National Cancer Institute, and people working at or living near facilities that produce it may be exposed to it. The EPA states that long-term exposure to the gas can increase a person’s risk of developing various cancers.

Environmental protection organizations say the exemption could negatively impact the health of people living near production sites. Neil Carman, director of clean air for the Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter, said Eastman’s exemption “raises serious concerns for both public health and regulatory integrity.”

“The HON Rule regulates emissions of hazardous organic air pollutants, including known carcinogens and other toxic chemicals,” Carman said. “Allowing Eastman to bypass these requirements increases the risk of exposure for nearby residents and sets a dangerous precedent of letting major polluters off the hook.”

In 2021, news outlet ProPublica classified Longview as a cancer “hot spot” and reported that Eastman is the top emitter of carcinogens in the area. A map created by the Environmental Defense Fund also shows the reach of petrochemical pollution from Eastman’s Longview-area facility and lists ethylene oxide as a top driver of cancer risk.

Chemical manufacturers say the risk of cancer from ethylene oxide is lower than some sources say. The American Chemistry Council has argued that the EPA’s data on cancer risks is flawed, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality conducted a peer-reviewed analysis that found the risk of cancer from the chemical to be 4,000 times lower than the EPA’s 2016 conclusion, according to the chemistry council.

Chemical manufacturers say the requirements in the HON Rule had an “unworkable timeline,” according to a July 18 statement from the American Chemistry Council, which advocates for chemical companies. The rule would jeopardize production of a chemical essential to “national security interests, including public health and economic security, as they are used for countless everyday products and critical industries such as agriculture, healthcare, semiconductor manufacturing, and more,” the statement read.

Jennifer Heronema, a spokeswoman for Eastman, said in a statement that the exemption will give Eastman and other companies “the much-needed time to determine how best to comply with this rule, particularly in our case where there is currently no known technology available to meet certain requirements.”

“Eastman takes its commitment to the safety of its employees, communities and the environment very seriously,” Heronema said. “We comply with all applicable regulations governing the handling and use of materials at our Longview plant and in many cases, we exceed those requirements with our own internal standards.”

Heronema did not answer the News-Journal’s questions about whether the company has air pollution monitoring systems in place at the facility or how the public can keep track of the amount of pollution emitted from the facility.

According to data from EPA, Eastman released more than 315,000 pounds of ethylene oxide into the environment between 1998 and 2023. The amount of ethylene oxide released has fluctuated in the past two decades but generally has declined: The company released nearly 21,000 pounds in 2008 and 6,133 in 2023.

Trump’s proclamation granting the exemptions states that the regulation imposes substantial burdens on companies that already have to follow stringent regulations.

“Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions,” the proclamation reads.

The proclamation did not explicitly state that the rule would have strong negative impacts on chemical companies, but it did say that any disruptions to those companies could weaken the nation’s supply chains, industrial strength and emergency readiness.

Carman, the Sierra Club official, said the exemption “means no penalties and no accountability” for Eastman under the HON Rule.

“Communities living in the shadow of this facility already bear a disproportionate burden of pollution,” he said. “Weakening protections only adds to that burden. Texans deserve clean, safe air to breathe.”",https://marshallnewsmessenger.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2025/07/07292025_lnj_news_honrule.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 03:02:08.563603

The U.S. National Weather Service noted on Saturday that it had issued more than 3,600 flash flood warnings in 2025, a pace that could surpass the typical yearly total of about 4,000, as torrential downpours continued into late July.

Texas has borne the brunt. On July 4, walls of water swept through the Guadalupe River valley, killing at least 135 people statewide. Kerr County lost 107 lives in the tragedy, including dozens of children at a summer camp, according to local officials cited by environmental news outlet Grist. River gauges in nearby Kerrville showed water levels rising more than 11.3 meters in 45 minutes, overwhelming rescuers.

Scientists said warm oceans had pumped record amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere this year, while a weak jet stream had allowed storm clouds to linger over the same areas.

The combination made 2025's thunderstorms unusually intense, Jeffrey Basara, a meteorology professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, wrote for The Conversation on Friday. He added that regions east of the Rocky Mountains received at least 50 percent more rain than usual between mid-April and mid-July.

Surface conditions compound the danger, the expert said, adding that saturated soils, steep terrain and sprawling pavement funnel water into creeks and streets at breakneck speed. The July 4 deluge struck the river's headwaters, which Basara called the worst possible setup, sending a torrent racing downstream.

Climate change is also sharpening the edge. The latest science suggested the Texas Hill Country floods were about 7 percent more severe because higher temperatures intensify rainfall, Annalisa Peace, executive director of the Greater Edwards Aquifer Alliance, wrote in the San Antonio Express News on Saturday.

Basara warned the pattern was likely to intensify, citing climate models that showed the heaviest U.S. downpours would continue to grow stronger as temperatures climb, raising the risk of future flash flood disasters.

Meanwhile, millions of U.S. homes are situated in flood-prone zones. Grist reported 7.9 million structures lie inside areas the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency labeled as having at least a 1-percent annual chance of flooding.

Experts urged stronger building codes, updated flood maps and green infrastructure.

AI data centres require advanced computing to train and run large machine learning models, consuming significantly more energy than conventional data centres.
Hyperscale data centres, which host tens of thousands of servers, are more efficient and can achieve scores as low as 1.1.
Khoo highlights that hyperscale data centres consume between 20-100 megawatts (MW) of power; “enough energy to power a small city”.
He notes that Cress can help align energy-intensive sectors like data centres with national decarbonisation goals.","Data centres are springing up across Southeast Asia as China and the US vie for AI supremacy. Tech giants – from ByteDance and Alibaba to Google and Microsoft – are setting their sights on Johor, Malaysia’s manufacturing hub just across the strait from Singapore. A rich agricultural state, Johor is now also home to sprawling data centre parks.

Since 2023, Malaysia has announced MYR 99 billion (US$23.4 billion) in data centre investments, much of it involving AI facilities, with a further MYR 149 billion (US$35.2 billion) in the near future.

With cheap electricity, labour and ample land, Malaysia has proven to be a compelling alternative to its land-constrained neighbour and is set to become the fastest-growing data-centre hotspot in Southeast Asia.

Like many of its regional neighbours, Malaysia is positioning itself as an intermediary between the US and China amid their trade war. However, this tightrope is growing more difficult to walk – a Chinese company was recently accused of renting Malaysian data centres via third parties, gaining indirect access to advanced, US-designed microchips that are restricted by US export controls.

Weeks after an investigation into that case was launched, the US announced that Malaysia will face 25 per cent tariffs from August, though talks over a trade deal are ongoing between the two nations.

“We can expect a continual and delicate balancing act where Malaysia seeks to avoid taking definitive action that antagonises either the US or China,” says Ewan Lusty, a director at Flint Global, a firm offering policy and regulations advice to businesses.

“

Targeted incentives can accelerate adoption of clean technologies, [but] establishing a clear sustainability framework from the outset is also critical; once data centres are operational, retrofitting becomes much harder.

Shabrina Nadhila, Southeast Asia energy analyst, Ember

Counting the carbon

The surge strengthens Malaysia’s role in the global data centre supply chain, but also raises environmental concerns. Shabrina Nadhila, Southeast Asia energy analyst at Ember, warns that the rise of energy-hungry server farms risks increasing emissions and “locking in fossil-fuel infrastructure that may become stranded”.

AI data centres require advanced computing to train and run large machine learning models, consuming significantly more energy than conventional data centres.

A key sustainability measure used by the industry is Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE). This ratio compares the energy used for facility operations, such as cooling, lighting and ventilation, against that for computing. A perfect PUE score of 1.0 would mean that every watt powers computation alone.

Hyperscale data centres, which host tens of thousands of servers, are more efficient and can achieve scores as low as 1.1. But PUE only tells part of the story. “It’s an internal sustainability metric,” says Wei Yang Khoo, a research associate at the Khazanah Research Institute (KRI) in Malaysia. He notes that PUE overlooks where the electricity comes from, how much is used overall, and the emissions tied to its generation.

Even the most technically efficient data centre can have a significant environmental footprint if it runs on fossil fuels. Khoo highlights that hyperscale data centres consume between 20-100 megawatts (MW) of power; “enough energy to power a small city”. Up to half of the total energy consumption is for cooling the computer systems using vast air conditioning and cooling set-ups that use large amounts of water and energy.

In 2024, 81 per cent of Malaysia’s electricity came from fossil fuels, much of it coal-fired. That reliance jars with corporate sustainability claims and is a challenge to the government’s National Energy Transition Roadmap, which targets 70 per cent renewable capacity by 2050. Ember projects that data centre electricity demand will surge from 9 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2024 to 68 TWh by 2030.

Malaysia’s fossil-fuel-heavy grid makes integration of renewables expensive and slow. It’s common for data centres to buy renewable energy certificates (RECs) to offset emissions, but “they could be using very dirty coal-fired power in Malaysia and then just buy cheaper RECs elsewhere”, says Khoo. Without standardised accounting, double-counting is a real risk, he adds.

Last year Malaysia launched its Corporate Renewable Energy Supply Scheme (Cress), which allows large corporate consumers to procure renewable energy directly from independent power producers. But uptake of the scheme has slowed because of added fees it has imposed on producers to access the network and help maintain it, meaning businesses are currently paying a premium for transitioning to renewable energy.

Can data centres drive the transition?

Some industry voices insist that data centres can be part of the solution. “Data centres actually play a critical role in accelerating the transition towards renewable energy by driving demand for clean power and investing in innovative energy solutions,” says Lusty.

He notes that Cress can help align energy-intensive sectors like data centres with national decarbonisation goals. Facility operators may also face pressure to meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets from global investors and clients.",https://eco-business.imgix.net/ebmedia/fileuploads/polina-kuzovkova-jyCPkC2xSQU-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=801&ixlib=django-1.2.0&q=85&w=1200,N,,2025-07-28 00:00:00.004379

If wind and solar energy are the future of America’s energy sector, they should compete without the crutch of federal aid.","The recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act signals a major shift in federal energy policy. Among its provisions, the law accelerates the phase-out of tax credits for new wind and solar projects and eliminates long-term subsidies for renewable developers on public land.

The law revives a principle that should guide all energy policy: Let the best ideas win on their own merit.

Rolling back the subsidies should relieve pressure to use valuable land for solar and wind farms. Consider the direct land use involved in today’s energy sector. Wind projects take up approximately 30,000 acres to produce the same amount of electricity as a 2,500-acre coal plant. Solar is also land-intensive, requiring about 5,000 acres for equivalent output.

However, when government subsidies reduce the use of public land for renewable energy sources, investors are no longer incentivized to look at the tradeoffs of their land-use footprint.

Land is a finite and valuable resource. Using it for energy comes at the expense of other potential uses. When developers receive subsidies, they do not have to account for the value of alternative uses for the land. If an energy source requires more land, it should pay for that land.

Communities across the country are voicing concerns, objecting to large-scale wind and solar developments that disrupt local land use, strain water resources and alter rural landscapes. According to Robert Bryce’s Renewable Rejection Database, more than 800 wind and solar projects have been rejected or restricted by local governments in the United States since 2015.

One example of the disadvantages of large-scale renewable energy projects is the Spotsylvania Solar Energy Center in Virginia, a solar facility that spans over 6,300 acres, one of the largest solar projects east of the Rockies.

Locals raised their concerns over the project’s environmental effects, particularly the clearing of 3,500 acres of forested land, which involved the removal of around a million trees. Residents feared toxic substances leaching from panels into groundwater, in addition to the heat generated by the installation of 1.8 million solar panels, manufactured by Chinese companies.

Despite the opposition, full operation began in 2021. Virginians’ average electricity rates rose from 10 cents per kilowatt hour in 2019 to 15 cents per kWh in June 2025. This 50 percent rise in energy prices over less than six years underscores that wind and solar projects generally don’t save money and entail serious environmental and community costs of their own.

Supporters of climate-change subsidies often argue that a rapid shift to renewable energy is necessary as they believe resource depletion or environmental harm is on the horizon. Even though America still holds centuries’ worth of recoverable fossil fuels, this argument is flawed in its understanding of energy production.

Coal, oil and gas are the most efficient and profitable energy sources available. Over the past 20 years, wind and solar have received global subsidies of $9 trillion.

The most recent data from the Energy Information Administration show that renewable energy sources received over $15 billion in federal subsidies in 2024, compared to $3 billion for fossil fuels. If renewable energy is truly the cheapest and most competitive option, why do its supporters call for lavish government support?

Some argue that without such incentives, renewable energy investment will dry up. However, when the government gives special financial help to one type of energy, it makes it harder to see which energy sources are the best and most affordable. This distorts fair competition. If wind and solar energy are the future of America’s energy sector, they should compete without the crutch of federal aid.

Subsidizing large-scale land for renewable energy development raises electricity prices and uses public, taxpayer-owned lands. The result is not cleaner and more reliable energy, but misallocated resources.

Spain offers a cautionary tale. With over half of its grid supplied by renewables and a national push toward 100 percent by 2050, the country suffered a 12-hour blackout on April 28. The grid had insufficient inertia, or backup, to continue operating.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents more than just a shift in federal spending; it reflects a renewed commitment to competitive land use in America’s energy sector. By phasing out preferential tax treatment and below-market land deals, the law encourages energy developers to compete on merits and meet America’s rising energy demands with an approach rooted in efficiency, reliability, and competition.

Strong EV sales — especially from brands that continue to cut costs and innovate — can help push the entire auto industry toward a cleaner future.
Cox Automotive expects another surge in EV sales for Q3 as shoppers rush to qualify for federal tax credits before they expire on September 30.
As legacy automakers ramp up production and options multiply, the EV market should become more accessible.","Tesla's Model Y and Model 3 aren't just topping the electric vehicle charts — they're rewriting them.

According to a new report from Cox Automotive, the two mainstream Tesla models together made up a staggering 43% of all EVs sold in the U.S. during Q2 2025. That's 86,120 Model Ys and 48,803 Model 3s — more than the next eight EVs combined. And it happened during a quarter when the EV market overall dipped 6.3% year-over-year.

Tesla's continued dominance comes in spite of a rocky first half of the year. The company paused deliveries to update the Model Y, navigated controversy surrounding its CEO, and faced protests at retail sites.

But these challenges did not significantly lower consumer demand. On the contrary, Tesla's lineup continued to prove what many already suspected: the brand still leads the pack when it comes to accessibility, desirability, and performance in the EV space.

Legacy automakers are starting to close the gap, though. General Motors more than doubled its EV sales in the first half of 2025, landing Chevrolet in the No. 2 spot behind Tesla. But Tesla still commands a 44.7% share of the EV market, despite a dip in quarterly revenue — and that kind of lead sends a clear signal.

So, why does this matter for everyday drivers?

Strong EV sales — especially from brands that continue to cut costs and innovate — can help push the entire auto industry toward a cleaner future. Tesla's market strength helps normalize EV ownership, builds out charging infrastructure, and drives competition, which typically means more affordable options for buyers.

And when you power those EVs with solar energy, the benefits get even bigger. Fueling your car with clean energy at home is significantly cheaper than public charging stations — and EnergySage can help you compare vetted solar installers and save up to $10,000 on a solar panel setup.

Cox Automotive expects another surge in EV sales for Q3 as shoppers rush to qualify for federal tax credits before they expire on September 30.

Despite a dip in year-over-year sales, the first half of 2025 still saw a record-breaking 607,089 electric vehicles sold — a clear indication that EVs are becoming a more mainstream option for drivers across the country.

USA: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Reportedly Wants to Remove Limits on Tailpipe Emissions

Under President Trump, the federal agency is said to be drafting a proposal to reverse a ruling that greenhouse gases are bad for human health.

A newly drafted plan from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said to be days away from going public, aims to strip the agency's ability to limit greenhouse gases. According to reporting from the New York Times, the draft proposal rescinds a 2009 declaration that carbon dioxide and methane emissions are hazardous to public health.

The EPA Reportedly Wants to Remove Limits on Tailpipe Emissions

Under President Trump, the federal agency is said to be drafting a proposal to reverse a ruling that greenhouse gases are bad for human health.

A new draft plan is reportedly going to unwind the EPA's ruling that greenhouse gases are a public health issue.

If passed, the federal agency's ability to enforce restrictions on automakers could be limited in the future.

The plan would overturn official EPA policy that has been in place since 2009.

A newly drafted plan from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), said to be days away from going public, aims to strip the agency's ability to limit greenhouse gases. According to reporting from the New York Times, the draft proposal rescinds a 2009 declaration that carbon dioxide and methane emissions are hazardous to public health.

If verified and passed, such a proposal presents further headwinds to EV adoption and also removes limits on tailpipe emissions. The ruling would also affect industrial pollution, but as far as the automotive industry is concerned, it would remove carbon emission limitations as a target for automakers.

With fines for CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) violations largely eliminated and federal rebates for EV purchases gone, this new change could continue to change the course of domestic car manufacturing. Long-term, such a change would limit the EPA's authority to enforce rules aimed at limiting climate change.The proposed draft is said not to argue with the science regarding greenhouse gas emissions, but rather it states that the EPA has legally overstepped its authority. It seeks to limit the EPA's ability to legislate except in specific circumstances.

There are several steps to be taken before such a change occurs, not least of which are various legal hurdles. If enacted, the new plan would almost certainly face challenges from various sources. It also has to weather some form of public review.It took two years for the EPA to officially label greenhouse gases as a public health issue after a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that they were pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Unwinding this finding may take a similarly long timeline.

If you are in the automaking business, however, it's fairly straightforward to see which way the winds are blowing. For the near future, investing in combustion-powered transportation is likely to be the safe bet.

It was barely more than a year ago that climate activists and federal bureaucrats thought they had maneuvered the internal combustion engine (ICE) automobile to the brink of extinction. ICE vehicles had become like dinosaurs, inferior to their new competitors the EVs, and therefore headed for the scrap heap of history. Customers were flocking to the trendy new EVs, which were seeing rapidly rising sales.

And the all-powerful federal bureaucracy was going to give the final push to put ICE vehicles out of their misery. On June 7, 2024 President Biden’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had issued a final rule (“Corporate Average Fuel Economy [CAFE] Standards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans for Model Years 2030 and Beyond”) jacking up mandatory average vehicle mileage to 50+ [mpg] as of 2031, with further increases to follow from there. Since no ICE vehicles bigger than a baby carriage could achieve that mileage, the only path forward for vehicle manufacturers would be rapid conversion to making only EVs. NHTSA’s mileage rule had also quickly followed an equally draconian mandate from EPA, finalized on April 18, 2024 (“Multi-Pollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles”) setting strict and declining limits for CO2 emissions that no ICE vehicles would be able to meet by the early 2030s. And meanwhile, 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act had extended a $7500 tax credit to buyers of new EVs through December 31, 2032.

So all the pieces were in place. By some time in the early 2030s, it would be effectively illegal to sell new ICE cars, and they would be rapidly disappearing from the roads.

Well, not so fast. Suddenly, the rapid advance of the EV may have stalled out completely. The federal regulators have reversed their direction. And customer preferences seemingly favorable to EVs may turn out to evaporate as soon as federal tax benefits end, an event now just a couple of months away.",https://hotair.com/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-27 22:01:31.918481

We are here today on the 15th anniversary of the Kalamazoo River oil spill so that history does not repeat itself.
""The massive Enbridge oil spill into our Kalamazoo River was so toxic that when we went that day to see it firsthand, we quickly left, feeling ill from the smell.
He talked about the Kalamazoo River oil spill and its legacy.
“A movement that says never again are we going to let major corporations like Enbridge spill oil into our rivers.","Environmental groups gathered over the weekend to mark the 15th anniversary of an oil spill into the Kalamazoo River. The message they delivered is this: That oil spill 15 years ago was a warning about what could happen if an oil pipeline that runs through the Great Lakes is not shut down.

Tented booths were set up to represent different groups that responded to what happened 15 years ago when Enbridge’s Line 6b burst. One-point-two million gallons of oil was recovered from that tar sands oil spill along more than 35 miles of the Kalamazoo River and one of its tributaries near Marshall, Michigan.

A report from the Federal On-Scene Coordinator extensively details the event and the damage, but residents say there was also a toll on them that is incalculable.

The Michigan Climate Action Network organized the event at the Historic Bridge Park near Battle Creek. That site was chosen because it was part of the long stretch of contaminated shoreline.

Denise Keele is the Executive Director of that group. She says no one has forgotten the damage caused by Line 6b. That’s why they worry about Line 5.

“The message remains the same: to shut down Line 5 and no oil tunnel. We are here today on the 15th anniversary of the Kalamazoo River oil spill so that history does not repeat itself. We should learn from our mistakes.”

Keele added the other mistake is perpetuating the use of fossil fuels that’s causing disruption of the Earth’s climate.

Local residents say they've paid a price because of the oil spill 15 years ago.

""The massive Enbridge oil spill into our Kalamazoo River was so toxic that when we went that day to see it firsthand, we quickly left, feeling ill from the smell. We knew it must never happen again,"" said Iris Potter with the group Kalamazoo Remembers.

She said Michigan should learn from that experience as the state reviews permit applications from Enbridge for a proposed tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac to house a new segment of the 72-year-old the Line 5 pipeline.

“So now, just envision that in the Straits and beyond. A spill happens when you least expect it and quickly the beauty is gone. Believe me,” Potter said to the crowd and an online audience watching the speeches.

Nichole Keway Biber is the Mid-Michigan Organizer of Michigan Clean Water Action. She’s also a citizen of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians. She noted that today Line 5 is more than 30 years older than Line 6b was when it ruptured.

“The many places that 645-mile-long pipeline crosses over waters is close by to the Great Lakes, beyond just the absurdity of that four-mile-stretch beneath the Straits. That’s all a threat. That pipeline is over 70-years-old,” Biber said.

Some of the environmental groups’ leaders spoke to those gathered at the event. Sean McBrearty is Coordinator of the Oil and Water Don’t Mix campaign. He talked about the Kalamazoo River oil spill and its legacy.

“This was entirely man-made. And it was only as big as it became because the negligence of the people who know, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the federal government are asking us to trust the Great Lakes with.”

He said that devastating Line 6b oil spill -one of the largest inland oil spills in the U.S.- spurred a movement.

“A movement that says never again are we going to let major corporations like Enbridge spill oil into our rivers. A movement that says we’re going to protect our Great Lakes. And make sure the same company responsible for this oil spill does not strike again, this time with a larger pipeline running more oil in the heart of the Great Lakes.”

Right now, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy (EGLE) is taking comments from the public on permit applications submitted by Enbridge. The company wants to tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac to house a new segment of Line 5. The current pipeline sits on the lakebed of the Straits that connect Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.

Beth Wallace is the Great Lakes climate and energy director for the National Wildlife Federation. She said EGLE is falling short in its responsibilities. It should be reviewing what kind of environmental damage could be caused by tunneling under the Straits of Mackinac in addition to the impacts where the tunnel construction begins and ends above ground.

""Our own state agencies, the ones that were stuck here sucking oil out of the river, seem to be playing right into the hands (of Enbridge), refusing to properly assess risk for a pipeline that poses a disaster for 20 percent of the world's (accessible) fresh water,"" Wallace told the crowd.

She questioned whether the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy was fulfilling its obligations under the Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act to review whether the drilling of the tunnel itself would have environmental impacts.

“Who are the decisions really serving? They’re not the people of Michigan. They’re not the tribes who have stewarded these waters for generations, and not the millions that rely on the Great Lakes.”

In a previous Michigan Public news story, EGLE said that during its review of the Enbridge Line 5 tunnel proposal, the top priority has been protecting the Straits of Mackinac and surrounding wetlands from adverse environmental impacts. The tunnel would hold a pipeline that carries petroleum products through an environmentally sensitive area, replacing the line that runs along the bottom of the straits.

EGLE added that The Great Lakes Submerged Lands Act is used primarily for construction projects on the bottomlands of the lake.

When asked what the groups were willing to do to stop Line 5 and the proposed tunnel, Wallace said if EGLE does not do its job fully, the National Wildlife Federation will take the agency to court.

Nichole Keway Biber with the Michigan Climate Action Network and member of the Little Traverse Band of Odawa responded to the question this way.

“Our indigenous people and our nations and our allies aren’t going to let this happen. We cannot. We cannot. So, if they want us to be up there camping out, and bring our drums, and bring our medicine, we’re ready to do that,"" she said to cheers and applause of several of those gathered.

When asked for a comment regarding the concerns of the environmental groups, Enbridge responded:

""Enbridge’s commitment to safeguarding the Great Lakes, natural resources, and communities continues to drive our work behind building the Great Lakes Tunnel, and locating a new, replacement section of the Line 5 pipeline inside the protection of the tunnel, deep under the lakebed.

We support and welcome the public comment process now underway. Public and stakeholder input is essential to the process and we look forward to hearing feedback and answering questions.""

EGLE is taking comments about the construction of the proposed tunnel and any concerns about environmental damage caused by it are being taken online or through the mail until August 29. You can learn more about the permits and leave comments here. Or you can submit comments by mail to:

This should probably be seen as dovetailing with the country’s policies around control of the materials vital for green energy.

And yet, in the face of the continuing rise in global temperatures, the struggle to encourage accelerated adoption of EVs (bearing in mind the vast number of petrol and diesel vehicles still on the roads), and a US administration that is turning the clock back on renewable energy, one might almost see António Guterres’s statement as a pyrrhic victory.

Still, we could look at this in five years and comment on a remarkable turnaround.

Guterres is right to point out that a great deal of energy insecurity revolves around fossil fuels, and so they are susceptible to the price shocks that accompany wars, invasions, and other geopolitical events. He said:

“There are no price spikes for sunlight,” he said. “No embargoes for wind.”

Let us look on his speech last week with the positivity it deserves. When it comes to hope, like the Irish phrase says: “Níl sé marbh fós.”

It isn’t dead yet, even if it is a faded shade of what it once was.

Making dreams come true

When it comes to connections, despite our own travails at home, it is good that we, as a country, still remember that there are those with greater needs than our own.

As reported by Imasha Costa in today’s edition, there are now six children’s homes in Sri Lanka that have been funded by Irish people. All are named after the towns that support them.

Initially founded by Wicklow-Wexford TD Brian Brennan, these began in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami that devastated swathes of Asia.

They have since grown in number.

While Sri Lanka itself has its dangers — Costa notes in a first-person piece that emigration is common, extreme poverty is endemic, and she herself was injured in an attempted robbery there in 2023 — it is something of a balm to know that there are oases of calm for children.

The country faces significant economic and political challenges, yet some of the boys and girls who have spent time at the homes have gone on to bigger and better things.

They are described as “exceptionally talented … they have incredibly massive dreams”.

Speaking after releasing the ATA’s latest submission to Treasury’s consultations for the Economic Reform Roundtable at Parliament House from August 19-21, Parry said the case for implementing a national EV road user charge was strong.

“Fuel excise is forecast to decline from 5.2 per cent of government revenue in 2008-09 to 3.5 per cent in 2028-29,” he said.

“And there needs to be a national charging system to override future, inconsistent state charges. Although the High Court overturned Victoria’s EV road user charge, the latest NSW budget projects the state will generate $214 million from its own charge in 2027-28 and 2028-29.

“The last thing that national trucking businesses need is to have to pay road user charges at different rates to different governments with different record keeping requirements.”

Parry said the federal government should decide the details of the charge now but not impose it until electric vehicles make up 30 per cent of light vehicle sales and, later, heavy vehicle sales.

“We need the certainty of knowing how the charge will work, but there is a convincing argument that it should not be imposed until EVs are better established,” he said.

“Right now, we need more EVs to reduce our carbon emissions and support Australia’s fuel security. Every EV on the road reduces our need for imported fuel.”

Parry said there was no need to move diesel trucks to an invoice based road user charging system.

“The current fuel tax credit system seeks to ensure that truck and bus operators pay for their road use but are not overcharged. It keeps transport costs down for families and businesses alike,” he said.

“Governments have debated invoice based charging for heavy vehicles for many years, but the current system for charging truck and bus operators for our use of the roads will be workable into the 2030s.”

The ATA said the National Transport Commission will shortly begin consulting on a new model for calculating the charges – the existing model, PAYGO, is no longer fit for purpose – but the new model will not change how the money is recovered.",https://bigrigs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/electric-truck.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 22:01:26.548897

Dr Tan See Leng, Singapore’s Minister-in-charge of Energy and Science & Technology, said in an interview on July 21 that the country needs to acquire technical expertise in this area to ensure its safety.

“Our neighbours, the Philippines, Indonesia, have publicly signalled that they intend to build nuclear plants. So, regardless of whether we have made the decision, our neighbours have made the decision,” he said in his first interview in the new portfolio.

Dr Tan was previously overseeing energy issues as Second Minister for Trade and Industry.

Five Asean countries – Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand – have said they are either studying the feasibility of advanced nuclear technology to meet their growing energy needs, or already have plans to build new reactors in the coming decades.

As Singapore continues to evaluate the viability of nuclear energy for the country, local talents have to be trained so they can determine whether advanced nuclear technologies are safe and suitable for the Republic when these come onto the market, Dr Tan said.

On July 11,

the Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Institute

was launched with an aim to train 100 nuclear experts by 2030 – up from the 50 today.

Singapore also renewed the Third Country Training Programme Memorandum of Understanding with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on July 25.

Under the agreement, Singapore will develop training programmes with the UN nuclear watchdog to support developing IAEA member states with fellowships, scientific visits and training courses.

Topics covered will include human health, industrial radiography, environmental radioactivity monitoring and analysis, and accelerator science.

Dr Tan noted that conventional nuclear plants are large, and require exclusive buffer zones. “Categorically, let me tell you that they will not be suitable for us,” he said .

But nuclear technologies have evolved since.

Small modular reactors (SMRs) are thought to be more suitable for land-scarce, population-dense Singapore, as they have a lower power capacity, enhanced safety standards and require much smaller buffer zones, compared with conventional reactors.

Dr Tan said: “We have not excluded that... because there is a lot of promise for some of the advanced modular reactors – the physics, the engineering, the technical feasibility, all point to the fact that they are possible, but it is just that commercially, they are still not viable yet.”

He also stressed that ensuring the safety of nuclear technologies is of “paramount importance” to the Government.

While Dr Tan acknowledged that Singaporeans may still have certain perceptions about nuclear energy, he said the country still needs to press ahead in this area given the interest from some of its neighbours .

Singapore has bilateral agreements with the United States and France to pursue cooperation on nuclear energy, which could better help in the country’s evaluation of the viability.

In July 2024, the Republic inked the

123 Agreement on Nuclear Cooperation with the US

, which will allow Singapore to learn more about nuclear technologies and scientific research from American organisations.

For example, local research institutes could work with US national laboratories and technology companies to perform safety simulations and modelling of SMRs.

In May, Singapore and France

signed agreements on nuclear energy

to facilitate cooperation on safety, workforce development, research, environmental protection, the protection of public health, and emergency preparedness and response, among others.

Dr Tan said that these partnerships will enable Singapore to learn more about the regulatory approvals, safety protocols, operations and engineering designs, among other things.

The US tariffs are not likely to affect these agreements, he said.

Dr Tan said that the learnings from the partnerships will help Singapore eventually make the assessment on whether to “jump in, or just stay at the capacity- and capability-building level”.

He added that Singapore is also open to exploring partnerships with other countries that have nuclear expertise, such as the United Arab Emirates, China and South Korea.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/1e7ddf5bcfb2abd985225536f6a6c2038ddb8a4eb93c6f141eb9e265f6094f6c,N,,2025-07-27 20:59:30.024598

By avoiding a trade war and stabilizing key sectors, the agreement introduces a 15% baseline tariff on most EU goods to the U.S., a compromise that balances American industrial protectionism with European access to U.S. markets. However, the deal's true transformative potential lies in its energy commitments, investment flows, and sector-specific dynamics, which are reshaping global supply chains and creating new opportunities for investors.

Energy: A New Era for U.S. Exporters and EU Diversification

The EU's $750 billion energy procurement from the U.S. over the next three years is a game-changer for American energy infrastructure. This commitment ensures long-term demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), oil, and other energy products, directly benefiting companies like Cheniere Energy (LNG) and NextEra Energy (NEE). Cheniere, which operates the largest LNG export terminals in the U.S., is poised to secure multi-year contracts with European buyers, while NextEra's expertise in renewables aligns with the EU's Net-Zero Industry Act.

However, the EU is simultaneously diversifying its energy sources to reduce reliance on U.S. imports. European firms like TotalEnergies (TTE) and Siemens Energy (SIEGY) are accelerating partnerships in Africa and the Middle East, creating a dual dynamic: U.S. energy companies gain near-term stability, while European firms hedge against geopolitical risks. Investors should monitor the pace of EU energy infrastructure projects and U.S. LNG terminal expansions to gauge the sustainability of this tailwind.

U.S. Manufacturing: Tariff Mitigation and Strategic Nearshoring

The 15% tariff framework stabilizes U.S. manufacturing by reducing uncertainty, but the deal's true value lies in the EU's $600 billion investment in American industry. This capital is directed toward advanced manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and technology sectors, accelerating nearshoring trends. European firms like ABB (ABBV) and Siemens (SI) are relocating production to the U.S. to meet EU procurement demands, creating opportunities for American suppliers of machinery and components.

Defense and industrial stocks stand to benefit most. The EU's $150 billion commitment to U.S. military equipment procurement is boosting demand for firms like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX). Meanwhile, the removal of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum—critical inputs for defense manufacturing—reduces costs for companies like ArcelorMittal (MT) and Nucor (NUE). Investors should prioritize defense contractors with strong order backlogs and industrial firms with nearshoring partnerships.

EU-Exporting Firms: Navigating Tariffs and ESG Alignment

The EU's 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. vehicles and the U.S. 200% tariff on European pharmaceuticals have created a bifurcated landscape. However, the deal's energy and investment components offer a path to stabilization. European pharmaceutical firms like Novo Nordisk (NOVOB.CO) and Roche (RHHBY) retain pricing power in critical markets, while industrial machinery firms like Siemens and ABB leverage their ESG credentials to secure U.S. contracts.

For export-oriented EU firms, the key is to balance tariff risks with strategic nearshoring and ESG alignment. Companies that prioritize localized production and green hydrogen projects—such as TotalEnergies and Siemens Energy—are better positioned to navigate regulatory and geopolitical shifts. Investors should focus on EU firms with diversified supply chains and strong U.S. market access.

Strategic Investment Recommendations

Energy Infrastructure: Buy Cheniere Energy (LNG) and NextEra Energy (NEE) for exposure to LNG demand and renewable growth.

U.S. Industrial Stocks: Target Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Nucor (NUE) to capitalize on defense and industrial tailwinds.

EU-Exporting Firms: Invest in ABB (ABBV) and TotalEnergies (TTE) for nearshoring and energy diversification plays.

Hedge Exposure: Use ETFs like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) to balance energy volatility and the Select STOXX Europe Aerospace & Defense ETF for defense sector stability.

The U.S.-EU Trade Deal is more than a tariff agreement—it is a strategic realignment of energy, manufacturing, and supply chain priorities.

Yet the administration has proposed cutting programs that help cushion these blows, like energy assistance (LIHEAP), food aid (SNAP), and Medicaid.","The Trump administration’s rollback of clean energy and climate policies is having a direct and painful impact on working Americans. Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies are expected to raise the cost of food, electricity, and insurance, while weakening the safety nets that protect vulnerable families.

By slashing tax credits and subsidies for solar, wind, and energy storage, the administration has stifled the growth of renewables and tilted the energy market back toward carbon-emitting fossil fuels. As a result, utility bills are climbing. Nationally, residential electricity rates have risen by over 6% in the first half of 2025 alone, with average household energy costs up more than $200 compared to 2022. Forecasts suggest that these bills could rise by another $170 to $640 annually by 2035, depending on the region and the pace of fossil fuel reliance.

At the same time, the growing intensity of climate-driven disasters, such as droughts, floods, and wildfires, are pushing food prices steadily higher. Crop failures and supply chain disruptions are expected to drive food inflation by roughly 3% annually, making groceries increasingly unaffordable for low-income families.

Insurance costs are surging as well. Property and auto premiums have risen sharply in recent years due to worsening climate risks. As the administration dismantles climate resilience initiatives and reduces federal disaster aid, insurers are passing the risk onto consumers which are pricing many out of adequate coverage entirely.

These rising costs hit low- and middle-income working Americans the hardest. They spend a greater share of their income on food, energy, and housing. Yet the administration has proposed cutting programs that help cushion these blows, like energy assistance (LIHEAP), food aid (SNAP), and Medicaid. The result is a perfect storm: higher bills and fewer lifelines. These costs are expected to rise the fastest and the sharpest in rural parts of America.

But consumers are not powerless. They can voice their dissatisfaction by contacting elected officials, voting for candidates who support climate resilience and affordability, and joining grassroots efforts that advocate for clean energy and economic justice. Local and state governments also remain key battlegrounds where people can push for renewable mandates and utility protections.

Clean energy includes renewable energy, nuclear power, electricity grids, energy storage, electric vehicles (EVs), and railways.
Clean energy technology is growing at a rapid pace in the ""new three"" industries: solar energy, EVs and batteries.
When it comes to the development of green energy technology, different Chinese provinces concentrate on different aspects of the sector.
As a matter of fact, Inner Mongolia led the nation in new renewable energy installations, green hydrogen production, new energy storage installations, and green electricity trading volume, becoming the leading supplier of green energy across the country and accounting for 10 percent of its green energy output.","An International Renewable Energy Agency report says renewable energy capacity increased by 585 gigawatts, or a record 15.1 percent, worldwide last year, with China being central to this increase, contributing nearly 63.8 percent of the capacity growth.

In fact, 2024 was a historic year for the Chinese economy and its sustainable development, because green technologies contributed an impressive 10.3 percent to China's economic growth, with sales and investments in this sector reaching an impressive 13.6 trillion yuan ($1.89 trillion).

For the first time in China's history, clean energy technology contributed 26 percent to the country's GDP growth, exceeding the value of real estate sales, in 2024. China would not have met its 5 percent GDP growth target without developing its clean energy technology sector. Clean energy includes renewable energy, nuclear power, electricity grids, energy storage, electric vehicles (EVs), and railways. These technologies and infrastructure are necessary to reduce China's carbon footprint in energy production and use.

Clean energy technology is growing at a rapid pace in the ""new three"" industries: solar energy, EVs and batteries. China exports more than 80 percent of the world's solar photovoltaic panels, over 70 percent of battery packs and components, and about 40 percent of EVs.

When it comes to the development of green energy technology, different Chinese provinces concentrate on different aspects of the sector. For example, Anhui, Guangdong and Jiangsu lead in EV manufacturing, attracting huge investments from automakers and battery manufacturers.

On the other hand, Jiangsu leads in offshore wind development, with provinces like Guangdong, Fujian, and Hainan, too, making rapid progress in this field.

China's primary battery-producing provinces are Jiangsu, Guangdong and Zhejiang, with Jiangsu producing more battery cells than the rest of the world in some years. The Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions are also vital to China's green energy sector, with Inner Mongolia lately seeing a larger increase in installed renewable energy capacity.

Thanks to its outstanding wind and solar power resources, Inner Mongolia is one of China's top green energy regions, with an estimated wind power potential of 1.46 billion kilowatts, accounting for 57 percent of China's total, and a solar power potential of 9.4 billion kW, accounting for 21 percent of the country's total.

According to the region's energy authority, Inner Mongolia added more than 41 GW of new renewable energy capacity in 2024, breaking the annual record for new installations. The total installed capacity of Inner Mongolia's new power plants, including wind and solar power, exceeds 135 GW, or 2.7 times more than what it was during the start of China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period. In fact, the region's clean energy capacity is now higher than its thermal power capacity.

As a matter of fact, Inner Mongolia led the nation in new renewable energy installations, green hydrogen production, new energy storage installations, and green electricity trading volume, becoming the leading supplier of green energy across the country and accounting for 10 percent of its green energy output.

There are clear indications that this growth will persist in 2025, propelled by the completion of significant projects before the end of this year. In the 15th Five-Year Plan (2026-30), China will likely set new and even more ambitious clean technology goals.

But can China's clean energy development reshape not only its economy but also global power dynamics? The exponential growth of China's ""new three"" industries is fueling the strategic reorientation of the country's economic engine, industrial capacity and international influence. And as Europe and the United States wrestle with regulatory uncertainty and high costs in their own energy transitions, China's vertically integrated, State-supported model is setting the pace.

What is unfolding in China is not just a national energy story, but a test to determine whether an emerging power can lead the global green transition at scale, in time and in alignment with both economic and climate goals. If successful, it could offer a model which developing countries can learn from to leapfrog fossil-fueled industrialization. But the stakes are high, and the world is watching — not just China's numbers, but also its narrative.

He acknowledged that Singapore’s energy transition will result in higher costs, and said the Government will provide support to help people cope.
A regional grid is a win-win for countries importing and exporting renewable energy, Dr Tan noted.
For example, the Government has appointed Singapore Energy Interconnections, a newly incorporated government-linked company, to specialise in developing cross-border power infrastructure.","SINGAPORE - It is no longer feasible nor practical for Singapore to avoid working towards a net-zero future, said Dr Tan See Leng, Singapore’s Minister-in-charge of Energy and Science & Technology.

Fluctuations in the prices of fossil fuels due to geopolitical conflicts have driven up energy prices. Dealing with the impacts of climate change, such as rising sea levels, is also critical for Singapore, he said.

“Energy is existential for us, just like water was existential in the 90s,” said Dr Tan in his first formal interview as Minister-in-charge of Energy and Science & Technology on July 21.

The portfolio sits under the Ministry of Trade and Industry, and was created in the

latest round of Cabinet changes

in May. Dr Tan was previously Second Minister for Trade and Industry, and he continues to helm the Manpower Ministry in the new Cabinet .

Prime Minister Lawrence Wong had said that science and technology are key drivers of growth, while energy – especially clean energy – will be an important part of his Government’s agenda.

Singapore now relies on natural gas, a fossil fuel, for about 95 per cent of its energy needs.

The Republic’s goal

is to reach net-zero emissions – where the total amount of emissions is balanced by activities to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere – by 2050.

Achieving this would require the energy sector, which makes up about 40 per cent of the nation’s total emissions, to cut its emissions.

Dr Tan said Singapore is exploring all possible options in its energy transition to ensure its energy needs are met in a sustainable, resilient and cost-effective way.

“Nothing is off the table. We will explore every single pathway, every single possibility, and... make sure it is cost-effective and sustainable,” he said.

During the 90-minute interview, Dr Tan fielded a range of questions about Singapore’s energy future, from developments in the Asean power grid, to the country’s

exploration of nuclear and geothermal energy

, and the role of emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage.

He acknowledged that Singapore’s energy transition will result in higher costs, and said the Government will provide support to help people cope.

For example, utility rebates such as the U-Save rebates help households to offset utility expenses, while climate vouchers are meant to encourage them to switch to green appliances. Meanwhile, he said the Government will work with businesses such as through energy efficiency grants to help them manage this impact.

“It is not going to be possible for the cost to not go up,” Dr Tan said. “But what we will endeavour to do is to manage that gradient... and supplement it with rebates, with grants to help our local population, our households and businesses.”

The promise of energy imports

Dr Tan said that in the near term, renewable energy imports hold the most promise for Singapore.

The Republic has limited access to renewable energy resources, so importing clean electricity generated elsewhere can help.

In 2024, Singapore

raised its low-carbon electricity import target

from 4 gigawatts (GW) to 6GW by 2035. This is expected to make up around a third of the country’s energy needs by 2035.

Dr Tan said there is a possibility to increase the target beyond this, depending on partnerships.

The Asean power grid – which will allow countries to share renewable energy resources – is also gaining traction, with a growing number of bilateral discussions on the issue.

For example, Singapore and Indonesia in June

inked three key agreements

to strengthen cooperation in clean energy and sustainable development, including agreements on cross-border electricity trade.

A regional grid is a win-win for countries importing and exporting renewable energy, Dr Tan noted.

It will not only help Asean achieve its net-zero ambitions earlier, he said, but also bring about economic growth to the countries. “Given the vast amount of potential that is within Asean itself, you could unlock significant economic opportunities,” he added.

A

US-Singapore study

on energy connectivity in South-east Asia had assessed that building the Asean power grid can generate US$2 billion (S$2.6 billion) annually in research and development, and create as many as 9,000 jobs a year.

Asked if the breakdown of multilateralism around the world helped to focus attention on the importance of the regional grid, Dr Tan said: “I think that in a way, we’ve all been encouraged as a result of all of the recent developments.”

He added: “I don’t think there’s any one major particular push. It’s a whole series of nudges. I think the tariffs could also be one of those reminders to encourage all of us to come together and work even more closely as one united Asean.”

Dr Tan said the other pathways that Singapore is exploring – such as the use of carbon capture technologies, the potential of hydrogen as a clean fuel, or tapping nuclear energy – are “still some distance away”.

“So I think in the foreseeable next five years, you will see a lot of work on renewable energy imports, and at the same time, still natural gas, and how to decarbonise natural gas.”

The importance of partnerships

Calling his new portfolio a “redesignation” since he had also overseen energy issues as Second Minister for Trade and Industry, Dr Tan said the new title will help him up the ante in international partnerships.

“It allows a more seamless coordination across the different government agencies within Singapore and also at the same time, when we negotiate internationally,” he said, noting that many countries have dedicated energy ministers.

Dr Tan said that while progress on the Asean grid has been made, challenges remain. These include logistical issues like the need to upgrade existing infrastructure to transfer energy.

This is where Singapore could step in to provide investments, such as initial funding to crowd in more capital for cross-border energy projects.

For example, the Government has appointed Singapore Energy Interconnections, a newly incorporated government-linked company, to specialise in developing cross-border power infrastructure.

Singapore’s

$10 billion Future Energy Fund

– set up to catalyse investments in clean energy technology that may involve high upfront costs and significant commercial, technological and geopolitical risks – could also provide initial funding.

But to attract other sources of capital, such as from the private sector, government-to-government frameworks will be needed to give investors greater certainty, said Dr Tan.

That would improve the “bankability” of such projects, he said . “I think it will attract significant investments, both from public capital, private capital, and even longer-term philanthropic capital .”

Going forward, Dr Tan said natural gas will likely remain a core pillar in Singapore’s energy mix.

But its share will change depending on the development of technologies.

“A good position for Singapore is that by the mid-2040s, natural gas will be around just slightly below 50 per cent of our mix,” he said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/ee418fdc7aa0e1455190b140453401f967a9e65221555d9ba2fd8c8209796e6e,N,,2025-07-27 20:01:49.269730

He urged European leaders to “stop the windmills,” because they are ruining their countries.

Mr. Trump made the remarks ahead of a key meeting on tariffs with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

“I say two things to Europe. Stop the windmills. You’re ruining your countries. I really mean it. It’s so sad,” Mr. Trump said Saturday.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump repeated his plea as he sat with Ms. von der Leyen and other leaders in Scotland ahead of the tariff talks.

“We will not allow a windmill to be built in the United States. They’re killing us. They’re killing the beauty of our scenery, our valleys, our beautiful plains,” the president said.

Mr. Trump is a longtime opponent of wind energy. He failed in his bid to block an offshore wind project near his Turnberry Golf Resort in Scotland.

The president said nine windmills can be seen from the resort, where he played on Sunday.

He’s hoping Europe bans windmills.

“Today I’m playing the best course, I think, in the world, Turnberry. Even though I own it, it’s probably the best course in the world, right?” Mr. Trump told reporters as he sat among European Union leaders. “And I look over the horizon and I see nine windmills. I said, isn’t that a shame? What a shame you have the same thing all over all over Europe, in particular, you have windmills all over the place.”

Wind, and in particular offshore wind, is one of the most expensive ways to provide energy, according to analysts.

Mr. Trump signed an executive order in January prohibiting new wind projects in the United States, although ongoing projects are allowed to continue.

Mr. Trump said the turbines are noisy, harm marine life, kill birds, ruin landscapes and rust after eight years. There is nowhere to safely bury them, he said.

“Germany tried it and wind doesn’t work,” Mr. Trump said. “You need subsidies for wind energy and energy should not need subsidies.”

Many U.S. states and some European countries have turned to wind energy to help achieve a goal of net-zero carbon emissions, but wind is intermittent and has not been able to fill the gap in Europe created by closing coal and nuclear power plants.

Wind supplied more than a quarter of Germany’s electricity in 2023 but it was not enough to power the grid thanks to slower-than-typical wind speeds. A massive increase in output from gas-fired power plants was required to keep the country out of the dark. Electricity prices are higher in Germany than in any other country in Europe.",https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/07/27/Trump_Scotland_92032_c0-71-1695-1059_s1200x700.jpg?9aa0cfe699f755c20a2826c1805466334ff01e52,N,,2025-07-27 20:01:57.022779

Stickler said they had to raise about $1 billion to build Hybar and construction began in August of 2023. They didn’t hire a general contractor to construct the facility, Stickler said. The company entered into a “hybrid” construction partnership with Lexicon, a company that specializes in building steel mills.

The arrangement allowed Hybar to keep its construction costs down and allowed the company to remain in control of the mill’s construction flow, but they got the expertise of one of the leading mill construction companies in the country, he said.

Lexicon CEO Patrick Schueck said the project partnership was beneficial for both companies.

”Lexicon was honored to serve as the construction manager for Hybar’s new rebar mill,” Schueck said. “With this project marking the fifth steel mill our team has built in the region, we brought decades of industrial construction expertise to the project. From breaking ground to rolling out the first ribbed rebar, the facility was completed in approximately 22 months — an incredibly aggressive timeline for a mill of this scale and complexity. What makes this project especially significant is that it showcases how Lexicon can lead large-scale industrial builds that push the boundaries of innovation, efficiency and sustainability. Our longstanding partnership with leaders in the steel sector, including Hybar, enabled us to align construction methods with forward-looking clean energy goals and LEED certification standards.”

One of the key features of the Hybar facility is the solar array, Stickler said. The array can power the plant that takes scrap metal and melts it. The melted steel is then cast into billets and afterwards it is hot rolled and then bent into shape. The array is among the practices and technological features that make the mill one of the most energy efficient in the industry, he said.

“From a broader perspective, this facility sets a new benchmark for sustainability in the U.S. steel industry. It’s the first in North America to produce rebar using 100% solar energy — thanks to a behind-the-meter solar installation — and it reduces emissions by up to 50% compared to traditional mills,” Schueck said.

Even before Hybar began operations, Mississippi County was by volume the largest steel-producing county nationwide. In 2024, 72.3 million tons of steel was produced in the country, and about 9.5 million tons of that was produced in the county, or about 13% of the country’s steel output.

The steel mills employ about 5,000 people directly and indirectly employ almost 8,000.

Rebar is used to build many things including bridges, tunnels, high rise buildings, ports, airports, public works projects and others.

“The demand for rebar is never ending,” Stickler said.

Schueck agreed with Stickler. During the next year he expects a lot of major construction projects to unfold and the demand for steel, and specifically rebar, will be high.

“From my perspective, the outlook is quite optimistic,” Schueck said. “We’re seeing a renewed focus on domestic production, which I believe will lead to an uptick in large-scale construction projects. We’ve already had indications from major steel producers that they’re committed to expanding their capacity here in the U.S., and that’s a positive sign. The demand for infrastructure improvements and new facilities — like data centers and manufacturing plants — is strong, and I expect that to drive growth in our sector. We’re also tracking several significant projects, including chip plants, that are coming into play, and I think we’ll see more announcements in the near future.”

Two companies, Nucor and Commercial Metals Company (CMC) control about 75% of the rebar market, Stickler said. Both are in the rebar fabrication business, and that hurt independent fabrication firms, he said. For instance, if an independent fabrication firm wants to bid on a bridge project, they will go to one rebar producer to get a price. At times, some of the rebar producers will raise the price or try to outright take the project from smaller fabrication companies.

Stickler said Hybar will not get into the fabrication business and will not “squeeze” those businesses. It will, however, expand its rebar production footprint, he said.

Plans are underway to construct another rebar producing mill adjacent to the current facility, he said. Construction is slated to begin in late summer or early fall. This facility should cost about $100 million less because the site drainage work, retention pond, and heavy haul road have already been built. But inflation has been on the rise and that will impact project costs, he said.

Hybar may also build one or two other rebar mills. Sites in Georgia and South Carolina have been examined, he said.

Stickler said he’s not surprised the Mississippi County has become, by volume, the largest steel producing county in the country. Public officials have been easy to work with, the state has a regulatory atmosphere that is conducive to business, and the workforce is outstanding.

He envisions Hybar having the most efficient workforce in the industry and that will lead to more money in workers’ pockets — through higher production.

“My goal is to have the highest paid steelworkers, with the lowest labor costs — we will achieve that through higher production and efficiency,” he said.",https://talkbusiness.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Hybar1_Aug2025.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 20:02:00.403052

Harmony Energy faced renewed opposition to proposals for the Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) on land off Newton Lane, between Ledston and Allerton Bywater near Leeds.

Harmony said the development would help tackle climate change and stabilise energy supplies by storing electricity for future use.

Leeds City Council planning panel members passed a motion not to accept a recommendation from council officers to approve the application.

Earlier this month, more than 1,200 residents, along with MPs and councillors, objected to other proposals by Harmony to install 72 containers storing lithium ion batteries on farmland at Heath near Wakefield.

Leeds City Council initially refused planning permission for the Allerton Bywater proposals in November 2023 after environmental and fire safety fears were raised, along with the impact on green belt land.

A plans panel was told national planning policy changes meant the site could now be downgraded to ""grey belt"" – deemed less environmentally important.

But that was disputed by action group Save our Villages and council leader James Lewis, who represents Kippax and Methley.

Lewis told the panel: ""I don't believe this site is grey belt and therefore the harm to green belt, which this site is, should be a reason for refusal.""

Objector Adrian Appleyard said a fire at the site could see contaminated water run off in to Fairburn Ings Nature Reserve, 400m away, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.

Parry says the government should decide the details of the charge now but not impose it until electric vehicles make up at least 30 per cent of light vehicle sales and, later, heavy vehicle sales too.

“We need the certainty of knowing how the charge will work, but there is a convincing argument that it should not be imposed until EVs are better established,” he says.

In a move that experts believe could accelerate Tanzania’s transition to clean energy, researchers and senior government policymakers have sealed a collaborative pact aimed at delivering evidence-based reforms to fast-track the country's clean cooking ambition.

This initiative comes as Tanzania continues to grapple with the heavy reliance on biomass fuels for cooking—a staggering 85 percent of the population still depends on firewood and charcoal, according to government estimates.

The resulting emissions not only endanger human health but also undermine the country’s environmental and climate targets.

Speaking at a workshop hosted at the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) on July 27,2025, as part of the Inclusive Green Economy (IGE) programme, Deputy Commissioner at the ministry of Finance, Dr Remidius Ruhinduka, emphasised the urgency of this partnership.

“Energy plays a pivotal role in achieving development objectives, particularly in improving citizens’ quality of life while safeguarding the environment. If we want to reduce emissions by 2030, there must be a shared understanding between researchers and policymakers,” Dr Ruhinduka said.

The event also marked the graduation of the programme’s first cohort of civil servants, who, over the past year, have worked alongside researchers to tackle the theme of “Energy Efficiency and Reduced Emissions” under the IGE initiative. Funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), the IGE programme has been implemented since 2021 across five East African countries—Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Rwanda, and Ethiopia.

In Tanzania, it aims to build capacity within ministries and government agencies to formulate sustainable policies grounded in research and economic-environmental policy instruments.

“In the past, there was a significant gap between policymakers and researchers. Researchers had solutions, but decision-makers were unaware of them. Through IGE, we have successfully bridged this gap,” said the IGE Lead in Tanzania, Dr Aloyce Hepelwa.

According to Dr Hepelwa, this collaboration has already resulted in policy reform recommendations that will serve as catalysts for improved clean energy advocacy at household level. The ministries involved in this cycle of the programme included the Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Transport, and the Rural Energy Agency (REA).

“The aim is to promote the adoption of energy-efficient domestic appliances and identify strategies to improve policy enforcement,” Dr Hepelwa added.

The collaboration aligns with Tanzania’s broader energy reform agenda, which includes the recently launched National Energy Efficiency Strategy (2024–2034). The strategy seeks to: Enhance energy security, promote innovation, reduce poverty and mitigate climate change.

These reforms, according to Dr Ruhinduka, are essential if the country is to realise its 2030 emissions reduction targets, as committed under international climate frameworks.

Yet, despite this ambitious policy landscape, the uptake of clean cooking technologies remains low. According to experts, this is due to a combination of factors including lack of awareness, high costs, and cultural preferences.

“Even though electric cookstoves are available, many Tanzanians are unaware of their benefits. There are companies offering incentives for electricity usage, but the public response is still minimal,” noted an environmental expert from the Vice President’s Office-environment, Mr James Choyi.

Mr Choyi, who is also among the first cohort of the programme, stressed the importance of providing consumer incentives and strengthening community-level awareness to complement policy-level reforms.

Research-backed policies for vision 2050

The IGE model could serve as a blueprint for other national goals, including Tanzania’s long-term Vision 2050, which seeks to transform the country into a middle-income, climate-resilient economy.

“We have trained policymakers to use economic policy instruments to design impactful, evidence-based strategies that support economic growth without harming the environment,” Dr Hepelwa noted.

Experts argue that embedding research into every phase of policy development—from agenda-setting to evaluation—will ensure that Tanzania’s development efforts are both inclusive and sustainable.

“This partnership is not only timely, but it is critical for ensuring that our climate targets are not just political promises but achievable goals rooted in science,” said a clean energy researcher from Ardhi University, Dr Magdalena Peter.

As Tanzania continues to champion clean energy—both regionally and globally—the success of the IGE programme highlights the power of collaboration.

Stakeholders are now calling for continued funding, scale-up of the initiative, and institutionalisation of researcher-policymaker networks across all sectors.

“Our ambition is to see all policy reforms informed by data, and more importantly, designed by people who understand both the science and the systems,” concluded Dr Ruhinduka.",https://www.thecitizen.co.tz/resource/image/5133994/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/80894b82dac2d896f9401cce792b3d50/Ye/clean-energy-for-cooking-4.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 19:00:03.438851

If approved, it will influence the trajectory of renewable energy investment and policy for years to come.
Developers, investors, and manufacturers will need to adjust their expectations based on the final structure of the tax-and-spending package.","Senate Republicans introduced an amendment in July 2025 aimed at modifying key provisions within President Trump’s proposed tax-and-spending package. The amendment seeks to adjust the phase-out schedule of subsidies for wind and solar projects, as well as eliminate a proposed excise tax on components sourced from China.

The original proposal outlined by the administration included a gradual reduction in financial incentives for renewable energy over a defined timeline. However, the amendment put forward by Senate Republicans aims to soften the pace of this phase-out, allowing for continued support of the sector during a period of transition. This adjustment is intended to provide greater stability for developers and investors who rely on these subsidies to fund and execute large-scale renewable projects.

In addition to revising the subsidy phase-out, the amendment also targets a separate component of the tax-and-spending plan. The original proposal included an excise tax on solar and wind equipment manufactured in China. This measure was designed to address trade imbalances and protect domestic manufacturing interests. However, the amendment seeks to remove this excise tax entirely, signaling a shift toward a more market-oriented approach.

The proposed changes reflect a broader strategy to balance economic growth with energy policy objectives. By extending the availability of subsidies, the amendment supports the continued development of renewable energy infrastructure, which has seen significant growth in recent years. At the same time, the removal of the excise tax acknowledges the role of international supply chains in the production of critical components, many of which remain essential to the U.S. energy sector.

The amendment is currently under review and is expected to be debated as part of the larger tax-and-spending package. If approved, it will influence the trajectory of renewable energy investment and policy for years to come. The changes could also affect the competitive landscape for domestic and international suppliers, reshaping procurement decisions in the clean energy market.

Industry stakeholders have been closely monitoring the legislative developments, as the outcome will impact project planning, capital allocation, and long-term operational strategies. Developers, investors, and manufacturers will need to adjust their expectations based on the final structure of the tax-and-spending package.

The Senate’s proposed amendment underscores the ongoing evolution of U.S. energy policy and the political dynamics shaping its implementation. As the debate continues, the final version of the package will determine the extent to which subsidies are maintained and how international trade considerations are integrated into domestic energy strategy.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 19:00:06.505669

Western Power said this is an important milestone in Western Australia’s clean energy transition and phased coal exit by 2030.

The investment enables major upgrades to the northern section of the SWIS (South West Interconnected System), the electricity distribution network servicing Western Australia from Geraldton to Albany and east to Kalgoorlie.

The contracts signed with GenusPlus, UGL Engineering, and Acciona are part of a $584 million State Budget commitment for Western Power to undertake network upgrades and expansion as part of the Clean Energy Link – North program.

The Western Australian Government said it has now invested $1.6 billion in the State’s electricity network expansion.

Clean Energy Link – North includes high-capacity transmission lines, terminals, substations and transformers installed to unlock the flow of clean energy in the regions north of Perth.

The upgrade runs from Western Power’s Northern Terminal in Malaga to Three Springs.

These contracts will deliver a 26.5km overhead 132kV transmission line from Wangara to Neerabup Terminal, new 132kV and 330kV terminals and line within the existing network, including existing line conversions and upgrades.

The work also includes the design and construction of new bays and associated lines at Regans Ford, construction of a new terminal at Three Springs and upgrading the existing transmission network in and around the Northern, Neerabup and Eneabba Terminals.

The Western Australian Government said that more than 400 jobs will be created, with the upgraded transmission network able to take more renewable energy to service households and businesses.

Once complete Clean Energy Link – North is expected to make around 400MW of existing wind and another 1GW – enough to power around 500,000 homes – of new renewable energy available to customers across the SWIS and allow for more clean energy generation in the Mid-West.

This increased capacity is more than the output from the two largest state-owned coal-fired power stations (Muja D and Collie) – of just under 750MW combined.

Western Power CEO, Sam Barbaro, said the utility has undertaken extensive scoping and planning for this project, and these contracts will lay the groundwork for the next five years.

“We look forward to working with [Genus, Acciona and UGL] as they help us deliver the critical infrastructure needed to continue the transition of the network to cater for renewable energy growth towards net zero,” he said.

Western Australian Energy and Decarbonisation Minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, said strengthening and expanding Western Australia’s main electricity network is fundamental in enabling industry and households to be powered by renewable energy from the Mid-West.

Wind projects take up approximately 30,000 acres to produce the same amount of electricity as a 2,500-acre coal plant.
One example of the disadvantages of large-scale renewable energy projects is the Spotsylvania Solar Energy Center in Virginia, a solar facility that spans more than 6,300 acres, one of the largest solar projects east of the Rockies.
If renewable energy is truly the cheapest and most competitive option, why do its supporters call for lavish government support?
If wind and solar energy are the future of America’s energy sector, they should compete without the crutch of federal aid.","The recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act signals a major shift in federal energy policy. Among its provisions, the law accelerates the phase-out of tax credits for new wind and solar projects and eliminates long-term subsidies for renewable developers on public land.

The law revives a principle that should guide all energy policy: Let the best ideas win on their own merit.

Rolling back the subsidies should relieve pressure to use valuable land for solar and wind farms. Consider the direct land use involved in today’s energy sector. Wind projects take up approximately 30,000 acres to produce the same amount of electricity as a 2,500-acre coal plant. Solar is also land-intensive, requiring about 5,000 acres for equivalent output.

However, when government subsidies reduce the use of public land for renewable energy sources, investors are no longer incentivized to look at the tradeoffs of their land-use footprint.

Land is a finite and valuable resource. Using it for energy comes at the expense of other potential uses. When developers receive subsidies, they do not have to account for the value of alternative uses for the land. If an energy source requires more land, it should pay for that land.

Communities across the country are voicing concerns, objecting to large-scale wind and solar developments that disrupt local land use, strain water resources and alter rural landscapes. According to Robert Bryce’s Renewable Rejection Database, more than 800 wind and solar projects have been rejected or restricted by local governments in the United States since 2015.

One example of the disadvantages of large-scale renewable energy projects is the Spotsylvania Solar Energy Center in Virginia, a solar facility that spans more than 6,300 acres, one of the largest solar projects east of the Rockies.

Locals raised their concerns over the project’s environmental effects, particularly the clearing of 3,500 acres of forested land, which involved the removal of around a million trees. Residents feared toxic substances leaching from panels into groundwater, in addition to the heat generated by the installation of 1.8 million solar panels, manufactured by Chinese companies.

Supporters of climate-change subsidies often argue that a rapid shift to renewable energy is necessary as they believe resource depletion or environmental harm is on the horizon. Even though America still holds centuries’ worth of recoverable fossil fuels, this argument is flawed in its understanding of energy production.

Coal, oil and gas are the most efficient and profitable energy sources available. In the past 20 years, wind and solar have received global subsidies of $9 trillion.

The most recent data from the Energy Information Administration show that renewable energy sources received more than $15 billion in federal subsidies in 2024, compared to $3 billion for fossil fuels. If renewable energy is truly the cheapest and most competitive option, why do its supporters call for lavish government support?

Some argue that without such incentives, renewable energy investment will dry up. However, when the government gives special financial help to one type of energy, it makes it harder to see which energy sources are the best and most affordable. This distorts fair competition. If wind and solar energy are the future of America’s energy sector, they should compete without the crutch of federal aid.

Subsidizing large-scale land for renewable energy development raises electricity prices and uses public, taxpayer-owned lands. The result is not cleaner and more reliable energy, but misallocated resources.

Spain offers a cautionary tale. With more than half of its grid supplied by renewables and a national push toward 100% by 2050, the country suffered a 12-hour blackout on April 28. Two solar panels in southwest Spain went down, and the grid had insufficient inertia, or backup, to continue operating.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act represents more than just a shift in federal spending; it reflects a renewed commitment to competitive land use in America’s energy sector. By phasing out preferential tax treatment and below-market land deals, the law encourages energy developers to compete on merits and meet America’s rising energy demands with an approach rooted in efficiency, reliability and competition.

By anchoring a 15% tariff framework on most EU goods and securing a $750 billion energy procurement commitment from the EU, the agreement has redefined energy security, manufacturing resilience, and U.S. export opportunities. For investors, this is not merely a trade pact—it is a strategic realignment of supply chains and geopolitical priorities.

Energy: A New Era of Export Dominance

The EU's pledge to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years has transformed American energy firms into linchpins of global energy security. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporters like Cheniere Energy (LNG) and renewable energy innovators like NextEra Energy (NEE) are poised to capitalize on this demand surge. Cheniere, for instance, has seen a 22% stock price jump since the deal's announcement, reflecting investor confidence in long-term EU contracts.

The deal also accelerates the U.S. green transition. The EU's focus on green hydrogen and battery storage under its Net-Zero Industry Act aligns with American clean energy leaders. NextEra Energy is already securing EU contracts for grid-scale battery projects, while firms like Bloom Energy (BE) and Fluor Corporation (FLR) benefit from streamlined permitting for net-zero infrastructure.

However, risks persist. European energy firms such as TotalEnergies and Siemens Energy are diversifying into African and Middle Eastern markets to reduce U.S. dependency. Investors must monitor how quickly U.S. LNG terminals expand to meet EU demand and whether geopolitical tensions—such as the EU's “Anti-Coercion Instrument”—could disrupt these flows.

Manufacturing: Nearshoring and Strategic Reshoring

The EU's $600 billion investment in U.S. industry—targeting advanced manufacturing, critical infrastructure, and technology—has ignited a nearshoring boom. European firms like Siemens and ABB are relocating production to the U.S., indirectly boosting American suppliers of machinery and components. This trend is particularly evident in the defense sector, where the EU's $150 billion procurement of U.S. military equipment has reshaped supply chains.

Defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) are scaling production of hypersonic weapons and cyber defense systems. The removal of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum has lowered costs for firms like ArcelorMittal (MT) and Nucor (NUE), enhancing margins.

Yet, the quota-based trade system for critical materials introduces volatility. If the EU delays permitting or shifts procurement priorities, U.S. manufacturers could face bottlenecks. Investors should also watch the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which could impose compliance costs on U.S. exporters starting in 2026.

Trade-Sensitive Sectors: Balancing Growth and Risk

The 15% tariff framework has stabilized trade but not eliminated asymmetries. The EU's 25% tariffs on U.S. aircraft, for example, have already boosted Airbus's market share over Boeing. This imbalance could widen if the U.S. fails to address disputes in sectors like semiconductors or agriculture.

For trade-sensitive sectors, diversification is key. While the EU's procurement commitments create predictable revenue streams, over-reliance on transatlantic demand exposes firms to geopolitical shifts. Investors should prioritize companies with dual-market exposure, such as Honeywell (HON), which serves both U.S. and EU defense and industrial needs.

Immediate Action for Investors

Energy Sector: Allocate to high-growth LNG and clean energy stocks (e.g., LNG, NEE) and ETFs like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).

Manufacturing: Target defense contractors (LMT, RTX) and materials firms (MT, NUE) benefiting from EU procurement.

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-27 22:02:56+00:00,Buffalo News,New York set ambitious goals for renewable energy. Then reality set in - Buffalo News,"matt glynn, Joshua Bessex, Buffalo News",,,,,https://buffalonews.com/news/local/business/article_59e9531a-a519-419f-8633-368eb23d6975.html,"Hochul remains committed to moving the state toward greater use of renewable energy and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.
The governor on Monday directed the New York Power Authority and the Department of Public Service to develop plans for a new nuclear energy plant at an undetermined site in upstate New York.
“All major fuels currently used in New York state are projected to continue to provide meaningful volumes of energy throughout the planning period, while the contributions of clean and renewable energy sources will grow,” the plan said.
“As clean energy resources ramp up over time, the state will maintain adequate supplies of other major energy sources.” The New York Independent System Operator said the state needs to bring more renewable energy generating capacity online.
Harris said the state continues its push to add renewable sources of energy, building on the impact of projects completed in recent years.","Gov. Kathy Hochul is slowly scaling back New York’s push to reach the ambitious energy targets spelled out by the Cuomo administration in the state’s plan to slash climate-changing emissions and accelerate the use of renewable power sources.

Hochul remains committed to moving the state toward greater use of renewable energy and reducing its reliance on fossil fuels. But the state is facing challenges from expectations that the demand for electricity will soar in the coming years from the growth of data centers, big manufacturing plants and electric vehicles, and the push to heat more homes with electricity.

At the same time, there are questions about the electricity supply to meet the increased demand, which is forecast to grow by 50% to 90% over the next two decades.

The stems partly because the state’s fossil fuel-based power generating capacity is being reduced at roughly twice the rate that renewable sources of energy are coming online, according to the operator of the state’s grid.

That prompted the New York Independent System Operator to suggest in May that the state may need to upgrade some natural gas-fired power plants that had been shut down and bring them back into service to meet the growing electricity demand.

The governor on Monday directed the New York Power Authority and the Department of Public Service to develop plans for a new nuclear energy plant at an undetermined site in upstate New York. Critics, however, say adding nuclear power is the wrong direction to go.

And last month, Hochul proposed building nuclear power plants at undetermined sites in New York that could generate up to 1 gigawatt of electricity to help meet the rising demand.

Meanwhile, ratepayers are being hit with higher energy bills, making affordability a hot topic among consumers.

On top of all that, the Trump administration is phasing out existing federal incentives for wind and solar power, creating major financial hurdles for those costly projects to move forward.

A newly published draft of a state energy plan, which looks ahead to 2040, acknowledges the challenges that New York faces in meeting the state’s climate goals, while ensuring the state’s energy system remains reliable and affordable for ratepayers over the next 15 years.

“All major fuels currently used in New York state are projected to continue to provide meaningful volumes of energy throughout the planning period, while the contributions of clean and renewable energy sources will grow,” the plan said. “As clean energy resources ramp up over time, the state will maintain adequate supplies of other major energy sources.”

The New York Independent System Operator said the state needs to bring more renewable energy generating capacity online.

That includes keeping natural gas in the energy mix.

“In part, this will require continued investment in the natural gas system, including to guarantee adequate supply infrastructure to meet demands even during the coldest days and to help relieve upward pressure on gas prices that can result from infrastructure constraints,” the plan said.

Environmental groups say the Hochul administration needs to stay the course on meeting the state’s climate targets and step up its deployment of renewable energy projects.

“Unfortunately, it does not appear that the governor is prioritizing meeting our climate law mandates,” said Liz Moran, New York policy advocate for Earthjustice. “There has been a number of decisions in the past six months that indicate the governor seems to be, at best, slow-walking our climate law.”

The climate law − passed in 2019, before Hochul became governor − includes targets such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, and for 70% of the state’s electricity to be generated from renewable sources.

Upstate New York residents are facing higher electric bills – and they aren't happy about it. National Grid is seeking approval for a 15% rate hike, while New York State Electric & Gas was granted a rate increase last year that will increase its average customer's bill by 31% over three years.

The purpose of the energy plan is to assess the state of the market and how to meet the demand for energy over the next decade and a half, said Doreen Harris, president and CEO of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and chair of the Energy Planning Board.

“We will be relying on a portfolio of resources to meet that need,” Harris said. “It’s not to say that we won’t be pursuing renewable generation.”

The energy plan suggests the state might not reach the target of 70% of electricity from renewable sources until 2033, three years later than initially expected.

The New York Independent System Operator, which operates the grid, has said renewable power needs to be added at a much higher rate than fossil fuel-generated megawatts are deactivated. That is because wind and solar tend to operate at a lower percentage of their generating capacity, since they depend on favorable weather conditions to produce power.

The NYISO suggested consideration of upgrading decades-old fossil fuel facilities with better technology, to serve as a “bridge” to a grid more reliant on renewables, whose power production is limited to when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining.

Environmental groups challenged NYISO’s report in a recent letter to Hochul and state agency leaders. The groups said it was “misleading” to suggest additional fossil fuel generation was needed for reliability.

Moran said the report was based partly on forecasted load growth. “But they’re basing that on particularly unpredictable and volatile industries” such as cryptocurrency mining, data centers and AI, she said.

“The state does need to address these large energy users,” due to their massive consumption of electricity, she said. “We need to be prioritizing renewable energy, and having that energy provide electricity for homes and businesses.”

The NYISO said its report “suggests that the repowering of all aging resource types – renewable and fossil – be examined to determine the opportunity for capacity additions, efficiency, and carbon reductions. Doing so may help bridge New York to its climate goals.”

Moran said the NYISO also needs to take steps to speed up deployment of more renewable energy projects.

The state budget approved this week does not contain provisions for phasing out natural gas-powered furnaces and appliances in existing homes.

“We have over 50,000 megawatts of renewable energy that is sitting on their interconnection queue, and that process is slow due to the New York Independent System Operator’s own rules,” she said. “We need to make some changes there to ensure we can get renewables online faster.”

The NYISO said its report “provides an honest look at recent improvements to the interconnection process, acknowledged by the Alliance for Clean Energy as reducing timelines significantly.

“We continue to meet with all stakeholders, including Earthjustice, through our open governance process to identify further improvements to interconnection while also maintaining reliability of the electric grid,” the NYISO said.

Moran said the state should continue phasing out the use of natural gas, due to emissions and the costs associated with maintaining the system.

“The true energy affordability agenda would be for the governor to be doing everything in her power to meet our climate law and get more renewables and battery storage online as quickly as possible,” she said.

With only days until the April 1 budget deadline, New York lawmakers are racing to find a compromise on a climate and energy plan. The outcome will fundamentally change the state economy and daily life for millions. Here is how each of the proposals would affect your household.

Earthjustice and two other environmental law groups have sued the state on behalf of four community organizations over the slow implementation of the climate law.

Hochul introduced another dimension to the energy debate last month, when she proposed bringing online an additional 1 gigawatt of nuclear power at a location in upstate New York.

The state already has nuclear power facilities in upstate New York, but has not added nuclear capacity for decades. It is not clear how soon such a facility could be built and start generating power. A site has not even been named yet.

The poll was commissioned by New Yorkers for Affordable Energy, a coalition of utilities, business groups and labor unions. The poll focused on elements of the state's energy roadmap, which calls for transforming energy use in homes and buildings.

Nuclear power, however, is one of the most expensive sources of electricity, with a long history of huge cost overruns and environmental hazards of its own stemming from the radioactive waste it produces. But the appeal of nuclear power is that, once it’s built and operating, it provides a massive source of electricity that also is able to operate day and night with little downtime.

Harris said the state continues its push to add renewable sources of energy, building on the impact of projects completed in recent years.

“Make no mistake about it: Our commitment remains firm in this respect, and it will be a critical part of our energy mix moving forward,” she said. “In fact, if nothing else, we need to accelerate their deployment in order to capture tax credit eligibility and savings that will come from that eligibility.”

“We can’t afford to let soaring electricity bills undermine public support for renewable energy,” Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement applauding Mills for signing the bill.
Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, a local trade association, called the law “penny wise and pound foolish” and “incredibly bad news” for Maine’s solar industry.
“But one of the primary ways that can happen is by having more renewable energy on the grid in Maine and I’m very concerned that by creating an atmosphere in Maine where the Maine legislature has conveyed that renewable energy investment is not welcome here, or can not be relied on here, we have set ourselves up to not enjoy the incredible stabilizing effect that renewable energy has on energy costs.
1777 and Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” Act adds “insult to injury.” This story was originally published by The Maine Monitor, a nonprofit and nonpartisan news organization.","MAINE, USA — It would be hard to argue that Maine’s solar incentive program hasn’t been successful in spurring the development of small-scale solar projects. Since it was established in 2019, the program, formally called Net Energy Billing, has helped bring hundreds of arrays and more than 1 gigawatt of solar power onto the grid — far exceeding the program’s 750 megawatt goal.

Where community support for the program wanes is on the issue of costs, with critics arguing that NEB has become a raw deal for Maine ratepayers who have subsidized solar development to the tune of more than $200 million annually.

Enter L.D. 1777, a bill that the Maine Legislature passed with bipartisan support last month and that Democratic Gov. Janet Mills signed into law on June 27. The administration and other proponents of the measure, including lead sponsor Rep. Sophia Warren (D-Scarborough), say overhauling the NEB program is necessary to better protect ratepayers amid rising energy prices.

“We can’t afford to let soaring electricity bills undermine public support for renewable energy,” Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn said in a statement applauding Mills for signing the bill. “This new law is a responsible, forward-looking reform that ensures we can continue growing clean energy while protecting Mainers from rising electricity bills.”

But solar energy advocates and developers warn that the law, which retroactively impacts projects that have already been built or are already under construction, threatens to put Maine’s growing renewable energy sector on ice.

Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, a local trade association, called the law “penny wise and pound foolish” and “incredibly bad news” for Maine’s solar industry.

“The cost of electricity, the numbers on folks’ utility bills, we need to take those incredibly seriously and look for the many ways that those costs can be lowered,” she told The Maine Monitor.

“But one of the primary ways that can happen is by having more renewable energy on the grid in Maine and I’m very concerned that by creating an atmosphere in Maine where the Maine legislature has conveyed that renewable energy investment is not welcome here, or can not be relied on here, we have set ourselves up to not enjoy the incredible stabilizing effect that renewable energy has on energy costs. That’s incredibly disappointing.”

Among other things, the law tasks the Public Utility Commission with establishing a new credit payment structure for non-residential customers in NEB’s tariff rate program. Instead of the current structure, where rates are tied to standard utility electricity rates, they would be capped and increase at 2.25 percent annually.

When Warren introduced her bill in May, she said having the tariff rate tied to volatile natural gas and fossil fuel markets ultimately led to “unexpectedly high returns” for renewable energy developers.

“In many cases, these rates now exceed what is required for project viability and are placing an unnecessary burden on nonparticipating ratepayers,” she wrote in written testimony to her colleagues in the House.

The law also makes changes to the NEB credit program, imposing new monthly per-kilowatt fees on community solar projects ranging in size from 1 to 5 megawatts beginning next year, with larger arrays paying more to local utilities. A 1 megawatt array would pay $2,800 per month, while a 5 megawatt project would pay $30,000. The new fees do not impact projects smaller than 1 megawatt, such as household rooftop arrays.

The changes are expected to slash overall payments to existing community solar farms by approximately 20 percent and save Maine ratepayers approximately $61 million annually over the next 16 years, according to the state’s Office of the Public Advocate.

Across the board, members of MREA in the solar development space have voiced to Donoghue that L.D. 1777 will significantly impact their current projects in Maine and their future relationship with the state.

“They are likely or have already directly communicated to me that they are no longer going to look to build projects in Maine because they perceive it as too risky from a regulatory perspective,” she said.

Nexamp, a member of MREA that has dozens of community solar projects across Maine, called the law’s retroactive policy changes “a breach of economic trust” that will “permanently damage Maine’s reputation as a climate leader.”

The adoption of L.D. 1777 came as Republicans in Congress were putting the final touches on President Donald Trump’s so-called “Big, Beautiful” budget bill, which includes numerous provisions meant to stymie the nation’s buildout of renewable energy.

The federal act, which Trump signed into law days after L.D. 1777 received Mill’s signature, rapidly phases out Biden administration-era tax credits for wind and solar projects and terminates tax credits for home energy efficiency upgrades, including rooftop solar, electric heat pumps and insulation, at the end of 2025.

Together, the federal act and the new state law leave Maine’s clean energy sector in a precarious place, according to Donoghue and Kate Daniel, Northeast regional director for the Coalition for Community Solar Access, a national trade group.

“I do find that it’s been a little frustrating to hear state policymakers in Maine criticizing these federal actions when they really don’t need the help of DC to kill solar programs in the state of Maine,” Daniel said, stressing that uncertainty in the Maine market will drive clean energy investors to do business elsewhere.

As for Maine’s new, more aggressive target of achieving 100 percent clean electricity by 2040, Donoghue worries that the state now finds itself with limited options to get there.

“We’re going to be exceptionally challenged to meet those goals,” she said, adding that the combination of L.D. 1777 and Trump’s “Big, Beautiful” Act adds “insult to injury.”

Ambitious “90 deals in 90 days” goal has fallen short of expectations

Tariff uncertainty having chilling effect on capex, onshoring, private equity deals

U.S. equities resilient despite tariff tensions, but currency markets more sensitive

Tariffs pressuring U.S. consumer prices and industries such as autos

Biggest uncertainties for pharma, semiconductors, lumber . . . and China

President Trump has launched an aggressive tariff campaign as part of his broader trade war strategy, with multiple threats and approaching deadlines creating significant uncertainty in global markets. The administration initially announced sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on April 2, 2025, followed by a 90-day pause that expires July 9, 2025. However, Trump has now extended the timeline to August 1, giving countries additional negotiating room. Uncertainties abound, and are having an impact on capex, onshoring, and private equity deal-making.

The U.S.’ average effective tariff rate now stands at 15.8 per cent, its highest level since 1936 and an increase of over 13 percentage points since the beginning of Trump’s term. Specifically, Trump threatened to impose an additional 10 per cent tariff on any country aligning with the BRICS nations’ “Anti-American policies,” and doubled steel tariffs to 50% in June, which affects the EU, Japan, and Canada.

Ambitious “90 Deals in 90 Days” Goal Has Fallen Short of Expectations

Only two preliminary agreements have emerged. The United Kingdom was the first country to reach a deal in May, though details remain unclear and subject to revision. Britain still faces 10% tariffs and must comply with restrictions on Chinese supply chain involvement. Second, Vietnam recently agreed to 20% tariffs plus additional 40% duties on transshipped goods to combat Chinese circumvention.

Other trading partners like the EU, Japan, Canada, and India remain in negotiations. Germany’s Chancellor Merz warned that “time is running out,” while EU officials report progress but uncertainty about final terms.

Tariff Uncertainty Has Chilling Effect on Capex, Onshoring, Private Equity Deals

Private equity firms are holding approximately $1 trillion in assets that could have been redeployed if planned exits hadn’t stalled. A recent PwC survey found 30% of dealmakers are pausing or revising transactions due to tariff uncertainty. Planned capital expenditure surveys paint a mixed picture, with the Richmond and Empire State surveys showing sizable reductions in spending plans while Dallas and Kansas City showing slight improvements, perhaps related to energy production.

Rather than reshoring production, companies are taking a “wait-and-see” approach. While 80% of chief operating officers plan to increase supply chain onshoring over three years, only 2% have successfully completed such plans. The complexity of relocating production, especially for regulated industries like pharmaceuticals, makes immediate factory relocations unlikely even with high tariffs.

Tariffs Pressure U.S. Consumer Prices and Industries Such as Autos

Analysts estimate that tariffs have raised American consumer prices by approximately 0.2 percentage points. Some categories face extreme burdens. Electric personal-care appliances from China hit 59 per cent effective rates in late April. Offsetting the impact to consumers, U.S. tariff revenue surged almost fourfold to a record $24.2 billion in May, while Chinese imports fell 43 per cent over the last 12 months.

Notwithstanding sharp drops in U.S.-China trade, China’s overall exports are up 4.8 per cent year over year as the country redirects trade flows to other regions including Africa, Canada, ASEAN countries, and India.

The automotive industry has been caught in the tariff tiff crosshairs, and Mercedes-Benz exemplifies the industry’s challenges. The company reported global sales falling nine per cent in Q2, with U.S. revenues down 12 per cent and Chinese sales plunging 19 per cent as the company’s Alabama-built SUVs face both U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing’s retaliatory 10 per cent levy on American-made vehicles. Mercedes’ EV sales declined 24 per cent, highlighting broader Western automaker struggles in China’s BYD-dominated electric vehicle market.

U.S. Equities Resilient Despite Tariff Tensions, but Currency Markets More Sensitive

Despite the trade tensions, U.S. equity markets have shown resilience, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs as investors downplay trade risks after several instances of administration pullbacks. While the S&P traded in tandem with U.S. policy uncertainty through April, since the beginning of May equity investors have shrugged off troubling tariff news.

Currency markets have reacted more dramatically. The dollar has rebounded 0.5 per cent against major currencies in recent days, while the Australian and New Zealand dollars fell roughly one per cent due to their strong China trade relationships. However, the greenback is off to its worst start to the year in 50 years, as tariffs tend to raise prices on importers and foment disinflation among exports. The United States is the world’s largest exporter of corn, and prices fell below $4/bushel for the first time since October as farmers struggle with unsold exports.

Biggest Uncertainties for Pharma, Semiconductors, Lumber . . . and China

Looking ahead, ongoing tariff negotiations pose the biggest uncertainties to several industries: pharmaceuticals, as Ireland is a manufacturing hub; semiconductors, sourcing from Taiwan and South Korea; and lumber, affecting Canada. These industry-specific duties complicate bilateral negotiations as they target core economic sectors of major trading partners.

Meanwhile, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains tenuous, with unresolved structural issues. While China reclassified fentanyl precursors as illegal, potentially reducing some tariffs, the White House has maintained export controls on advanced chips and other technology. Trump’s planned September visit to China following Xi Jinping’s invitation could de-escalate tensions.

The World Bank and OECD have downgraded their global growth forecasts due in large part to escalating tariffs. Already, price impacts can be seen in toys, bananas, coffee and some large electrical appliances. Steel tariffs are raising costs on U.S. manufacturers and consumers, while offering domestic steel producers an opportunity to raise their prices in tandem.

Bottom Line:

Trade tariffs are, in effect, a consumption tax that tends to put downward pressure on growth and upward pressure on the prices of imported goods. Higher input costs will tend to crimp profit margins with increased tax collections providing an incremental offset. Exporters will feel deflation pressure as inventories mount. Here at home, we expect higher prices for automobiles and smart phones and lower prices on agricultural commodities, like corn, soybeans and natural gas.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/Tariff%20Tarriffs%20Trade%20Tax%20Import%20Export-248616739.jpg.webp?itok=m5y_tJXV,N,,2025-07-27 22:02:07.709233

Keeping the agency running could require them to use money that would have otherwise gone to a laboratory to test Guam water for contaminants, and a new headquarters.

Lastimoza reported earlier this month that Guam EPA stands to lose around 85% of its budget as the Trump White House looks to slash “categorical grants” from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in fiscal 2026. She said the cut would “literally eliminate” the agency’s operations.

The USEPA gives categorical grants to state and territorial governments to help comply with environmental laws that are on the books.

The White House has pointed to the cut as a way to save taxpayers $1 billion, while making jurisdictions responsible for their own programs.

“It is true that for fiscal year 2026, all categorical grants, which is basically our consolidated grant, will be eliminated,” Lastimoza told the Guam EPA board.

But she said the agency is still due about a $1.9 million allotment for fiscal 2025, which will come by the end of September.

Lastimoza said the money, which is a little more than half of the $3.4 million or $3.5 million GEPA gets annually from the grant money, will help the agency get through fiscal 2026.

Likewise, Guam EPA is still on track to get $9 million from an emerging contaminant grant meant to help the agency build a new lab and headquarters in Dededo.

Lastimoza said the program manager for Guam has agreed to use some of that $9 million to cover salaries, if it comes to it.

“However that works out, he’s willing to work with not shutting down the agency,” Lastimoza said.

Redirecting funds will require Guam EPA to either slow down building the lab and headquarters, scale down its “bells and whistles,” or not proceed at this time, she said.

There’s already a contract out for architectural and design work for the building, meant for construction at the old Dededo solid waste transfer station, the Pacific Daily News has reported.

Lastimoza said getting the design work done will still get Guam EPA a “shovel-ready” project whenever funding becomes available.

The lab the $9 million is meant to pay is expected to improve Guam EPA’s ability to test drinking water for emerging contaminants, chemicals that were only recently classified as toxic or discovered in water supplies.

Lastimoza said renovating Guam EPA’s current facilities, which belong to the airport and are close to being condemned, is not an option.

Other potential sources of revenue include use taxes, the administrator added.

Guam EPA by law gets 20% of use tax collections, which historically amounts to $60 million a year, Lastimoza said.

That translates to about $12 million annually for Guam EPA but the money goes directly into the Guam EPA Environmental Cleanup Fund to cover costs for preserving natural resources.

Vice Speaker Tony Ada’s Bill 8-38 would shift that money so that Guam EPA can hire employees, but Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero vetoed the bill in June.

The governor’s veto message took issue with the timing of the bill, which requires a detailed plan from Guam EPA for the money, and said it couldn’t go into effect until fiscal 2026.

Lastimoza on Thursday said if Guam EPA needs to, it will ask lawmakers to appropriate money out of the General Fund to keep operations running.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/guampdn.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/c2/bc2d81d6-a66a-59de-ad37-9a3d6bcceeca/60ee4c74e6182.image.jpg?crop=1803%2C947%2C0%2C101&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-27 18:01:08.524050

cleveland.com (TNS)

COLUMBUS — If your electricity bill feels unusually steep this summer, rising temperatures aren’t the only reason.

A record-breaking auction in the wholesale electricity market last year set higher prices for future supply. Ohioans saw increases that averaged 10%-15%, according to the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council.

And another financial heatwave is on the horizon.

Earlier this week, PJM Interconnection — Ohio’s regional grid operator—released the results of its latest capacity auction. Prices jumped 22% from last year’s record, hitting the maximum allowed rate of $329.17 per megawatt-day.

These new costs will appear on electric bills in June 2026, with expected increases of 1.5% to 5%.

The price hike isn’t just about hot summers. It’s tied to a sharp rise in electricity demand, fueled by the growth of data centers and artificial intelligence.

A February report from the Ohio Business Roundtable projected the state’s energy needs could climb 50% over the next decade.

Without more power generation, the report warned, Ohio could face brownouts, higher bills, and missed opportunities for economic growth.

Blame the auction, not the AC

It’s easy to blame the air conditioning when your power bill goes up in the summer. But this year, there’s more going on behind the scenes.

PJM formed in the late 1950s when utilities in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland joined to expand an integrated power pool.

Today, PJMmanages the power grid for 13 states, including Ohio, and each year it holds an auction to make sure there’s enough electricity available in the future.

Think of PJM like an air traffic controller for the electric grid.

It directs electricity from hundreds of power plants, plans for weather events, sets wholesale prices, and ensures your lights turn on every time you flip a switch.

One of its most important tools is the annual capacity auction, which sets the price utilities must pay to guarantee backup power is available three years ahead.

That includes having enough energy on hand for peak times, like hot summer afternoons.

PJM says capacity costs typically make up a small share of what you pay. But last year’s record-breaking auction pushed Ohio electric bills up by 10% to 15%.

This week’s auction could add another 5% starting in June 2026.

Stuck in the queue

Experts say these price spikes are happening because PJM isn’t approving new power plants fast enough. Since 2014, only 7% of proposed projects have actually made it onto the grid.

“It’s very easy for your eyes to glaze over because the details are excruciating,” said Abraham Silverman, a research scholar at Johns Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute. “But it’s really important to realize that the queue is the graduating class of seniors who are going to take the jobs from those of us who are retiring.”

In other words, the new generation of energy projects — solar farms, wind turbines, and natural gas plants — needs to step in as older coal and gas plants retire. When those new resources get stuck waiting for approval, the entire grid has fewer options to keep prices low.

“The reason it makes such a difference,” Silverman added, “is they are the greatest way of decreasing prices.”

Advanced Energy United Director John Gordon said 95% of the projects in PJM’s queue are renewable energy projects. Some have been waiting on their approval for six years.

The long delays have forced a few power developers to withdraw their projects altogether as building costs, business plans, and market conditions have shifted in the years they’ve spent waiting.

“It’s really just tragic, frankly, that this massive resource has been held up,” Gordon said.

That backlog has also raised eyebrows at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

“It takes [PJM] twice as long as what’s required,” said Clara Summers, campaign manager with Consumers for a Better Grid. “This price spike was avoidable and should never have happened.”

Forecasting the future

While PJM’s backlog is slowing down the supply of new energy, local utility companies are adding pressure from the other side of the equation—by raising the amount of power they say customers will need.

Before utilities can buy future electricity through PJM’s auction, they have to predict how much power their customers will need three years from now.

These predictions are called load forecasts, and they play a major role in how PJM calculates its prices.

“Consumers are on the hook for paying for this future demand,” Summers said. “It’s really important to get the forecast right.”

One of the biggest challenges is figuring out how to account for data centers.

The massive buildings store and process information for things like cloud services, artificial intelligence, and social media.

These centers use huge amounts of electricity, and utilities often include proposed data centers in their forecasts.

“Too often a proposed data center is included in a utility’s load forecast even if it has little chance of being built,” Summers said.

There’s a difference, in her opinion, between a company that has expressed interest in building a data center and one that has put down money.

“Only one of those is reasonable to include,” Summers said. “Sometimes there are five to 10 times more than the number that will actually be built.”

When PJM uses these load forecasts in its auction, it can lead to higher prices. And when auction prices go up, so do customer bills.

Political power struggle

Not everyone agrees with how PJM is handling the rising cost of electricity.

The debate is increasingly political, especially between states that export energy and those that rely on importing it.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro negotiated a price cap in this year’s auction to keep prices from climbing even higher. Without that cap, PJM says electricity costs could have hit nearly $389 per megawatt-day—an 18% jump beyond the new price.

Pennsylvania can make demands of PJM because it produces more electricity than it uses.

But some Ohio lawmakers believe that gives Shapiro too much power.

Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman has said the price cap undermines free-market principles and could put Ohio at a disadvantage.

Huffman has even floated the idea of Ohio leaving PJM altogether and joining a different regional grid operator called MISO, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator.

“If that’s going to be how PJM acts,” he said, “we need to consider, do we want to be part of a non-free market system?”",https://www.limaohio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/135137909_web1_Electricity.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 18:00:57.327500

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

The new deadline: New Year’s Eve 2025.

The huge tax-and-spending package known as the “Big Beautiful Bill” stripped away federal funding on most initiatives aimed at improving energy efficiency and combatting climate change. That includes consumer tax credits for electric vehicles (they now expire Sept. 30), home energy improvements and tax incentives for building utility-scale solar and wind power projects.

For homeowners planning energy-related improvements, from adding insulation to replacing major systems, there are just months left to act. Any items eligible for the credit must be installed by the Dec. 31 deadline.

There are no income limits on seeking these tax credits. They can be claimed for a number of energy-saving improvements to a primary residence.

The credits are non-refundable dollar-for-dollar reductions in income tax liability, which means they can reduce one’s tax bill to zero but any remaining credit wouldn’t be refunded to the taxpayer or carried over to future years.

So, how can they be used and what are they worth?

Up to $3,200

The tax credits are worth 30 percent of the cost of improvements, but with different rules and maximum credits for different things. Altogether, the most that can be claimed for energy efficiency improvements is $3,200.

The largest credit, up to $2,000, is for installing a qualifying heat pump or heat pump water heater.

All those tax credits listed above add up to thousands of dollars, but remember that the maximum that can be claimed is $1,200, plus up to $2,000 more for the separate heat pump tax credit.

You may also have noticed the word “qualified” keeps popping up. All of the improvements that can result in a tax credit must meet efficiency standards, such as Energy Star’s “most efficient” rating for windows, or the 2023 International Energy Conservation Code standards for insulation.

Those can be looked up on irs.gov, and check with your installer.

Thinking of installing solar panels, geothermal heating or a battery storage system? Those separate 30 percent federal tax credits now have an end-of-year deadline, too.

For electric vehicle chargers, those must be placed in service by June 30 next year to claim up to $1,000 of the cost as a tax credit.

Remember that the things I’ve just outlined are only the federal tax credits. Utility companies also may offer incentives for energy efficiency improvements, so check with yours.

This twenty-year partnership seeks to address the growing energy demands of Meta’s data centers and artificial intelligence (AI) operations. The deal marks a significant step as Meta becomes one of the first tech giants to directly engage with an existing nuclear power facility, the Clinton Clean Energy Center. This collaboration is set to provide a substantial portion of the electricity needed to power Meta’s expansive digital services, including Facebook and Instagram, as well as its evolving AI tools.

The Power of Nuclear Energy in the Digital Age

As the digital world expands, the need for large-scale, reliable energy infrastructure becomes increasingly critical. Meta’s partnership with the Clinton Clean Energy Center signifies a strategic approach to meeting this demand through nuclear energy. The Clinton facility will increase its output from 1,121 megawatts to 1,151 megawatts, an enhancement that underscores the potential of nuclear energy to support technological advancements. This increase of 30 megawatts is estimated to power approximately 800,000 households in the United States, showcasing the extensive reach and impact of such energy solutions.

Other tech companies are also turning to nuclear energy. Google, for instance, has entered into agreements involving small nuclear reactors, while Microsoft plans to revitalize the Three Mile Island plant. These decisions reflect a growing trend among tech firms to secure robust energy sources that can sustain the rapid growth of AI and other digital innovations. By investing in nuclear power, these companies are not only ensuring the continuity of their operations but also contributing to a more sustainable energy future.

Economic and Environmental Implications

The agreement between Meta and Constellation Energy is not just about powering data centers; it also has significant economic and environmental implications. The Clinton plant benefits from Illinois’s zero-emission credits program, which incentivizes low-carbon energy production. This program, however, is set to expire in 2027. Post-expiration, Meta will continue to provide financial support through its energy agreement, aiding in the renewal of the plant’s operating license and ensuring the continued contribution of nuclear energy to the state’s grid.

Environmentally, nuclear energy offers a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, which is crucial in the fight against climate change. By supporting nuclear facilities, Meta and other tech giants are playing a pivotal role in reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices. This shift towards nuclear power could serve as a model for other industries seeking to balance energy demands with environmental responsibilities.

The Role of Tech Giants in Shaping Energy Policy

Meta’s involvement in nuclear energy is indicative of a larger trend where tech companies are increasingly influencing energy policy and infrastructure. According to Urvi Parekh, Meta’s Head of Energy, the certainty of operational continuity is a significant concern for utilities, making these partnerships vital. The collaboration with Constellation Energy could inspire other companies to invest in existing nuclear infrastructure, ensuring reliability and sustainability for future data center operations.

Joe Dominguez, CEO of Constellation, expressed the company’s ongoing discussions with potential clients nationwide, highlighting the broader implications of Meta’s lead in this area. By investing in operational nuclear facilities, tech companies can secure stable energy supplies while supporting the longevity and modernization of critical infrastructure. This proactive approach not only benefits the companies but also bolsters the local economies and communities dependent on these energy plants.

Local Impact and Job Security

The partnership between Meta and Constellation Energy extends beyond energy production; it also plays a crucial role in securing jobs and economic stability for local communities. Bobby Wendell, a union representative, emphasized the importance of maintaining a stable work environment at the Clinton plant. For many employees, the continued operation of the plant ensures job security and economic prosperity, which are vital to both the workforce and the surrounding community.

The support from tech giants like Meta provides a lifeline for these facilities, enabling them to continue operations and contribute to the local economy. As the demand for energy grows, the involvement of major corporations in sustaining energy infrastructure becomes even more critical. This partnership highlights the interconnectedness of technological advancement, energy sustainability, and community well-being.

As Meta sets a precedent in the tech industry with its nuclear energy agreement, the future of energy consumption for digital enterprises appears poised for transformation. While the benefits are evident, it raises important questions about the role of technology in shaping energy policy and the balance between innovation and sustainability. How will these developments influence global energy strategies, and what further steps will tech companies take to ensure a sustainable future?

The next phase of this trade relationship will unfold as the EU's Clean Industrial Deal and U.S. industrial policies converge.","The U.S.-EU trade deal finalized in July 2025 marks a seismic shift in transatlantic economic relations, with far-reaching implications for American energy and industrial sectors. At its core, the agreement hinges on two transformative commitments: the EU's pledge to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy over the next three years and a $600 billion investment in U.S. industry. These figures are not mere numbers—they represent a recalibration of global trade dynamics, driven by geopolitical necessity and economic strategy. For investors, the deal opens a window of opportunity in sectors poised to benefit from this unprecedented alignment of transatlantic interests.

Energy Sector: A Windfall for U.S. Producers

The EU's $750 billion energy purchase is a direct response to its urgent need to reduce reliance on Russian gas. This commitment is structured around two pillars: liquefied natural gas (LNG) and nuclear fuel. The EU has agreed to a $250 billion annual procurement of U.S. LNG, totaling $750 billion over Trump's second term. This shift is already reshaping the U.S. energy landscape.

LNG Exporters as Key Winners

Companies like Cheniere Energy (LNG) and Sempra Energy (SRE) stand to gain significantly. The removal of EU retaliatory tariffs and the establishment of long-term contracts create a stable revenue stream for these firms. For example, Cheniere's Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi terminals are now prioritized in EU procurement plans, ensuring capacity utilization rates near 100% for the foreseeable future.

Nuclear Fuel and Renewable Synergies

Beyond LNG, the EU's commitment to U.S. nuclear fuel and green energy infrastructure is equally compelling. The EU's Net-Zero Industry Act, which mandates 40% of clean energy components be sourced locally, aligns with U.S. firms like NextEra Energy (NEE) and Vestas Wind Systems (VWS). These companies are expanding their European footprints through green hydrogen and battery storage projects. The EU's decarbonization goals, paired with the Trump-EU deal's tariff reductions, create a fertile ground for U.S. renewable energy firms to scale operations in Europe.

Industrial Sectors: A $600 Billion Infusion

The EU's $600 billion investment in U.S. industry is a strategic move to bolster American manufacturing, technology, and infrastructure. This influx of capital is expected to flow into sectors critical to both economies: semiconductors, advanced manufacturing, and industrial electrification.

Semiconductors and Advanced Manufacturing

The EU's investment will likely target U.S. firms under the CHIPS and Science Act, such as ASML (ASML) and Intel (INTC). By reducing EU tariffs on U.S. semiconductor equipment to zero, the deal removes a major barrier for American firms seeking to expand their European operations. Additionally, the EU's procurement of $150 billion in U.S. military and industrial goods will drive demand for defense contractors like Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX).

Industrial Electrification and Grid Modernization

The EU's Clean Industrial Deal, announced in February 2025, complements the trade agreement by accelerating electrification and grid upgrades. U.S. firms involved in grid infrastructure, such as Siemens Energy (SIEGY) and General Electric (GE), are well-positioned to benefit from EU-funded projects. The EU's $1 billion Industrial Decarbonisation Facility will further support U.S. clean energy technology deployments in Europe.

Risks and Strategic Considerations

While the deal presents immense opportunities, investors must remain vigilant. The EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, a retaliatory tool beyond tariffs, could disrupt market access if trade tensions resurface. Additionally, the EU's decarbonization goals may reduce long-term demand for fossil fuels, including U.S. LNG.

To mitigate these risks, a diversified approach is prudent. Investors should consider industrial conglomerates like 3M (MMM) or Honeywell (HON), which operate across multiple sectors and geographies. For the energy sector, hedging with renewable energy ETFs like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) can balance exposure to both fossil fuel and clean energy transitions.

Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Transatlantic Trade

The Trump-EU Trade Deal is more than a political achievement—it is a catalyst for economic transformation. By securing the EU's $750 billion energy purchase and $600 billion investment, the U.S. has positioned itself at the center of a new energy and industrial era. For investors, the key lies in identifying firms that align with these strategic priorities: U.S. LNG exporters, renewable energy leaders, and industrial innovators. As the EU pivots toward energy security and decarbonization, the U.S. energy and industrial sectors are set to reap the rewards of this historic agreement.

The next phase of this trade relationship will unfold as the EU's Clean Industrial Deal and U.S. industrial policies converge. Investors who act decisively now will find themselves at the forefront of a transatlantic economic renaissance.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 18:00:52.647976

The Trump administration is moving to rescind the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) 2009 “endangerment finding,” a cornerstone of federal climate policy. The finding declared greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, a danger to human health and welfare, providing the basis for numerous regulations on emissions from cars, power plants, and industries.

READ: Gaza’s Starvation: US House Speaker Johnson Points Finger At Hamas, Despite IDF Reports

Led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, the EPA’s draft proposal argues the agency overstepped its legal authority in issuing the finding. This action directly challenges the interpretation of the Clean Air Act, a statute that critics argue was never intended to regulate CO2.

The administration’s move also leverages the Supreme Court’s recent decision to do away with the Chevron Deference, which previously compelled courts to defer to agency interpretations of federal law.

If successful, revoking the finding would significantly limit the federal government’s ability to regulate carbon emissions. This move is expected to face strong opposition and legal challenges from climate advocacy groups, who maintain that climate change impacts have only worsened since 2009.

However, the administration frames this as a necessary step to curb regulatory overreach and allow market forces to drive energy and climate solutions, emphasizing concerns about rising energy costs and grid reliability under current policies.

The impending legal battle will determine the future scope of federal climate regulation in the U.S.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

It hums mellow on top of our homes/unfastens softly listlessly upon our streets navigates noiselessly along beneath the farmland grounds a mile removed. This Energy Revolution is called green energy — and it is quickly changing how we live, work, travel and dream.

From Sunlight to Switchboards

Enter a well-designed home today and there is a faint but strong shift that you will feel. Solar panels shimmy with pride-cum-sustainability on the building roofs, sending clean energy into the kitchen, the bedroom and other corners. Smart meters minute by minute keep count of each unit of energy and on we need to think carefully. The era of mindless consumption of power is over, and the era of mindful consumption has come. It is due to the strong government efforts and the rise in knowledge about climate facts that solar energy has finally ceased to be a luxury. It is a way of life.

Mobility, Reimagined

Silent hum of electric motors is taking over roaring engines on our roads. Schoolchildren are transported by e-rickshaws, urban highways are glided by electric buses and electric charging points appear as green points at malls and parking spaces. The EV (electric vehicle) tsunami is not on its way, but it has already hit the shores, and it is accelerating. Things used to be considered futuristic are now becoming a part of our morning commute. EVs are taking over the pace of the city powered by clean grids and anchored by tech.

Empowering the Grassroots

This is not a change that is limited to sky lines of the cities. Green energy is being installed in heartland India and brightening villages where power used to flicker off -- or not show up at all. Microgrids in the form of solar power supply are used in classrooms, clinics, and community centers. Without any dependence on diesel prices and fuel panic, farmers continue to water their farms using solar-powered pumps. Renewable energy is an opportunity to many, and yet not merely an environmental solution since it leads to opportunities, education, and empowerment.

Innovation at Every Turn

There is the bio energy plant which turns kitchen waste to cooking gas on the one hand, and windows which act as solar panels on the other, innovation is blossoming. Entrepreneurs and start ups are building green solutions out of ideas that can be scaled. The green collar army of installers, technicians, energy auditors is expanding, generating good jobs in the back-yards around the nation. India is at the perfect position to spearhead this green revolution as it has the blend of ancient wisdom and the latest technology.

A Greener Rhythm of Life

Green energy is not all about watts and volts. It is all about embracing more respect towards the earth by adopting a mellower pace, one that looks forward. It is about generating power in homes instead of polluting rivers, and in commuting instead of casting a haze in the sky. It is all about compassion, self-sufficiency and reconnecting people and the environment.

The Road Ahead

Naturally, there are problems on the way. The technologies of storage, energy equity, and infrastructure remain to be addressed. But the trend is obvious and cannot be turned back. Since green energy moves in silently and revolutionizes our everyday lives, it also changes the vision of progress: greener air, less noisy towns, stronger friendly communities, and a planet that heaves a bit easier. Therefore, the next time your ceiling fan hums on a sunny afternoon or your EV passes a petrol station, just stop and figure it out, you are not consuming energy. This is how you are creating the future.

In the first half of the year, US EV sales hit a record of 607,000 but declined in the second quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book.
A GM spokesman said the new investment will create more jobs there, though the company is not putting a number on staffing yet.","(Bloomberg) —

General Motors Co. and LG Energy Solution plan to add more battery production lines at their joint venture plant in Tennessee to make lower-cost cells starting in late 2027, the companies said in a statement Monday. The amount of the investment was not disclosed.

The Ultium Cells LLC plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, will begin to make lower-cost lithium iron phosphate batteries, or LFP, in addition to more-expensive and longer-range nickel-based batteries. The new LFP batteries will enable GM to make more lower-priced electric vehicles.

The news comes as most automakers are pulling back on electric vehicle investments in the US market. EV sales in the US have slowed and President Donald Trump’s tax bill cuts the $7,500 federal tax incentive for battery-powered models in September.

But GM remains committed to EVs. After spending $35 billion to develop its Ultium battery platform and a dozen models, Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra sees electric drive as the long-term future and a near-term way to win over buyers as other automakers back off.

In the first half of the year, GM’s EV sales more than doubled to more than 78,000 as its $35,000 Chevrolet Equinox EV sold near 28,000. This is the low-priced EV’s first year of full production.

GM may be a lone bright spot in the market. In the first half of the year, US EV sales hit a record of 607,000 but declined in the second quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. Tesla Inc. sales are on pace for their second annual decline.

Barra hired former Tesla Inc. executive Kurt Kelty to rethink GM’s battery strategy. With him running the energy storage operations, GM has invested in LFP technology, different cell shapes that can store more energy on board and another chemistry called lithium manganese rich batteries that the company believes will lower EV costs and give drivers satisfactory driving range.

Rival Ford Motor Co. has pulled back from EVs. The company scrapped plans for a three-row electric sport utility vehicle and pivoted toward hybrids and other vehicles that still run with a gasoline engine on board.

The Ultium Cells Spring Hill plant currently employs about 1,300 people. A GM spokesman said the new investment will create more jobs there, though the company is not putting a number on staffing yet.

The bloc has agreed to purchase $750 billion of American energy and invest $600 billion into the US beyond current levels while the US imposes a 15% tariff on most goods being imported from the EU.

The US president revealed the deal shortly after meeting with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Trump Turnberry resort in Scotland.

“I think it’s the biggest deal ever made,” Trump said.

“I think we both wanted to make a deal,” the president added. “It’s going to bring us closer together. I think this deal will bring us very close together.”

Part of the agreement also involves the EU to “purchase a vast amount of military equipment” from the US. Trump noted that “We don’t know what that number is” yet.

After making the deal, Von der Leyen and Trump both shook hands.

“The starting point was an imbalance — a surplus on our side and a deficit on the US side,” Von der Leyen said when asked about Trump’s concessions. “And we wanted to rebalance the trade relation, and we wanted to do it in a way that trade goes on between the two of us across the Atlantic.”

Previously, Trump had threatened to place a 30% tariff rate against the EU if they failed to reach a deal with the US.

Von der Leyen had went to Scotland with the purpose of meeting with Trump and working out a trade deal. Both parties put the odds of coming to an agreement at 50% an hour before announcing the deal.

Before announcing the deal, Trump said that “pharmaceuticals won’t be part” of the deal as his administration is creating a more aggressive approach in that sector.

During their post-meeting press conference, Von der Leyen called Trump a “tough negotiator and dealmaker.” Trump interjected adding “and fair.”

During a gaggle with reporters on Sunday, Trump said he has no intention of delaying the Aug. 1 tariffs deadline a third time.

So far, Trump has made preliminary tariff deals with the UK, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia and the Philippines.

He also has a variety of tariffs in place now, including a 25% rate on automobiles, aluminum and steel as well as 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico.

Following years of heavy investment in green energy, many energy experts expect that China might even achieve peak emissions ahead of schedule.
In 2024, China’s primary coal mining region, Shanxi, produced around 1.27 billion tonnes of coal, which is more than that of India.
However, thanks to the government’s rapid renewable energy rollout, the country is growing to rely less on coal and is developing its green energy sector.
Several other companies have also established operations in Shanxi to support the transition from a coal region to a renewable energy hub.","China’s coal hubs are some of the biggest in the world, with the Asian country having long relied on the fossil fuel for power and industry. However, some of these regions are now being transformed into green energy hubs, as China gradually reduces its reliance on coal in favour of renewable alternatives. One such region is Shanxi in the North of China.

In 2023, China produced around 4.71 billion tonnes of coal from over 3,000 mines. Coal is China’s biggest source of carbon emissions. However, with China pledging to achieve peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030, and to net-zero carbon emissions by 2060, the government is gradually closing its coal mines as the country expands its renewable energy capacity. Following years of heavy investment in green energy, many energy experts expect that China might even achieve peak emissions ahead of schedule.

In 2024, China’s primary coal mining region, Shanxi, produced around 1.27 billion tonnes of coal, which is more than that of India. If Shanxi were a country, it would be the second-biggest coal producer in the world, after China. However, thanks to the government’s rapid renewable energy rollout, the country is growing to rely less on coal and is developing its green energy sector. China is developing more wind and solar power than the rest of the world combined, and its wind and solar power generation soared to almost 1,500 GW in April, exceeding its fossil fuel output.

In Shanxi, around one in ten people work in the coal and related industries. There are fears that as China shuts down its coal mines, many people in the province will be left unemployed. More than 1.7 million coal-related jobs are expected to be cut by 2030. In anticipation of the dramatic hit to the job market, Shanxi is developing other economic sectors, such as tourism and clean energy.

By the end of 2024, Shanxi had a total installed clean energy capacity of 61.89 GW, which is around the same as that of the United Kingdom. Over half of it came from solar power, which reached 34.8 GW last year. In Shanxi's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for renewable energy development, the province set a target of a cumulative 30 GW wind capacity and 50 GW solar PV capacity in operation by the end of 2025, which is aimed at diversifying the province’s energy mix.

LONGi, one of China’s largest solar power companies, launched a solar panel factory in Datong in 2022, which employs over 160 people, with over half of its employees coming from the coal industry.

Several other companies have also established operations in Shanxi to support the transition from a coal region to a renewable energy hub. Meijin Energy, in Shanxi’s capital Taiyuan, is one of China’s largest private coke companies, with the capacity to process over 6 million tonnes of coal each year, and 11 million tonnes of coke. In recent years, Meijin has expanded its portfolio to include hydrogen, which is a byproduct of the coking process and can be used to fuel vehicles. Meijin now produces around 1,500 tonnes of hydrogen a year, much of which is used to power its transport. Previously, the excess hydrogen was burnt or discarded, which contaminated he air. However, the company has seen the potential of supporting the energy revolution in the region.

In 2024, the Chinese firm Shanxi International Energy Group signed a deal with a local government in northern China to produce 350,000 tonnes a year of green aviation fuel produced from wind-powered hydrogen, according to local reports. The $1.48 billion project is expected to include 1 GW of new off-grid wind power, which will be used to produce green hydrogen to be combined with sequestered carbon dioxide to produce e-kerosene, which is chemically identical to conventional jet fuel.

The project is expected to be developed over two phases. The first phase includes the development of 300 MW of wind power to produce 100,000 tonnes of green kerosene a year, and the second includes a further 700 MW of wind energy capacity, for a fuel output of 250,000 tonnes.

There is also international interest in diversifying China’s energy mix and helping the Asian country reduce its reliance on coal to support a global green transition. In 2019, the World Bank Group launched a $350 million project aimed at accelerating “Shanxi’s transition to a lower coal consumption and more diversified economy, and provide alternative employment opportunities, thereby mitigating global climate change and improving air quality.”

There is significant potential for China’s Shanxi province to transition away from a reliance on coal to renewable alternatives in the coming years. However, the closure of many coal mines will likely lead to significant job losses across the region. China could mitigate the risk of widespread unemployment in Shanxi by investing heavily in a just transition, training workers in the coal industry to take up roles in other energy sectors as the province expands its renewable energy capacity.

Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change.","NEW YORK (AP) — When world leaders, diplomats, business leaders, scientists and activists go to Brazil in November for the United Nations’ annual climate negotiations, poverty, deforestation and much of the world’s troubles will be right in their faces — by design.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

One theme that seems to recur in that history is BPA’s desire for dominance and control. In 1976 BPA sought congressional approval for unfetter authority to acquire and market new energy. Congress, however, granted a more constrained authority.

BPA’s recent decision to join Market + seems inexplicable. Their other alternative, energy market EDAM, offers advantages on cost, reliability, integration of renewable energy resources, and environmental impacts. What could explain BPA’s preference?

Here’s the essential fact: Without BPA participation, the Arkansas based Markets+ is probably not a viable project. BPA owns 75 percent of Northwest transmission. Without that transmission Markets+ would have very limited ability to deliver or receive energy from Northwest participants such as Puget Sound Energy and Snohomish PUD. Without strong participation by Northwest entities and access to their hydropower, Markets+ would be too limited to succeed.

Bonneville knows that their participation is a life-or-death matter for Markets+, as does the market’s organizer, the Southwest Power Pool. This gives BPA a degree of leverage they could not hope to have as part of EDAM. BPA has been lured away from what would most benefit our region so it can be a big fish in a small pond rather than share the advantages of a bigger pond with other big fish.

By slashing tariffs and unlocking $600 billion in EU investments in U.S. industry, the agreement has created a tailwind for companies exposed to European demand. While skepticism remains about the EU's ability to fulfill its financial commitments, the immediate stabilization of trade tensions and the removal of retaliatory threats have already triggered a re-rating of energy and industrial equities. For investors, this presents a rare opportunity to identify high-conviction stocks poised to capitalize on the new trade framework.

Energy Sector: LNG and Renewable Infrastructure as Winners

The EU's pivot to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) and its push for green energy infrastructure have made energy stocks a focal point. Cheniere Energy (LNG) stands out as a direct beneficiary. With the EU seeking to diversify away from Russian gas and stabilize its energy supply, U.S. LNG exporters are in a strong position to secure long-term contracts. The trade deal's tariff reductions on U.S. energy exports further enhance profitability for companies like Cheniere, which operates terminals in Texas and Louisiana.

Renewable energy firms are also gaining traction. NextEra Energy (NEE), the largest U.S. clean energy producer, is expanding its footprint in Europe through green hydrogen and battery storage projects. The EU's Net-Zero Industry Act, which mandates 40% of clean energy components be sourced locally, aligns with NextEra's expertise in solar and wind infrastructure. Investors should monitor Vestas Wind Systems (VWS), a Danish turbine manufacturer with growing U.S. demand, as the trade deal eases restrictions on cross-border green technology trade.

Industrial Sector: Steel, Aluminum, and Manufacturing Resilience

The U.S. steel and aluminum industries, long plagued by EU tariffs, are set to benefit from the deal's quota-based system. ArcelorMittal (MT) and Nucor (NUE), two of the largest U.S. steel producers, have already begun restructuring supply chains to mitigate trade risks. The removal of 50% tariffs on EU steel and aluminum imports will reduce production costs and improve competitiveness for these firms.

Moreover, the EU's $150 billion procurement of U.S. military equipment and industrial goods has created a surge in demand for defense and manufacturing companies. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon Technologies (RTX) are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, given their dominance in defense contracts and their ability to scale production for European markets.

Tariff Stabilization and Market Re-Rating

The trade deal's success lies in its ability to eliminate the “tariff discount” embedded in European export stocks. For instance, the Stoxx Europe 600 Autos index, trading at a 42.6% discount to fair value, could see a valuation rebound if retaliatory measures are averted. U.S. investors should consider Stellantis (STLA), which has a hybrid U.S.-EU production model, as a speculative play on tariff normalization.

Renewable energy ETFs like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) have already outperformed broader markets, reflecting investor confidence in decarbonization trends. However, the sector's long-term success will depend on the EU's ability to meet its $600 billion investment pledge—a target that remains unproven but structurally aligned with U.S. manufacturing priorities.

Risks and Strategic Considerations

While the trade deal offers optimism, investors must remain cautious. The EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument—a retaliatory tool beyond tariffs—could still disrupt market access for U.S. firms if trade tensions resurface. Additionally, the EU's decarbonization goals may reduce long-term demand for fossil fuels, including U.S. LNG.

For a balanced approach, consider hedging with diversified industrial conglomerates like 3M (MMM) or Honeywell (HON), which operate across multiple sectors and geographies. These firms are less exposed to trade volatility while still benefiting from the EU's procurement commitments.

Investment Thesis and Recommendations

High-Conviction Buys:

Cheniere Energy (LNG): Direct exposure to EU LNG demand and tariff reductions.

NextEra Energy (NEE): Leadership in renewable energy with EU green hydrogen partnerships.

ArcelorMittal (MT): Benefiting from EU tariff easing and industrial demand.

Speculative Plays:

Stellantis (STLA): Hybrid production model with EU exposure.

Vestas Wind Systems (VWS): Renewable infrastructure growth in the U.S.

Defensive Holdings:

iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN): Diversified exposure to renewable energy trends.

3M (MMM): Resilient industrial conglomerate with low trade sensitivity.

The U.S.-EU trade deal is not a panacea, but it has created a stable environment for energy and industrial sectors to thrive. By focusing on companies with strong EU demand, tariff resilience, and alignment with green energy transitions, investors can position themselves to capitalize on this pivotal moment in transatlantic trade.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 15:03:30.259174

On one hand, politicians in Wyoming are delighted that the Project 2025-inspired “Big Beautiful Bill” will enhance support via tax breaks for the state’s faltering fossil fuel industry. Ironically, the same politicians are also a bit pissy that wind and solar — the cheapest and fastest-growing energy sector in the state and nation — are under real threat of collapse.

Wyoming generates about 10,200 megawatts of electricity from all sources, according to state and federal data. Nearly one-third comes from wind and solar, and one megawatt is enough electricity to power about 750 homes. More than half the electrons generated in the state are exported to customers outside Wyoming’s borders.

The upcoming loss of tax credits will have statewide effects due to the demise of hundreds of electrical power sector projects and the long-term consequences of that industry vacuum.

Many Wyoming politicians are wary of coming face-to-face with their constituents, who’ll be paying higher electricity bills.

“While the new policies are a step backward, the combination of surging demand for electric power and economic benefits of renewable energy technologies ensure that clean power will continue to play a significant and growing role in our nation’s energy mix,” American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet insists. “Our economic and national security requires that we support all forms of American energy. It is time for the brawlers to get out of the way and let the builders get back to work.”

The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports that Power Company of Wyoming’s Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project in Carbon County will add more than 3,500 megawatts of electrical generation capacity, boosting the state’s power generation by 34%. The 600-turbine project qualifies for federal tax credits,

Developers had planned to begin producing wind energy in phases, with the target date of 2030 to place the project into full capacity operation. This and other major additions to Wyoming’s electrical generation industry is uncertain.

Wyoming, known for its extremely cold winters, has by far the steepest average monthly cost of energy, according to a WalletHub report: $1,591 — in large part because it consumes the most motor fuel and residential oil per capita, and has the highest monthly prices for both. One consumer advocacy group — Clean Energy Buyers Association, whose 400 members include Microsoft, Amazon, and Google — warned that if the renewable energy sector loses the 45Y and 48E production and investment tax credits, it would raise the cost of electricity in Wyoming by an average 29% — the steepest increase in the nation.

Trump signed the executive order directing the Treasury Department to “strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities.” Projects must begin construction before July 4, 2026 and be operational by the end of 2027, shaving several years off the previous eligibility timeline. The deadline sounds workable until reality sets in: permitting can take years during a favorable administration, which Trump and colleagues are not.

The executive order condemns commercial wind and solar development, saying it “denigrates the beauty of our nation’s natural landscape,” “displaces” affordable domestic energy sources, is “unreliable,” and poses a threat to national security for relying on supplies from “foreign entities of concern.”

A 2025 University of Wyoming survey reveals Wyoming residents overwhelmingly believe that changes in water resources and climate are happening, and risks can be reduced with community response plans and statewide policies.

Wyoming is one of the few states in the nation that imposes a tax on wind energy generation, producing millions of dollars each year that are split between the state and the counties hosting wind power plants. An argument that politicians in Wyoming may use to prop up ongoing wind and solar plant construction is the cost-share built into the Trump order that will split federal rents and fees with local governments hosting wind and solar facilities.

How did the Trump Administration get Renewables So Wrong?

The conversion to renewable energy-powered production has been remarkable over the last few years. At least 160 clean energy manufacturing facilities or expansions have been announced since August 2022, driven by tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act, with 47 declared in 2024 alone. Collectively, these facilities are expected to result in 100,000 new manufacturing jobs and at least $500 billion in investment, $75 billion of which has already been spent.

Despite the interest of overseas investors in pursuing renewable energy opportunities in the US, on April 8 Trump issued an order aimed at force-feeding more coal back into the nation’s power generation profile. The Associated Press ran the story under the headline, “Trump signs executive orders to boost coal, a reliable but polluting energy source.”

The US solar industry has been working overtime to convince Republican members of Congress that solar energy can deliver more kilowatts, more quickly, than any other form of power generation. Solar developers had been at a particularly strong advantage in the wake of Biden-era policies that saw a massive surge in solar manufacturing capacity in the US, providing developers with a robust domestic pipeline for solar modules.

So, for the first time, solar and wind energy are now cheaper than coal, natural gas, or oil and are the quickest options for installing new electricity generation. Solar is now growing faster than any power source in history — people are constructing a gigawatt’s worth of solar panels every 15 hours. That’s more or less what one coal-fired plant generates.

In a special address this month at UN Headquarters in New York, UN Secretary‑General António Guterres declared the world has “passed the point of no return” on the shift to renewables. He cited surging clean energy investment and plunging solar and wind costs that now outcompete fossil fuels. “The energy transition is unstoppable, but the transition is not yet fast enough or fair enough,” he said, asking the audience to “follow the money.” He mentioned that $2 trillion flowed into clean energy last year — $800 billion more than fossil fuels and up almost 70%.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Wyoming.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 15:03:34.170611

The study was conducted by Citizens Action Coalition and “exposes how Indiana’s monopoly utilities have imposed the most severe electric bill increases on residential customers in at least two decades — with some families paying nearly $50 more a month than just one year ago.”

Using data from the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC), the utility-focused customer advocacy group compared July 1 residential bills for 1,000 kWh of usage from 2024 and 2025.

“Things keeps getting worse for Hoosier consumers and our state leaders continue to allow it to happen,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of the coalition. “Based on this trend, the rhetoric regarding affordability emanating from the Statehouse appears to be nothing more than lip service. Hoosier consumers can no longer afford monopoly pricing. Something must change soon.”

The statewide average increase was nearly double the prior year’s record increase of 9.3%, the analysis found.

“Indiana has been growing, and Indiana’s utilities have an obligation to keep pace with that demand and power a modern economy,” the Indiana Energy Association said in a statement.

“In recent years, our energy companies have made substantial investments in additional power generation and modernization of the state’s century-old electric grid that delivers that power. We’ve added advanced technology to the electric grid that reduces power outages and hardens the grid against severe weather. There also have been substantial investments in evolving environmental regulations. We are committed to keeping affordability top of mind, while also making the investments needed to provide reliable electricity.”

IEA is a trade association that represents Indiana’s investor-owned electric utilities and local distribution gas companies.

Here are some findings about individual utilities from the analysis:

NIPSCO residential customers were hit hardest: $50 per month (26.7%) increase in just one year, compounding a 17.8% hike in 2024. This follows an IURC-approved settlement opposed by CAC.

CenterPoint bills surged $44 per month (25%) after the IURC greenlit a large base rate increase.

Duke Energy Indiana raised residential bills nearly $26 per month (20%).

AES Indiana increased bills nearly $17 per month (12%) — and now seeks an additional $21 per month by 2027 in a pending rate case.

I&M bills rose $6 per month (3.9%).

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

There are several contributing factors, including smoke from wildfires and auto emissions. The sunlight also plays a big role.

Particulate matter from those fires and ground-level, human caused ozone from cars are the specific pollutants in the air, a problem exacerbated during the long summer days because of ultraviolet rays emitted by the intense sunlight.

Several state health agencies in the region have issued air quality advisories.

Ozone is a ""regional issue,"" according to Kevin MacDonald, public information officer with the Clark County Division of Air Quality in Nevada, one of the counties that has issued an advisory.

""One of the issues with ozone is that pollutants will travel like wildfire smoke, and this all plays a factor in what we call this 'stew' that forms ozone,"" he said.

Ground-level ozone pollution increases during the summer months, he added.

""If you look at a 24-hour day and look up data from one of our monitoring stations, you'll see ozone is going to be low in the morning and then, typically, around 2- to 3 O'clock is when it's reaching its peak,"" MacDonald said. ""The sunlight is helping to cook that ozone.""

Southern Nevada is under an ozone advisory through the end of August. A particulate advisory has also been issued due to wildfires. Clark County has exceeded safe ozone levels on at least 14 days this summer.

This week, the federal Environmental Protection Agency forecasted ongoing bad air quality in parts of Nevada. The forecast also said areas in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming should expect poor air quality in the days ahead.

That has led state and local officials in several states to recommend that people take proactive measures, such as driving less, refueling their vehicles in the evenings to minimize the evaporation of gas fumes, and reducing household energy use.

To the shock and surprise of nobody, former natural gas CEO and current US Energy Secretary Chris Wright summarily canceled a federal loan guarantee of almost $5 billion for the Grain Belt Express, a new 5-gigawatt transmission project of historic proportions aimed at bringing wind energy from Kansas to kilowatt-thirsty points east. If yanking the loan was meant to be a kill shot, Wright missed the mark. The project lives on.

The Grain Belt Express Wind Energy Project

In terms of historic proportions, the Grain Belt Express meets the bar of transformative infrastructure projects like the Transcontinental Railroad. Completed in 1869, the new railway revolutionized the US economy when it shaved travel time between New York and San Francisco from an arduous months-long journey down to a single week.

The Grain Belt Express will have a similar, seismic-scale impact on electricity transmission in the US, if and when it goes into operation.

That will take some doing. The ambitious, multi-state project has already jumped on and off the CleanTechnica radar for almost 15 years. It began to take shape during the Obama administration under the wing of the Texas startup Clean Line Energy Partners, which launched in 2009. In 2011, Clean Line announced plans for a new, 700-mile high voltage direct current transmission line shunting wind energy from Kansas to interconnections in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and beyond. After a series of fits and starts, the project seemed to hit the end of the trail in 2015, when the Missouri Public Service Commission nixed it.

Undeterred, Clean Line appealed the decision and the Public Service Commission turned it down again. Still undeterred, Clean Line took its case to the Missouri Supreme Court. In 2018, the court greenlit the project, but by that time, Clean Line had already seen enough. The firm had other projects in the works, and it dropped the Grain Belt Express from its roster in 2019.

Follow The Money To Wind Energy

Clean Line was not the end of the line for the wind energy dream. In February of 2019, the Chicago-based clean energy developer Invenergy slipped word that it was willing to pick up the Grain Belt thread. That same year, the Missouri Public Service Commission reversed itself, greenlit the project, and okayed Invenergy’s plan to acquire it.

And … that’s where things went south again. In Missouri, state lawmakers stepped in to quash the project with new anti-wind legislation. Property owners also vowed to appeal. In an even more concerning development, the state of Illinois abruptly decided not to let the Grain Belt Express go through after all.

Nevertheless, Invenergy persisted. By 2023, the company assembled almost $4 billion from Blackstone Infrastructure Partners to support its various renewable energy ventures, including its portfolio of interregional transmission lines. The company also broke the project into phases, beginning with Missouri, where it counted transmission agreements with almost 40 municipal utilities by 2023.

More Money For A Massive Wind Energy Project

With private sector dollars and municipal utilities in its pocket, Invenergy applied to the Loan Programs Office of the US Department of Energy for a loan guarantee. On January 16 of this year, the DOE came through with conditional approval of a $4.9 billion loan guarantee for Phase I of the project, a 578-mile, 2.5-gigawatt high-voltage line from Ford County in Kansas to Callaway County in Missouri.

To be clear, a DOE loan guarantee is not a direct loan. The loan program was launched under the Bush administration in order to help transformative energy projects obtain favorable credit terms, not to dole out taxpayer dollars willy-nilly. It was designed from the start to absorb a degree of risk while yielding significant economic benefits overall, which it has done (see lots more LPO background here).

The Missouri phase is not the whole Grain Belt project, but it will have a significant impact on regional transmission. “The project will connect three regional grids: the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), and Associated Electric Cooperative Incorporated (AECI),” the DOE explained upon awarding the conditional guarantee, adding that it will “significantly expand import and export capabilities between these areas.”

“MISO, which is already a net importer of electricity, is expected to have a growing electricity supply gap as electricity demand grows,” the DOE added. “Grain Belt Express Phase 1 would unlock access to low-cost energy in Kansas to help bridge this gap.”

The US Department Of Energy Steps In It Again

With approvals from all four states finally in hand, the path ahead seemed clear. However, that’s when things went even farther south. On July 17, The New York Times noted that Republican US Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri raised a series of objections to the project beginning in March. The state’s Republican Attorney General also called upon the Missouri PSC to reverse itself again.

The ruckus reportedly culminated in a consequential Oval Office chat last week between Hawley and US President Donald Trump in person, with Energy Secretary Wright on the line. The consequence was that all those years of work and all those billions of dollars went up in smoke. On July 23, Wright announced the termination of the loan guarantee.

Invenergy was having none of it. As reported by the Times, the firm took to X (formerly Twitter) to make sure everyone still on X understands what happened to their transformative wind energy project, without saying wind energy. “Senator Hawley is attempting to kill the largest transmission infrastructure project in U.S. history, which is already approved by all four states and is aligned with the President’s energy dominance agenda,” Invenergy asserted, as cited by the Times.

“Senator Hawley is trying to deprive Americans of billions of dollars in energy cost savings, thousands of jobs, and grid reliability and national security, all in an era of exponentially growing electricity demand,” Invenergy added for good measure, still without mentioning wind energy.

When last heard from, Invenergy is also going to court to stop the Missouri Attorney General from creating any more mischief.

The Wind Energy Dream Rises From The Ashes

The story doesn’t end there. Digging in its heels on the Grain Belt Express website, Invenergy also reminded everyone that it has already assembled a binder full of private investors. “While we are disappointed about the LPO loan guarantee, a privately financed Grain Belt Express transmission superhighway will advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy and technology dominance while delivering billions of dollars in energy cost savings, strengthening grid reliability and resiliency, and creating thousands of American jobs,” the company stated.

So, it’s onwards and upwards for the most transformative wind energy project of its kind in US history. We sure have come a long way from the early 20th century, when thousands of windmills — not wind turbines, windmills — dotted the US landscape, performing vital water supply tasks at farms and ranches all over the US.

Or, have we? If you’re thinking Invenergy is being somewhat overly optimistic about their chances, consider that the project already has more than 14 years of project development under its belt. What’s another 3.5 years? On January 20, 2029, Trump will hande the reins of government over — peacefully this time, one hopes — to another Commander-in-Chief, presumably one more fit to steer the ship of the nation.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LPO-12-2024-GrainBelt-CC-Web-ProjectPage.png,N,,2025-07-27 14:02:42.432147

President Donald Trump’s accord with Japan appeared to be a ‘bad deal’ for the US industry, said Matt Blunt, head of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents General Motors, Ford and Stellantis.

The accord between Washington and Tokyo sets a 15 per cent tariff for Japanese goods, including autos.

Vehicles manufactured overseas currently face a 25 per cent levy under a Trump-imposed tariff that took effect in early April.

Japanese prime minister Shigeru Ishiba highlighted the relief for Japanese automakers, a sector that accounts for eight per cent of Japanese jobs, saying, ‘we are the first (country) in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume.’

But that relief did not sit well with the AAPC, whose members have organized their supply chains around the 2020 US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which Trump negotiated in his first term.

All three Detroit companies export from Canada and Mexico to the United States.

‘American Automakers still need to review the details of the US Japan agreement but any deal that charges a lower tariff for Japanese imports with virtually no US content than the tariff imposed on North American built vehicles with high US content is a bad deal for US industry and US auto workers,’ said Blunt.

The Japan deal also comes as Trump’s administration is engaged in negotiations with other auto-focused countries that face the current 25 per cent tariff on finished autos.

These include South Korea and Germany, a key player in Washington’s trade dealings with the European Union.

The flow of imports from South Korea includes autos from South Korean companies Kia and Hyundai, as well as General Motors, which exports the Chevrolet Trax and other vehicles to the United States from the country.

On Tuesday, GM executives suggested they were hoping for a lower tariff rate from the trade negotiations. Executives noted that affordability of the vehicles in an earnings conference call.

‘We have continued to bring the vehicles in from Korea because they’re (profitable) and they’re very much in demand,’ said GM Chief Executive Mary Barra.

‘Customers love those vehicles.’",https://outspoken.newagebd.com/files/img/202507/d3f9681bc8c689a2d11ea49f1819a16c_og.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 14:03:14.790767

Can the Rooftop Solar Industry Make Up for Lost Tax Credits by Cutting Costs?
One of the big questions as tax credits are about to expire is whether the rooftop solar industry will be able to adjust.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Consumers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to be eligible for tax credits for EVs, followed by a Dec. 31 deadline when credits vanish for rooftop solar, air source heat pumps and certain water heaters.

These are major purchases and customers will likely want to consider multiple options before making a selection, but there isn’t much time for research. To help, I’ve convened some experts to help you make good decisions.

First, how we got here: President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, which repealed tax credits that had been created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since the EV credits expire first, we’ll start there. Until Sept. 30, the government has a $7,500 credit for qualifying new EVs and plug-in hybrids, and a $4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs. There is also a $7,500 credit under a different part of the law that applies to leased EVs.

Should you buy immediately? I asked Alex Knizek, associate director of auto test development at the Consumer Reports Auto Test Center.

“If you’ve already done your research and found a safe, reliable EV or [plug-in hybrid] that fits your needs and budget, you should make that purchase sooner rather than later,” he said. “But don’t panic-buy a car in a rush just for the sake of getting the tax credit.”

Knizek said there is a danger that a quick decision will leave you stuck with a vehicle that doesn’t fit your needs. Also, a quick buying process may lead you to get a vehicle that is unreliable and will need expensive repairs.

Especially if you’re a first-time EV buyer, there are some details you need to figure out before you start taking test drives. For example, you should determine your charging setup and get a sense of whether there will be extra costs to upgrade your home’s wiring.

The larger point is that rushed decisions are often bad decisions.

But if you feel ready to buy, there are many resources available to identify which vehicles have the best promotions and the inventory levels in your area. Websites such as KBB.com and Edmunds.com can provide a big-picture view.

The federal government lists which new vehicles and used vehicles qualify for credits when a customer is buying, as opposed to leasing.

For leases, dealers and their financing affiliates can get a $7,500 credit for EVs that they deliver to customers, with few restrictions. But there is no master list for prices and availability. I’ve found that it’s helpful to look online for lists of the best lease deals, and also look for specials on the websites of local dealers.

Prices vary depending on where you are located. For example, Columbus, Ohio, where I live, often doesn’t have some of the best promotions that are available in markets where dealers have a lot more EV inventory.

You have more time to shop and make decisions about the other expiring credits than you do with EVs. Most of the other consumer-facing tax credits expire on Dec. 31, including:

A 30 percent credit for home energy systems that can include rooftop solar, battery energy storage systems and small wind turbines, among others. This credit has no maximum benefit, which allows for a lot of flexibility in deciding the size of the system you want.

A 30 percent credit for buying a qualifying air source heat pump, which is an electric system that provides home heating and cooling. The maximum benefit is $2,000.

A 30 percent credit for home improvements that help with energy conservation, which can include insulation, windows, doors and electrical panel replacement. The maximum benefit is $1,200, and there are several other limits for certain items, such as a cap of $600 for windows.

The only major consumer-facing credit that will continue beyond the end of the year is an incentive for buying and installing a home charger for an EV, which ends after June 2026. This is a 30 percent credit with a maximum benefit of $1,000. (EnergySage has a good roundup of the credits and expiration dates, which helped me to parse some of these details.)

But knowing which credits are available is just an initial step. The next one is to determine what to do with this information.

At my house, I have found that Electrify Central Ohio is a great resource, and I wrote about it in 2022. It’s a volunteer-run organization in which people share their experiences with buying rooftop solar, EVs and other emissions-cutting technologies. Other cities and regions have their own groups like this and I advise you to join one in your community.

I asked the co-founders, Andy Leber and Madeline Fleisher, whether the rapid expiration of tax credits means I should rush to make purchases.

“We were advising people considering solar to do it this calendar year, but it might already be too late to start getting bids and getting the system installed by Dec. 31,” said Leber, who is an Ohio State University psychology professor by day. “If I were shopping now, I’d try to secure a guarantee that the system would be installed in time and eligible for the credit.”

He is less sure of what to recommend for people who want to buy battery energy storage. He expects that retail prices for batteries will continue to fall to the point that the repeal of the credit won’t be as much of an issue in a year or two as it would be for rooftop solar and other resources.

Fleisher, an attorney who specializes in energy issues, emphasized the urgency of getting rooftop solar before the end of the year because of questions of what the solar industry is going to look like as it tries to adapt to not having the credits.

“I think you’re rolling the dice after the end of this year as to what might happen,” she said. “The business model is built around the tax credit and there’s going to need to be some significant adjustment of that business model before companies can figure out how to make money. It could be rough in the meantime.”

In writing about the rapid expiration of the credits, I’m reminded of how forward-thinking they were. Most of these credits were set to last for a decade before this abrupt reduction in the timetable.

Fleisher noted that the original timetable meant that the credits were going to be around as consumers reached the point in their buying cycle when they needed a new car, heating system or other major purchases.

She suspects that many people will find that their needs didn’t line up precisely enough with the window of when the incentives are available.

“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late,” she said. “People are going to miss the chance.”

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

PJM Capacity Price Rises Again and Hits Cap as Clean Energy Projects Remain Stalled: Electricity customers are going to see a continuing increase in costs because of results of an auction announced this week in the country’s largest grid region, as my colleague Rambo Talabong reports for ICN. PJM Interconnection—whose territory runs from New Jersey to Illinois—held the auction to set the price that is paid to power plant owners to be available for use by the grid when needed. Growth in electricity demand combined with PJM’s backlog of approvals of grid connections for new energy projects, most of them renewable, are contributing to a scarcity that is driving up prices. The new price, which takes effect next year, is $329.17 per megawatt-day, which hit a price ceiling set by PJM. The upshot is that most customers will see increases in the part of their bills that covers PJM’s services.

Tesla’s Automotive Revenue Falls Again, Even Lower Than Analysts Expected: Tesla had a rough second quarter, reporting on Wednesday that its automotive revenue fell 16 percent compared to a year ago, the second quarter in a row in which sales decreased. This is the second straight quarter of revenue declines as the automaker dealt with challenges tied to the lack of a hot new model and the continuing fallout from CEO Elon Musk’s close association with the Trump administration. The results fell short of analysts’ expectations and added to a string of disappointing news for the company, as Lora Kolodny reports for CNBC.

Trump Has Unleashed a Regulatory Blitz Against Renewables: President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office to try to put up barriers to renewable energy development. A recent example is the requirement disclosed last week that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy personally approve renewable energy projects on public lands. Benjamin Storrow reports for E&E News about the administration’s efforts and how they are a significant escalation using the government to slow growth of renewables.

Republican Excitement for Wyoming Rare Earth Mining Contradicts the Party’s Disdain for Renewables: A recent ribbon cutting for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine was showcase for Republicans’ dissonance on mining for rare earth minerals, as my colleague Jake Bolster reports for ICN.

On the other hand, the administration has been hostile to the products that need these minerals, which can include solar cells and EV batteries.

The rally, organised in partnership with the Indian Air Force, Tata Motors and PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI), ran from Delhi to Adampur, Punjab, and back, covering key stops including Murthal and Ambala.

The initiative was aimed at raising awareness about clean mobility and acknowledging the role of India’s defence forces. Over 30 Tata Harrier EVs participated in the rally, which acted as a live demonstration of India’s readiness to support electric mobility over long distances. Tata Power ensured uninterrupted operations by deploying strategically placed charging stations along the entire route.

The company’s charging network played a critical role in enabling seamless travel without range anxiety. By powering the rally end-to-end, Tata Power tested its public charging infrastructure under real-world conditions across multiple cities and terrains.

Tata Power’s participation in the rally aligns with its broader goal of expanding EV adoption in India. The company currently operates more than 5,400 public and captive EV charging points, over 1.35 lakh home chargers, and 1,200+ bus charging points across 600+ cities and towns. Its charging solutions are installed across highways, commercial zones, residential areas, and tourist locations.

To date, Tata Power’s EV network has enabled over 23.6 crore green kilometres and helped avoid over 1 lakh tonnes of CO₂ emissions through electric buses alone. The company aims to expand to 7.5 lakh home chargers and 10,000 public charging stations by 2030.

The Shaurya Bharat EV Rally served as a proof-of-concept for India’s growing electric mobility infrastructure and Tata Power’s role in enabling mission-critical operations powered by clean energy.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/07/27/EV-Shaurya-Rally.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 13:02:45.652895

National Rooftop Solar Programme: Proposals on the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation

National Rooftop Solar Programme: Public Private Partnership Model (PPP Model)

CPD calls for the National Rooftop Solar Programme to begin with carefully selected pilot projects, rather than a simultaneous nationwide rollout. Drawing on past failures—including the underwhelming Rooftop Solar System—CPD stressed that a measured, evidence-based approach is essential for success.

This recommendation emerged at the media briefing titled ‘National Rooftop Solar Programme: Proposals on the design, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation’ held on Sunday, 27 July 2025 organised by the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD)at its own premises.

In his introductory remarks, Dr Khondaker Golam Moazzem, Research Director, CPD, remarked ‘The interim government plans to establish connections for nearly 3,000 megawatts of electricity by December 2025. These installations will be made in government infrastructure, schools, and hospitals. This initiative is part of the government’s renewable energy policy, which aims to reach 20 per cent renewable energy by 2030 and 30 per cent by 2040’.

He added, ‘Previous rooftop solar programmes in Dhaka led to installations that were more symbolic than functional, fostering negative perceptions about renewable energy, which we must overcome to ensure the success of this new initiative’.

In her keynote presentation, Ms Helen Mashiyat Preoty, Senior Research Associate, CPD, highlighted ‘The government’s plan to install 3000 MW of rooftop solar on public institutions is commendable, but premature implementation without feasibility assessments, clearly defined institutional roles, or coordinated oversight could undermine its impact’. In this context, CPD recommends starting in areas with high solar potential, grid readiness, and institutional capacity to manage installations and maintenance.

She underscored that, to ensure sustainable implementation, agencies such as Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board (BREB), and Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) must first clarify their responsibilities. Each installation should be preceded by structural analysis, shadow studies, and site-specific financial modelling. CPD further emphasises that procurement must be handled by accredited vendors, and all installations must comply with stringent technical standards.

For financing, CPD proposes that Bangladesh Bank introduce a concessional green energy loan scheme with a lower interest rate with longer loan repayment period, alongside sovereign guarantees to reduce investor risk under the OPEX model. Without these mechanisms, the private sector is unlikely to commit capital to large-scale deployment.

Maintenance is another critical challenge. Under the CAPEX model, systems often deteriorate due to unclear accountability and weak follow-up. CPD suggests embedding 5–10-year maintenance clauses in EPC contracts, supported by a government-backed guarantee fund and digital monitoring systems linked to a central solar dashboard.

Mr Nasir Uddin Chowdhury, General Member, Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association (BSREA), reflected on the challenges with previous rooftop solar projects, stating, ‘Our experience with residential rooftop solar installations has been disappointing, with many systems criticised for their lack of functionality. For example, in my own Dhaka building, 3-5 kW systems were installed but didn’t work. In contrast, solar installations in villages, which were implemented from 2003 to 2021, have been successful and continue to operate.’

He added, ‘These solar systems have lasted almost 25 years with regular maintenance, demonstrating that solar home systems themselves aren’t the issue—rather, it’s the poor installations that caused the problems’.

‘The Power Division has been closely monitoring the national rooftop solar programme’s implementation, with a committee reviewing the tender documents’ said the Director of Renewable Energy and Research & Development Department, BPDB, Mr Moniruzzaman.

He added ‘We are integrating remote monitoring facilities to ensure efficient operation and grid stability, confident that the system will enhance energy savings and strengthen our distribution network’

Engr. Md. Mujibur Rahman, Director (Deputy Secretary), Renewable Energy Development, SREDA, highlighted ‘The solar installations planned for homes in 2010 were ineffective because there was no obligation for them to generate electricity continuously. With the new net metering system, we must convert those meters and set a requirement for a certain percentage of electricity generation to ensure that people will meet the necessary targets’.

Mr Sardar Mohammad Zafrul Hasan, Chief Engineer (Planning & Design) at Power Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited (PGCB), remarked ‘Our Power Division has tendered for 1,500 MW of solar capacity and, after consulting on grid stability, we foresee no issues’.

He added ‘With the 3,000 MW rooftop solar target, we are confident there will be no grid problems. To support this, we’ve already initiated key mitigation measures, including 100 MW and 35 MW battery energy storage projects’

Sharing his concerns, Mr Ramprasad Pal, Deputy Director, Renewable Energy Department, Bangladesh Rural Electrification Board, said ‘When the net metering system was introduced, issues arose, particularly with the rural electricity associations. Immediately after its implementation, a drop in revenue was observed, which remains a significant concern. If the OPEX model were implemented, they could generate electricity and sell it back to consumers, thereby incentivising them’

Reflecting on the National Rooftop Solar Programme, Engineer Naznin Akter, Managing Director, GSOLARIC Bangladesh Ltd, said ‘I respectfully disagree with the notion that the net metering system has completely failed. It is still ongoing, though there are some issues with domestic connections. However, industrial connections, like those from companies such as Hamim Group and Akij Group, have been very successful’

Mr Khondkar Morshed Millat, Former Director, Sustainable Finance Department at Bangladesh Bank, discussed about the refinancing scheme and said ‘A separate scheme is not necessary. The existing 1,000 crore BDT green refinancing fund from Bangladesh Bank already includes solar rooftop projects, providing ample support. When institutions approach the bank for solar financing, the first question is, “Are you going to horizontally or vertically integrate?” The main challenge with horizontal integration is the lack of land availability, but rooftop solar remains the prime objective, which is certainly achievable’.

In his concluding remarks, Mr Mostafa Al Mahmud, President, Bangladesh Solar and Renewable Energy Association, said ‘This programme will create jobs for over 100,000 people, both directly and indirectly. In fact, I believe the number will be much higher—perhaps 2 to 2.5 million people. Some will become importers, others will be retailers or wholesalers, and many others will be involved in various roles, ultimately spreading across the grassroots level, which will contribute to sustainable development. This is a major and effective development’.

What’s better value, electric or gas?

Although electric vehicles are cheaper to run than gas-powered cars, the initial price difference between the two is a turn-off for many potential purchasers.

Those incentives were originally designed to help make electric vehicles more appealing to prospective buyers simply by making them more affordable; at present, to buy a new electric vehicle it is around $9,000 more expensive than a gas vehicle, or $2,000 if you’re buying used.

However, despite the elimination of the tax credit, those in the know insist EVs are significantly more efficient, and will therefore be much better value, in the long run compared to their gas-powered ancestors.

“Quickly you’ll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,” Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America told CBS.

The organized chaos had a reason. Teams of high school students from across the nation prepared their vehicles for the Solar Car Challenge, an annual event held July 17-23 in Fort Worth, which aims to educate participants in science, engineering and alternative energy.

Students spent the past year working on their cars.

Before race day, the teams’ cars must go through “scrutineering,” a series of six tests that are evaluated by judges and ensure all rules are followed and each vehicle is safe to operate.

The Falcon EV team from Fort Worth Country Day toiled away in the garage. Co-captains Jason Pham and Andrew Lobo worked quickly and calmly as they prepared their car.

“Scrutineering is actually way more intense than the race day, or that’s how it felt,” Pham said. “Because right here we have a test to pass to be able to race, and we want to race. This is the most important step for us.”

This isn’t the first time Pham and Lobo participated in the challenge. Their team has competed for the past three years, they said. The difference is both students stepped up into team leadership.

“It’s definitely a lot more work, but it’s definitely a lot more rewarding too,” Lobo said.

The event is a competition, but teams help each other and foster a collaborative atmosphere, both captains said.

“Everyone plays fair,” Pham said. “Everyone wants the best for each team because we want to compete at each other’s best, not their worst. That’s what the event is about.”

Hartford residents beset by flooding draw lawmaker support.
As a marginalized population, Jennings said the North End is encumbered with poverty, racial discrimination, low employment rates, and low levels of home ownership.
Jennings’ former colleague and fellow founding member of the Connecticut Coalition for Environmental Justice, Dr. Mark Mitchell, described Jennings as a powerful force.

Jennings, a lifelong resident of Hartford’s North End, remembers wading through standing water to do her laundry. She later developed an illness her doctor attributed to mold. And she has channeled those experiences into helping her community deal with environmental problems.

Her experiences bring to life the impact of Hartford’s flooding problems on residents who have for generations endured floods from untreated waste mixed with water from storms that, in recent decades, have intensified due to climate change.

‘It’s like a swamp’: Hartford residents share the reality of living with flooded homes and businesses

On a sunny February afternoon, Jennings opened the front door to her house at 86 Hartland St., in the Blue Hills neighborhood, with a smile. She wore a floor-length blue and black dress. She thanked a group of journalism students for stepping in as the next generation to address climate change. Her passion for advocacy radiated through her kitchen and neat dining room.

“This is very tantamount to the survival of many people in this city, this state, and this country,” Jennings said.

Starting many decades ago, the basement floor of her family’s previous house on Cambridge Street was always covered with a foot and a half of water.

“We had our washing machine up on a pallet so that it would not get wet,” she said. “And we would walk through the water to put our clothes in the washing machine.

About 30 years ago, Jennings became ill. Her doctor suggested the illness was due to the mold that grew from bacteria in the sewage water.

The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a division of the National Library of Medicine, has linked respiratory illness and some cancers to black mold.

Jennings’ old house on Cambridge Street was prone to constant flooding. Its foundation was often wet along with the basement. The fire department would not pump out wastewater, she said, and her family did not have the money to hire a contractor. She said they lived with the water.

But the house where she lives now on Hartland Street and where she raised her son and daughter stands on slightly higher land and did not flood during the childhoods of her children. Her son, Sean Brown, is now 58 years old and lives in North Carolina. Her daughter, Shirene Brown, is 55 and lives in Florida. But in recent years, mixed waste and stormwater flooded this basement. After one storm, Jennings was devastated to find that valuables belonging to her mother had been destroyed. These included irreplaceable pictures, clothes, and shoes.

As of today, a sub pump and backflow preventer were put in about eight months ago. This is a temporary fix until the storm water and sewage water are separated.

In the past two decades, Jennings has watched storms in her neighborhood become more intense, a documented effect of a changing climate.

“Flooding is out of control and placing people out of their homes,” she said.

Hartford residents beset by flooding draw lawmaker support. Will it bring change?

She channeled her experiences with flooding into her career as a civil rights attorney and an environmental activist. The activism dates to the 1990s, when she and other residents of the North End worried about the health effects of dumping trash in the city landfill in the North Meadows area, about a half mile from her neighborhood.

Jennings moved into politics. She served six years on the Hartford City Council, until 2018, when she had to resign after changing her party affiliation. She ran unsuccessfully as an independent for Secretary of the State in 2022. She ran for office out of a sense of loyalty to her community. She said she would say, “You are not going to ignore us and take our tax money. We pay the same taxes as everybody else.”

According to the Connecticut Data Collaborative and Liberal Arts Action Lab, north Hartford is a predominately African American community in Hartford. As a marginalized population, Jennings said the North End is encumbered with poverty, racial discrimination, low employment rates, and low levels of home ownership.

The state reported in October 2024 that 100% of children in the Hartford public schools qualify for free and reduced lunches.

Jennings connects this statistic to the “Toxic Wastes and Race in the United States” study conducted by The United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, which concludes that minority groups inhabit the most environmentally risky places in America.

Jennings’ former colleague and fellow founding member of the Connecticut Coalition for Environmental Justice, Dr. Mark Mitchell, described Jennings as a powerful force.

“She is tenacious. Obviously, very intelligent. She is passionate, and she’s not afraid to confront those in power,” Mitchell said in an online interview in March 2025.

When Mitchell was health director for the Connecticut Department of Public Health, Jennings was a block captain in the North End. Mitchell recalls how Jennings, alongside Larry Charles and a former neighborhood group called ONE/CHANE Hartford, led opposition to the landfill’s expansion.

“Whenever the Department of Environmental Protection tried to crack down on the landfill, they would pass laws exempting the North Hartford landfill from the regulations and rules. But it was because of Cynthia Jennings and ONE/CHANE that EPA became involved and that they were able to hold the landfill operators to account because of their opposition and their community organizing,” Mitchell said.

One community particularly important to Jennings is renters. According to Housing Data Profiles, created in collaboration between the Partnership for Strong Communities and the Connecticut Data Collaborative, 63.9% of units in Hartford are renter- occupied.

Jennings advocates that renters get renters’ insurance and that building owners make sump pumps available to renters, because the owners must give permission for residents to apply for the state’s grant program that covered repairs and backflow preventers for homeowners. That program allocated about $9 million over two years and is now on hold.

Renters’ and tenants’ insurance policies “will mean that they can live in a hotel with their families while repairs are done to their units,” Jennings said. “Other than that, they face the real possibility of living in a shelter.”

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

President Joe Biden had reversed former President Donald Trump’s fossil fuel initiatives and set an ambitious goal for all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be zero-emissions.

He signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a landmark climate package that delivered historic investments for cutting emissions.

Electric vehicles led the way, an industry turbocharged by the IRA’s generous tax credits for vehicle purchases, home chargers, battery manufacturing and billions for new production facilities.

Electric vehicle sales surged in 2023, reaching 14 million globally with 1.4 million sold in the United States, a whopping 67% year-over-year increase. They accounted for 10% of U.S. light vehicle sales, with Tesla holding over half the EV market share.

Eager to capitalize, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly brokered a deal with Panasonic to build a massive $4 billion lithium-ion battery plant in De Soto, aimed at supplying Tesla’s new factories in Texas. An $829 million dollar tax incentive package secured Panasonic’s investment, made possible by the bipartisan APEX Act passed by the Kansas Legislature.

Kelly described the deal as transformative, the largest economic development project in Kansas history, expected to create 4,000 jobs and thousands more through related businesses.

Trump posed little threat. The intense backlash after the Capitol riots and mounting legal challenges cast serious doubt about his future.

And despite lingering concerns about his age, Biden was expected to win reelection and help Democrats take back the House. The anticipated “red wave” never materialized in the midterms, signaling waning strength of the Republican brand.

Yet, what felt inevitable crumbled.

Trump returned stronger, calling the shift to EVs a “transition to hell,” framing it effectively as a “government assassination” of auto jobs and unionized workers.

Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk joined Trump, which eventually led to a major loss in the company’s market share and a sharp stock sell off.

The enthusiasm for EVs seemed driven as much by political momentum as by consumer demand. When that momentum slowed, so did the market.

Overall sales slumped in 2024, dropping to 8% of U.S. light vehicles sales. Buyers remained concentrated among the affluent and college educated, with limited penetration into the broader public. Biden’s zero-emissions goal appeared naïve and disconnected from middle-and working-class realities.

Democrats were swept in November.

Trump recently signed his One Big Beautiful Bill, which terminates EV tax credits and phases out incentives for battery production.

Just as Biden had undone Trump’s policies, Trump unraveled Biden’s.

Because federal control routinely alternates between the parties, companies are constantly exposed to shifting regulations and the prospect of brand polarization — ask Disney, Bud Light, now Tesla.

Getting the politics wrong carries serious consequences.

Now that circumstances have changed so dramatically, would Kelly still place such a large bet on EVs?

Would Panasonic?

After all, many clean energy projects have been canceled, including battery plants in Georgia and Arizona.

EVs are excellent cars, and the market will still grow — just more slowly now.

But that slower pace has Kansans concerned about the direction this might take, and whether Tesla comes out ahead.

The Challenges of Scaling Dac Technology Despite the promising outlook, the Direct Air Capture technology faces significant hurdles.
Experts agree that scaling up DAC technology could provide substantial help in addressing emissions from sectors that are difficult to decarbonize.","In a bold move to fight the climate crisis, the United States has committed $1.2 billion to create two carbon-sucking vacuums that aim to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere. These two massive Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities, located in Texas and Louisiana, are designed to each remove up to one million tons of CO2 annually. This is equivalent to the emissions of 445,000 gas-powered cars each year, offering an innovative approach to tackling the growing global environmental crisis.

A Revolutionary Technology: Direct Air Capture

The technology behind these machines, Direct Air Capture (DAC), is one of the most advanced methods of addressing the climate emergency. These machines work by drawing in air and passing it through a chemical filter that captures CO2, leaving other gases behind. Once captured, the CO2 is stored underground or repurposed for industrial uses such as concrete production or aviation fuel.

The technology is still relatively untested at a large scale, with only a few DAC facilities operating globally, including a successful plant in Iceland, operated by the Swiss company Climeworks, a key partner in this project. Climeworks has already demonstrated the effectiveness of DAC in capturing carbon in smaller amounts, and now, with the US government’s support, the hope is to scale the technology to a level that could make a real dent in global emissions.

While each DAC facility may seem like a small contribution in the fight against climate change, the potential impact is significant. If scaled to the level required, DAC could play an essential role in meeting the world’s net-zero emissions goals.

The $1.2 Billion Gamble

The US Department of Energy’s investment will support two facilities in Texas and Louisiana, with each facility expected to capture one million tons of CO2 annually. According to Secretary Jennifer Granholm, “Cutting back on our carbon emissions alone won’t reverse the growing impacts of climate change,” adding that “We also need to remove the CO2 that we’ve already put in the atmosphere.” This reflects the understanding that reducing emissions is not enough on its own to address the scale of global warming.

The Louisiana project, dubbed Project Cypress, will be run by the US non-profit Battelle in partnership with Heirloom Carbon Technology and Climeworks. Shashank Samala, CEO of Heirloom, spoke optimistically about the pace of progress, stating, “Just two years ago, we were in a petri dish where we were removing grams of CO2 from the air… If we continue this pace of exponential growth every year, I think a billion tons a year is definitely, definitely achievable.”

Meanwhile, the Texas facility, led by Occidental and Carbon Engineering, is designed to scale up even further. Its ultimate capacity could reach up to 30 million tons of CO2 per year, making it a key part of the US’s long-term strategy to reduce atmospheric carbon.

The Challenges of Scaling Dac Technology

Despite the promising outlook, the Direct Air Capture technology faces significant hurdles. One of the primary concerns is the cost of operations, as the technology is still relatively expensive. Climeworks’ director Jan Wurzbacher noted that while the technology is advancing, it must become significantly cheaper in the coming years to have a meaningful impact on global CO2 levels. The challenge is not only financial but also technological, as scaling DAC to a level that can have a global effect requires further research and development.

Currently, the technology is considered “relatively untested” on a large scale, and costs are high. But the ambitious goals set by the US government signal a belief that DAC has the potential to change the way the world addresses the climate crisis. As Granholm emphasized, “If we deploy this at scale, this technology can help us make serious headway toward our net-zero emissions goals while we are still focused on deploying, deploying, deploying more clean energy at the same time.”

A Step Forward in the Climate Fight

While Direct Air Capture might not be the ultimate solution to the climate crisis, it represents an important tool in the fight to reverse the damage already done. The United Nations’ International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified carbon removal technologies like DAC as essential to keeping global warming within safe limits. In particular, the ability to capture carbon after it has already been emitted into the atmosphere may become crucial in stabilizing the climate over the coming decades.

Experts agree that scaling up DAC technology could provide substantial help in addressing emissions from sectors that are difficult to decarbonize. However, the cost and energy requirements for these machines remain a major concern. As Martin Penwald from Climeworks points out, “The energy used for these machines could be more effectively utilized directly on the grid,” raising the issue of whether the energy needed to power DAC systems could outweigh their benefits.",https://dailygalaxy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CO2-Emissions.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 12:05:30.517570

“Rain gardens kind of use your yard opportunistically,” said Carlee Steppe, a conservation botanist with Wildlife Conservation at the Wildlife Resource Division. “A lot of times they’re there to kind of prevent a certain part of your yard from flooding. For example, if you didn’t want water runoff on your driveway, or you didn’t want it moving into a child’s playground, you could add a rain garden.”

Steppe said a rain garden is made up of wetland plants which are used to absorb some of the water coming in.

“Some cities use them on a larger scale, essentially to help water flow through some type of rain garden to prevent pollution from entering into the environment,"" said Steppe. ""The plants can absorb some of the nutrients and things that come out of people's yards. Typically, people are using them on a smaller scale in their own yard.”

A rain garden is a depressed area in the landscape that collects rain water from a roof, driveway or street and allows it to soak into the ground, according to the federal Environmental Protection Agency.

Planted with grasses and flowering perennials, rain gardens can be a cost effective way to help filter out pollutants in runoff, provide food and shelter for butterflies, song birds and other wildlife.

Additional benefits of rain gardens, according to the EPA:

The soil and plants in a rain garden filter out pollutants like sediment, nutrients and heavy metals from the runoff, improving water quality.

By allowing water to soak into the ground, rain gardens help reduce the amount of water flowing over land and into storm drains, which can help prevent flooding and erosion.

Rain gardens help recharge groundwater supplies, which can be especially important in drought-prone areas.

University of Georgia extension agent Campbell Vaughn said the traditional way of dealing with runoff is to get it to a hard surface, put it in a pipe and run it out into the river.

“This gives water an opportunity to get to a place, get moisture back into the soil for the little area,” said Vaughn of rain gardens. “You add in plants that can handle the moisture. Sometimes they even have the ability to filter some of the stuff that may be on the surface that's getting washed into these areas. It keeps some of the toxins out of the rivers and streams.”

How to build a rain garden:

Choose a location that receives runoff from a roof or other impervious surface.

The size of the rain garden depends on the area of the contributing runoff and the soil type.

Amend the soil with compost or other organic matter to improve drainage and water retention.

Choose native plants that are adapted to wet and dry conditions.

“In an undisturbed environment, water falls to the ground, either hitting the surface and running off or percolating through the soil into the groundwater,"" noted Dr. Bodie Pennisi, the Vincent J. Dooley Professor in Horticulture at the UGA College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, in an email. "" ... Through both routes, water makes its way to our streams, ponds, wetlands, rivers, lakes and oceans. As we develop and alter the urban landscape, this natural cycle is disturbed, impacting both water quantity and water quality.”

“The amount of rainfall that infiltrates into the soil to recharge groundwater decreases from 50% to 15%,” he added. “The changes to the water cycle from changes caused by land development are numerous.”

Changes to the water cycle due to land development according to Pennisi, include:

Increased runoff

More frequent and severe flooding

Decreased infiltration

Less groundwater recharge

Decrease in base flow to streams

More pollution generated from land use is delivered to waterways.

“The increased volume of runoff from storms also increases the likelihood of flooding downstream, particularly during intense storms,” said Pennisi.

Cities are ideal for implementing rain gardens

Pennisi said parking lots are large areas of impervious surface because they generate large volumes of stormwater.

“Rain gardens can be incorporated in parking lots,” he said. “Cities, municipalities and schools can be proactive in mitigating stormwater runoff and help with water quality.”

This follows the passing on Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which seeks to expand the fossil fuel and nuclear power sectors while also halting renewable energy progress in the U.S. These moves could lead energy companies to pause investments in renewable energy projects due to the uncertain outlook for the industry, as developers face more red tape and fewer financial incentives in establishing new solar and wind projects.

It may become even harder to develop solar and wind projects that require federal permitting, as the Trump administration has put Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in charge of deciding which projects may proceed on federal land. Burgum now has the “final review” of leases, rights-of-way, construction plans and all other aspects of the Interior Department’s federal permitting process for wind and solar projects, according to an internal memo.

The Interior Department said in a statement that it was “levelling the playing field” for coal and natural gas “after years of assault” by the Biden administration. This follows recent moves by the Trump administration to encourage new coal developments and boost production to supposedly drive down energy costs.

Burgum’s office will now be responsible for reviewing 68 types of agency actions, including federal permits, environmental reviews, lease sales, site plans, wildlife impact assessments and numerous smaller decisions and consultations related to solar and wind energy developments. This is expected to lead to bottlenecks and delays for many renewable energy projects.

Jason Grumet, the CEO of the lobby group American Clean Power (ACP), said, “The Interior Department adds three new layers of needless process and unprecedented political review to the construction of domestic energy projects.” Grumet added, “This isn’t oversight. It’s obstruction that will needlessly harm the fastest-growing sources of electric power.” Approximately 5 percent of solar projects and 1 percent of wind projects are situated on federal land, according to ACP.

While only a small percentage of wind and solar projects are developed on federal lands and waters, many projects situated on private lands consult with the Interior Department to determine whether they require federal permits to comply with wildlife protections or other laws. Several industry groups have criticised the move for hindering the development of U.S. solar and wind power, which has accelerated in recent years.

The new measures are expected to restrict the development of solar and wind energy projects and, therefore, slow the speed of new clean electricity generation at a time when the U.S. electricity demand is expected to soar. As tech companies invest heavily in the rollout of data centres to support complex technologies such as artificial intelligence, experts worry that the U.S. will not be able to meet the growing electricity demand. President Trump has regularly been criticised as experts say his restrictions on the development of renewable energy projects are at odds with his claims that the U.S. is facing an energy emergency to meet growing demand for electricity.

The recent passing of President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act also threatens green energy progress in the U.S., as it scraps several financial incentives for renewable energy development. Another executive order from July called for the Interior Department to “eliminate preferential treatment for wind and solar facilities compared to reliable, dispatchable energy sources,” referring to coal, natural gas and nuclear power.

Several House Republicans had previously lobbied for the bill to bring an end to green energy subsidies even faster than the final Act stipulates. Upon voting for a watered-down version of the bill, in terms of renewable energy restrictions, some lawmakers said that Trump had promised to address their concerns through executive action.

And it seems like Trump has followed through with his promise by signing an executive order to end market-distorting subsidies for unreliable, foreign-controlled energy sources on July 7. The order directed the Treasury Department to consider revising its guidelines for how and when renewable energy projects would need to commence development in order to be eligible for tax breaks.

Adam Suess, the acting assistant secretary for lands and minerals management at the Interior Department, said, the “actions further deliver on President Trump’s promise to tackle the Green New Scam and protect the American taxpayers’ dollars.” Suess added, “American energy dominance is driven by U.S.-based production of reliable base load energy, not regulatory favouritism toward unreliable energy projects that are solely dependent on taxpayer subsidies and foreign-sourced equipment.”

In recent months, it seems that Trump has waged a war on renewable energy development in the U.S., while also stating the need to rollout more electricity to meet the rising national demand. Through several executive orders and the Big Beautiful Bill, Trump has favoured fossil fuels and supported a reversal of the U.S. energy agenda, as he aims to move away from renewable energy to oil, gas, coal and nuclear power.

Other than that: The average efficiency is still lower than that of traditional solar panels.","A future where your home’s windows not only let in light but also power your appliances is no longer science fiction, it’s reality. That’s because a new generation of transparent solar panels, known as smart glass or transparent photovoltaic glass, is arriving in the United States, promising to transform glass facades into veritable invisible power plants. But how does this work in practice?And is this technology worth investing in?

How do these windows generate energy without darkening the room?

Let’s get straight to the point: these windows aren’t like the standard solar panels we’re used to seeing on rooftops. That’s because, while traditional solar panels absorb all visible light (hence their dark appearance), transparent solar panels operate much more subtly: they let through the light your eyes can see and capture only invisible rays, such as ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR). It’s as if the window has a “detective mode,” seeing what no one else sees and transforming it into electricity.

There are two main types:

Fully transparent: identical in appearance to regular glass (but with lower efficiency).

Semi-transparent: balancing visibility and energy generation with better practical results.

It’s worth noting that the technologies behind these windows include extremely thin materials such as perovskites, which are nothing more than quantum dots, and special polymers that can absorb energy without blocking the view.

Where can this type of solar panel be used?

So you might be wondering, “Cool, but where is this actually being used?” The answer is in more places than we could imagine:

Sustainable architecture: think of glass buildings generating energy for their own consumption. The acronym BIPV (Building-Integrated Photovoltaics) has already become a trend in Europe and is starting to appear in the US.

Electric vehicles: manufacturers are already testing this technology on solar roofs on cars, trains, and even boats, which helps charge batteries even when the vehicle is turned off.

Smart cities: from streetlights, traffic lights, and sidewalks to urban panels that can use transparent panels to operate on clean, independent energy.

Electronics and wearables: from solar watches to glasses with self-charging sensors, the idea of devices that never need an outlet is gaining traction.

In other words, besides versatility, one of the greatest advantages is aesthetics: the technology doesn’t interfere with the design of products or buildings. Everything works behind the scenes. This even reminds us of those other solar panels that, unlike this transparent one, are colored, you choose: green, red, orange, or silver, all with unexpected performance.

Why transparent solar windows could be our future?

Of course, it’s not all positives… Because it’s a new technology, cost is still a barrier, especially for 100% transparent models. Just to give you an idea, while a semi-transparent window can cost around $80/m², completely invisible versions exceed $400/m². Other than that:

The average efficiency is still lower than that of traditional solar panels. While these reach 20–25%, transparent models are in the 7–10% range.

The durability of materials like perovskite is still being optimized; many lose efficiency over time and with exposure to moisture.

Energy production depends on UV and IR radiation, which can be compromised in locations with frequent cloudy days or constantly shaded windows.",https://www.ecoticias.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ultraviolet-window-hit-seethrough-panel.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 12:04:33.309619

Lower completion rates and lower new well productivity lead to slower growth in US output in 2025 and 2026, Completion rates are expected to be even lower in 2026 due to very low oil prices (WTI=$55/b) leading to no increase in US average output in 2026 compared to 2025.

US GDP and distillate consumption are closely correlated and the outlook is less optimistic now than in January 2025. The rebound at the end of 2026 for US GDP looks like wishful thinking to me.

The scenario above attempts to model marketed shale gas production where it is assumed that dry shale gas is about 92% of marketed shale gas production.

Net exports of natural gas are expected to increase by 4.3 BCF/d from 2024 to 2026 and there are 24 BCF/d of LNG capacity under construction or approved which are expected to begin exports between 2024 and 2030. Assuming all of this is developed and net pipeline exports are unchanged the net exports would increase by 24 BCF/d from 2024 to 2026. It looks to me that unless natural gas consumption in the US drops by 20 BCF/d, there will not be enough natural gas produced in the US to meet the demand from LNG exporters.

BERLIN, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Nestled at the heart of Germany's industrial corridor, a Chinese-backed battery gigafactory offers a revealing glimpse into stronger Europe-China collaborate in powering Europe's green energy transition.

Located in Arnstadt, Thuringia, the 1.8 billion euros (2.11 billion U.S. dollars) facility, built and run by the Chinese company CATL, has been operating since late 2022 as the first large-scale power battery manufacturing site in Germany.

With an annual design capacity of up to 30 million cells, enough to power roughly 200,000 electric vehicles, the factory supplies key European automakers racing to decarbonize under mounting regulatory and market pressure.

Yet the plant is more than just a production facility. It has emerged as a test case for cross-border industrial integration, merging China's battery expertise with Germany's engineering tradition, and offering a model of how the two can collaborate in the green transition.

CROSS-CULTURAL COLLABORATION

The factory's early stages required hundreds of engineers and technicians from China to stabilize operations and train local staff. Now, with a largely European workforce in place, collaboration has become part of the plant's daily rhythm.

""I was skeptical about Chinese manufacturing at first,"" said Amjad Abdallah, a module assembly technician. ""But working side by side, I saw how precise their systems are and how high their standards really are.""

Joint teams of Chinese and European technicians now work together to calibrate assembly lines, fine-tune precision tolerances, and troubleshoot automated systems. As workflows become more integrated, informal cultural exchanges are emerging as well, basic greetings in Chinese and German have become part of the shop floor's everyday soundscape.

""At first, we relied on gestures and English,"" said Qian Lei, a Chinese engineer. ""Now we're joking in basic German.""

The effects of this collaboration extend beyond the factory walls. Local public transport has added new routes to serve the facility, complete with bilingual signage. Small businesses catering to Chinese employees, such as restaurants and coffee shops, have sprung up in the city center, reflecting a level of social integration rarely seen in foreign-led industrial projects.

As the number of expatriate staff declines, local employees have taken over core functions including module integration, packaging, and logistics. ""I'm heading back to China soon. The team here is fully capable,"" said Qian.

GROWING GREEN CAPACITY

The Arnstadt plant represents part of a broader wave of Chinese investment across Europe's battery value chain. Chinese battery makers are stepping up efforts to establish localized production across Europe.

New CATL plants are under construction in Hungary and Spain, while other firms are investing in Slovakia and expanding operations in Hungary, launching their first European factories. Together, these projects aim to support European carmakers with local supply chains and advance the region's shift to electric mobility.

The Arnstadt site has become CATL's first overseas plant to operate with net-zero carbon emissions. It runs on green electricity, uses fully electrified internal logistics, and is managed through a smart energy control system. The plant is also collaborating with Germany's Fraunhofer Institute to develop battery life prediction models, aiming to improve durability, enhance resource efficiency, and lower long-term maintenance costs.

""The plant not only produces next-generation batteries with a lower carbon footprint but also promotes circular economy practices, such as recycling and energy efficiency,"" said CATL spokesperson Caspar Spinnen. ""It showcases how international collaboration can accelerate the shift toward a greener, more sustainable future.""

""Chinese producers now dominate not only in cell chemistry and systems integration, but also in recycling and life cycle management,"" said Ferdinand Dudenhoeffer, a renowned German automotive expert.

The Thuringia site has already generated more than 1,000 jobs while supporting local construction, retail and transit services. Arnstadt Mayor Frank Spilling said rising tax revenue is being reinvested into public infrastructure, including daycare centers and housing developments.

""This project has helped establish Thuringia as a future hub for battery research and production,"" said the state's Economy Minister Colette Boos-John.

STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT

As China and the European Union mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties, their leaders on Thursday convened for the 25th China-EU summit in Beijing and issued a joint statement on climate change, in which they recognized that strengthening China-EU cooperation on the issue will impact the well-being of people on both sides.

Amid Europe's accelerating shift toward green industry, the experience of one small town in Thuringia offers a glimpse into how China-Europe cooperation is helping drive regional economic transformation.

""This kind of deep industrial cooperation helps anchor bilateral ties beyond politics,"" said Michael Schumann, chairman of the German Federal Association for Economic Development and Foreign Trade. ""It reflects mutual trust, long-term vision and shared value creation.""

""The cooperation is no longer just practical, it has become essential,"" said Dudenhoeffer. ""Chinese firms lead in production efficiency and energy density; European automakers remain ahead in user experience and design. It's a natural and strategic complement.""

The battery facility is part of a broader trend. Chinese automakers are deepening their industrial partnerships in Europe and accelerating local operations. BYD is building a car manufacturing plant in Hungary; Chery has formed a joint venture with Spain's Ebro to produce electric vehicles; and SAIC also plans to set up its assembly base in Europe. As Chinese brands expand their presence, their EV models are gaining growing traction among European consumers.

On Colorado’s public lands, hikers trek through forests of spruce and pine trees, families go camping and fishing and hunters search for elk in the northwest.
Lien, a longtime champion of public lands, frequently hunts in the San Juan National Forest near Durango, and he has hiked peaks across the state.
“We were able to stop the direct sell-offs (of public lands), but we probably didn’t anticipate how bad some of these other provisions would be,” Lien said.
“This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with local communities.","After a proposed provision in the recent Republican tax break and spending cut law that would have opened up millions of acres of federal lands for sale was axed, Colorado climate leaders and public lands advocates still didn’t have much to celebrate.

That’s because the massive federal policy bill‘s surviving provisions governing oil and gas leasing on federal lands are “an egregious step back for the environment,” according to Melissa Hornbein, a senior attorney at the Western Environmental Law Center.

The law makes it easier to lease federal lands in several Western states for oil and gas extraction. It also limits the ways by which this land can be regulated and lowers the royalty rate that oil and gas companies must pay the government, among other related provisions.

“This bill goes in the wrong direction, essentially promoting oil and gas leasing, and then on top of that, it’s hamstringing (government) discretion to minimize the on-the-ground impacts of oil and gas infrastructure,” Hornbein said. “It’s exacerbating the climate crisis.”

The law, achieved through the reconciliation process in Congress and signed July 4 by President Donald Trump, who calls it the “big, beautiful bill,” mandates that the secretary of the Interior Department make federal lands available for oil and gas leasing on, at minimum, a quarterly basis in nine states, including Colorado. The available lands are governed by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.

Those agencies handle swaths of public lands that are typically multiuse. On Colorado’s public lands, hikers trek through forests of spruce and pine trees, families go camping and fishing and hunters search for elk in the northwest. The lands are also often used for commercial purposes, including by tourism and recreation companies, and for resource extraction. The state is home to 24 million acres of federal land.

By prioritizing oil and gas leasing above other uses for certain lands, the law “hurts everybody but the extractive industries,” said Colorado Springs resident and outdoorsman David Lien.

Lien, a longtime champion of public lands, frequently hunts in the San Juan National Forest near Durango, and he has hiked peaks across the state.

“We were able to stop the direct sell-offs (of public lands), but we probably didn’t anticipate how bad some of these other provisions would be,” Lien said. “To use a hunting term, I’d say the reconciliation bill passed by Congress has gutted public lands, in respect to extractive industries.”

The Bureau of Land Management declined an interview request for this article.

“The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a historic piece of legislation that will restore energy independence and make life more affordable for American families by reversing disastrous Biden-era policies that constricted domestic energy production,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a statement on Tuesday. “This marks a significant shift in how we manage our public lands, support energy development and work with local communities. The Department is proud to implement President Trump’s agenda and get the federal government back to working for the American people.”

Limited regulation

Federal lands used for oil and gas leasing are regulated by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management through a variety of means, including resource management plans, which are long-term land-use blueprints.

Prior to the signing of the GOP reconciliation bill, these plans served as a starting point for regulation, not a finish line. But the law has made it so the government “may not add new restrictions outside of the conditions of approval included in the resource management plans” for oil and gas leases, according to a Bureau of Land Management statement.

Allison Henderson, the southern Rockies director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said this provision poses a “significant risk” to the environment, water supplies and vulnerable species of animals that live on public lands, because resource management plans “do not provide kind of the nitty-gritty, site-specific types of mitigation measures that are necessary.”

Resource management plans are typically updated every 10 to 20 years, and a single plan can often cover a wide region spanning hundreds of thousands of acres. Henderson said this makes the plans not adaptive or area-specific enough to be adequate as the exclusive means for environmental regulation of oil and gas leases on federal lands.

“The RMPs are doing these broad, kind of general covers of big picture stuff,” Henderson said. “So this provision really seems to be like it’s trying to prevent anything more protective from going forward, which means that a lot will fall through the cracks.”

Lower royalty rate

Beyond its anticipated adverse effects on the climate, the law also decreases the revenue that states and the federal government bring in from leasing public lands for oil and gas extraction.

When federal land is leased for resource extraction, oil and gas companies must pay royalties to the government. The GOP law sets the royalty rate for new onshore oil and gas leases at 12.5%, which is below market rate and significantly lower than the Biden-era royalty rate of 16.67%. This change means the government is expected to earn billions of dollars less in royalties over the next decade.

Oil and gas lease royalties in Colorado are split roughly equally between the federal government and the state. In 2024, oil and gas lease royalties for onshore federal land in Colorado totaled $131 million, according to the U.S. Department of the Interior natural resource revenue database.

“In addition to being a significant attack on public lands, this is also going to be causing us to lose billions of dollars in royalties, and then who knows what the ultimate billion dollars of cost it’ll be as a result of the climate emissions that are going to end up happening because of these leases,” Henderson said.",https://www.realvail.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/oil-and-gas-near-parachute-2023.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 12:04:56.278788

Southeast Asia's energy landscape is undergoing a transition toward new energy, with China playing a pivotal role in advancing green development through sustainable solutions. One key example of this trend is the Monsoon Wind Power Project in Laos.

The first-phase 300 megawatt installation of the Monsoon Wind Power Project - a 600 megawatt wind power project in Laos and Asia's first cross-border new-energy transmission project built by PowerChina - recently began commercial operation, according to a release published on PowerChina's official website on Sunday.

This marks a milestone for the largest single-unit wind power project in Southeast Asia. It provides strong momentum for Laos' energy transition and cross-regional green power supply.

As Laos' first wind power project, its benefits extend beyond Laos. By connecting to Vietnam's grid, the Monsoon Wind Power Project plays a crucial role in regional energy security and contributes to Southeast Asia's green energy ambitions. It provides a stable, clean power supply and offers a concrete example of how renewable energy can be shared across borders, benefiting entire regions.

Leveraging its abundant hydro, wind, and solar energy resources, Laos has positioned itself as the ""battery of Southeast Asia"" and is fully committed to advancing the development of its power industry. Cooperation between China and Laos in the renewable energy sector is conducive to advancing related industries in Laos and boosting its electricity exports.

Laos is intensifying its efforts in the energy transition, with collaboration from China playing a key role in these initiatives. China has been a key partner in driving the development of renewable energy in Laos, providing expertise, technology, and investment. Cooperation between the two nations goes beyond wind power; Laos has also worked with China to develop its hydropower potential, which is among the major hydropower projects in the region.

For instance, the China General Nuclear Power Corporation's clean energy base in northern Laos is a key supporting power source for China-Laos power interconnection and integration. The project is planned as a large-scale clean energy base integrating wind and solar power.

China's involvement in the Southeast Asian renewable energy sector is part of a broader effort to promote green development. Over the years, China has become a global leader in renewable energy technologies, from solar panels and wind turbines to electric vehicles and energy storage systems. With its expertise and resources, China is helping Southeast Asian countries build the infrastructure needed to transition to a low-carbon economy.

China's ""carbon emission reduction capabilities"" are a key asset in this effort. The country has made significant progress in reducing its own carbon emissions through the deployment of renewable energy sources and the adoption of energy-efficient technologies. By exporting this technology and knowledge to countries like Laos, China is contributing to the region's green development and supporting the global effort to combat climate change.

Moreover, China's role in Southeast Asia's renewable energy sector is evolving toward building a full green value chain. This shift is creating jobs, supporting local talent development, and introducing green finance initiatives, with Chinese financial institutions offering loans for low-carbon projects.

From 2000 to 2020, China's public investment in renewable energy projects in ASEAN countries accounted for 60 percent of the total foreign public investment received by ASEAN during the same period, the Xinhua News Agency reported in September 2024.

At the same time, Chinese companies are transferring technologies and standards in wind, solar, and energy storage, enhancing local capacity to build and manage its own clean energy infrastructure.

Southeast Asia faces significant energy challenges, including rising demand for electricity, environmental concerns, and the need to reduce carbon emissions. At the same time, the region is rich in renewable energy resources, such as hydro, solar, and wind, which can provide a sustainable path forward. Through partnerships exemplified by the one between China and Laos, Southeast Asia is taking critical steps toward a more sustainable future.

This year's tally has already overtaken 2024's total of €185 million, which was the previous high watermark for European fusion funding, the publication said, citing Dealroom data.

Topping the list was Munich-based Proxima Fusion. It scored a record-high deal for a European fusion startup, raising €130 million in June.

The company is betting on a fusion device called a stellarator, an intricate, twisted ring of metal that founders hope could offer a more stable source of fusion energy than existing reactors.

Proxima cofounder Francesco Sciortino told The Next Web: ""Fusion holds the potential to fundamentally transform the way we think about energy, changing the world from a place that's controlled by those with reserves of oil and gas, to one where technology lets countries control their own fate.""

According to the International Atomic Energy Agency, nuclear fusion is the process of combining two light atoms, such as hydrogen, into a heavier one, which releases a huge amount of energy.

Watch now: Does clean energy really cause blackouts?

It's the same reaction that powers the sun. Scientists are working to recreate it and make it commercially viable on Earth, something that some experts think could happen in the 2030s.

The benefit of fusion is that it doesn't depend on the weather, like wind and solar energy production, meaning cheaper, more predictable clean power for everything from public transport to data centers to heating homes.

Unlike current nuclear power plants that use fission, which involves splitting atoms and results in radioactive waste, fusion does not create long-lasting harmful byproducts.

The second-biggest European fundraiser was Munich-based Marvel Fusion, which raised €113 million in a funding round in March, per The Next Web.

Marvel is developing a type of fusion that uses lasers to create extreme heat, causing atoms to fuse together and release energy.

Meanwhile, researchers in California achieved a fusion ignition in 2023, meaning they generated more energy than they used in the reaction.

While the technology is still a way off, experts think it could eventually become a source of virtually limitless clean energy — cutting out the need for carbon-emitting dirty fuels altogether and making the planet a healthier and safer place for generations to come.

Furthermore, Dadan emphasized the importance of industrial downstreaming and the development of clean energy ecosystems as drivers for job creation.
""Job opportunities exist not only in battery factories, but also in mining, raw material processing, to final products.
So, do not worry, the energy sector will become a new job creation locomotive in the future,"" he concluded.","TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - The Secretary General of the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Dadan Kusdiana, revealed that the energy sector is projected to create up to 6.2 million job opportunities. He stated that this estimate refers to the national energy project plans over the next five years.

""Currently, Indonesia has a 169 million productive-age population out of a total of 284 million. Approximately 7.27 million of them are still pursuing higher education or are unemployed. This is an opportunity that must be utilized by providing as many job opportunities, one of which is through the energy sector,"" as stated by Dadan in a written statement on Sunday, July 27, 2025.

On the other hand, Dadan explained that the potential for job creation in the energy sector is closely related to Indonesia's per capita electricity consumption. He acknowledged that the current employment in this sector is still minimal due to low electricity consumption.

Dadan stated that the current electricity consumption is only 1,337 kWh per year. This figure lags far behind Vietnam, which has reached 2,648 kWh. ""This means that we need to increase power plant capacity. The investment projection for green energy is expected to reach 42.6 gigawatts (GW) in the next 10 years, with an investment value of Rp1.682 trillion. These projects will create huge demand for labor,"" he said.

He added that apart from power plant construction, job opportunities also arise from supporting sectors such as production, services, logistics, and increasing domestic consumption.

Furthermore, Dadan emphasized the importance of industrial downstreaming and the development of clean energy ecosystems as drivers for job creation. He cited the recent laying of the first stone for the electric vehicle (EV) battery industry by President Prabowo Subianto.

According to Dadan, Indonesia has great potential to develop this sector as it is one of the countries with the largest nickel reserves in the world.

""Job opportunities exist not only in battery factories, but also in mining, raw material processing, to final products. This is also part of efforts to strengthen energy resilience and expand the use of clean energy,"" he said.

Dadan believes that the job creation effect is not limited only to the main sectors, such as power plants and mining. Energy projects will also trigger growth in other indirectly involved sectors, such as catering, logistics, banking, and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).

""If calculated comprehensively, based on simulations we have conducted, the total potential reaches 6.2 million people. So, do not worry, the energy sector will become a new job creation locomotive in the future,"" he concluded.

The EV play: Nio

Nio is a major Chinese EV maker which is gradually expanding into Europe. It differentiates itself from its competitors with its removable batteries, which can be quickly swapped out at its power swap stations across China and Europe. Its drivers can pay for those battery swaps individually or pay a monthly fee for lower rates.

Nio's namesake brand sells higher-end sedans and SUVs. Its newer Onvo and Firefly sub-brands sell cheaper SUVs and compact cars, respectively. From 2020 to 2024, Nio's annual deliveries rose more than fivefold, its revenue grew at a CAGR of 42%, and its number of year-end battery-swapping stations jumped from 155 to 3,445.

Most of its recent growth was driven by brisk sales of Nio's higher-end sedans, its gradual growth in Europe, and the recent launches of its Onvo and Firefly vehicles.

From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Nio's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 26% as it continues to grow its market share in China and disrupt the European market. It isn't profitable yet, but it's growing at an impressive rate for a stock which trades at less than one times this year's sales.

The hydrogen play: Plug Power

Plug Power is the world's largest pure play hydrogen charging and storage company. It mainly provides hydrogen fuel cells and charging stations for warehouse forklifts, and its top customers include Amazon and Walmart. It's already deployed more than 70,000 fuel cell systems and over 250 fueling stations across the world.

In 2024, Plug Power's revenue plunged 29% as its net loss widened. That decline was caused by the challenging macroheadwinds, which throttled the market's demand for new hydrogen-charging projects, and tough year-over-year comparisons to two big acquisitions (which expanded its smaller, cryogenic-systems business) in 2022 and 2023.

But from 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Plug's revenue to grow at a CAGR of 30% as the macroenvironment stabilizes and the hydrogen market heats up again. It also aims to narrow its losses with Project Quantum Leap, a cost-cutting plan aimed at reducing its expenditures by $150 million to $200 million each year.

A new $1.66 billion loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for the construction of six green hydrogen manufacturing plants should help it stay solvent as it tries to expand its business again. That outlook seems promising, yet Plug trades at less than three times this year's sales. Therefore, any positive news about the hydrogen market could drive its stock a lot higher.

The nuclear play: Cameco

Cameco, which is based in Canada, is the world's second-largest uranium miner after Kazakhstan's national miner Kazatomprom. It mined about 17% of the world's uranium in 2024, and it operates its mines and mills in Canada, the U.S., and Kazakhstan.

The company's revenue declined every year from 2011 to 2021. That decline started after the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which drove many countries to reevaluate their nuclear energy plans. As uranium's spot price plunged, Cameco suspended its biggest mines to conserve its cash. The COVID-19 pandemic then hampered its recovery.

But from 2021 to 2024, Cameco's revenue grew at a CAGR of 29% in Canadian dollar (CAD) terms as its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) surged at a CAGR of 206%. That recovery was driven by soaring uranium spot prices (which rose from $29.63 in January 2021 to $78.50 this June), its restarted mines, and its acquisition of a 49% stake in the nuclear power plant designer and builder Westinghouse Electric in late 2023.

Uranium's comeback was driven by the market's rising demand outstripping its tight supply, supply chain disruptions in Kazakhstan, Russia, and Niger, as well as the rapid growth of the power-hungry cloud and AI data center markets. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a CAGR of 8% (in CAD terms) as its adjusted EBITDA rises at a CAGR of 16%.

Those are impressive growth rates for a stock which trades at just 25 times this year's adjusted EBITDA, so Cameco's stock could still have plenty of room to run.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

The California Energy Commission (CEC) last month approved the Darden Clean Energy Project (DCEP), the first project under the state’s Opt-In Certification program.

The project will be the largest battery energy storage system in the world once it is built and will support the state’s progress to 100 percent clean electricity, according to state officials.

Projects seeking approval through the Opt-In Certification program are required to provide community and economic benefits agreements. Environmental justice groups had raised concerns whether the transition from agriculture to energy production would be equitable for the communities’ residents.

Enviromental advocates said the residents in the communities neighboring the project already face challenges such as undrinkable and unaffordable water, extreme heat, and historical disinvestment.

“We think clean energy is what we need. However, the way how you go into that transition and looking at the local impacts of those projects is something that we need to keep at the core of things,” said Nayamin Martinez executive director with the Central California Environmental Justice Network.

The approval of the solar project creates a precedent for the numerous other programs and projects what will be coming to the Valley, Martinez said.

The residents of the three predominantly Latino farmworkers communities formed Comunidades de Westside to advocate for their health and well-being and ensure there are benefits coming directly to their community from the nearby project.

Mariana Alvarenga, senior policy advocate with Leadership Counsel for Justice and Accountability, said residents asked the CEC not to approve the project at its June 11 meeting until residents agreed on the community benefits agreement plan with the developer. The agreement has since been finalized but it is not yet public.

The energy project is the first one to be approved under Assembly Bill 205’s “opt-in” permitting process that fast-tracks renewable energy development. Enviromental reviews must be completed within 270 days from when the project application is deemed complete.

More than 20 organizations across California supported Comunidades de Westside’s priorities, which included dust mitigation measures and for traffic to be rerouted during the construction of the project, which is estimated to take three years.

In a May letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom, CEC commissioners and environmental justice advocates urged the state Energy Commission to ensure that the Darden Clean Energy Project invests in community priorities and mitigate the impacts on nearby disadvantaged communities.

The residents and the organizations demanded “a just transition that centers community voices.”

Martinez said having strong community benefit agreements allows those companies to “demonstrate that they are going to be good neighbors by treating the residents that will be more affected in a just way.”

What is the Darden Clean Energy Project?

The DCEP project will be located four miles northwest of Five Points and three miles southeast of Cantua Creek and Westside Elementary School.

The solar power plant will be built on 9,500 acres of land in unincorporated western Fresno County that is no longer able to support agricultural production. The land was owned by the Westlands Water District.

The project, owned by IP Darden I, LLC, a subsidiary of Intersect Power, includes a 1,150-megawatt solar facility with approximately 3.1 million solar panels and up to 1,150 megawatts of battery storage, enough to power 850,000 homes for four hours.

Construction is projected to begin at the end of 2025, with the facility becoming fully operational in late 2027 or early 2028.

The project will create over 1,200 jobs during its peak construction phase and approximately 16 full-time operational positions, according to Elizabeth Knowles, head of community engagement for Intersect Power.

According to state officials, some of the community and economic benefits that DCEP is required to provide under the Opt-In Certification program includes:

$2 million in community investments over the next decade, starting with a $320,000 commitment to Centro La Familia Advocacy Services, a nonprofit supporting crime victims, family wellness, and civic engagement in rural communities.

More than 2,000 prevailing-wage construction jobs to support the local workforce throughout the construction period, which will last from 1.5 to 3 years.

An estimated $169 million in economic benefits to the local area over the project’s lifetime, estimated at 35 years.

This month, Intersect Power partnered with Centro La Familia to distribute air conditioning units to community members in Five Points and Cantua Creek affected by high temperatures. Approximately 250 units were distributed at both events.

The initiative was in direct response to community requests to address concerns about lack of cooling as part of the Darden Community Benefits plan, Knowles said.

Margarita Rocha, executive director with Centro La Familia, said the response from the community at the events was overwhelmingly positive.

CEC Commissioner Noemí Gallardo said the project “exemplifies a community-focused approach that advances the state’s energy goals while creating benefits for local workers and residents.”

Knowles said the project will commit $2 million over the first 10 years in direct community investments through our Community Benefits Plan, as well as $5 million over the lifetime of the project.

“Since 2023, we have had an ongoing commitment to being a strong partner to the region, working closely with local stakeholders to ensure the Darden Project delivers lasting benefits and truly elevates the communities closest to the site,” Knowles said.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/latest-news/e5fig5/picture310814285/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Solar%20Five%20point%20event%201S4A1311,N,,2025-07-27 09:59:45.114670

A recent breakthrough from South Korean researchers has ushered in a new era of possibilities with lithium-metal batteries. Known for their potential to significantly enhance energy capacity, these batteries have long been plagued by safety concerns and limited lifespan. However, the novel manufacturing method developed by the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT) could change the landscape, offering a promising path forward for long-range EVs and large-scale energy storage systems.

Understanding the Lithium-Metal Battery Breakthrough

The breakthrough centers on a revolutionary approach to manufacturing lithium-metal batteries, which are known for their theoretical energy capacity that surpasses conventional lithium-ion cells. Despite this potential, these batteries have been challenging to commercialize due to the risk of dendrite formation. Dendrites are needle-like structures that can grow during charge/discharge cycles, posing a significant risk of short-circuiting and fire hazards. The novel method developed by KRICT scientists involves a solvent-free, roll-based transfer printing technique that introduces a protective layer to the batteries.

By eliminating solvents that could damage the reactive lithium metal, this technique ensures a uniform coating and significantly enhances the stability of the cells. The protective layer combines ceramic and polymer components, which effectively safeguard the anodes from dendrite growth. The innovation not only boosts the lifespan of these batteries but also makes them safer for widespread use in EVs, representing a significant leap forward in battery technology.

The Impact of the New Manufacturing Method

The implications of this breakthrough are far-reaching. By addressing the critical issue of dendrite formation, the manufacturing method paves the way for more reliable and efficient energy storage solutions. In tests, the batteries equipped with the new protective layer maintained 81.5% of their initial capacity after 100 charge-discharge cycles. Even under high-rate discharge conditions, where the battery is fully depleted in nine minutes, the cells retained 74.1% of their capacity, demonstrating remarkable resilience.

This advancement not only enhances the performance of lithium-metal batteries but also opens up new possibilities for their application in various sectors. From long-range electric vehicles to large-scale energy storage systems, the potential uses are vast and varied. By providing a scalable solution to a longstanding challenge, this innovation could significantly boost Korea’s competitiveness in the global battery industry, positioning it as a leader in high-energy-density battery technology.

Applications Beyond Electric Vehicles

While electric vehicles stand to benefit immensely from this breakthrough, the impact extends beyond the automotive industry. The enhanced stability and energy capacity of lithium-metal batteries make them suitable for solid-state and lithium-sulfur batteries, which are integral to advanced energy storage systems. These systems are crucial for managing energy produced from renewable sources, providing a stable supply even during peak demand.

Additionally, researchers in China are exploring complementary innovations, such as lithium-metal batteries with built-in flame suppressants. These prototypes incorporate polymers that release fire-inhibiting chemicals when temperatures rise, acting as a safeguard against potential thermal runaway. Such innovations highlight the global momentum towards safer, more efficient battery technologies, emphasizing the collaborative efforts driving progress in this field.

In past conference cities — including resort areas and playgrounds for the rich such as Bali, Cancun, Paris, Sharm El-Sheikh and Dubai — host nations show off both their amenities and what their communities have done about climate change. But this fall’s conference is in a high-poverty city on the edge of the Amazon to demonstrate what needs to be done, said the diplomat who will run the mega-negotiations in Belem known as COP30, or Conference of Parties.

What better way to tackle a problem than facing it head on, however uncomfortable, COP30 President-designate André Corrêa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, said in an interview with The Associated Press at United Nations headquarters.

“We cannot hide the fact that we are in the world with lots of inequalities and where sustainability and fighting climate change is something that has to get closer to people,” do Lago said. That’s what Brazilian President President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has in mind, he said.

“When people will go to Belem, you are going to see a developing country and city with considerable infrastructure issues still with, in relative terms, a high percentage of poverty and President Lula thinks it’s very important that we talk about climate thinking of all the forests, thinking of poverty and thinking of progress,” do Lago said. “He wants everybody to see a city that can improve thanks to the results of these debates.”

The rich and powerful — as well as poorer nations, activists and media — are already feeling a bit of that discomfort even before getting to Belem. Even with two years of notice, Brazil is way behind in having enough hotel rooms and other accommodations for a global conference that has had 90,000 attendees.

The official United Nations COP30 website says Brazil would have an official booking portal by the end of April. But specific plans weren’t announced till last week when Brazil said it arranged for two cruise ships with 6,000 beds to help with lodging, saying the country is ensuring “accommodation for all countries” and starting a system where 98 poorer nations have the option to reserve first.

Skyrocketing lodging costs are a problem, do Lago conceded. Some places have been charging $15,000 a night for one person and activists and others have talked of cutting back. But he said prices “are already going down,” even as local media report otherwise.

Do Lago said it will be a local holiday so residents can rent out their homes, adding “a significant supply of apartments.”

Big year for climate negotiations

This is a significant year for climate negotiations. The 2015 Paris climate agreement required countries to come up with their own plans to reduce the emissions of heat-trapping gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas and then to update those plans every five years.

This year nearly every nation — the United States, the No. 2 carbon dioxide emitter and historically biggest polluter, withdrew from the accord earlier this year — has to submit their first plan update. Most of those updates are already late, but the United Nations wants countries to complete them by September when world leaders gather in New York. That would give the United Nations time to calculate how much they would curb future climate change if implemented — before the COP six weeks later.

UN Secretary-General Antonio-Guterres, in an interview with AP, reiterated what officials want in those plans: that they cover each nation’s entire economy, that they include all greenhouse gases and that they are in line with efforts to limit long-term human-caused warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times. That target is the Paris agreement goal. And it’s tough since the world is only a couple of tenths of a degree away and last year even temporarily shot past the 1.5 degree mark.

Do Lago said he expects the countries’ plans will fall short of keeping warming below the 1.5 degree mark, so tackling that gap will be a crucial element of negotiations.

Some big things aren’t on agenda, like $1.3 trillion for poorer nations

Some of the negotiations’ most important work won’t be on the formal agenda, including these plans, do Lago said. Another is a road map to provide $1.3 trillion in financial help to poorer nations in dealing with climate change. And finally, he said, Brazil “wants very much to talk about nature, about forests.”

The nearby Amazon has been an important part of Earth’s natural system to suck large amounts of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, but deforestation is a major threat to that. At times, parts of the Amazon have gone from reducing carbon dioxide in the air to increasing it, a 2021 study found.

On Wednesday, the United Nation’s top court ruled that a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right, a decision that may bolster efforts to come up with stronger action at the November climate conference, some activists said.

“Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system … may constitute an internationally wrongful act,” court President Yuji Iwasawa said during the hearing.

Do Lago said the challenge for countries is to think of these emission-reduction plans not as a sacrifice but as a moment to change and grow.

“One of the objectives of this COP is that we hope we will be remembered as a COP of solutions, a COP in which people realized that this agenda is creating more opportunities and challenges,” do Lago said.

Alphabet's AI-led growth and Tesla's EV struggles highlight the sector's bifurcation.","The AI and electric vehicle (EV) sectors have long been the twin engines of tech market euphoria, but Q2 2025 earnings reports reveal a stark divergence in their trajectories. Alphabet's robust growth in AI and cloud computing contrasts sharply with Tesla's struggles in the EV market, while Trump-era trade policies add a layer of geopolitical volatility to both. Investors now face a critical question: Are the current market highs for these sectors sustainable, or are they built on fragile foundations of speculative optimism?

Alphabet: AI's Golden Child

Alphabet's Q2 2025 results underscore its dominance in AI-driven innovation. Revenue rose 14% year-over-year to $96.4 billion, with Google Cloud surging 32% to $13.6 billion. The company's AI tools, such as Gemini (450 million monthly users) and AI Overviews (2 billion users), are not just enhancing user engagement but also monetizing through cloud infrastructure and enterprise partnerships.

Alphabet's forward P/S ratio of 6.43X may seem lofty, but its strategic investments justify scrutiny. The company increased 2025 capital expenditures to $85 billion, driven by AI infrastructure demand. Sundar Pichai's emphasis on AI integration across search, YouTube, and cloud services reflects a long-term vision that could sustain growth. However, Trump's tariffs on semiconductors and copper—affecting data center costs—pose a risk. The EU's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods could further pressure European ad revenue. Investors must weigh Alphabet's AI monetization potential against these macroeconomic headwinds.

Tesla: EV Market Struggles and AI Hopes

Tesla's Q2 2025 earnings tell a tale of waning automotive dominance and unproven AI ambition. Automotive revenue fell 16% to $16.7 billion, with deliveries dropping 14% to 384,000 units. Regulatory credit revenue plummeted to $439 million, and the company's trailing P/E of 189.05 hinges on the success of robotaxi and Optimus robots.

While Musk touts Austin's robotaxi tests as a “future cash cow,” the reality is more complex. Tesla's core automotive business faces pricing pressures, supply chain bottlenecks, and the expiration of U.S. EV tax credits by September 2025. Trump's 145% tariffs on Chinese EV components have driven battery costs up by over 160%, squeezing margins. The company's delayed Model 2 and competition from Chinese automakers like BYD (which surpassed Tesla in global EV sales in Q4 2024) further cloud its prospects.

Trump Trade Deals: A Double-Edged Sword

The Trump administration's reciprocal tariffs, averaging 26% on key partners, have created a trade war-like environment. For Alphabet, this means higher costs for semiconductors and copper, critical for AI infrastructure. For Tesla, tariffs on Chinese battery components and the EU's retaliatory 30% tariffs on U.S. goods threaten to erode its already thin margins.

The administration's anti-EV policies—eliminating the $7,500 federal tax credit and easing fuel economy standards—add to the uncertainty. While Tesla's FSD software revenue grew 35% quarter-over-quarter, its near-term profitability remains in question. Meanwhile, Alphabet's cloud business, less exposed to physical trade, is better positioned to weather the storm.

Investment Implications: Balancing AI's Promise with Macro Risks

The sustainability of AI and EV market highs hinges on two factors: the pace of AI monetization and the resolution of trade tensions. Alphabet's premium valuation is justified if its cloud and AI infrastructure dominate the $1.2 trillion AI market. However, investors should monitor the EU's retaliatory measures and the U.S. dollar's strength, which could pressure European ad revenue.

For Tesla, the focus must shift from speculative AI bets to tangible automotive turnaround. The company's robotaxi ambitions require not just technological execution but also regulatory approval and consumer adoption. Given its stretched valuation, a diversified approach—hedging with short-term options or diversifying into AI-driven services—may mitigate downside risks.

Conclusion: A Divided Tech Landscape

The AI and EV sectors are no longer monoliths. Alphabet's AI-led growth and Tesla's EV struggles highlight the sector's bifurcation. While Trump's tariffs have exacerbated these divides, the long-term potential of AI remains compelling. Investors should prioritize companies with defensible cash flows and lower trade exposure, while maintaining a cautious stance on EVs until supply chain resilience and policy clarity emerge. In this volatile landscape, adaptability—not just in technology but in portfolio strategy—will define success.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 14:01:47.160001

1. Vice President Sara Duterte’s Trial: Is it Dead in the Water

The next round of the Marcos-Duterte family feud was expected to play out in Congress. But the Dutertes scored a win—and the possibility of a reprieve until February 2026 or even longer—in Friday’s Supreme Court ruling that temporarily banned an impeachment trial.

The Marcos-controlled House impeached Duterte last February, but a divided Senate has been delaying a trial, citing technicalities and remanding the impeachment complaint to the House.

Now the high court has unanimously ruled that the House impeachment complaint, filed on February 5, was invalid because the constitution bans the filing of an impeachment complaint against the same official during a one-year period. (The court said that last December, the House already archived—and dismissed—three impeachment complaints filed by private citizens against the vice-president.)

Some observers say that the ruling signals a thawing of the Marcos-Duterte family feud—a sign of a truce that allows the Marcoses to ease the growing tensions between the two families.

So will the trial even take place?

Does a Congress in thrall to the country’s two most powerful families have the gumption to hold Sara Duterte to account for allegedly misusing more than P600 million in confidential funds, making death threats against the President and his family members, and for possible involvement in drug-war related killings?

How will the tiny progressive bloc in the 20th Congress, caught between two feuding families, play its cards? And what does all this mean for the country’s tarnished record of accountability?

2. Budget Meetings Behind Closed Doors: Time to Let the Public in?

The 2025 national budget, critics said, was the “most corrupt” in Philippine history. They flagged the huge cuts to the Department of Education and zero funds for the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation even as public money was directed to pork-barrel type projects that fattened the legislators’ patronage pots in an election year. These include increased funding for public works projects and cash aid programs.

Most of this redirection took place in secret bicameral meetings between the House and the Senate. At least three petitions challenging the budget’s constitutionality are now in the Supreme Court.

Good governance advocate Cielo Magno is pushing an #OpenBicam campaign to open closed-door bicam meetings—the most secretive stage of the budget process—to the public.

Leyte Rep. Martin Romualdez, who is poised to retain his position as house speaker, expressed openness to the proposal. Some senators have also voiced support.

But is Congress ready for transparency?

3. The Quadcom’s Next Act: What’s on the Agenda?

The most sensational public hearings in the 19th Congress were held by the “quadcom,” four House committees that held joint hearings into the police reward system during former president Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war and cracked open the workings of POGOs, illegal gaming operations said to be hubs for online scams and human trafficking.

Live coverage of the quadcom hearings was avidly watched online and on TV. A high point was when Duterte threatened to hit former Senator Antonio Trillanes IV during one of the hearings. The House panel also got Duterte to say he took full responsibility for the killings.

The quadcom ended its hearings with the five proposed bills on extrajudicial killings, POGOs, land fraud, identity falsification and espionage.

The quadcom is expected to reconvene and expand its focus to other issues, including the case of the missing cockfighters and online gambling regulation.

Will the quadcom continue to generate interest? And will its hearing produce real changes, not just political theater?

4. Congress Leadership: Will Romualdez and Escudero retain their positions?

The 20th Congress, like the 19th, will likely be a battleground between the two most powerful families in the country—the Marcoses and the Dutertes.

As House Speaker during the 19th Congress, presidential cousin Romualdez presided over the Duterte impeachment, passed a controversial budget, and approved a proposed constitutional amendment easing restrictions on foreign ownership of local businesses.

The Marcos government’s ability to advance its political and legislative agenda hinges on whether Romualdez can keep being Speaker. So far, reports say he has the votes of at least 291 out of 317 representatives despite grumblings from lawmakers from Visayas and Mindanao, known Duterte bailiwicks.

In the Senate, Escudero and Sotto have butted heads over the stalled impeachment trial. Sotto has also raised concerns over budget insertions that were supposedly intended to get some senators to support Escudero’s leadership.

5. A Long-Sought Reform: Will We Finally Get an Anti-Dynasty Law?

In 1987, the Philippines was emerging from dictatorship and entering a new era of restored democracy—one that promised to break away from the elite rule that marked Ferdinand Marcos Sr.’s regime.

The Constitution ratified that year mandated Congress to pass a law prohibiting political dynasties. But nearly four decades later, no such law still exists and families rule.

The result of the last midterm elections confirm the increasing hold of families: 19 of the 24 senators and 80% of district representatives come from political clans. In addition, at least 18 obese political dynasties, families that have four or more elective positions, are now in power.

Despite this, electoral reform advocates, who have long opposed political dynasties, noted small signs of progress: Some challengers won against dynasties, others came close, and a few longstanding clans lost seats.

Some lawmakers—including Erwin Tulfo, himself from a political family—have voiced support for reviving efforts to pass an anti-dynasty law, following strong advocacy against families during the campaign.

“Pocket rescissions, I think, are unconstitutional,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a spending cardinal, this week.
“Like that’s the concept behind a pocket rescission.

), a senior appropriator and former attorney, said this week when asked by reporters whether pocket rescissions were legal.","Some Republicans in Congress are uneasy about the possibility the Trump administration will use a “pocket rescission” to claw back already approved government funding as fears of a fall shutdown rise.

The Trump administration has already clawed back funds through the use of a rescissions package that passed both chambers of Congress, and some GOP lawmakers are concerned about having to vote on a second, possibly politically tougher, package of cuts.

But these lawmakers say the use of pocket rescissions, an idea floated by the White House’s budget chief that could yank back money without input from lawmakers, could create bad feelings not only with Democrats, but also with Republicans.

“Pocket rescissions, I think, are unconstitutional,” said Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), a spending cardinal, this week. “So, just like impoundment, I think, is unconstitutional.”

“So we’ll see how it goes,” he said.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought referred to pocket rescissions as “one of the executive tools” that are “on the table” earlier this month, as the administration continues a sweeping operation aimed at reducing federal spending.

“The president was elected to get us to balance, to deal with our fiscal situation, and we’re going to use all of the tools that are there depending on the situation, and as we move through the year,” he said at an event.

However, he also noted then that the administration hasn’t yet “made a determination to use it in part because we’re making progress during the normal course of business with Congress.”

Trump became the first president in decades to successfully claw back funds through the special rescissions process, with the GOP-led Congress agreeing to pull back about $9 billion in previously allocated funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting.

The Impoundment Control Act (ICA) lays out rules governing that process and allows the administration to temporarily withhold funding for 45 days while Congress considers the request. If Congress opts not to approve the request in the timeframe, the funds must be released.

Under a pocket rescission, however, experts say the president would send the same type of request to Congress, but do so within 45 days of the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. The targeted funds could then essentially be held until the clock runs out and they expire.

Vought has described the tactic as “no different than a normal rescission, except for the timing of when it occurs.”

“A pocket rescission occurs later in the end of the fiscal year, within 45 days of the time that you have to hold the funding, and then the money evaporates at the end of the fiscal year,” he said.

But some budget experts have strongly pushed back on the budget chief’s characterization, arguing the tactic is “illegal” and undermines the intent of the ICA. The Government Accountability Office also said during Trump’s first presidential term that the law does not allow “the withholding of funds through their date of expiration.”

“It is a method through which [Vought] would get to impound funds against congressional intent,” said Bobby Kogan, a former Senate budget aide and senior director of federal budget policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, in a recent interview.

“Pocket rescission says, ‘Well, what if I send up a request 45 days before the end of the fiscal year, then even if Congress says no, I can still end all funding for the rest of the year, right?’” he argued. “Like that’s the concept behind a pocket rescission. Profoundly illegal because it would allow you to impound funds without congressional approval, which is illegal.”

At the same time, other experts have argued impoundment law is murky on the matter and have described the tactic as a potential loophole. Some have defended the administration’s interpretation of the law and argue lawmakers would have prohibited the maneuver over the years if they wanted to.

Not all Republicans are certain about the legality of the use of pocket rescissions, however.

“I don’t know. I haven’t researched it,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), a senior appropriator and former attorney, said this week when asked by reporters whether pocket rescissions were legal. “I’d prefer that we not do it that way.”

The Louisiana Republican, who has been pushing for the White House to work with Congress to get more rescissions packages out the door, instead said it “wouldn’t bother” him if the administration sent “a rescission package a week and spell out in detail what they want to propose we cut.”

There’s been concern from members on both sides of the aisle that the administration’s plans to continue to claw back federal funding with only GOP support could threaten bipartisan funding talks for fiscal 2026.

But Republican rifts over the president’s latest rescissions requests were also an issue.

The party clashed over potential cuts to programs like the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and public broadcasting dollars that help fund not only PBS and NPR, but also local stations some Republicans say their constituents depend on.

Under the pocket rescissions strategy, experts say the administration could reduce some funding by strategically holding up appropriations set to expire at the end of the fiscal year.

If Congress chooses not to approve the administration’s request for cuts, it could still provide funding for the program as part of a deal to keep the government open past September. Congress often opts to keep government funding levels mostly the same at the start of a new fiscal year to buy time for a larger deal updating funding levels.

But experts have emphasized that would be “new funding,” noting funding an account was denied at the end of the fiscal year as part of a pocket rescission likely would not roll over into the next.

Asked whether another rescissions plan could worsen the outlook for a funding deal for fiscal 2026, House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said this week that “the only thing that would worry me is if Congress didn’t get a chance to vote on it, that’s the key thing.”

“I don’t want to see things up here that get jammed where Congress doesn’t vote.”

Cole was asked whether he was referring to pocket rescissions.

“I don’t care procedurally what you want to call it,” he responded. “I expect Congress to vote on these things, and you know that would worry me, and I know that would worry my colleagues in the other chamber, on both sides of the aisle, certainly worry my Democratic colleagues here.”

“And there’s a lot of Republican concern about this too,” he added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Pocket-rescission_072725_AP_Scott-Applewhite.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-27 10:00:22.044926

DOE’s announcement follows an April Request for Information from the White House identifying 16 potential Department?owned sites for AI data center build?out. The agency evaluated thousands of acres of federal land focusing on areas able to support rapid construction and co?located power infrastructure.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the selections are part of a strategy to “accelerate the next Manhattan Project,” citing strong suitability for hosting data centers alongside power generation to boost grid reliability, enhance national security, and reduce energy costs.

DOE plans to invite private sector partners to develop cutting?edge AI data centers and energy projects at SRS and the other sites. Solicitations are expected in the coming months, with partner selections potentially complete by the end of 2025.

While limited details have been released specifically for Savannah River, DOE emphasized that all four sites are “well?situated for large?scale data centers, new power generation, and other necessary infrastructure.” DOE further stated that it will consult with local governments, federally recognized tribes, and the public during project planning.

These developments align with the Trump administration’s executive orders issued in July, which aim to streamline federal permitting for data center infrastructure, promote advanced nuclear reactor deployment, and leverage federal land for energy?AI development.

Construction on selected sites, including SRS, was initially projected to begin as early as late 2025, with targeted completion set for the end of 2027. DOE noted that additional federal sites may be evaluated in the future, potentially expanding this initiative beyond the initial four locations.

This has been demonstrated by the production of near-pure hydrogen from a single gas field in Mali, attracting the attention of governments in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom and Europe.

There is also interest from major venture capital investors and international resource companies. By the end of 2023, 40 companies were exploring natural hydrogen globally. That has likely doubled since 2024.

Hydrogen as a resource

Hydrogen resources have long been a multi-billion-dollar market, even before recent interest in hydrogen as a contributor to the green energy transition. The environments and conditions that result in natural hydrogen accumulation occur globally. But one of the barriers to investment in many jurisdictions is regulatory, as hydrogen had not previously been considered as a resource.

Natural hydrogen can be used to decarbonize hard-to-abate but globally critical industries. Industries that use hydrogen include fuel refining (about 44 per cent), ammonia and fertilizer production for food sustainability (about 34 per cent), and steel manufacturing (about five per cent).

According to a recent British government policy briefing document, addressing this requires governments to include hydrogen as a listed natural resource. Future uses for hydrogen may include long-distance transportation and contributions to the decarbonization of the mining industry.

High carbon footprint

Most of the hydrogen used today is produced from fossil fuels. Because of this, hydrogen production contributes about 2.5 per cent of global carbon dioxide emissions. Efforts to produce low-carbon (green) hydrogen from renewable electricity and carbon capture and storage technologies remain expensive.

Natural hydrogen has a carbon footprint comparable to or below that of green hydrogen. The two will likely be complementary, but estimates are uncertain as natural hydrogen is as yet an unproven resource.

Developing strategies could determine whether hydrogen from any source is an economically viable resource. For natural hydrogen, exploration strategies have to be developed to find and extract natural deposits of hydrogen at an economically feasible cost. This also needs incentives that include natural hydrogen in exploration or production licenses.

Hydrogen and helium

The U.S. Geological Survey recently estimated there’s enough accessible natural hydrogen to supply global hydrogen demand for about 200 years.

Hydrogen forms in the Earth’s crust through two natural geological processes: chemical reactions between natural groundwaters and iron-rich minerals and water radiolysis. Water molecules are broken by natural background radioactivity in rocks releasing hydrogen — and helium, a valuable element included in Canada’s Critical Minerals Strategy — as a byproduct.

The search for helium began in Canada in the 1920s, but it is only recently that systematic commercial exploration for helium has restarted. By the 1980s, systematic studies of natural hydrogen began in Canada, Finland and parts of Africa as part of research on subsurface microbial life.

Renewed interest

An unusual coincidence sparked the current global interest in hydrogen. An accidental discovery of the small natural hydrogen gas field in Mali coincided with the publication of extensive historical data from the former Soviet Union, drawing attention to hydrogen’s immense potential as a clean power resource. Australia, France and the U.S. were among the first countries to re-investigate historical natural hydrogen.

Natural hydrogen and helium systems have similarities to petroleum systems, requiring a source rock, a migration pathway and accumulation in a reservoir. The infrastructure for natural hydrogen wells would be comparable to hydrocarbon wells, albeit with changes in well completion and drilling methods.

The footprint of a natural hydrogen production project would take up much less space to deliver the same amount of energy compared to a green hydrogen production facility, which requires solar or wind farms and electrolyzers.

Similarly, natural hydrogen projects do not need to draw on surface water resources, which are scarce in many parts of the world.

Future policies

Some jurisdictions lack policies regulating hydrogen exploration. In others, regulation falls under existing mining or hydrocarbon policies. The lack of clear regulations in areas with high potential for natural hydrogen exploration — such as the U.S., Canada, India and parts of Africa and Europe — is a major obstacle for exploration.

An absence of regulation slows down exploration and land acquisition, and prevents the decision-making required for developing infrastructure. And critically, it means that no community consultations are undertaken to ensure the social acceptance essential for the success of such projects.

A project in South Australia demonstrates what legislation can accomplish. Once regulation of natural hydrogen exploration and capture was implemented, the government received dozens of applications from companies interested in natural hydrogen exploration.

The appetite for exploration is clearly there, but policy and regulatory solutions are required. New exploration projects will provide critical new data to understand natural hydrogen’s potential to provide green energy.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/679937/original/file-20250714-56-1zz59o.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C33%2C6914%2C3457&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-07-27 10:59:36.242100

High-voltage DC, however, can only be optimized by studying the electric network as a whole.
The Europeans formed a consortium, “Friends Of The Supergrid,” in 2006 to consider a high-voltage DC supergrid over their 540 GW AC grid.
But the U.S. has not taken full advantage of high-voltage DC capability and other important new technologies.
We need a program to upgrade the national electric grid, which should include three critical elements.","U.S. electricity demand is rising rapidly, and all the while the electric system is operating closer to its physical limits, causing more frequent system disturbances. These problems will increase in number and severity if we continue down our current path.

Most national attention has focused on the need for additional generation. However, the power produced by these generators cannot be delivered to the trillions of devices that use this energy without a robust network of transmission lines that links generators to local distribution networks throughout the country.

The current patchwork legacy system of jurisdictional responsibilities and competing state interests bottlenecks the needs of the 21st century electric economy. Transmission siting approvals are shared among many redundant decisionmakers based on laws enacted when interstate transmission was in its infancy. The result is that sub-regional decisions are made that fail to take full consideration of the advantages, economies of scale and the best new technologies that benefit the interconnection as a whole.

A high-voltage direct current (or DC) transmission system, for example, can overlay the alternating current or AC grid, providing significantly more capacity to move power large distances to users. High-voltage DC, however, can only be optimized by studying the electric network as a whole.

The average age of our transmission lines is between 40 and 50 years. Obtaining required approvals of new projects can take decades, and lines proposed to meet minimum reliability requirements are often rejected for political reasons or abandoned by their proponents as costs and delays accumulate. As the grid is stretched closer to its physical limits, lower-cost generators operating below their full capability cannot help regions in distress because of the delivery limitations of the AC system.

As recently observed, the Northeast operated near critical limits during an extended heat wave, while generation in neighboring areas couldn’t be delivered to alleviate the concern. NERC, the national agency responsible for reliability of the high voltage electric system, stated in its 2024 Reliability Report that 35 GWs of additional transfer capability was needed throughout the national grid.

Electricity does not flow over transmission lines like water or natural gas through pipes. Changes in supply or demand and other system conditions instantaneously impact power flows across the entire Eastern (600GWs), Western (160GWs) and Texas (95 GWs) AC interconnections based on physical laws unique to electricity.

This speed-of-light delivery must be kept in balance between power sources and uses at all times, while maintaining a constant frequency of 60 hertz and ensuring that the amount of energy transmitted does not exceed the capacity of any individual transmission line in the interconnection. Every second, complex computer programs surveil every source, line and use to identify limitations that result from system changes so that operators can respond effectively.

Because every change affects the entire AC network, complex, protracted studies must be made for all system additions, slowing down the ability to keep up with requests to connect to the system.

The Chinese and Europeans have long recognized these same problems.

In 2005, the Chinese began to overlay their 1300 GW AC grid with an high-voltage DC system, creating a hybrid grid that currently consists of 55 HVDC lines with a combined 170 GWs of transfer capacity. Another 27 GWs is under construction. Many of China’s high-voltage DC lines are more than 1,500 miles long, and a new 12 GW line is over 2,100 miles long, which is like connecting California to the MidAtlantic.

The Europeans formed a consortium, “Friends Of The Supergrid,” in 2006 to consider a high-voltage DC supergrid over their 540 GW AC grid. Europe also established ENTSOe, a group of all transmission owners, to study their collective transmission needs and coordinate a unified plan with the European Union.

But the U.S. has not taken full advantage of high-voltage DC capability and other important new technologies. In 2016, Alexander Macdonald published a study based on 10 years of NOAA supercomputer analysis of system conditions and weather patterns, which concluded that every dollar of high-voltage DC investment would produce $3 of benefits while also substantially reducing carbon emissions.

Opportunities also exist to replace existing conductors with composite core conductors, which would substantially increase the carrying capacity of existing lines. And a new technology known as grid-forming inverters can detect system anomalies in milliseconds, providing immediate benefits to real time grid reliability. This capability is especially important as more “rotating iron” is reaching the end of its useful life.

If these matters are not addressed, America will not have the energy to meet the needs of a growing economy. We need a program to upgrade the national electric grid, which should include three critical elements.

First, like the establishment of the transcontinental railroad and interstate highway system, America needs to build a national, preferably buried, network of high-voltage DC lines that overlays the existing AC network. In addition to the physical security and environmental advantages, buried high-voltage DC lines can be placed in the same Right of Way as existing AC transmission lines.

Second, the transfer capacity of the existing AC network should be improved by hot line conversion, without taking any line outages, to composite core conductors on crucial circuits.

Third, the advantages of grid-forming inverters to real-time grid reliability are intuitively obvious; installation of these devices should be a priority.

With rapidly rising demand, the future is coming at us quickly, and we are not ready for it. These three priorities, effectively implemented, would assist in ensuring that there is sufficient reliable energy to meet the growth needs of the American economy.

Periods of vigorous activity have been followed by periods of re-evaluation and assessment.

It seems that with the cancellation of the ambitious Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the state is now turning the page on another era in its continuing battle to find the best ways to restore its coast.

As this newspaper has long supported the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion, we lament that we won't see the fruits of this painstakingly planned coastal restoration project. But we respect that there were legitimate concerns about the project's $3 billion price tag and its potential effects on commercial oyster growers and shrimpers along the coast.

Though this chapter is at an end, the state should not retreat from its wetlands-replenishment efforts, but instead should redouble them.

Fortunately, there’s more than just one way to address our coastal issues.

The state’s series of successive, six-year Master Plans for coastal rehabilitation have identified numerous means of successfully retarding and in some cases, reversing marshland loss. Among them are the three big approaches of diversions, drainage and dredging, but also in the mix are oyster-reef reconstruction, man-made berms and breakwaters, and more. The 2023 Master Plan has identified a plethora of possible projects worthy of implementation, often in specific locations and with a high level of confidence.

With the Mid-Barataria project now shelved, money originally slated for that huge project may be available for repurposing in dozens of smaller initiatives. Officials should quickly convene to decide which existing plans should be sped up or expanded, which new projects can now be funded and what other ideas new science or research may offer.

Alas, some $600 million already has been spent on the Mid-Barataria project. The Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority will need to see if any of the work already done can be salvaged. The state says it hopes to build what's known as the Myrtle Grove project, a diversion around a quarter of the size, and a large-scale land bridge in the Barataria Basin using dredged sediment.

Whatever happens next, it also helps to know that language in the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act will direct as much as $50 million in additional funds to Louisiana for coastal protection each year. This means the CPRA happily will have more to work with than it could count on back when the 2023 Master Plan was adopted.

Louisiana's land loss isn't going away, so we must keep pressing forward. With the Mid-Barataria's loss, a host of other opportunities now arise, just as we want new wetlands to arise in areas previously lost to the sea. State officials should move smartly and expeditiously to seize the day.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/82/38227080-58f7-11ef-bf8d-13bc606ed204/66ba878d5b696.image.png?crop=1233%2C647%2C0%2C21&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-07-27 12:06:03.450284

Two versions of the same measure were filed with Legislative Council Staff last week by retired contractor Donald Hanneman from Castle Rock and retired tech executive Michael A. Hancock from Aurora. One includes a 10-year sunset. The initial review and comment meeting is set for August 1.

“We need to redirect existing fees back to roads, which is the cornerstone of our economic development,” Weld County Commissioner Kevin Ross said in a statement in support of the initiative.

Roads and other transportation infrastructure is funded through a combination of federal, state and local government revenue in Colorado. A lot of that state transportation funding comes from the gas tax and vehicle registration fees — money that is already constitutionally required to go into the Highway Users Tax Fund and toward the construction and maintenance of public highways.

For the current fiscal year, there is projected to be about $1.3 billion in the HUTF to distribute to various entities. About half of that will go to the transportation department and smaller shares are slated for counties and municipalities.

The proposed ballot measure would require that all sales taxes, tolls and fees imposed on cars and gas, retail delivery fees and ride-share fees go towards roads and bridges, ultimately pulling money from the state’s recent efforts to encourage different modes of travel and mitigate environmental impacts from car use.

Now is the time for states like Colorado to protect the policies we have and, if anything, compensate for the lack of federal support for things like electric vehicles and public transit.

Since landmark 2021 transportation legislation, a handful of fees and enterprise funds have partially funded projects like electrifying vehicle fleets, encouraging multimodal transit and installing electric vehicle charging stations.

Colorado’s prearranged ride fee, for example, is either 18 cents or 34 cents, depending on vehicle type, and is imposed on rides from companies like Uber and Lyft. It funds transit expansions, electric vehicle adoption strategies and air pollution mitigation.

The 28-cent retail delivery fee is allocated to multimodal transportation options, state highways and electrification efforts. It raised close to $93 million in 2024. A little less than 30 percent of that fee revenue goes to the Multimodal Transportation and Mitigation Options Fund, and the rest goes to HUTF.

But measure backers say that about $200 million in transportation fees, such as the prearranged ride fee and delivery fee, are being directed away from road maintenance to funnel money towards mass transit projects in the Denver metro area. They want that to go to fixing the roads Colorado drivers use.

The budget passed during the most recent legislative session cut nearly $114 million in transportation funding to help fill a $1.2 billion budget hole. A coalition of elected officials and business groups urged lawmakers not to make those cuts, and some of them are now backing the potential ballot measure.

“The lack of transportation funding has reached a point of critical concern. In order for Colorado to stay competitive, we need funding for roads and bridges infrastructure that meets the needs of our industries that operate statewide,” Loren Furman, president and CEO of the Colorado Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement. “Sustainable solutions are critical for ensuring that Colorado is a place that attracts businesses and workers.”

The measure would also require that federal funds meant for car use and two-thirds of sales tax collected on car parts and accessories go toward road maintenance.

Matt Frommer, the transportation and land use policy manager at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project said the initiative would be a move in the wrong direction, especially as the federal government rolls back policies like electric vehicle incentives.

“Now is the time for states like Colorado to protect the policies we have and, if anything, compensate for the lack of federal support for things like electric vehicles and public transit,” he said. “There’s a real risk here of abandoning these efforts at all levels of government right at a time when they’re starting to pick up and gain some traction.”

He said the impact of such an initiative could be fewer transit options, increased car dependence and more traffic congestion on the state’s roads.

The measure’s proponents have a long road to landing the issue on the ballot, including getting a title set by the state Title Board, getting approved for a petition and gathering enough signatures. As a constitutional amendment, it would need 55 percent of the vote to pass.",http://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-07-27 14:02:27.830257

Can the Rooftop Solar Industry Make Up for Lost Tax Credits by Cutting Costs?
One of the big questions as tax credits are about to expire is whether the rooftop solar industry will be able to adjust.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

Consumers are facing a Sept. 30 deadline to be eligible for tax credits for EVs, followed by a Dec. 31 deadline when credits vanish for rooftop solar, air source heat pumps and certain water heaters.

These are major purchases and customers will likely want to consider multiple options before making a selection, but there isn’t much time for research. To help, I’ve convened some experts to help you make good decisions.

First, how we got here: President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act earlier this month, which repealed tax credits that had been created or expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Since the EV credits expire first, we’ll start there. Until Sept. 30, the government has a $7,500 credit for qualifying new EVs and plug-in hybrids, and a $4,000 credit for qualifying used EVs. There is also a $7,500 credit under a different part of the law that applies to leased EVs.

Should you buy immediately? I asked Alex Knizek, associate director of auto test development at the Consumer Reports Auto Test Center.

“If you’ve already done your research and found a safe, reliable EV or [plug-in hybrid] that fits your needs and budget, you should make that purchase sooner rather than later,” he said. “But don’t panic-buy a car in a rush just for the sake of getting the tax credit.”

Knizek said there is a danger that a quick decision will leave you stuck with a vehicle that doesn’t fit your needs. Also, a quick buying process may lead you to get a vehicle that is unreliable and will need expensive repairs.

Especially if you’re a first-time EV buyer, there are some details you need to figure out before you start taking test drives. For example, you should determine your charging setup and get a sense of whether there will be extra costs to upgrade your home’s wiring.

The larger point is that rushed decisions are often bad decisions.

But if you feel ready to buy, there are many resources available to identify which vehicles have the best promotions and the inventory levels in your area. Websites such as KBB.com and Edmunds.com can provide a big-picture view.

The federal government lists which new vehicles and used vehicles qualify for credits when a customer is buying, as opposed to leasing.

For leases, dealers and their financing affiliates can get a $7,500 credit for EVs that they deliver to customers, with few restrictions. But there is no master list for prices and availability. I’ve found that it’s helpful to look online for lists of the best lease deals, and also look for specials on the websites of local dealers.

Prices vary depending on where you are located. For example, Columbus, Ohio, where I live, often doesn’t have some of the best promotions that are available in markets where dealers have a lot more EV inventory.

You have more time to shop and make decisions about the other expiring credits than you do with EVs. Most of the other consumer-facing tax credits expire on Dec. 31, including:

A 30 percent credit for home energy systems that can include rooftop solar, battery energy storage systems and small wind turbines, among others. This credit has no maximum benefit, which allows for a lot of flexibility in deciding the size of the system you want.

A 30 percent credit for buying a qualifying air source heat pump, which is an electric system that provides home heating and cooling. The maximum benefit is $2,000.

A 30 percent credit for home improvements that help with energy conservation, which can include insulation, windows, doors and electrical panel replacement. The maximum benefit is $1,200, and there are several other limits for certain items, such as a cap of $600 for windows.

The only major consumer-facing credit that will continue beyond the end of the year is an incentive for buying and installing a home charger for an EV, which ends after June 2026. This is a 30 percent credit with a maximum benefit of $1,000. (EnergySage has a good roundup of the credits and expiration dates, which helped me to parse some of these details.)

But knowing which credits are available is just an initial step. The next one is to determine what to do with this information.

At my house, I have found that Electrify Central Ohio is a great resource, and I wrote about it in 2022. It’s a volunteer-run organization in which people share their experiences with buying rooftop solar, EVs and other emissions-cutting technologies. Other cities and regions have their own groups like this and I advise you to join one in your community.

I asked the co-founders, Andy Leber and Madeline Fleisher, whether the rapid expiration of tax credits means I should rush to make purchases.

“We were advising people considering solar to do it this calendar year, but it might already be too late to start getting bids and getting the system installed by Dec. 31,” said Leber, who is an Ohio State University psychology professor by day. “If I were shopping now, I’d try to secure a guarantee that the system would be installed in time and eligible for the credit.”

He is less sure of what to recommend for people who want to buy battery energy storage. He expects that retail prices for batteries will continue to fall to the point that the repeal of the credit won’t be as much of an issue in a year or two as it would be for rooftop solar and other resources.

Fleisher, an attorney who specializes in energy issues, emphasized the urgency of getting rooftop solar before the end of the year because of questions of what the solar industry is going to look like as it tries to adapt to not having the credits.

“I think you’re rolling the dice after the end of this year as to what might happen,” she said. “The business model is built around the tax credit and there’s going to need to be some significant adjustment of that business model before companies can figure out how to make money. It could be rough in the meantime.”

In writing about the rapid expiration of the credits, I’m reminded of how forward-thinking they were. Most of these credits were set to last for a decade before this abrupt reduction in the timetable.

Fleisher noted that the original timetable meant that the credits were going to be around as consumers reached the point in their buying cycle when they needed a new car, heating system or other major purchases.

She suspects that many people will find that their needs didn’t line up precisely enough with the window of when the incentives are available.

“People won’t find out about it until it’s too late,” she said. “People are going to miss the chance.”

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

PJM Capacity Price Rises Again and Hits Cap as Clean Energy Projects Remain Stalled: Electricity customers are going to see a continuing increase in costs because of results of an auction announced this week in the country’s largest grid region, as my colleague Rambo Talabong reports for ICN. PJM Interconnection—whose territory runs from New Jersey to Illinois—held the auction to set the price that is paid to power plant owners to be available for use by the grid when needed. Growth in electricity demand combined with PJM’s backlog of approvals of grid connections for new energy projects, most of them renewable, are contributing to a scarcity that is driving up prices. The new price, which takes effect next year, is $329.17 per megawatt-day, which hit a price ceiling set by PJM. The upshot is that most customers will see increases in the part of their bills that covers PJM’s services.

Tesla’s Automotive Revenue Falls Again, Even Lower Than Analysts Expected: Tesla had a rough second quarter, reporting on Wednesday that its automotive revenue fell 16 percent compared to a year ago, the second quarter in a row in which sales decreased. This is the second straight quarter of revenue declines as the automaker dealt with challenges tied to the lack of a hot new model and the continuing fallout from CEO Elon Musk’s close association with the Trump administration. The results fell short of analysts’ expectations and added to a string of disappointing news for the company, as Lora Kolodny reports for CNBC.

Trump Has Unleashed a Regulatory Blitz Against Renewables: President Donald Trump has used the powers of his office to try to put up barriers to renewable energy development. A recent example is the requirement disclosed last week that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum or his deputy personally approve renewable energy projects on public lands. Benjamin Storrow reports for E&E News about the administration’s efforts and how they are a significant escalation using the government to slow growth of renewables.

Republican Excitement for Wyoming Rare Earth Mining Contradicts the Party’s Disdain for Renewables: A recent ribbon cutting for Ramaco Resources’ Brook Mine was showcase for Republicans’ dissonance on mining for rare earth minerals, as my colleague Jake Bolster reports for ICN. On one hand, the Trump administration has taken action to encourage U.S. production of rare earth minerals. On the other hand, the administration has been hostile to the products that need these minerals, which can include solar cells and EV batteries.

Following a trip to China in 2024, Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford, has publicly expressed his concern regarding Chinese vehicle manufacturers such as BYD, Xiaomi, and Changan. He emphasizes that this issue extends beyond the quality or affordability of their automotive products, but rather pertains to the speed at which they are capable of innovating.

This is why Ford has proposed a restructuring of its production strategy, focusing on smaller, more accessible electric vehicles that meet market needs. This new platform will be led by former Tesla engineer Alan Clark. Despite acknowledging the challenges of matching China in large-scale production, they will do everything possible to continue competing on equal terms.

Ford

Founded by the world-renowned Henry Ford in 1913, the Ford Motor Company first emerged in Detroit, Michigan, United States. It is an automobile manufacturing company whose headquarters are now located in Dearborn. Although it began its journey in the United States, it has successfully expanded globally, becoming recognized for producing automobiles, commercial vehicles, and racing cars. While Ford had previously invested in electric vehicles between 1998 and 2002 (without much success), it was not until 2024 that they revisited this concept. It was then that mass production of the Ford Explorer, a fully electric vehicle, commenced, and it is now available in the market.

Research on the Chinese market

Although Ford is of American origin, a significant portion of its market is located in Europe. It is precisely there that vehicle manufacturing companies face increasing competition from Chinese manufacturers. The President and CEO of Ford, Jim Farley, has come to regard companies from the Asian giant as an ‘existential threat’ to the rest of the manufacturers. To substantiate his theory, in 2024 he traveled to China with the aim of closely studying the competition.

Once there, he was completely fascinated by the speed at which these companies have been able to develop, incorporate, and market new innovation techniques. He highlighted companies such as Xiaomi, BYD, and Changan, stating, “What really keeps me awake at night is the speed at which the Chinese are innovating. Everyone talks about how good or cheap they are, but what truly stands out is how fast they are”.

What makes China´s production different?

In case the visit to the competition did not shed enough light, Ford has gone a step further. In its quest to understand and compete with BYD, the North American brand has disassembled one of the Chinese electric vehicles to analyze it piece by piece. What makes Chinese production different? Farley emphasized the cost reduction of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries and their vertical integration. This allows them to reduce costs by manufacturing their own batteries, without compromising on quality.

On the other hand, although Farley explained that BYD’s propulsion systems are not the most powerful, the market strategy they have employed certainly is. It is evident that they need to optimize their own manufacturing processes if they intend to compete with such companies. “We need smaller plants, less labor, and to reduce complexity,” he stated.

What is next for Ford?

Ford’s response to this situation has been a restructuring of its own production processes, and the announcement of the launch in the coming years of a low-cost, smaller, and more accessible electric vehicle. However, its main concern remains the same: ‘What really worries me is how we are going to execute these technologies on a large scale.’ It is not so much whether our technology will be competitive, but whether we will be able to produce on a large scale with these new suppliers.’ This new platform will be led by former Tesla engineer Alan Clarke, with the expectation of narrowing the gap with Chinese manufacturers. Will Ford achieve its goal?",https://www.lagradaonline.com/us/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/1-38.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 06:58:54.834554

No amount of public relations spin can disguise the reality: BlackRock is still boycotting legal energy production.
And it is exactly the type of conduct Texas law was written to stop.
Texas is an energy superpower, and our prosperity depends on the freedom to produce, transport, and consume reliable food and fuels.","When Texas passed SB 13 in 2021, a model policy I helped craft, it did so for a reason. The law bars state entities from doing business with financial companies that take any action to penalize or economically harm fossil fuel producers or impose environmental standards beyond what federal and state laws require. It was a clear, necessary stand against the woke finance machine.

Yet despite this law, BlackRock was quietly dropped from the state’s boycott list after claiming it had pulled back from climate alliances. Never mind that BlackRock itself admitted its departure from the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative “doesn’t change how we manage portfolios.” In other words, the same discriminatory practices just under a different banner.

The evidence is overwhelming. BlackRock’s U.S. voting guidelines still demand that companies adopt “science-based” emissions targets. That’s a polite way of insisting on net-zero policies that would all but erase fossil fuel use within 25 years. Under the widely accepted definitions of “science-based,” this means companies are expected to slash emissions from electricity and heat generation to near-zero by mid-century. If that isn’t an attempt to impose climate mandates far beyond any legal requirement, what is?

It gets worse. BlackRock still pressures companies to churn out reams of climate disclosures modeled on the SEC’s failed proposal — regulations so burdensome the SEC admitted they would cause “significant harm” to the economy. In practice, these demands amount to a shakedown: Comply with our climate edicts or watch your board seats vanish. In 2024 alone, BlackRock voted against 127 directors for failing to meet these unrealistic expectations.

It also continues to back shareholder resolutions that target fossil fuels and the Texas ranchers who rely on them. For example, BlackRock voted for a Berkshire Hathaway resolution demanding net-zero electricity — effectively the elimination of natural gas and coal. And in a particularly absurd twist, it supported proposals at Cracker Barrel, Denny’s, Jack in the Box, and Wingstop to force emissions targets modeled on McDonald’s supply chain. These net-zero goals call for electrifying farm machinery, ditching nitrogen fertilizer, and cutting beef consumption in half. The consequences for Texas agriculture and cattle ranching would be devastating.

And let’s not forget BlackRock’s unrepentant pledge to divest from thermal coal. That policy has been on the books since 2020 and remains today. No amount of public relations spin can disguise the reality: BlackRock is still boycotting legal energy production.

This is not conjecture or conspiracy theory. It is documented in BlackRock’s own stewardship reports, proxy voting records, and policy guidelines. And it is exactly the type of conduct Texas law was written to stop.

What’s even more remarkable is that Texas removed BlackRock from the boycott list while the state attorney general is suing it for collusion to suppress fossil fuel production. At a minimum, this litigation should have prompted caution and further scrutiny, not a clean bill of health.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. Texas is an energy superpower, and our prosperity depends on the freedom to produce, transport, and consume reliable food and fuels. When Wall Street giants such as BlackRock weaponize trillions of dollars to kneecap these industries, families pay the price through higher electric bills, higher food costs, and diminished economic opportunity.

Texans aren’t asking for special treatment. We’re demanding a level playing field and accountability for companies that say one thing in press releases and do another behind closed doors. The Texas comptroller’s office owes taxpayers a transparent explanation of how BlackRock’s record was evaluated, what evidence justified removal from the list, and whether any independent verification occurred.

CHEVRON’S CONDUCT IS NOT CONSISTENT WITH TRUMP’S AGENDA

It’s time for policymakers to remember why SB 13 passed in the first place: to defend our energy economy from activists who treat fossil fuels as a sin to be purged. BlackRock hasn’t abandoned that ideology. It has simply learned to disguise it.

Texas has the law, the evidence, and the moral clarity to hold BlackRock accountable. Now, it must find the will.

More than just a business deal, this investment marks a strategic leap—bridging infrastructure gaps while advancing the UAE’s role in both the AI and BRICS-driven global order.

“We’re saving $18 million a year through real estate consolidation,” Zeldin noted. “Just by canceling certain media contracts and closing an EPA museum that no one visited, we are continuing to find efficiencies in everything that I just described.”

Zeldin said these cuts do not compromise the agency’s core responsibilities. “We are still able to fulfill our statutory obligations in the power of the Great American Comeback,” he stated.

Zeldin pledged that the agency will continue to prioritize clean air, water, and land while also “unleashing energy dominance,” advancing permitting reform, fostering cooperative federalism, and helping make America the global leader in AI and automotive manufacturing.

As other states are making investments in advanced nuclear energy technology, Pennsylvania should be next.
That’s why we’re calling on federal and state leaders to renew their commitment to an energy future that keeps Pennsylvania at the forefront of energy dominance.
Nuclear power can play an important role in our clean energy future, but we must also include other energy sources and technologies, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.
Kate Harper and Conor Lamb Co-Chairs Energy Future PA","Editor: Pennsylvanians could be forgiven for feeling a bit whipsawed when it comes to recent energy-related news here in the Keystone State.

On one hand, the recently signed federal “One Big Beautiful Bill” pulls back from recent progress that has been made in clean energy production, limiting our energy options instead of supporting an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy. That means fewer jobs, less economic growth and an electric grid that will become increasingly strained under continued and unprecedented demand for more power.

On the other hand, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick and President Donald Trump were in Pittsburgh recently to announce a whopping $90 billion in energy and technology investments in Pennsylvania. Among them is a plan from Westinghouse Electric Company to build 10 new, large nuclear power plant reactors across the U.S. – expected to generate $6 billion in investment and 15,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania alone.

There is widespread support for more investment in safe, reliable nuclear power. Pennsylvania has a strong nuclear legacy and generates the second most nuclear energy in the country. To lead the new nuclear resurgence, we’ll have to exceed our current pace. As other states are making investments in advanced nuclear energy technology, Pennsylvania should be next.

That’s why we’re calling on federal and state leaders to renew their commitment to an energy future that keeps Pennsylvania at the forefront of energy dominance. That means setting aside party labels and advancing commonsense energy policy that is solution-driven and puts Pennsylvanians first. Nuclear power can play an important role in our clean energy future, but we must also include other energy sources and technologies, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.

Only through a comprehensive approach to our energy policy can we ensure our power supply is reliable, clean and affordable – not just today, but for future generations.

Now it's time for us to think again - The Observer,Martha Gill,,,,,https://observer.co.uk/news/opinion-and-ideas/article/nuclear-power-is-the-future-britain-rejected-now-its-time-for-us-to-think-again,"Last week Ed Miliband optimistically announced the dawn of a new “golden age” of nuclear power.
Of all the possible ways to gather clean energy, nuclear power seems the most likely to allow us to dispense with fossil fuels completely.
Meanwhile, a single nuclear power station creates enough energy to provide power for 2 million average Europeans.
Environmentalists had turned against nuclear power in the early 1960s – psychologists have tracked its association among these groups with the nuclear bomb.
People fear nuclear power over coal power for much the same reason they worry more about shark attacks than traffic accidents.","Britain was once poised to be the world leader in clean energy. We split the atom, pioneered the first commercial nuclear power station, and by 1988 had built 18 reactors, the third highest number in the world. By the mid-1990s, we were producing enough energy to supply a quarter of the country’s electricity. But then, even as climate change was mov ing from being a contested idea to an accepted one, progress stalled. We stopped building entirely. Now we get just 14% of electricity from this source, and five of our six remaining plants are due for retirement at the end of the decade.

Last week Ed Miliband optimistically announced the dawn of a new “golden age” of nuclear power. His hopes rest on a single Suffolk megaplant, Sizewell C – already delayed and now to be around 12 years in the making, if finished on time. And that looks far from guaranteed.

After 10 years of planning, and nine of building, Hinkley Point C, in Somerset, pictured above, missed its deadline for completion this year. It has now been pushed back to 2031, with such an expanded budget that it is to be the most costly power plant in history. How did we lose our advantage? Of all the possible ways to gather clean energy, nuclear power seems the most likely to allow us to dispense with fossil fuels completely. Wind and solar power can be unreliable – especially on a cloudy island with such variable weather – and backup systems can’t always compensate, as hydroelectricity stores and batteries run down in a few hours. In fact, wind farms must actually shut down when gusts are too strong. Meanwhile, a single nuclear power station creates enough energy to provide power for 2 million average Europeans. Over time, it is also the lowest-price way to garner low-carbon energy, and it has the lightest ecological burden.

Steep initial costs are talked about as the central challenge to building more power stations – and that is the block against which political will has tended to founder. Long and risky construction processes mean that the price starts high and can rise astronomically if things go wrong. But British projects are also among the most expensive in the world. Only America does worse.

The UK has more stringent safety rules than many other countries – and in some, such as China, construction workers earn less than their British counterparts. High-paying Finland and France build more cheaply, as does South Korea, where costs are roughly a quarter of what they are in Britain.

Instead Britain may be missing the secret to success, which – according to the thinktank Britain Remade – is repetition. South Korea builds fleets of plants for every design, relying on economies of scale and learning from practice. This provides workers with standard protocol and a steady pipeline of projects. France bulked up its supply in the 1970s with a similar approach, building 56 reactors with an average construction time of six years each. But Britain seems to have forgotten how to build nuclear power stations. Each project must start again from scratch. That is the direct result of a full 20-year hiatus.

Britain’s underlying problem with nuclear has not in fact been technical, but psychological. The trigger was two high-profile disasters, both of which sharply halted nuclear progress all around the world: Chernobyl in 1986 and Fukushima in 2011. The first was the result of a human mistake – operators disabled safety systems during a test – combined with a flawed reactor design; the second was caused by an earthquake and tsunami. The horrific results were splashed across newspapers, and reporting continued for years. But in some countries the effect has lingered longer than in others.

People fear nuclear for much the same reason they worry about shark attacks

In the UK, according to a recent study, public fears were further stoked after Chernobyl by an unusual alliance of environmental activists and fossil-fuel interest groups. The Thatcher government was in the midst of a fight with the miners’ unions when Chernobyl melted down. The disaster became part of that battle. Analysis shows that MPs sponsored by miners’ unions were much more likely to speak out against nuclear energy; newspapers with ties to fossil fuel published more anti-nuclear articles.

Britain's sluggishness can also be explained partly by the political makeup of its green groups, which might have formed the vanguard of those pushing for this clean energy solution. But an ideological split emerged, dominated by those who preferred to campaign for reduced energy consumption rather than technological solutions. Environmentalists had turned against nuclear power in the early 1960s – psychologists have tracked its association among these groups with the nuclear bomb. With few green champions for nuclear, Britain turned back to fossil fuels.

As a result, there has been an enduring idea in Britain that nuclear is “very unsafe” – similar to Germany, which has all but shut down its nuclear capacity since Fukushima. This compares with 15% of Danish and 11% of Swedes.

But this does not reflect reality. Hugely improved safety methods mean the likelihood of another disaster is extremely minimal. Calculations of deaths per terawatt-hour generated put nuclear power, at 0.03, on a par with wind turbines, which is at 0.04, (mostly from accidents, such as drowning in the process of setting them up). For coal, this rises to 24.6, owing to pollution. In fact living near a coal power station exposes people to more radiation than living near a nuclear one – but both are low, at around 0.01mSv (millisieverts, a measurement of radiation) a year. For comparison, those living in Cornwall receive about 6.9mSv a year

Risks are tough to calculate correctly. We tend to overestimate the danger of the dramatic and unfamiliar. People fear nuclear power over coal power for much the same reason they worry more about shark attacks than traffic accidents. But fossil fuels are much more dangerous, by any standard. One back-of-the-envelope calculation from a recent report finds that the swap in nuclear power stations for fossil fuels after Chernobyl has resulted in the loss of “318 million life years” since 1986.

Yet support for nuclear power is rising across the world, including in Britain. Why? Well, perhaps the most efficient way to shift perception of one threat is for another, larger one to come along . France’s success can be explained by the oil crisis in 1973: the country was almost completely reliant on foreign oil; that problem ate the nuclear one. Now we are going through a similar moment of our own. Academics have used the term “reluctant acceptance” to explain the shift in support as climate risks ramp up. But the real change may have come since the energy threats posted by the war in Ukraine. Campaigners should remember that their greatest advances are made not in the field of science, but in politics.

These are impressive documents, readily available on the internet, which should be required reading for anyone interested in Maine’s future. The heart of our state energy plan is to have 100% clean energy (non-carbon based) by 2040.

It’s an extraordinarily ambitious goal.

Recent actions by the current federal administration to deny any new wind power projects in federal waters and to withdraw approval for a major wind project already being constructed demonstrate that, unfortunately, Maine is not fully in control of its energy future.

There is reason to doubt that Maine will reach a 100% electricity powered by “green” sources by 2040. But it does seem clear that by 2040 or 2050, if enough electricity can be generated, and if the transmission and distribution grids can be upgraded to support the increased amounts of electricity needed (both vastly expensive and technically challenging tasks), gas- and diesel-powered vehicles and fuel-oil or propane furnaces and heaters will be prohibited or strictly regulated within 25 years in the state of Maine.

Aside from all of the community planning, economic development and conservation issues that will arise in this green energy effort, there has been little public consideration of how this new state green energy system will be protected, both from the increased violent natural events brought on by a warming planet, and protected from both domestic and foreign parties that may see Maine’s energy infrastructure as a target.

Maine has made more progress in thinking about its energy future and taking direct action toward specific goals than most states. And in spite of federal interference and lack of support, Maine continues to work with Canada and other Northeastern states to coordinate grid improvements.

In-state, Maine is providing direct support for installation of heat pumps and EV charging stations, while also collaborating on advanced wind energy projects. While I am grateful for and impressed by what is being accomplished, under extraordinarily difficult conditions, I am increasingly concerned that the Maine Energy Plan focuses so much on how to make our electrical supply “green” that it does not adequately consider how to keep it protected.

It is my impression that most people living and working in Maine don’t fully grasp what is being proposed, and what is starting to happen. The Maine Energy Plan envisions that by 2040 or 2050. there will be few if any fuel oil-fired furnaces, and no more gasoline- or diesel- powered cars or trucks, which means that there will be few if any gas stations and few if any heating oil delivery services. The only energy for our homes and businesses will be electricity.

The impact that this change will have upon jobs, community structure and appearance (now is the time to start planning for what should and should not happen with all of those intersection-located gas stations) will be immense.

During the past 10 years, as I have driven on I-95 from Portland to Augusta, I have been intrigued by the growing number of solar farms visible along the side of the road. On occasion I have driven onto side roads, which allow a direct close view of some of these large solar panel installations, and have also looked at them using Google Earth.

Advertisement

It is interesting to see the evolving design of solar panels, the structures they are mounted on and how the arrays of panels are connected to the grid. What is also interesting to see, from Google Earth and site visits, are the various ways that people could gain access to these solar farms.

I make no claim to be a security expert, but it seems obvious that two or three people equipped with splitting mauls, axes and each carrying 5 gallons of gasoline could easily get over the low fences surrounding the sites or break through the gates with a reinforced vehicular grill and, within 20 minutes, render any of those sites inoperable for between six months and two years, if the sites were even deemed by their owners to be worth reinvestment as solar farms.

As Maine becomes more dependent upon electricity as its only source of residential and commercial energy, the infrastructure supporting that single source becomes an increasingly attractive target both for the individual seeking revenge for some real or imagined wrong and for military or paramilitary groups seeking large-scale civil disruption. Such a disruption could be either a distraction to camouflage some other action or to diminish the state or the nation’s capacity to function. Russia, very early in its war with Ukraine, targeted Ukraine’s energy production and distribution infrastructure.

Last month, I went to a medical appointment next to Thompson’s Point, on Sewall Street. There is an electrical substation there, where high- voltage electricity from the transmission grid is switched to low-voltage electrical power and fed to the local Portland area distribution system.

The security for this vital component of economic and residential activity is a high fence with rolled strands of barbed wire and a front locked gate. However, for the two hours I was on Sewall Street, that gate was open with no vehicle or visible personnel on the site. The fence would probably have been effective until the late 1990s. Now almost any truck and many SUVs could easily push open the surprisingly flimsy gate, and anyone with training and some simple equipment could bypass the rolled barbed wire. Major harm could be achieved without even entering the compound.

It is my deep concern that existing physical security for Maine’s vast electric power infrastructure, designed for a less informed, more law-abiding society that no longer exists, and at a time when the electricity supply system was not so essential for the functioning of everything, is now inadequate.

Advertisement

Added to my concern is that new security threats exist. Anyone wanting to damage a substation, an electricity-generating dam or a solar farm can gain essential planning knowledge from any cellphone, tablet or computer using such free tools as Google Earth. Several firms are eager to sell drones with night-vision cameras and software that would allow highly accurate maps to be prepared from undetected night drone surveillance flights.

I won’t go further, but terrorist groups around the world have discovered and are using internet-provided information to cause vast harm: information that into the 1980s was esoteric, hard to find and very often highly classified. Why will such attacks never happen in Maine? Or, perhaps, when will that happen in Maine?

***

What to do about this?

Establish a task force that includes military, police and others knowledgeable in the disruption of power supply systems and hopefully, in the defense of such systems, complete a review of best security practices across the country and around the world. Then develop guidelines and standards; hold education and training workshops. Then start requiring that any new electrical source being connected to the grid must be reliable, repairable and physically secure.

And review every existing connection to the grid, giving operators of those sources a time specific by which security improvements must be in place, in addition to providing technical assistance and, whenever possible, financial help or incentive. Then inspect and, as necessary, repair or upgrade those systems every year. This should become one of the highest priority capital improvement projects of the state, of New England and the nation.

The Governor’s Energy Office is, in my opinion, doing a really good job and the governor deserves great credit for such strong support of the office’s efforts. And the GEO staff is looking at the durability of the transmission and distribution grids, as well as what kind of changes will be needed when and if Maine relies not just upon a relative handful of electricity generators, but literally hundreds if not thousands of homes, institutions and businesses connecting their solar panel arrays to the grid.

The 15 years between now and 2040 are going to require immense amounts of work, skill, money and luck, along with increasing awareness and support from the general population if the energy plan is to have any chance at success.

But all of this good and expensive work will be wasted if the transmission lines, substations, distribution lines and sources of electricity are not physically secure. This immense, complicated, absolutely essential, and in many instances highly vulnerable infrastructure needs to be physically secure from the byproducts of a warming planet. Those include more high wind events, more ice, sleet and hail damage, more and higher tidal surges and rain bombs when warmer air holds more moisture and drops several inches of rain in an hour.

But they must also be secure from deliberate actions to disrupt and destroy. When everything is connected through the “grid,” and when everything depends solely upon electricity, whether green or not, it takes relatively little to have a big, powerful, dangerous impact. And unfortunately, in the world we presently live in, that makes all parts of Maine’s electrical infrastructure prime targets for those who wish to cause harm.",https://www.sunjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/07/26688861_20210930_solar_8368-e1633025584955-1024x638-1-1753378013.jpeg?w=1024,N,,2025-07-27 10:00:09.300131

The move, which is expected to be proposed in the coming days, would reverse the scientific determination that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and undermine efforts to limit emissions and tackle climate change. This would have significant implications for climate policies in the US.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reportedly set to propose a significant change in its stance on climate change, which could reshape U.S. climate policies. The EPA is expected to reverse its 2009 ""endangerment finding,"" a scientific and legal determination that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health. This move would undo the core legal authority underpinning major climate regulations across transportation, energy, and industrial sectors [1].

The EPA's proposal, submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget on June 30, is expected to be released for public comment after interagency review. This reversal would modify the legal framework that has been the basis for federal climate change regulations for over a decade. The decision is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to roll back environmental regulations, including emissions standards for vehicles and other industries [1].

The implications of this proposed change are far-reaching. It could lead to a relaxation of emissions standards for vehicles, industrial processes, and power plants, potentially increasing greenhouse gas emissions. This move is likely to be opposed by environmental groups and climate advocates who argue that reducing emissions is crucial to mitigating the effects of climate change. The automotive industry, which has been grappling with tariffs and weak demand, may also face additional challenges if emissions standards are relaxed [1].

The EPA's action comes amidst a backdrop of significant developments in the automotive industry. President Donald Trump recently announced a new trade agreement with Japan that lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese imports to 15%, down from the previously threatened 25% rate. This agreement includes a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the United States [2]. However, the impact of this trade deal on the automotive industry remains to be seen, as it could both boost U.S. inventory and partnerships while also creating potential challenges for automakers facing tariffs and weak demand [2].

Additionally, the EPA's proposed rollback of the endangerment finding coincides with significant financial struggles in the automotive sector. Stellantis reported a preliminary net loss of €2.3 billion ($2.7 billion) for the first half of 2025, driven by weak North American sales, program cancellations, and a €300 million tariff hit under President Trump’s new trade policies [2]. General Motors also reported a 34.5% decline in second-quarter 2025 net income to $1.9 billion, primarily due to tariffs, warranty costs, and EV inventory adjustments [2].

The proposed rollback of the endangerment finding is a complex and contentious issue with far-reaching implications for climate policy, the automotive industry, and investors. As the EPA's proposal moves forward, it will be crucial to monitor the regulatory and market responses to understand the potential impacts on the U.S. economy and environment.

The leaders also unveiled an ambitious new framework for bilateral ties, formally known as the UK-India Vision 2035.

Described as the most comprehensive trade deal India has ever entered into and the most economically significant bilateral agreement for the UK since its departure from the European Union, the pact is expected to increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion annually. This milestone marks a significant shift in the trajectory of trade, investment, and strategic collaboration between two of the world’s fastest-growing economies.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the agreement as a “major win for Britain”, saying: “It will create thousands of British jobs across the UK, unlock new opportunities for businesses and drive growth in every corner of the country, delivering on our Plan for Change. We’re putting more money in the pockets of hardworking Brits and helping families with the cost of living.”

Announced against a backdrop of economic volatility and geopolitical flux, the agreement reflects a shared intent to usher in a decade of deeper cooperation across several areas. These include trade and defence, as well as clean energy, education, and cutting-edge technology.

Prime Minister Modi hailed the signing as a historic moment in the relationship between India and the United Kingdom. He emphasised the importance of a shared vision and reaffirmed both nations' commitment to progress as equal partners in innovation, security, and inclusive development.

For businesses and consumers alike, the deal offers tangible benefits. Indian exporters will gain unprecedented access to the UK market, while British consumers can expect lower prices and a wider range of products. On the UK side, the agreement opens new avenues for trade, job creation, and cross-border investment in industries ranging from aerospace to green energy.

According to the Department for Business and Trade, Indian buyers will soon be able to enjoy British goods, including soft drinks, cosmetics, automobiles, and medical equipment, at significantly reduced tariffs. Rates that previously averaged around 15 per cent will now fall to just 3 per cent. In return, UK consumers and businesses will see Indian products become far more affordable and widely available.

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds called the deal “historic” and stated, “India is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world and an emerging economic superpower.” This trade deal puts the UK in the best position to partner with India over the next decade, promising to unlock thousands of jobs and boost growth across both economies.”

Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds praised the agreement, calling it a historic step forward. He also revealed nearly £6 billion in new investment commitments and export agreements. Twenty-six British companies are launching new ventures in India, including aerospace leaders Airbus and Rolls-Royce, which will supply aircraft and engines as part of contracts valued at approximately £5 billion.

Yet the scope of this partnership goes far beyond trade. The UK-India Vision 2035 outlines long-term objectives across various sectors. These include a new Defence Industrial Roadmap aimed at bolstering joint defence capabilities and sharing advanced technologies. The two nations will also strengthen their collaboration on climate and clean energy, with the UK gaining access to India’s rapidly growing renewable energy procurement markets.

In financial services, the agreement locks in liberalisation measures that remove key barriers to UK investment. India has committed to maintaining foreign investment caps in the insurance sector and to ensuring equal treatment for British firms, an essential step toward stability and long-term investor confidence.

Further collaboration will focus on addressing global threats, including corruption, organised crime, and irregular migration. Enhanced intelligence-sharing protocols and new operational frameworks are being established to support these efforts.

The timing of today’s announcement is notable. It coincides with the first anniversary of the UK-India Technology Security Initiative, launched in July 2024. Both governments reaffirmed their shared ambition to lead in frontier technologies, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, space innovation, and cyberdefence.

For the UK’s green economy, the deal provides a unique foothold in India’s rapidly growing clean energy sector. Analysts expect this to give a substantial boost to British green tech exports while advancing India's broader energy transition strategy.

Education and innovation also sit high on the agenda. The two countries plan to deepen academic ties, expand student exchange programs, and increase collaborative research between universities and tech institutions. Over the coming decade, these partnerships are expected to foster significant cross-border talent and knowledge transfer.

As the UK Parliament prepares to ratify the deal, government officials are urging businesses in both countries to prepare for implementation. The agreement will be formally tabled in Parliament in the coming weeks, following standard legislative procedure.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/becc64_51681a3d97194836910829b691ec035b~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_815,h_503,al_c,lg_1,q_85/becc64_51681a3d97194836910829b691ec035b~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-27 09:00:01.007928

“These manufacturers have made multi-billion-dollar investments that were predicated on these different tax credits being there, so that’s going to hurt,” he said.
Even so, the “engine of growth” will likely idle down in the coming years as EV tax credits disappear, according to Viles.","NEW CARISLE — Over the past year, thousands of construction workers have descended on the small town of New Carlisle.

They’re building a 2.5-million-square- oot facility that will make batteries for General Motors’ growing fleet of electric vehicles.

The new plant marks a $3.5 billion investment that is projected to bring 1,700 new jobs to St. Joseph County, which wooed the company by approving lucrative tax abatements and $50 million in bonds to build out infrastructure to the site. “Everything seems to be on track from our end of things here,” said Jeff Rea, president and CEO of the South Bend Regional Chamber of Commerce. “Everybody feels good about it here.”

The same story is playing out in Kokomo, where Stellantis, in partnership with Samsung SDI, is building two battery plants totaling a $5.7 billion investment projected to create 2,800 new jobs.

But EV advocates say battery plants like the ones under construction in Indiana will soon face major setbacks that could lead to fewer jobs and put billions of publicly invested dollars at risk.

Republican lawmakers this month approved President Donald Trump’s “One, Big Beautiful Bill” that guts Biden-era incentives approved in the Inflation Reduction Act that have fueled the rapid growth of Indiana’s EV industry.

SETBACKS AND JOB LOSSES

In October, the $7,500 tax credit for American-made EVs and the $4,000 credit for used EVs will end, as will the tax credit for commercial EVs that offered up to $40,000 for heavy trucks. The 30% tax credit for personal EV charging infrastructure will expire after June 30.

Those credits have been instrumental in pushing EV sales, which in the U.S. have increased 60% since 2022. During that time in Indiana, the number of new EV registrations doubled to 35,000, according to Go Electric Vehicle Indiana, a statewide initiative dedicated to advancing the adoption of EVs.

Now, without the tax credits, sales of battery electric vehicles could drop about 30% in 2027 and 40% in 2030 compared to a scenario in which Biden-era policies are continued, according to a Princeton University study published in March.

With the anticipated drop in sales, up to 72% of all battery cell manufacturing that will be operational by the end of the year won’t be needed, due to the slumping demand for EVs. Plants could be at risk of closure, the study reported.

In Indiana, that could put nearly 7,000 jobs at risk in 2030, most of which would be in the battery sector, according to an April study published by the International Council on Clean Transportation.

Battery manufacturers are already responding to the Trump administration’s abrupt shift in EV policy. A Japanese company in June halted construction of a $1.6 billion factory in South Carolina to help make batteries for electric BMWs, citing “policy and market uncertainty.”

In South Bend, a company called SiFAB will likely delay the expansion of a production line for a new kind of silicon fiber used to build lithium-ion batteries, according to Rea. The company did not respond to an interview request.

“These changes can affect what happens at our local companies here,” Rea said. “I think they’ll still advance their platform. It just may be slower compared to what they originally planned.”

‘FAR MORE THAN AN EV CREDIT’

The cuts to the tax credits come as Indiana companies have invested billions to build out their EV markets as sales have steadily increased across Indiana and the nation.

GM, Honda, Stellantis and Toyota have poured, in total, more than $1.4 billion into new EV production lines at their Indiana facilities. ENTEK, a battery-component supplier, is investing $1.5 billion to build a new facility in Terre Haute.

An EV startup called Slate is spending $360 million to convert a former printing plant in Warsaw into a new production facility for customizable electric trucks. The company said the project would bring about 1,600 jobs to the city.

Add it up, and Indiana today ranks ninth in the nation for new EV investment, according to the Environmental Defense Fund.

Now, the claw back of federal support for electric vehicles will disrupt the longterm financial plans for those companies, argued Ryan Lisek, program director for Drive Clean Indiana, a nonprofit working to accelerate EV adoption.

“These manufacturers have made multi-billion-dollar investments that were predicated on these different tax credits being there, so that’s going to hurt,” he said.

Removing the tax credits will also undermine what has become a uniquely American industry that has developed into a major economic driver in places such as Indiana, argued Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association and son of former Vice President Al Gore.

The $7,500 tax credit approved in the Inflation Reduction Act applied only to vehicles assembled in the U.S. that don’t use minerals from any country considered a “Foreign Entity of Concern,” including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.

Those stipulations led many automakers in the past few years to onshore their EV production in the U. S., Gore explained. Today, about 74% of all EVs sold in America are made in-country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Agency. That’s far higher than the 50% of gas vehicles made in-country and sold in the U.S.

“This tax credit was highly tailored for American manufacturing, American battery components and mineral production,” Gore said. “It was far more than an EV credit.”

“Now, this pretty intense, top-down effort to unwind a lot of the energy credits … also unwound a lot of policy that was really highly tailored around American jobs and competing with China,” he added.

‘A BUMP IN THE ROAD’

Although ending tax credits will slow the adoption of EVs, it won’t stop their long-term success in the U.S., argued Aaron Viles, senior director of campaigns at the Electrification Coalition, a nonprofit that aims to end America’s dependence on oil.

The price gap between electric and gas vehicles has gradually narrowed in the past five years while new battery technolog y has allowed for longer driving distances, making EVs far more attractive to new car buyers, Viles explained. Those trends made the Tesla Model Y the fourth best-selling vehicle in the nation last year.

Phasing out the credits could force automakers to move more quickly to bring down EV prices in order to compete with their more popular gas counterparts, argued Lisek of Drive Clean Indiana.

“It is going to hurt the market,” he said. “We’ll be seeing the training wheels come off for electric vehicles. But I think we’re going to see softer prices as manufacturers and dealers sharpen their pencils.”

Although EV companies and automakers will likely pull back on near-term investments as federal support evaporates under the Trump administration, those companies that have already made investments are set to reap the benefits, Gore asserted.

“The demand for good EVs that deliver on what people are looking for is always way higher than I think most people estimate, because in the end, they’re really good cars that people love to drive,” he said.

Back in New Carlisle, the first steel went up last month at the GM battery plant.

Liz Winter, the company’s senior manager of corporate affairs, noted GM has invested in a resilient critical minerals and battery supply chain to “support American innovation, manufacturing and economic security.”

Those investments have made “GM the engine of growth for the U.S. auto industry this year, and we don’t see that changing,” she said in an emailed statement.

Even so, the “engine of growth” will likely idle down in the coming years as EV tax credits disappear, according to Viles.

But for bedrock auto companies like GM and Stellantis that have already made huge EV investments in Indiana, the slowdown represents only a bump in the road to the industry’s long-term success, Viles argued.

“It’s a very big bump in the road, but I don’t think we’re hitting a wall.”

The complexity of lithium supply chains now threatens the pace and affordability of the global net zero transition.
This sharp increase in mineral input – particularly lithium – underscores how the world’s clean energy supply chains remain at risk.
The IEA now warns that without rapid expansion and diversification of lithium production, shortages could delay or inflate the cost of clean energy deployment.
Only 10% of lithium demand is expected to be met through recycling in that timeframe.","Lithium’s role in clean energy systems goes far beyond its use in electric vehicle batteries. It is central to any global attempt to shift away from fossil fuels, but while lithium is abundant in nature, getting it where it is needed most – and at the right time – is a different story.

The complexity of lithium supply chains now threatens the pace and affordability of the global net zero transition.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), demand for lithium will rise more than 40-fold by 2040 under the agency’s Sustainable Development Scenario – which aligns with the Paris Agreement’s climate targets.

Even less ambitious policy scenarios still point to at least a doubling of overall mineral needs.

This sharp increase in mineral input – particularly lithium – underscores how the world’s clean energy supply chains remain at risk. Current mining, refining and investment plans fall far short of projected needs.

Lithium’s essential supply chain role

Energy systems based on solar, wind and battery technologies rely on far more mineral input than traditional fossil fuel infrastructure.

One electric vehicle (EV) requires six times more mineral material than a petrol-powered car, while an onshore wind power plant requires nine times more than its gas-fired counterpart.

For EV batteries and energy storage, lithium is joined by key materials such as nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite.

These determine battery longevity, performance and energy density. Copper and aluminium, meanwhile, underpin electricity grid expansion, while rare earth elements power the magnets in wind turbines and EV motors.

As demand grows, attention is shifting to where these materials come from, how they are transported and refined and whether supply chains can keep pace.

From 2010 to now, mineral requirements for new power generation capacity have already grown by 50%.

The IEA now warns that without rapid expansion and diversification of lithium production, shortages could delay or inflate the cost of clean energy deployment.

Jakob Stausholm, Chief Executive of mining company Rio Tinto, links lithium directly to Rio’s low-carbon business model.

Following the firm’s $6.7bn acquisition of Arcadium Lithium, Stausholm says the move will “create a world-class lithium business” and help position Rio as a key supplier for low-emission technologies.

Strategic moves to secure lithium

To respond to rising demand, countries and companies are scaling up lithium output. In Chile, the second-largest holder of lithium reserves, a major partnership has formed between state-owned Codelco and lithium producer SQM.

Their joint venture will extract and refine lithium from the Salar de Atacama from 2025, with Codelco assuming full operational control from 2031.

Máximo Pacheco, Chairman of Codelco, says: “Just as we have contributed to making Chile the world leader in copper production, we will now contribute to making our country a leader in the production of lithium.”

This is both a strategic industrial agreement and one built around environmental performance. Both companies commit to higher environmental standards, local stakeholder engagement and technological upgrades.

The goal is to meet growing global demand while also addressing the growing scrutiny around water use, waste management and emissions from lithium extraction – particularly in sensitive regions like the Atacama desert.

The Arcadium deal positions Rio Tinto alongside customers such as Tesla, General Motors and BMW.

By integrating lithium into its wider minerals portfolio – which includes copper, aluminium and iron ore – Rio aims to reduce customer exposure to price volatility and supply disruption.

Yet while moves by companies like Rio and Codelco are promising, they remain outpaced by demand.

Supply chain gaps and future risks

Lithium’s sharp demand trajectory exposes several structural risks. Mineral extraction is geographically concentrated.

More than 70% of cobalt and 60% of rare earths come from just one or two countries – mainly the Democratic Republic of the Congo and China. Lithium, while more widely distributed, still faces similar issues with refining and processing concentrated in a few regions.

Mining projects are slow to come online. The IEA reports an average lead time of 16.5 years between discovery and production.

Meanwhile, clean energy rollouts – especially EVs and grid-scale batteries – are accelerating much faster.

Even if all existing projects are delivered on schedule, only half of lithium and cobalt demand will be met by 2030 under climate-aligned scenarios.

This supply shortfall could raise costs and create bottlenecks. For lithium-ion batteries, raw materials now make up 50–70% of total costs.

A doubling in lithium or nickel prices could push battery prices up by 6% – cutting into cost reductions achieved through scale.

Recycling, seen as one way to ease pressure on primary supply, is unlikely to make a major dent before 2040. Only 10% of lithium demand is expected to be met through recycling in that timeframe.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/0269d16bfb9a9f94a50d49d7d0e1cd72:cef0c61355a8464a52dfbb408dea9fd9/lithium-main.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-07-27 09:00:08.673859

Federal tax credits for electric vehicles will end on Sept. 30.
Solar panels still qualify for a 30% tax credit under the Residential Clean Energy Credit, averaging $5,084 back, according to The Washington Post.
As reported by The Washington Post, Rewiring America says most homeowners use this for insulation, doors, and windows.
If your household brings in 80-150% of your area's median income, you might get half off, according to The Washington Post.","If you're thinking about buying an electric vehicle or upgrading your home with energy-saving technology like solar panels or smart windows, you might want to get a move on. Government tax credits for electric vehicles and home projects will soon be no more.

The Washington Post reported that Republican lawmakers voted to axe many clean energy incentives earlier than expected. Federal tax credits for electric vehicles will end on Sept. 30. Credits for energy-saving home upgrades will expire on Dec. 31.

""These are the kinds of things people make decisions about when they need to — when machines come to the end of their useful lives or when they're not working correctly,"" said Ari Matusiak, CEO of Rewiring America, per The Washington Post. ""Now we have a perverse incentive where, if you want to get … a discount, you have to rush out and do it before the end of the year.""

For anyone eyeing an EV, Sept. 30 is your last chance to sign a purchase or lease agreement for up to $7,500 off a new model or $4,000 off a used one.

Corey Cantor, research director at the Zero Emission Transportation Association, told The Washington Post: ""A car is often the second-largest purchase a person makes. You do need to shop around and get a sense of what's out there.""

Solar panels still qualify for a 30% tax credit under the Residential Clean Energy Credit, averaging $5,084 back, according to The Washington Post. But Congress could cut this credit by year's end. That means homeowners would need installations finished before Dec. 31 to snag the savings.

Installing solar isn't just about money. It can cut down on pollution that is heating up the planet. EnergySage offers a free tool to compare local installer quotes and get quick rooftop solar estimates.

Heat pump water heaters, insulation, and window upgrades are part of the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, paying up to $3,200 per year. As reported by The Washington Post, Rewiring America says most homeowners use this for insulation, doors, and windows. The average claim? Around $882.

Toward the end of the year, you can still use EnergySage's mapping tool to see average solar panel costs and state incentives in your area. Together with their services, the average homeowner could save nearly $10,000 on solar installations.

Some rebates aren't going away just yet. The Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate Program still offers big discounts on heat pumps, electric stoves, insulation, and wiring upgrades. If your household brings in 80-150% of your area's median income, you might get half off, according to The Washington Post. Families earning less could even have the whole cost covered, up to certain limits.

Are you currently using solar power in your home?","A major step toward more affordable renewable energy recently occurred in Peru. Zelestra, a Spanish renewable energy company, has officially switched on the country's largest solar farm.

The solar farm, dubbed the San Martín project, consists of 450,000 solar panels and will generate over 830 GWh of clean energy annually, powering more than 400,000 homes. To put it in perspective, a U.S. household uses roughly 10,500 kWh per year, or 0.0105 GWh.

Located in the La Joya district of Arequipa, Peru, this plant is good news for everyday people because solar energy can help lower electricity bills in the long run and benefit the environment. Unlike fossil fuels, the sun's energy is free, so once the panels are built, the power they produce doesn't depend on buying expensive gas or coal.

By adding substantial clean power to the grid, the San Martín project can help protect families from rising energy costs while also maintaining power during major storms.

""By leveraging our global expertise in engineering, procurement, and construction, we can successfully co-build tailored solutions that bring projects to life on time and on budget,"" said Zelestra CEO Leo Moreno, per Renewable Energy Magazine. ""We are proud to see the most ambitious solar project in Peru now fully operational, and we look forward to a long-term partnership with Kallpa in delivering clean, reliable energy for years to come.""

Building and running this solar farm has already created hundreds of local jobs, and it will continue to provide steady work for those who maintain and operate it. Additionally, replacing fossil-fuel energy with solar energy reduces pollution.

This project alone will prevent over 160,000 tons of carbon pollution from entering the air each year, according to the report. This means cleaner air and a healthier environment for the community. In short, Peru's sunshine just got a whole lot more powerful, and everyone's set to breathe a little easier because of it.

Some of our deepest values take root in childhood. For me, it began in the lush green spaces of the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad, a peaceful space where native flowering trees thrive, and bird songs are more common than traffic noise. The constant presence of rich biodiversity instilled in me the value of coexisting with Nature and sparked a desire to conserve it from a young age.

Law wasn’t an accidental choice. In the late 1990s, I pursued the five-year Integreated LLB (Hons.) from Andhra University, Visakhapatnam. Environmental law wasn’t offered as a subject then. We only touched upon it briefly through laws like the Air Act and the Water Act. This early exposure sparked my interest and I found myself drawn to issues around natural resources, governance, and sustainability.

Inspiration

Reading Down to Earth magazine during my student years only deepened that curiosity and made me aware about environmental concerns. This led me to apply for an internship at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) in Delhi. What began as a three-month internship turned into several transformative years, as I was introduced to the grassroots dimensions of environmental justice and met inspiring figures like Rajendra Singh, the “Waterman of India”.

My early work in the development sector focused on human rights, gender, and natural resource management and gave me valuable field exposure and insights into how laws play out in real life. Soon, I began engaging with questions around sustainable development, governance, and how law could be used as a tool to promote environmental responsibility. This eventually led me to the field of environmental law, not just as an academic subject, but as a dynamic and evolving space where real impact was possible.

Connecting environment and law

I advise other organisations, develop curricula, teach at multiple institutions, and conduct training for forest officers, civil servants, and members of the judiciary. Through the Centre for Environmental Law (CEL), WWF-India, we’ve tried to strengthen environmental law education in the country. I’ve designed and launched several online courses such as the Post Graduate Diploma in Environmental Law and Policy, developed jointly with National Law University, Delhi, and the LL.M. in Environmental Law, Energy and Climate Change, in collaboration with O.P. Jindal Global University, which have opened new avenues for students to pursue specialised legal careers in environmental issues.

What makes this journey rewarding is the ability to work for the voiceless wildlife and ecosystems that cannot advocate for themselves. One of the most exhilarating cases I followed was the Nyamjang Chhu case in Arunachal Pradesh, where the return of the endangered Black-necked Crane to its threatened breeding ground, just in time for the final court hearing, led to the halting of a hydropower project. It was as though Nature itself had spoken!

I often say that environmental law is not something that can be practised in isolation. You need to bring in science, economics, politics, even ethics. One of the biggest challenges is how to communicate complex environmental issues to diverse stakeholders; from communities to corporations to judges. That’s where law can act as a bridge.

To anyone considering a green career in law, I’d say: identify problems but focus equally on creating solutions. Use your skills to advocate, to innovate, and to act. Our generation has done its part but it’s your voice that will shape the future. Be that voice for the voiceless.

Behind California, it is also America’s second-largest producer of solar power, but it is catching up rapidly.
“Renewable energy is so important to rural Texas,” says John Davis, another rancher and a former member of the Texas House of Representatives.
No, it’s clean power, it’s renewable power, it’s economics.
The group’s polling in March showed 64pc of Republican voters in Texas favour renewable energy, up from 60pc two years earlier.","Bobby Helmers used to be an oilman.

For years, he worked leasing land for petroleum companies and at one point had as many as nine oil wells on his ranch in West Texas.

But those wells have long been plugged up.

“It’s not that I was dissatisfied with the oil,” says Helmers. “It’s just that production was depleting. They became no longer economically feasible.”

Now, instead, the 84-year-old Trump voter has six wind turbines spinning on his ranch.

Standing 300ft high, they make up the north-eastern end of a 76-turbine farm that stretches into the distance and is owned by French utilities company Engie, which pays Helmers handsomely for the privilege.

“If you’re talking about bottom-line dollars, the wind turbines make more for the ranch than the cattle do,” says Helmers. “They’re a blessing.”

His shift to renewables may seem surprising, especially given that he lives in the largest oil-producing state in the largest oil-producing country in the world.

But the free-market, Republican region has also now become far and away America’s biggest generator of renewable energy, as well as producing nearly 43pc of all US crude.

Last year, the state generated 124,934 gigawatt hours of wind energy, enough to power 11.6 million homes and nearly three times the second-largest wind-producing state.

Behind California, it is also America’s second-largest producer of solar power, but it is catching up rapidly.

Between 2020 and 2024, California’s solar output jumped by 67pc. In Texas, the increase was 338pc.

Its wind and solar output combined is nearly double the Golden State’s, and so far this year, nearly half of Texas’s electricity was powered by clean energy.

The numbers are testament not to government mandates but to what is the most aggressively competitive electricity market in America.

Texas has its own grid, a granular, location-based pricing system and no utility monopolies.

The result is an abundance of clean, cheap power fuelling strong economic growth in Texas, with many Republicans supportive of the shift away from oil.

However, their backing is now being put to the test as Donald Trump wages war on America’s clean energy sector.

After returning to the White House with a promise to “drill, baby, drill”, the US president has dismissed wind farms as “junk” and referred to them dismissively as “windmills”.

He is now planning to fund his “big beautiful bill” by gutting America’s green energy industry, stripping away credits to fund a barrage of tax cuts.

Economists predict the move will cost Texas more than $50bn (£37bn) in lost economic growth over a decade, putting the president on a collision course with some of his core supporters.

“Renewable energy is so important to rural Texas,” says John Davis, another rancher and a former member of the Texas House of Representatives.

“And these are Republican voters. They’re alienating their own base. They’re going against their very own voters.”

Free-market power

Visiting Texas’s latest solar farm means driving through the Permian Basin, America’s largest oilfield.

For miles, on either side of the road north of a town called Big Spring, hundreds of oil pump-jacks are visible across vast fields of mesquite trees.

Their pickaxe-shaped heads dip slowly up and down as they extract crude oil from underground wells. Located among them, as far as the eye can see, are hundreds of wind turbines.

While oil and gas production is still dominant in Texas, the Hornet Solar Farm, which became fully operational in April, is emblematic of the state’s renewable energy boom.

Hornet consists of 1.3m solar panels that, in 12,000 rows, span an acreage 11 times the size of London’s Hyde Park. They produce 600 megawatts of electricity – nearly double the output of the largest solar farm in the UK.

The farm is so large that its owner, Vesper Energy, has installed a herd of 2,140 sheep that can be seen trotting beneath the panels, tasked with keeping vegetation at bay.

This is in addition to five people employed as full-time mowers. And Vesper is already working on plans to expand the farm further.

“Texas, in general and especially this area of West Texas, has all the elements you look for in a perfect solar project,” says Zach Wald, Vesper’s vice president of engineering, procurement and construction.

It is not just about the amount of sun, but the quality of the transmission system, the speed of the planning system, and the openness among locals to this kind of development, says Wald: “There’s a community that’s positive and wants it.”

As well as boasting sun and wind, Texas also has a growing population that requires power.

But another driving factor in attracting renewable energy companies is the free market.

“In Texas, there is no push for renewable energy,” says Nick Chaset, the chief executive of Octopus Energy US, the American arm of Britain’s largest energy supplier, which launched in the US five years ago in Houston. “It’s purely markets, may the cheapest resource win.”

Politically, Texas and California couldn’t be further apart, especially on net zero. However, both states have embraced clean power, albeit for different reasons.

“Texas and California have diametrically opposed political rhetoric,” says Chaset. “California is very much net zero or nothing. It’s about trying to construct a perfect world, [which means] it becomes extremely expensive.

“That dynamic mimics the UK a bit. It’s very high-minded, but actually not necessarily delivering the desired outcome.”

The challenge facing California is that its energy costs are some of the highest in the country, despite boasting plenty of solar power and battery storage.

By contrast, Texas has lower costs because of its agnostic, free-market approach to net zero, as well as a dearth of regulation.

“You just have to fulfil your energy obligations to your consumers, and because you’re competing, you’re trying to do it at the least cost,” says Chaset.

A kilowatt hour of power for a Texas homeowner in April cost 15.55 cents (12p), according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), compared with 31.55 cents in California.

Another key aspect that sets Texas apart is that it has its own grid, run by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot).

Crucially, unlike other states that also have their own grids such as California, Texas is not tied to the Eastern or Western interconnectors.

This means the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Ferc) has no role in Texas’s transmission market, meaning local officials are free to set the state’s power policies as they wish.

“The benefit of that is agility,” says Pablo Vegas, the Ercot chief executive.

This means that decisions can be made without federal consent, taking years off the approval process.

“We operate probably the most pure competitive electric market in the United States,” says Vegas.

While in Britain, the grid has one price nationally, Ercot has 17,000 “nodes”.

“That is effectively 17,000 different mini-markets across the state,” says Guy Newey, the chief executive of the Energy Systems Catapult in the UK.

While other parts of the US operate capacity markets, which means operators are paid for providing capacity to meet peak demand, Texas operates an “energy-only” market. This means operators are only paid for the electricity they provide to the grid.

Every five minutes, in every node, each power plant in Texas bids a price for the electricity that it can deliver to Ercot. Ercot then dispatches the cheapest energy into the grid first.

As the generators are only paid for what they send into the grid, there is a major incentive to be cheap.

“It set up its markets to be cut-throat,” says Joshua Rhodes, a research scientist at the University of Texas.

By contrast, in many other parts of the US, there is no competition at all, says Rhodes.

“In the south-east US, they’re a fully regulated monopoly utility,” he says. “The same company owns all the generators and the power lines, and they’re the ones you pay your bill to at the end of the month.”

Rewards for keeping costs down help the renewables sector, where projects are cheaper and quicker to build than new gas power stations.

“This is all getting built in Texas, not because solar and storage are green, but because it is simply the most cost-effective and fastest,” says Chaset.

Theoretically, this pricing system creates more financial risk for renewable energy companies operating in Texas compared to the UK, where the British Government protects against price volatility with so-called contracts for difference.

This extra risk is more than outweighed, however, by the speed and agility of Texas’s planning system, says Newey.

This is aided by the fact that 97pc of the land in Texas is privately owned, meaning landowners can largely sell up to whomever they want.

Renewables-loving Republicans

John Davis was approached three times before he finally agreed to let an energy company build seven turbines on his Stoney Lonesome Ranch – land that has been in his family since 1880.

The first couple of times, Davis turned them down because he did not like the look of wind turbines. “We thought they were big monstrosities,” he says.

But six years ago, he relented and now takes great pride in the 500ft turbines turning above his herd of Wagyu cows and their calves.

“I think they look majestic,” says Davis. “It shows we’re part of the new clean power that’s sustainable and it’s great for kids growing up in rural communities to see that you can do renewable power.”

As for what triggered his Damascene conversion, the 65-year-old grins before responding: “They get a lot prettier when they start paying you money. I can be bought.”

Leasing his land for wind turbines now produces around 40pc of Davis’s income, meaning he is far less reliant on the volatility of cattle farming.

“That is significant because I don’t have to maintain them,” says the rancher. “I don’t have to water them, or feed them, or castrate them.”

As a result, he has been able to reinvest in the ranch and use some of the money to build a community area in the town that hosts a weekly farmers market. “People can strike oil, we happened to strike wind,” says Davis.

This flexibility highlights how conservatives in Texas have long favoured the development of a wide range of power sources, regardless of Trump’s anti-green agenda.

The seeds of Texas’s wind boom began in 1999, when then-governor George W Bush scrapped the state’s electricity monopolies and called for more wind power.

This was then followed by a decision in 2005 by Rick Perry, Bush’s successor and Trump’s energy secretary during his first term, to push through the Texas Utilities Code.

This designated Competitive Renewable Energy Zones (Crez), which enabled transmission lines to be connected to windy areas before contracts were signed with developers.

Davis was serving in the Texas House of Representatives when both bills were passed. “All the Republicans supported it,” he says.

“Even though we are an oil state, we were all saying, ‘We have a lot of sun, we have a lot of wind – that’s a good thing.’”

However, he insists he is anything but a net zero fanatic.

“We don’t like to call it green energy, because that is affiliated with AOC,” Davis adds, referring to Democrat firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

“If you say green energy, people think you’re just a tree-hugger. No, it’s clean power, it’s renewable power, it’s economics. I’m not doing it to try to save the Earth.”

Ironically, one key driver of demand in Texas’s renewable energy sector is oil and gas, as shale production in the Permian Basin uses vast amounts of electricity.

Yet in Texas’s last biannual legislative sessions, which adjourned in June, some Republican lawmakers brought forward a series of bills designed to curb the renewable energy rollout by introducing new regulatory requirements and fees.

“The anti-renewable Right in Texas is starting to look a lot like the California pro-clean energy Left,” says Chaset. “They both think the government must make all decisions and mandate this and that. In both cases, it’s top-down decision making.”

Conservative Texans for Energy Innovation (CTEI), a group formed six years ago to advocate for an “all of the above” approach to energy, lobbied hard against the measures, alongside many landowners. Davis is himself a member. The Republican House rejected the bills.

CTEI is part of the Conservative Energy Network, a group that spans 25 states in America trying to advance free-market clean energy policies.

The group’s polling in March showed 64pc of Republican voters in Texas favour renewable energy, up from 60pc two years earlier. Only 22pc are against.

Opposition to renewable energy generation in Texas is typically based on objections to the appearance of wind and solar farms, as well as concerns that they rely too much on subsidies, says Matt Welsh, CTEI’s state director.

Others also point to their intermittency.

Storm Uri, which dumped record amounts of snow on Texas in February 2021 and triggered the worst energy infrastructure crisis in the state’s history, leaving 4.5 million people without power, has left a troubled legacy.

At the time, Texas governor Greg Abbott claimed the power blackouts were because “wind and solar got shut down”.

In reality, wind turbines did freeze, but so did Texas’s gas wells and coal power pipes.

Altogether, more fossil fuel power went offline than renewables, but the narrative blaming renewables stuck.

“That has been disproved, yet it got ingrained and started this gradual doubt about the value of wind and solar,” says Welsh.

War on the ‘windmills’

As for Trump, he has expressed consistent opposition to renewable energy.

“I don’t want windmills destroying our place,” the president said as he prepared to sign his “big beautiful bill” this month. “I don’t want these solar things where they go for miles and they cover up half a mountain and they’re ugly as hell.”

For once, his bite may be worse than his bark.

The bill will claw back more than $500bn in subsidies and tax credits implemented under Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Within this, the one that matters the most for the renewables sector is the bill’s measure to eliminate tax credits for clean electricity production and investment for projects starting after 2027, worth around $250bn over the next decade.

“I HATE ‘GREEN TAX CREDITS’ IN THE GREAT, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL. They are largely a giant SCAM.” Trump wrote on Truth Social in June.

“Windmills, and the rest of this ‘JUNK’ are the most expensive and inefficient energy in the world.”

Federal subsidies for renewable energy have certainly increased the price advantage that renewable energy producers have selling electricity into Ercot, says Vegas.

Of course, America’s fossil fuel industry also gets massive subsidies to the tune of tens of billions per year.

However, these subsidies do not flow directly through to the real-time market price for consumers in the same way that they do for renewables, says Vegas.

Wind farms get production tax credits for every megawatt they produce. “That is real-time revenue that can be priced into their economic dispatch,” says Vegas.

As a result, the sudden loss of the tax credits means that fewer projects will be built and household energy bills will rise.

According to Dan O’Brien, a senior analyst at Energy Innovation, the bill means Texas will miss out on about 77 gigawatts of new electricity generation capacity over the next decade, compared to the current trajectory. This will mean $52bn in lost GDP growth and a net loss of 94,000 jobs.

It will also add 23pc to consumer energy prices and 54pc to industrial energy prices over the next decade, says O’Brien.

This is after accounting for inflation. By 2030, annual household energy bills in Texas will be $220 higher because of the bill. By 2035, the extra cost will be $480.

“Instead of seeing prices come down as we add renewables, we’re seeing prices go up because of the bill,” says O’Brien.

Although it increases subsidies for oil and gas, fossil fuel production cannot be raised quickly enough to fill the hole left by fewer renewables.

“I am actually a proponent of phasing out the tax credits,” says Doug Lewin, the president of Stoic Energy Consulting. “But actually phasing them out, with a ramp over 20 years as opposed to this cliff.

“Because what is mangled at the bottom of the cliff are consumers in the American economy. And if you’re truly conservative from a market perspective, you should be in favour of phasing out oil and gas subsidies too.”

“It’s going to raise the cost of building things and it’s going to slow down the build-out,” says Aaron Zubaty, chief executive of Eolian, an investor behind several energy projects in Texas. “Then less stuff will be built.”

Such concerns are being raised amid a radical policy shift in government.

This month, Doug Burgum, Trump’s interior secretary, announced that renewable energy projects would only be allowed to progress on public lands if he or his deputy had personally approved them.

“What we have already seen is projects that are really good that we’ve been developing for a very long time have had their permits denied in the last few weeks, very surprisingly,” says Zubaty.

“We are already seeing multiple projects, tens of millions of dollars of investment, that within the last two weeks we are going to have to walk away from.”

One now mothballed project was a 150-megawatt solar project in Virginia.

Unsurprisingly, Davis is frustrated by the policy shift and the anti-renewables rhetoric.

“Rural Texas doesn’t have very much economic development,” he says.

“That’s what just doesn’t make any sense, and that makes me frustrated as a conservative, as a Republican, as a rancher. My own party, it’s like they’re turning against us. It’s wrong-headed.”

Complaints of this nature are emerging in the wake of horrific flash floods that killed 137 people in Texas this month, sparking outcry over Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service.

However, regardless of grumbles, Trump knows that he can probably still count on Texas for support.

While he disagrees with the president over renewable energy cuts, Davis says in no way will they be enough to stop him from voting Republican.

Even so, he’ll keep fighting his case.

“Wind just makes sense,” says Davis. “For me, I can’t think of anything more conservative than to use what God gave us, wind and power.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/briefs/2025/07/25/TELEMMGLPICT000433171358_17534351152250_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-07-27 02:58:50.062637

Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas.
“The fossil fuel age is flailing and failing,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports.
United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South.
“Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies, they sabotaging them.","The global switch to renewable energy has passed a “positive tipping point” where solar and wind power will become even cheaper and more widespread, according to two United Nations reports released Tuesday, describing a bright spot amid otherwise gloomy progress to curb climate change.

Last year, 74 per cent of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green sources, according to the UN’s multiagency report, called Seizing the Moment of Opportunity. It found that 92.5 per cent of all new electricity capacity added to the grid worldwide in that time period came from renewables. Meanwhile, sales of electric vehicles are up from 500,000 in 2015 to more than 17 million in 2024.

The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by IRENA, the International Renewable Energy Agency. Solar power now is 41 per cent cheaper and wind power is 53 per cent cheaper globally than the lowest-cost fossil fuel, the reports said. Fossil fuels, which are the chief cause of climate change, include coal, oil and natural gas.

“The fossil fuel age is flailing and failing,” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in Tuesday morning speech unveiling the reports. “We are in the dawn of a new energy era. An era where cheap, clean, abundant energy powers a world rich in economic opportunity.”

“Just follow the money,” Guterres said, quoting the reports that showed last year there was US$2 trillion in investment in green energy, which is about US$800 billion more than in fossil fuels.

Still, United Nations officials said the switch to renewable energy, while remarkable compared to 10 years ago, is not happening fast enough.

The global renewables growth has been mostly in developed countries such as China — where one-tenth of the economy is tied up in green energy — as well as countries such as India and Brazil.

Yet Africa represented less than two per cent of the new green energy capacity installed last year despite having great electrification needs, the reports said. United Nations officials blamed the high cost of capital for the Global South.

“The Global South must be empowered to generate its own electricity without adding to already unsustainable level of debts,” said Bahamian climate scientist Adelle Thomas of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Thomas, who did not work on the reports, added that they debunk the myth that clean energy cannot compete with fossil fuels, instead showing a clean energy future is not just possible but likely inevitable.

The UN reports are “right on the money,” said University of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who also wasn’t part of the studies. He said the economic tipping point leads to a cycle that keeps driving renewable costs down and makes fossil fuel power less and less desirable.

And renewables are booming despite fossil fuels getting nearly nine times the government consumption subsidies as they do, Guterres and the reports said. In 2023, global fossil fuel subsidies amounted to US$620 billion, compared to US$70 billion for renewables, the UN report said.

But just as renewables are booming, fossil fuel production globally is still increasing, instead of going down in response. United Nations officials said that’s because power demand is increasing overall, spurred by developing countries, artificial intelligence data centres and the need for cooling in an ever warmer world.

“A typical AI data centre eats up as much electricity as 100,000 homes,” Guterres said. “By 2030 data centres could consume as much electricity as all of Japan does today.”

So Guterres called on the world’s major tech firms to power data centres completely with renewables by 2030.

In the United States, solar and wind power had been growing at a rate of 12.3 per cent per year from 2018 to 2023, the IRENA report said. But since US President Donald Trump took office earlier this year, his administration cut many federal renewable energy programmes, with a renewed emphasis on fossil fuels.

Guterres warned nations hanging on to fossil fuels that they were heading down a dangerous path that would make them poorer not richer, without naming the United States specifically.

“Countries that cling to fossil fuels are not protecting their economies, they sabotaging them. Driving up costs. Undermining competitiveness. Locking in stranded assets,” Guterres said.

Renewables are the smart way to go for energy security, Guterres said. With renewables, he said, “there are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind.”

David Waskow of the World Resources Institute said the message of problems mixed with optimism makes sense. He compared Tuesday’s assessment to climbing a mountain and taking time halfway through to look down and appreciate how far you’ve come. But a look up shows the trek is getting steeper.

Guterres said he understands how young people could have a sense of “doom and gloom,” and regrets what his generation has left them — but all is not lost.

“This is not inevitable. We have the tools, the instruments, the capacity to change course,” Guterres said. “There are reasons to be hopeful.”",https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2025/07/27/3191480/8342042.jpg?itok=7tzDfrm9,N,,2025-07-27 01:59:06.704414

Tesla's big swing moment is not just a test of engineering and execution—it's a defining chapter in the company's evolution.","In the summer of 2025, Tesla finds itself at a crossroads. The electric vehicle pioneer, once synonymous with market dominance, now faces a confluence of challenges: a 10% year-over-year drop in U.S. EV sales, a 13% global delivery decline, and the impending expiration of federal EV tax credits. Meanwhile, competitors like General Motors and BYD are closing the gap, and Chinese automakers are reshaping the global EV landscape. Yet, amid these headwinds, Tesla's leadership—CEO Elon Musk chief among them—has staked the company's future on three ambitious bets: robotaxi, Optimus, and the Tesla Semi. These projects, if successful, could redefine Tesla's role in the global economy. If they fail, the company risks becoming a relic of the EV era it once defined.

The Robotaxi Gambit: A $75 Billion Bet on Autonomy

Tesla's robotaxi service, currently in a limited pilot in Austin, Texas, is the most audacious of these bets. Priced at $6.90 per ride, the service is projected to generate $1 billion in 2026 and scale to $75 billion by 2030, assuming regulatory and technical hurdles are overcome. This vision hinges on two critical factors: regulatory approvals in key markets like California and Europe, and public trust in Tesla's camera-only autonomy system.

The robotaxi is more than a mobility service—it's a platform for AI-driven data collection and refinement. With 500,000+ Tesla vehicles on the road already generating real-world driving data, the company has a unique edge in training its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system. However, delays in deploying FSD globally (due to regulatory fragmentation) and technical challenges in achieving full autonomy could derail timelines. For instance, Tesla's inability to secure approval in California by mid-2025 has already pushed back its plan to cover half the U.S. population with robotaxi by year-end.

Investors must weigh the potential of robotaxi against Tesla's current financial realities. The company's Q2 2025 earnings report revealed a 12% year-over-year revenue drop and a 16% plunge in net income, driven by waning EV tax credits and rising competition. Yet, if robotaxi achieves its 2030 revenue target, it would represent 45% of Tesla's total vehicle revenue that year, potentially offsetting declines in core EV sales.

Optimus: The Humanoid Robot with $10 Trillion in Long-Term Potential

Tesla's Optimus humanoid robot, unveiled in 2023, is another moonshot. Designed to handle repetitive tasks in manufacturing and beyond, Optimus is expected to begin factory operations by late 2025. The production roadmap is aggressive: 10,000 units in 2024, 100,000 units annually by 2026, and 100 million units by 2030. At scale, production costs could fall below $20,000 per unit, with market pricing likely higher due to demand.

The market potential is staggering. Analysts estimate that capturing just 1% of the $25 trillion global automation market could generate $250 billion in revenue by 2030. Optimus's success, however, depends on Tesla's ability to scale production efficiently and ensure the robots meet safety and performance standards. Early adopters in manufacturing and logistics will be critical, but skeptics question whether the technology can transition from controlled environments to broader consumer markets.

The Tesla Semi: A Delayed Promise in a Crowded Market

The Tesla Semi, first unveiled in 2017, has become a symbol of the company's struggle to balance ambition with execution. Production is now expected to begin in late 2025 at Tesla's Nevada gigafactory, with annual capacity targeting 50,000 units. However, the Semi's economics have deteriorated: its price has surged from $150,000 to over $350,000, undermining its total cost of ownership (TCO) advantages. Early adopters like Ryder have cut orders and extended delivery timelines, citing “dramatic changes to product economics.”

The Semi must also contend with a rapidly evolving market. Rivals like BYD, Freightliner, and Volvo already operate electric Class 8 trucks in the U.S., offering real-world performance data and customer testimonials. Tesla's delays have allowed these competitors to capture early adopters, while U.S. tariffs on Chinese components have further complicated production planning. For the Semi to succeed, it must deliver not just performance but a compelling value proposition in a market where TCO is king.

Strategic Implications: Balancing Risk and Reward

Tesla's pivot to AI, robotics, and autonomy is a high-stakes bet. If robotaxi and Optimus achieve their projected growth, they could generate $300 billion in combined revenue by 2030, dwarfing the company's current EV sales. The energy segment, meanwhile, is a stabilizing force, with Tesla deploying 9.6 gigawatt-hours of storage in Q2 2025 and on track to generate $3.5 billion in annual gross profit by 2026.

Yet, the risks are equally profound. Regulatory delays, technical bottlenecks, and public skepticism could stall robotaxi's rollout. Optimus's transition from factory to consumer markets is unproven. And the Semi's high price point and crowded field make it a long shot to recapture lost EV market share.

Investment Advice: Navigating the Uncertainty

For investors, Tesla's current valuation—142 times projected profits—reflects high expectations. This premium is justified if the company executes on its moonshot bets but could become a liability if it misses key milestones. A prudent strategy might involve:

Hedging against regulatory and technical risks by diversifying exposure to other EV and AI stocks (e.g., Waymo, Boston Dynamics).

Monitoring robotaxi's regulatory progress in California and Europe, which could catalyze or derail its growth.

Assessing Optimus's scalability through production timelines and early adopter feedback.

In the short term, Tesla's stock may face volatility as it navigates Q3 2025's tax credit expiration and Q4's post-holiday market adjustment. Long-term, however, the company's success will hinge on whether its bets on autonomy and robotics pay off—transforming Tesla from an EV maker into a cornerstone of the AI and automation era.

Tesla's big swing moment is not just a test of engineering and execution—it's a defining chapter in the company's evolution. For those willing to tolerate the risks, the rewards could be life-changing. For others, the lesson may be that even the most visionary companies must adapt to stay ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-27 14:02:35.938870

The gathering, the second of its kind, was organized by the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and brought together business leaders, government officials and other representatives from Japan, India and ISA member nations.
Of those, India and Japan are two of the largest economies and are widely seen as leaders in global solar and solar-linked technologies.
In 2022, the two countries launched a Clean Energy Partnership, with the goal of expanding cooperation on clean energy and energy security.
“It guts clean energy tax credits, kills American jobs and ships them overseas, raises electricity bills for families and small businesses, and weakens our energy independence,” said Andrew Reagan, president of the nonprofit Clean Energy for America, in a press release.","The latest data has made it official — India overtook Japan in 2023 to become the world’s third-largest generator of solar energy.

But at the International Solar Festival held at the Osaka Expo earlier this month, the focus wasn’t on competition but rather how India and Japan can partner to grow solar capacity together.

The gathering, the second of its kind, was organized by the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and brought together business leaders, government officials and other representatives from Japan, India and ISA member nations. The goal was to tell the story of solar and its potential as a driver of economic growth to visitors from around the world.

“We wanted to have the International Solar Festival in Osaka because one of the key challenges is on getting the private sector to look at new frontier solar technologies, which is linked to the question of how Japan and India can collaborate meaningfully,” said Ashish Khanna, the director-general of the ISA.

The ISA, founded in 2015 at COP21 in Paris and based in India, has more than 100 member countries. Of those, India and Japan are two of the largest economies and are widely seen as leaders in global solar and solar-linked technologies.

In addition to promoting tech to the private sector, the alliance also seeks to address another challenge — the lack of progress on expanding solar generation and production in developing countries, despite massive potential. Case in point, the most recent analysis from the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) found that Asia, Europe and North America accounted for 90% of renewable capacity growth in 2024.

“Bridging the divide and closing the investment gap between countries and regions is critical,” said Francesco La Camera, IRENA’s director-general, in an emailed statement.

Expanding partnerships

The ISF in Osaka was just the latest in a series of energy- and climate-related discussions between Japan and India. In 2022, the two countries launched a Clean Energy Partnership, with the goal of expanding cooperation on clean energy and energy security.

India also joined the Japan-led Asia Energy Transition Initiative (AETI) in 2023. More recently, talks are ongoing about India becoming the next country eligible to receive funds under Japan’s joint crediting mechanism (JCM), one of the largest state-led carbon credit and offset programs in the world.

“The JCM is expected to generate employment opportunities in both nations by fostering investments in low-carbon technologies,” said Shamkant Mirashi, an India-based sustainability consultant. “By subsidizing these technologies, Japan can help equalize the cost of clean energy with conventional polluting sources.”

Then, in 2024, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) provided funds to support Osaka Gas’ joint investment in renewable energy projects with India’s CleanMax.

Despite this, there’s still much more to be done, says Khanna, as overall bilateral investment and trade in solar have been limited. That, he hopes, will soon change.

“All partnerships take time,” Khanna said. “We want to see the R&D and manufacturing ecosystem of Japan marrying with the entrepreneurial talent and market of India, a harmonization of alignment. How this translates into concrete business opportunities is something that we would like to facilitate more.”

One challenge is that most major Japanese companies and financial institutions have yet to make large investments into solar technologies in India, which Khanna says is disappointing, as solar provides a safe, reliable investment opportunity.

“Japan has not exercised enough the financial muscle of its pension funds and institutional investors,” said Khanna. “The time is now ... to create an ecosystem by which more concrete investment decisions are made.”

Part of that reluctance could be the fact that major players in Japan and the government itself are not exactly all-in on solar energy.

One criticism of Japan’s approach, via entities such as AETI but also the Asia Zero Emissions Community (AZEC) has been a focus on pushing alternative Japanese technologies such as ammonia and biomass co-firing, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Critics say these alternatives are either not viable, short-term solutions or would have limited impact in reducing emissions. But Khanna did not necessarily see these efforts as distracting from solar.

“I think the answer for that is not either/or, but and,” said Khanna. “Green hydrogen and ammonia have huge potential if the economics can be sorted out, and India can be a source of green hydrogen for Japan.”

The elephants in the room

Two notable countries were absent at the ISF — the United States and China. Despite their lack of engagement in the solar alliance, both countries, in their respective ways, cast a long shadow on the potential for Japan-India solar collaboration.

While the U.S. has the second-highest solar capacity in the world and, under the Inflation Reduction Act passed during the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, has made strides in solar and cleantech manufacturing, the world’s largest economy is seeing dramatic cutbacks in global climate support this year.

The main driver is the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose recent budget reconciliation law passed by Congress would reduce solar tax credits, part of a sudden shift away from support for renewable energy projects.

“It guts clean energy tax credits, kills American jobs and ships them overseas, raises electricity bills for families and small businesses, and weakens our energy independence,” said Andrew Reagan, president of the nonprofit Clean Energy for America, in a press release.

Efforts set up under the Biden administration, like a partnership with Japan focused on expanding technology and supply chains for floating offshore wind, look unlikely to continue.

Instead, amid trade tensions between the two countries, the U.S. has been pushing Japan to buy more of its liquefied natural gas. In fact, new trade tariffs also could limit the export of solar components and panels to the U.S., while the Trump administration prioritizes the domestic expansion of planet-warming fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.

China, meanwhile, has been praised for its rapid domestic expansion of solar, adding more capacity than the rest of the world combined in 2024. But the industry has numerous ethical concerns, including well-documented links to forced labor and human rights violations in the Uyghur homelands in the far-western region of Xinjiang, where many solar components are produced.

“There is a significant risk that that solar panels are being built with Uyghur forced labor, potentially across every stage: from quartz mining and polysilicon refinement to module construction and the development of the plant itself,” said Elfidar Iltebir, president of the nonprofit Uyghur American Association.

Chinese companies, backed by state subsidies and access to cheap energy and labor, have been able to undercut solar manufacturing in Europe and Japan. Even India’s attempts to expand domestic production have run into issues, and the country remains reliant on Chinese components.

Exploring new technologies

With those issues plaguing the industry in the world’s top two economies, tie-ups between countries such as India and Japan become all the more important.

For Khanna, one path forward might be developing alternatives to photovoltaics, the most common solar technology used today.

“If the industry is disrupted, that can itself become a source of diversification,” said Khanna. “Perovskite, for example, doesn't need silica or ingots, and solid state batteries may not need lithium. The current supply chain can become a new supply chain if these technologies can be commercialized, and there is clearly a role for India, Japan and other countries to collaborate.”

A model already exists, says Khanna. One of India’s leading foreign collaborators is Shizuoka Prefecture-based Suzuki, which partnered with India’s Maruti to build the country’s largest automaker, and have even released an electric car together.

“What will be the Suzuki for solar in India,” asked Khanna. “Suzuki transformed the automobile sector, by taking a bet. Who will take that bet, that private sector leadership, for solar?”",https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2025/07/27/483555.jpg?v=3.1,N,,2025-07-27 01:58:57.117918

Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

Associated Press

President Donald Trump’s plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the U.S. could speed up a building boom that was already expected to strain the nation’s ability to power it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here's what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company's development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What's at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that's not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It's necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it's possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can't be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,"" she added. ""But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”

A recent breakthrough study published in npj Sustainable Agriculture presents an innovative approach to achieving food sufficiency through the integration of renewable energy technologies specifically adapted for Arctic conditions. This pioneering research elucidates how harnessing wind, solar, and geothermal energy can overcome the logistical and climatic hurdles that have long impeded reliable food cultivation and supply chains in the far North.

The profound challenges of Arctic agriculture stem from its extreme cold, permafrost soil, prolonged darkness during winter months, and short growing seasons. Traditional agrarian practices are fundamentally unsuitable for this environment without significant energy inputs for heating, lighting, and infrastructure maintenance. The research team led by Hailu, Najm, and Aspholm examines how renewable energy infrastructures can serve as sustainable power sources to enable controlled-environment agriculture, such as greenhouses powered by wind turbines and photovoltaic systems designed to operate under polar conditions.

Central to the study is the recognition that Arctic communities suffer from chronic food insecurity exacerbated by high costs and the carbon footprint of food imports. The authors propose an integrated energy-food nexus, whereby local renewable energy generation can operationalize vertical farming, hydroponics, and aquaponics within insulated structures that mitigate the impact of external climate variability. Their models demonstrate how hybrid renewable energy systems can maintain stable indoor climates while minimizing reliance on fossil fuels, thereby significantly reducing environmental impact and dependency on distant food supply chains.

Wind energy emerges as a particularly promising resource due to the Arctic’s persistent, strong wind currents. The researchers detail the engineering adaptations required for turbines to endure extreme cold, ice accumulation, and low sunlight visibility. Innovations such as cold-resistant lubricants, blade de-icing technologies, and reinforced structural components are critical to maintaining turbine performance and longevity. These advancements not only ensure steady electrical output for agricultural applications but also contribute to localized grid resilience.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) technology, often underrated in polar zones due to limited winter insolation, gains new relevance when combined with energy storage systems and efficient demand management. The study highlights the importance of maximizing solar utilization during the extended summers, while relying on energy storage solutions — including advanced batteries and thermal energy storage — to bridge periods of darkness. The synergy between wind and solar generation creates a complementary system capable of delivering continuous power across fluctuating seasonal conditions.

Perhaps the most novel aspect of the research involves tapping into geothermal sources, which remain underexploited in Arctic locales despite the presence of sub-surface heat reservoirs. By integrating shallow geothermal heat pumps, the system can provide reliable baseline heating necessary for maintaining optimal growing temperatures year-round. This approach not only leverages a clean energy source particularly suited to permafrost regions but also ensures thermal stability critical for plant growth and aquaculture systems.

The authors employ comprehensive techno-economic analyses to assess the feasibility and scalability of these renewable energy systems for community-scale food production. Their findings suggest that initial capital expenditures are offset by long-term reductions in fossil fuel consumption, supply chain vulnerabilities, and greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, the localized production enabled by renewables enhances food sovereignty and resilience against global supply disruptions — a factor increasingly vital amid geopolitical and climatic uncertainties.

Another dimension addressed by the investigation pertains to the socio-cultural implications of renewable-powered Arctic agriculture. The study acknowledges the importance of aligning technological deployment with indigenous knowledge systems and community priorities. Co-development strategies involving local stakeholders ensure that energy-food innovations are culturally appropriate, economically inclusive, and environmentally respectful, thus fostering holistic sustainability outcomes.

Technological integration extends beyond energy generation to include advances in smart farming techniques. The authors describe how sensor networks, AI-based monitoring, and automation can optimize resource use efficiency within Arctic greenhouses. Precision irrigation, nutrient delivery, and climate control minimize waste and adapt dynamically to changing environmental parameters, further enhancing the viability and productivity of northern food systems powered by renewables.

The environmental benefits of this approach resonate beyond food security. By drastically curbing fossil fuel dependency, renewable energy-driven Arctic agriculture offers a pathway to mitigating local contributions to climate change — creating a positive feedback loop where sustainable food systems also help preserve fragile polar ecosystems. The research highlights potential reductions in black carbon emissions and soil degradation, pivotal for maintaining biodiversity and ecological balance.

Policy implications emanating from the work underscore an urgent need for coordinated Arctic energy and food security strategies that prioritize renewable technology deployment. The authors recommend targeted investments, incentivization of green innovation, and the establishment of supportive regulatory frameworks to accelerate transitions toward clean, resilient food production infrastructures in northern communities.

Beyond the Arctic, the principles demonstrated by this study carry transformative potential for other extreme environments confronted with similar constraints on energy and agriculture. Deserts, high-altitude settlements, and isolated islands could adopt tailored renewable energy-food systems inspired by the Arctic model, contributing to global efforts to create more equitable and sustainable food networks.

The convergence of climate science, renewable energy engineering, and sustainable agriculture represented here marks a milestone in addressing the multifaceted challenges of northern food security. This interdisciplinary endeavor paves the way for new paradigms in how humanity can sustainably inhabit and thrive in the planet’s most extreme frontiers.

As the urgency of climate adaptation intensifies, this research offers a compelling vision where Greenland’s glaciers, Siberian tundra, and Canadian Arctic communities may transform from food-deficient zones into sources of nutritional self-reliance, powered purely by the winds, sunlight, and earth beneath their feet.

In sum, the work of Hailu and colleagues presents a comprehensive blueprint for harnessing Arctic renewable energy resources to deliver sustainable and sufficient food production. This promising fusion of cutting-edge energy technology with controlled-environment agriculture not only addresses immediate nutritional needs but also aligns with broader goals of environmental stewardship, cultural respect, and economic development in the circumpolar North.

The Arctic’s frozen landscape no longer needs to be a barrier to food security; through innovation and sustainability, it can become a beacon of humanity’s ability to adapt and flourish even in the harshest of climates. The future of Arctic food sufficiency lies at the intersection of wind turbines, solar arrays, geothermal heat pumps, and intelligent farming systems, heralding a new era of resilience and prosperity.

PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.

TRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND

PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.

In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.

AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM’s territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.

Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.

While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.

Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center’s power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.

PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.

To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.

,Detroit and Evs,2025-07-27 00:11:42+00:00,Jalopnik,The Pros And Cons Of Buying A High Mileage EV - Jalopnik,Logan K. Carter,,,,,https://www.jalopnik.com/1921830/pros-cons-buying-high-mileage-ev/,"Ten years ago, buying a used EV was a much riskier prospect since many of the early EVs had very low maximum ranges when new and less efficient battery cooling methods.
Buying a used EV, in most cases, means you will spend less money on repairs, less time at the shop, and less headache surrounding upkeep.
The cons of buying a used EV are difficult to predict, but statistics show that big issues are relatively uncommon.
Finally, make sure that the EV you are looking to purchase has all of its necessary charging accoutrements like charging cables and adapters.
To ensure the smoothest possible experience when purchasing a used EV, make sure the car you are buying has its charging cables.","Buying a used EV is a great way to save money, since most EVs depreciate at a higher rate than internal combustion vehicles and hybrids, but there are some important things to look out for. Fortunately, in the latter half of the year 2025, EVs have been relatively mainstream for around 15 years now, and their technology has improved at a rapid rate.

Ten years ago, buying a used EV was a much riskier prospect since many of the early EVs had very low maximum ranges when new and less efficient battery cooling methods. Over the course of several years and hundreds of charge cycles, those two factors led to significant battery degradation, and those low maximum ranges dropped down to barely usable levels for most drivers. The best option in that case was to pay to have a battery replaced, which oftentimes would cost more than the value of the car.

Newer EVs have longer ranges to begin with, and their superior battery cooling systems and more sophisticated battery management systems preserve the health of their batteries more effectively so battery replacements are a less-common occurrence. Here are some important things to consider when shopping for a high-mileage EV.

One of the best things about used EVs, as I already noted, is that they tend to depreciate faster than cars with more traditional powertrains like gas and even hybrids. Now, that isn't a good thing for the first owner of the car if they bought it when it was new, but it's great for the second or third owner who gets a screaming deal on a relatively new car.

Another benefit is that EVs have a fraction of the moving parts that gas-powered cars have. The drivetrain of gas-powered cars have over 2,000 moving parts that are likely to wear out or break over the course of several thousands of miles, where EV drivetrains have around 20 moving parts. If you've owned a high-mileage gas-powered car, you're likely familiar with how many tiny parts can suddenly go wrong, and how repairs can suddenly add up to significant sums of money. Buying a used EV, in most cases, means you will spend less money on repairs, less time at the shop, and less headache surrounding upkeep.

The cons of buying a used EV are difficult to predict, but statistics show that big issues are relatively uncommon. The primary concern is high-voltage battery longevity, which many recent studies have shown is very rarely an issue. The easiest way to determine the battery health of a used EV is to check the car's predicted maximum range on a full charge. If the car shows a maximum range prediction that's significantly lower than the car's EPA estimated maximum range, then the battery may be in poor condition. Modern EVs with liquid-cooled battery packs and advanced battery management systems rarely experience degradation significant enough to warrant a costly battery replacement, even over the course of hundreds of thousands of mies and upward of 15 years of use. A recent study by a UK-based vehicle telematics company shows that on average, EVs lose about 1.8% of their maximum range per year, and that most battery packs last between 15 and 20 years, so it's not a big concern yet since most EVs are newer than that.

Charging speeds are another concern to take into account; EV technology has rapidly progressed, so older EVs tend to have slower charging speeds than new ones. In day-to-day drives, the average American drives under 50-miles per day, so daily charging shouldn't be a necessity for most EVs. It's important to take into consideration your intended use-case and charging solution when shopping for an EV; if you travel long distances on a daily basis and cannot charge your vehicle at home each night or at your place of work, then maybe an EV isn't the right choice for you. Reliance on the public charging network can be burdensome, and if you plan to rely on the public charging system, then it will be important to consider the maximum rate of charge that an EV can achieve, since some can charge much faster than others. The same goes for new EVs though, so this issue isn't isolated to used or high-mileage EVs.

Many EVs are capable of over-the-air software updates, and some of their features can be dependent upon a monthly or annual subscription model, either of which could become outdated or no-longer supported by the manufacturer. If the EV you're shopping for has these features, it's important to confirm with the seller and make sure that you have the necessary log-in credentials, as well as confirm that the car has the most updated software possible. Some cars may require a dealer visit to receive updates, but this is not an issue that's unique to EVs; many modern internal combustion vehicles have the same requirements.

Finally, make sure that the EV you are looking to purchase has all of its necessary charging accoutrements like charging cables and adapters. New EVs usually come with charge cables to allow you to plug them in at home, or adapters that allow access to different public chargers. To ensure the smoothest possible experience when purchasing a used EV, make sure the car you are buying has its charging cables.

As with all other cars, there's no foolproof way to confirm that the used electric vehicle you're looking to purchase will run trouble-free for years. It's important to do research on the car you're considering, so use all sources possible to conduct that research including online forums and YouTube videos from long-term owners. Both of these sources are great ways to get first-hand information about what to expect from long-term ownership of the specific car you're looking to buy.

Many EVs have long warranties on their electric powertrains and batteries, and some companies allow these eight-to-10 year warranties are transferrable for the second owner and sometimes third owners, too. If you're concerned about an EV's long-term battery life, look for used EVs that are produced by companies that honor their powertrain warranties beyond the first owner of the car. Beyond factory warranties, you can also search for aftermarket warranties that can cover costly repairs, but again, do your research on the aftermarket warranty before purchasing it to make sure it meets your needs.

It's important to weigh the pros and cons of buying a particular vehicle, whether it's an EV or not, so do your research, make sure you have a reliable charging solution, and rest easy knowing that you've done everything in your power to make an informed decision.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/the-pros-and-cons-of-buying-a-high-mileage-ev/l-intro-1753452950.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 22:00:50.132755

The legislation extended tax cuts enacted in his first term, funds his concepts for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico and slashes federal support for the social safety net to make up for revenue lost in the tax cuts.
Groups such as the Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office said the tax cuts in the new law will add $2 trillion or more to the federal deficit over the next decade.
Those work requirements will impact 1 in 5 people nationally, said FranSha Anderson, executive director for the Arkansas State Independent Living Council.
""These Medicaid cuts are forever,"" Gess said.","Lynn Foster is certain the cuts to programs included in the tax and spending bill signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month means the end of bird and bee tracking.

That may sound silly to some, Foster said, but the work done by the Environmental Protection Agency in placing bands on birds and following the migration of bees informs officials about the impact of projects on the environment. That work helped preserve habitats along the Mississippi Flyway migration route, a large funnel traversed by birds during annual migrations and studied by scientists, Foster said.

""That's how we get more knowledge than we have,"" Foster said.

Foster was one of five speakers addressing a town hall at the Central Arkansas Library System's Fletcher Library on North Buchanan Street. The event, attended by about 35 people in person and live streamed, was put on by Citizens First Congress, a coalition of 68 member organizations representing 32,000 people, and Arkansas Public Policy Panel, which focuses on social and economic issues.

The groups aim to have people contact members of Congress as appropriations bills to fund or cut the budget for programs as outlined in the bill signed by Trump on July 4 are written between now and the fall. It was one of a series of town halls around the country as part of the Families First: 50-State Day of Peaceful Action in opposition to the legislation.

The legislation extended tax cuts enacted in his first term, funds his concepts for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico and slashes federal support for the social safety net to make up for revenue lost in the tax cuts. The full Arkansas congressional delegation backed the measure, which passed largely along partisan lines.

The Trump administration said the measure will lower the federal deficit and cut government spending. Groups such as the Tax Policy Center and the Congressional Budget Office said the tax cuts in the new law will add $2 trillion or more to the federal deficit over the next decade.

Speakers talked about how the measure would reduce food benefits for the poor, slash Medicaid and impose expanded work requirements on recipients and push more money into immigration enforcement.

Immigration attorney Badria Mryyan, who works with the California-based Social Justice Collaborative, said people will see more raids and arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents because the legislation increases funding for the agency.

The new law also allows local law enforcement, previously barred from making immigration-related arrests and conducting immigration investigations, to work more closely with ICE and make those arrests, she said.

""We're going to see more ICE raids,"" Mryyan said. ""We're going to see more ICE check-ins.""

The legislation also changes the work and reporting requirements for people on Medicaid, a joint federal-date program that helps cover costs for people with limited income and resources.

The new requirements mean Medicaid enrollees will have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month. The law will also require that people caring for a young child will have to apply for an exemption.

Those work requirements will impact 1 in 5 people nationally, said FranSha Anderson, executive director for the Arkansas State Independent Living Council.

Anderson told attendees at the town hall about her two children, who she described as disabled, noting that they both work, but may not qualify for Medicaid under the new requirements.

""Medicaid is a lifeline,"" Anderson said. ""I know it will be a harsh hit for me.""

And while benefits included in the bill, such as no tax on tips or overtime, expire in 2029, cuts to social programs have no expiration date, said Peter Gess, economic policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families.

""These Medicaid cuts are forever,"" Gess said.

In Arkansas, where 1 in 5 children are food insecure and 1 in 3 children in rural counties are in that situation, the new law will have a devastating impact, said Tomekia Moore, executive director for Arkansas Community Action Agencies Association.

The new law would remove $25 a month in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits from families, according to the Urban Institute. That's an average of $146 per month for families, the institute said in a report.

Cuts like those will hurt children who come from ""food insecure"" environments, Moore said.

""A hungry child doesn't learn. A hungry child doesn't grow,"" Moore said. ""A hungry child can't thrive.""

Protecting areas where birds migrate may not seem that important on the surface, Foster said, but Arkansas relies on tourism for parts of its economy. Across the board, the law will be bad for the state, Foster said.

""Arkansas benefits from a lot of these programs, but they won't be around,"" Foster said.",https://wehco.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2025/07/26/AP25185786516864_t1200.jpg?57a0c2296240c280e9492005c3cad63e7cbe80f4,N,,2025-07-26 22:00:33.933977

Its anode-free lithium metal cells promise more range and faster charging speeds than traditional lithium-ion batteries.

The Volkswagen Group is going full steam forward with the development and commercialization of next-generation solid-state batteries for electric vehicles.

The VW Group’s battery subsidiary PowerCo will now provide $131 million to solid-state battery start-up QuantumScape. The new funding will go towards the development of a pilot production line in San Jose, the start-up said in a press release this week.

This amount is in addition to $130 million PowerCo promised to QuantumScape last year to license and mass produce solid-state cells using QuantumScape’s technology. However, the payments hinge on certain milestones and technical progress that the start-up has to reach.

The VW Group is among the largest backers of the start-up. Its partnership with QuantumScape dates back to 2012, and the German auto giant has a 17% stake in the battery start-up, worth about $459 million.

Under an updated, non-exclusive licensing agreement that the companies signed last year, PowerCo will be able to manufacture 40 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of solid-state cells per year, with the option to expand to 80 GWh—that much capacity is enough to power one million EVs per year.

PowerCo is building battery factories in Germany, Spain and Canada, which could also be some of the potential sites for the future mass production of solid-state cells.

Traditional lithium-ion batteries use a liquid chemical for the electrolyte to facilitate the movement of ions between charging and discharging cycles. Solid-state batteries swap that out for a solid electrolyte, often made of polymer, sulfides, oxides, or a ceramic-type material.

Battery companies believe this will unlock far more range, faster charging speeds, more performance and better fire safety. Moreover, QuantumScape’s QSE-5 cells are pretty unique compared to traditional lithium-ion cells.

It’s an anode-free lithium metal battery that uses a ceramic separator—the anode is the part of the battery that holds the charge when you plug in your EV. The anode is not pre-formed like traditional batteries—it’s created during the first charging cycle as the lithium ions deposit onto the current collector.

The whole point of this approach is getting rid of the expensive and dirty graphite—which is typically used to make anodes—and also simplifying manufacturing, reducing costs and improving energy density.

Quantumscape’s cells have an energy density of 305 watt-hours per kilogram, only slightly more than today’s lithium-ion cells which deliver between 200-300 wh/kg. The company says today's EVs which have 350 miles of range could get between 400 and 500 miles of range with the QSE-5 cells—although that number will vary depending on pack size.

It’s early to tell whether the Volkswagen Group’s huge bet on solid-state batteries will pay off. But the momentum is on their side, and these cells are closer to production than they have ever been.

Accident tolerant fuels may offer important technological advances to increase the safety of U.S. nuclear power plants. ATFs are being studied to determine their potential to perform better in normal operations and during transportation as well as in nuclear power plant accidents.

The NRC’s Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research recently released the report prepared by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

The Richland, Wash.-based PNNL is providing technical assistance about the proposed nuclear fuel and new fuel cladding designs that may replace current nuclear fuel rods made with zirconium-based alloys.

The 91-page highly technical report is called “Spent Fuel Storage and Transportation of Accident Tolerant Fuel Concepts” and outlines the latest information on fuel material properties and performance associated with storing and transporting spent nuclear fuel.

The federal government is evaluating the performance of nuclear power systems containing ATF. The NRC says the same performance requirements are being sought with irradiated ATF fuel as mandated for conventional zirconium alloy cladded uranium dioxide fuel.

3 Companies Testing New Nuclear Power Plant Fuels

The new report explores the current activities of the following companies in their developments with ATFs and fuel cladding designs:

Framatome—has tested cladding and enriched uranium fuel. It hopes to commercialize two ATF designs as part of the CEA-Framatome-EDF French nuclear fuel joint program. Framatome on July 17 opened its expanded operations in Lynchburg, Va. with a dedicated nuclear training center to support next-generation small and advanced reactor technologies. The company plans to hire 500 employees there.

Global Nuclear Fuels—has experimented with alloys, cladding and enriched uranium fuel. A joint venture led by General Electric, the company is working with GE to commercialize two ATF designs for use in boiling water nuclear reactors.

Westinghouse—has tested cladding and enriched uranium fuel. The company is simultaneously developing both near- and long-term ATF designs.

DOE Also Studying Innovations in Nuclear Reactor Fuels

The DOE is working on its Advanced Fuels Campaign with teams of researchers seeking new nuclear power plant fuels at five of its national laboratories. The federal collaborations are centered at the PNNL, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Idaho National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

According to DOE, ATFs offer several advantages over conventional nuclear energy fuel. ATFs are being developed to improve nuclear reactor safety “by maintaining structural integrity and reactor cooling for a longer duration during severe accident conditions,” DOE says. ATFs

Can withstand extreme heat/steam longer.

Last longer with better efficiently in a reactor core to possibly lengthen refueling from 1.5 years to 2 years while using 30% less fuel.

Generate less waste and lower fuel costs.

The main objective of the Advanced Fuels Campaign is to develop and use ATFs to significantly increase nuclear power performance and safety.

Further ATF Developments Expected

The NRC report also discussed whether its current regulations would apply to ATF storage and transportation. While it advised companies applying for licenses to provide justification data to support their applications, the NRC noted the federal government’s current regulatory framework for storing and transporting spent nuclear fuel would generally cover apply to ATFs. These findings would appear to pave the way for greater interest by companies in turning to nuclear power to meet their energy demands.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68852fb477de94394a81e089/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:31.048151

Climate risks for the elderly Older people face increased risks during extreme weather and suffer more from ongoing environmental degradation.","From ancient microbes awakening in melting glaciers to toxic pollutants unleashed by floods, the dangers are no longer distant or theoretical. They are here, and they are growing.

The Frontiers Report 2025, released by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), highlights four critical areas where environmental degradation intersects with human vulnerability: legacy pollution, melting glacier microbes, undamming rivers and climate risks for an ageing population that is growing.

The report paints a vivid picture of how climate change is not only altering ecosystems but also exposing communities – especially the most vulnerable – to new and intensifying dangers. Some issues may be local or relatively small-scale issues today, but have the potential to become issues of regional or global concern if not addressed early, the report warned.

UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen said action must be taken “to protect people, nature and economies from threats that will only grow with each passing year”.

Here’s what’s at stake and why it matters to all of us:

Melting glacier microbes

Climate scientists are saying many glaciers will not survive this century unless action is taking to slow the melting rate caused by climate change. That means those living downstream will face a tide of floods alongside threats posed by reactivated microbes in a warming cryosphere or frozen parts of the Earth.

Frozen in ice sheets, glaciers and permafrost are bacteria, fungi and viruses. While most are dead, some are dormant and some are active. As global temperatures hit record highs, these microorganisms will become more active in many ecosystems. Even if the melting can be slowed down by mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, efforts must assess and prepare for possible threats from potential pathogens.

Also crucial is documenting and preserving cryospheric microorganisms, which can shed light on the history of climate and evolution, help in finding therapies for diseases and develop innovative biotechnologies.

Dismantling dams

In the Colombian Amazon, river water levels have dropped by up to 80 per cent, restricting access to drinking water and food supplies, leading to shuttering 130 schools, increasing children’s risk of recruitment, use and exploitation by non-State armed groups and resulting in increased respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, malaria and acute malnutrition among youngsters under age five.

Part of what is making the problem worse in Colombia and other hot spots around the world are the plethora of dams operating at a time when climate change is triggering droughts around the world. Drought is keeping more than 420,000 children out of school in Brazil, Colombia and Peru alone, according to a report by the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF).

As such, there is a growing need to remove dams and other barriers to rehabilitate river ecosystems, a process increasingly initiated by local communities, Indigenous Peoples, women and youth. Rivers and streams can recover remarkably once barriers are gone, but other stressors, from pollution to climate change, need to be addressed in parallel. Understanding the restoration outcomes of barrier removal is necessary not only to guide future removals, but also to inform decisions about existing and future barriers.

Climate risks for the elderly

Older people face increased risks during extreme weather and suffer more from ongoing environmental degradation. As the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) predicts ever more hot weather, the elderly are suffering disproportionately, as seen in rising numbers of deaths and illnesses amid recent heat waves around the world.

At the same time, the world’s ageing population is growing: the global share of people over 65 years old will rise from 10 per cent in 2024 to 16 per cent by 2050. Most of them will live in cities, where they will be exposed to extreme heat and air pollution and experience more frequent disasters.

Older people are already more at risk, so effective adaptation strategies will need to evolve to protect these older populations.

Legacy pollutants

Flooding has crippled communities in all regions of the world as the number of extreme weather events climb. Among the hidden dangers are legacy pollutants that have been secreted into the ground over time and released as extreme rainfall and floods wash away sediments and debris.

The Pakistan floods of 2010, flooding in the Niger Delta in 2012 and Hurricane Harvey off the coast of Texas in 2017 are all examples when floodwaters stirred up sediments, releasing heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants.

Evaluating sediments to understand hazards, rethinking flood protection to lean on nature-based solutions and investments in natural remediation of contaminated sediments are all options to deal with this problem.",https://global.unitednations.entermediadb.net/assets/mediadb/services/module/asset/downloads/preset/Collections/Embargoed/02-11-2023-UNEP-Kenya-drought-02.jpg/image770x420cropped.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 22:59:59.964647

With the participation of representatives from over 50 countries, the focus will be on solid waste and its role in the global environmental crisis. This year’s motto is clear: “Towards a future without waste or a planet with no future.”

Organized by the Argentine Solid Waste Association (ARS) and Messe Frankfurt, the meeting seeks answers to the triple planetary crisis: climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. The challenge is to move towards concrete solutions from an inclusive and global perspective.

Circular economy, extended producer responsibility, and organic waste treatment are some of the topics on the agenda. Issues such as open-air dumps, textile waste management, and energy recovery will also be addressed. The goal is to build a waste system that does not generate negative impacts and promotes a regenerative economy.

Simultaneously, discussions will focus on financing mechanisms and innovation for sustainable projects. The event will offer workshops and sessions on initiatives like “Too Good To Waste,” promoted by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), which aims to accelerate the transition to more efficient management.

The link between waste and global warming

One of the central themes of the Congress will be the connection between waste and climate change. Poor waste management generates large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 80 times higher than carbon dioxide.

Although less persistent than CO₂ in the atmosphere, methane accounts for over 25% of the current global warming. Alongside livestock and the oil and mining industries, the accumulation of urban waste is one of its main sources.

Mitigating emissions of this gas is essential to halt the progress of the climate crisis. Therefore, the Congress will provide space for public policies and investments aimed at improving waste collection, separation, and treatment.

Promoting clean technologies, composting, biogas, and renewable energy derived from waste will be part of the explored solutions. These actions could help comply with the Global Methane Pledge: reducing its emissions by at least 30% by 2030.

What is the ISWA World Congress and why does it matter

The ISWA (International Solid Waste Association) World Congress is the most relevant international meeting on solid waste management. It has been held annually since 1972 and in 29 countries. Argentina hosted it for the first time in 2005, and now, two decades later, it does so again.

Its mission is to promote the exchange of knowledge, experiences, and strategies that help improve waste treatment worldwide. It also aims to strengthen cooperation among governments, the private sector, academia, and civil society to advance towards a circular economy.

During the event, spaces for debate will be created with the presence of experts, researchers, environmental leaders, and representatives of multilateral organizations. The sessions will focus on finding concrete solutions to local and global challenges.

Furthermore, the Congress seeks to promote sustainable investments, encourage inclusive policies, and foster responsible production and consumption models. All with a vision towards a cleaner, fairer, and more resilient future.

An opportunity to transform the future

The realization of the Congress in Buenos Aires represents a strategic opportunity for the region. Latin America faces huge challenges in waste management, but it also has innovative initiatives and committed communities.

The event can serve as a catalyst for more effective policies, regional integration, and international cooperation. With available knowledge and adequate political will, it is possible to build a management model that reduces impacts and creates opportunities.

In the face of a climate crisis scenario, every decision matters. How waste is managed can be part of the problem or part of the solution. This Congress invites us to rethink actions and bet on a more habitable planet.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/04/proyecto-de-reciclaje.jpg.webp,N,,2025-07-26 22:00:38.393946

Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.","Despite the Trump administration’s efforts to slow federal funding for building electric vehicle chargers across the country, the number of ports is growing, although rural areas are seeing less investment, per data from the EV charging data analytics firm Paren shared with The Daily Yonder.

As of the first quarter of 2025, 45% of rural counties had at least one fast EV charging port installed, compared to 76.5% of metropolitan counties. Right now, the United States has around 60,000 fast charging ports installed, with more than 3,600 new ones coming online across the U.S. since the beginning of the year, Paren found. A charging port is like a gas pump—it’s where a car gets plugged in to charge up. Direct current fast charging ports, which are also called DC or level 3 chargers, take about 30 minutes to fill a car to a full charge.

Sarah Melotte and Julia Tilton // The Daily Yonder

A charging station can have anywhere from several to several dozen charging ports. The term “charger” refers to the hardware. While chargers and ports might seem interchangeable, they’re not. It gets tricky because one charger can have the hookups for more than one vehicle. The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.

In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas. That’s partly because of low utilization, or the amount of time the ports are plugged in and providing vehicles with electricity. In cities like San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami, where a greater share of the cars on the road are EVs, charging ports can have utilization rates as high as 30% or 40% during peak hours, which are typically in the evening. For much of the rest of the country, though, and particularly in less densely populated rural areas, utilization rates tend to be in the teens or lower.

North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana have the lowest state-wide utilization rates in the country, according to Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst. Rural counties in those states also have the fewest charging ports.

“There just aren’t a lot of them on the road there locally to have that sort of baseline level of usage of those stations,” said McDonald.

The rural charging catch-22

Few EV drivers and a limited number of charging stations pose a dilemma for rural areas looking to expand EV charging infrastructure. Beyond ideological and price considerations, drivers may be hesitant to switch to EVs when there are few places to charge them, while at the same time, investors are hesitant to build charging stations because there aren’t many EV drivers on the road. In order for privately funded charging stations to break even on their investment, utilization rates have to hit certain percentages, usually greater than the teens or low twenties.

“The deck is stacked against those rural areas,” McDonald said. “There aren’t the trends and the economic viability to motivate private industry to put them there.”

To mitigate what McDonald calls this “emerging charging divide,” state and federal-level government programs offer competitive funding for developers to build out EV charging infrastructure in rural areas.

However, the Trump administration has made funding at the federal level difficult for states to access. In February, the Trump administration suspended funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Several states and nonprofit organizations, including Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, and Plug in America, have since sued the government for withholding the funds, which were authorized by Congress in 2021.

On May 22, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Transportation, which administers the program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), does not have the authority to suspend NEVI and that the agency must continue to carry out the requirements of the program. The court case brought by states and nonprofits is still pending.

Funding for NEVI is designed to be allocated to states over a five-year period. The FHWA has allocated a total of $3.3 billion of NEVI funding to states through fiscal year 2025. States had awarded or obligated $527 million when the Trump administration suspended the program, and an estimated 57 NEVI-funded charging stations had opened across 15 states.

Of those NEVI-funded charging stations, 19 are in Ohio, where Bill Ferro, Paren’s chief technology officer, said many are in rural areas. This has to do with Ohio’s major interstate highways that run North-South and East-West through rural counties. In November and December 2024, when traffic increased during the holiday season, utilization rates spiked for Ohio’s rural EV chargers. Ferro said the stations are an example of how NEVI projects can be successful in rural areas.

“We would say they were the best use of NEVI funding in that they were outside the major cities, and they were intended to allow that great American Road Trip to go,” said Ferro.

Another hotspot on the map is in La Paz County, Arizona, where there are 140 ports, more than any other rural county in the country. Like in Ohio, an interstate is responsible for the buildout, Ferro and McDonald said. Interstate 10 connects Los Angeles to Phoenix, and one Tesla Supercharger station right off the highway has 84 ports.

As of early June, states are still waiting to see how the future of NEVI is resolved, and some have paused the application process for the next cycle of funding. While the program’s freeze has been a blow to rural areas looking to build out their charging infrastructure, McDonald stressed that NEVI is not the only source of money available to communities.

“Almost every charging station in America has some type of incentive, grant, or tax credit,” McDonald said. “NEVI gets all the headlines, but there are lots of other sources of incentive and grant money to offset costs.”

Utility companies and states have “make-ready” incentives to prepare sites to power EV charging stations. Some programs will cover the cost of getting sites connected with the utility and any construction that’s needed before the ports go in. Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.

McDonald sees the government’s role in funding EV chargers as a way to ensure Americans have access to services regardless of where they live. He compared the current buildout of EV infrastructure to the Rural Electrification Act, which provided federal loans for the installation of rural electrical systems in the 1930s. In that era, the government stepped in to ensure communities had access to electric services in places where private investors didn’t see a way to make a profit.

“There are some things that literally require government help, or otherwise it’s never going to happen,” McDonald said.

Across the U.S., EV sales grew in 2024, increasing the share of EVs among all car sales, according to the International Energy Agency’s annual report released in May. The report projects that the number of EVs on the road is expected to continue growing in the U.S. in 2025 and beyond, despite current political and trade headwinds imposed by the Trump administration.",https://krdo.b-cdn.net/2025/07/tdy-mapping-fast-ev-ports-01.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 20:01:56.960221

So how will this megaproject be built, can it avoid the pitfalls of previous nuclear plants, and is it worth the money?

Sizewell C will comprise two nuclear reactors totalling 3.2GW — enough to power six million homes — with an expected 60-year lifespan. It will be a copy of Hinkley Point C, which is being built on the Somerset coast and uses a design from the French nuclear company EDF, the European Pressurised Reactor (EPR). Hinkley Point is overdue and over budget, while the EPR has been plagued by problems in other countries where it has been built. Small wonder, then, that some have asked whether replicating Hinkley is a good idea.

Rebuilding an industry

Pyke is here to tell people that copying Hinkley is exactly what we should be doing. “It’s better to build the thing you know how to build because … it will be cheaper.”

She added: “Hinkley was the first nuclear new-build for a generation … It has taken on the burden of relearning how to build nuclear in the UK.” Indeed, the last nuclear plant opened in the UK was Sizewell B in 1995. The B plant, still operational, will be next door to the new C plant.

Hinkley has helped build up a nuclear workforce that was in decline. Pyke recalled the first batch of university interns at Sizewell C. “The majority of them literally didn’t know that the UK had a nuclear industry. It had been that quiet,” she said.

How did it come to this? The industry fell into the doldrums after electricity was privatised in 1990. No private company was capable of taking on the risk of financing a new nuclear power station (Sizewell B was already in train). And the abundance of North Sea gas meant it was cheaper to build gas-fired power stations.

But by the 2010s, the need to wean ourselves off environmentally damaging fossil fuels had become more pressing. The government chose EDF to build Hinkley, but the project began construction before the design was fully finalised. EDF was on the hook for overruns as the budget spiralled to a staggering £46 billion (from an initial estimate of £18 billion).

When it came to Sizewell, a cash-strapped EDF was never going to take on such risk. So the government switched to a different type of financing model, called the “regulated asset base”, which means billpayers contribute to its construction cost up front, and the developer can make returns while it is being built.

The deal struck last week will see the government take a 45 per cent stake, with Canadian pension fund La Caisse holding 20 per cent, British Gas owner Centrica 15 per cent, EDF 12.5 per cent, and Amber Infrastructure the remaining 7.6 per cent.

The gargantuan cost will be 65 per cent funded by debt, and 35 per cent by equity. The government has pencilled in a total cost of £55 billion for contingency and inflation over the lifetime of the plant. Last week there was much noise around the fact that Sizewell’s price tag had ballooned from an estimate of £20 billion, in 2015 money. The new figure accounts for inflation and “some cost increase”, according to Pyke.

One big difference between Hinkley and Sizewell, she argued, is that the design is now better understood and contracts will be tighter. Many of Hinkley’s overruns were blamed on “cost-plus” contracts that allowed suppliers to ratchet up their bills. Pyke pointed to a recent deal for civil engineering at Sizewell: “It’s a contract which, roughly speaking, pays the contractors the actual cost of doing a day’s work. And it aligns profit to achieved milestones. So they’re not incentivised to run the job long.”

In any case, Pyke argued, talk of cost misses the point. Sizewell C will ultimately be an asset for the taxpayer. And the project will pay billions in tax over its lifespan. “The cost is an investment for society because it’s going to give us energy security and lower bills, as well as pay tax … it has much wider societal benefits.”

Amazon-style delivery

So how will Sizewell be built? Like Hinkley, it is in a remote spot that will require thousands of workers to be bussed in and out. The logistical challenges are nightmarish. The project will build accommodation for 2,500 workers, but will try to minimise the number of people who need to be on site daily.

An Amazon-style fulfilment centre will be constructed near Ipswich to hold equipment for each room in the power station, so that it can be installed in sequence, rather than the stop-start fashion at Hinkley, according to Pyke. “We’re having everything made early and stored. We have the time to quality check everything, assemble it in the right configurations and then have it delivered in its grouped configuration, sort of like Ikea.”

About 60 per cent of Sizewell’s materials will be transported by rail and ship, with a new jetty on the beach. Sizewell C will source 70 per cent of its goods from the UK, Pyke said, and pour millions into establishing a new further education college, a new rail station, and nature reserves to offset the damage of construction. Sizewell is expected to create 7,900 jobs during peak construction. Polling by Sizewell suggests 70 per cent of people in the east of England recognise it will be a boon for employment. Yet many locals are implacably opposed.

Alison Downes, executive director of the Stop Sizewell C campaign, said that as a group, they had always tried to emphasise the wider problems with the project, beyond their self-interest. “One former EDF chief executive described the EPR design as too complicated — almost unbuildable,” she said. “The long delays at EPRs elsewhere in the world, the massive cost overruns, suggest that this project will be very difficult to build. And the Sizewell site is complex. Any savings are likely to be frittered away in more complicated groundworks.”

‘A super investment’

The actual cost of the electricity Sizewell will generate remains unclear. The government believes it could reduce Britain’s energy costs by up to £2 billion a year. Ultimately the goal is to provide steady, always-on power at times when wind or solar dips.

“Nuclear provides firm capacity and it has a very high load factor, meaning that it runs almost 24 hours a day,” explained Victor Yip, research associate at Aurora Energy Research. More big nuclear is needed, he added: “We have old gas plants that are retiring, while 85 per cent of the existing nuclear fleet will retire by 2028.” But there are clear drawbacks, he said. “Nuclear is really expensive and it takes a significant amount of underwriting to get these projects to the finish line.”

Indeed, the government has had to keep private investors sweet by capping their liabilities for any cost overruns beyond a certain level. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, said last week that even in the most pessimistic scenario, his company would make a 10 per cent return. “This is, I think, a super investment… there’s a lot to like about this project,” O’Shea told analysts last week. “We could increase [our] stake in the future.”

Much will hinge, of course, on whether Sizewell hits its targets. Here Pyke’s words sound like a hostage to fortune: “We’re aiming to bring it in as early as we can in the mid to late 2030s and we’re aiming to get it down as far below £38 billion as we can.”

The government has two broad scenarios: one where it is generating power by 2039; another by 2043. Downes said: “There are no guarantees at all about delivery on budget and on schedule.”

Building nuclear power stations is an unlikely path for Pyke, who started out as an M&A lawyer. Her parents were teachers and she was motivated by “growing up without much money,” she said. “I wanted a more comfortable life.”

Her co-chief, Nigel Cann, will handle the more technical side of Sizewell. But Pyke has become the face of the project since stepping up to the co-chief role in 2023. A CND member in her late teens, she said Sizewell appealed to her spirit of “social justice” because it democratised access to clean power.

“Electricity has become a necessity in the same way that water is a necessity. It needs to be provided in the fairest way possible to society.

“I do see it as a heroic endeavour,” she added. “Sizewell C is essentially a project for people’s kids. So that they have access to weather-independent electricity, and don’t have electricity bills that are dependent on the vagaries of international markets. That’s what it’s for. And I think that maybe we’ve been through quite a long period of not building for the future.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F88f681fb-f35e-4bce-af37-759da5cf3a29.jpg?crop=7078%2C3981%2C1114%2C947&resize=1200,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:36.329711

Volkswagen Group reported a sharp decline in profits for the second quarter and first half of 2025, even as vehicle deliveries rose, highlighting the challenges of transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs) while facing higher U.S. import tariffs. This downturn underscores the economic pressures on automakers scaling up EV production, where lower margins on battery-powered models erode overall earnings.

EV Sales Growth Masks Profit Erosion

The company delivered 4.4 million vehicles in the first six months of 2025, marking a 1.3% increase year-on-year. Deliveries in the second quarter alone reached 2.27 million units, up 1.2%. Despite these gains, earnings after tax for the first half fell 38.5% to an unspecified total, with the second quarter seeing a 36.3% drop to €2.29 billion (about $2.69 billion), reports Auto Blog.

This contrast arises partly from the surge in EV sales, which carry slimmer profit margins than traditional vehicles. Volkswagen Group’s leadership acknowledged this shift.

“Our half-year figures present a contrasting picture: on the one hand, we achieved strong product success and made progress in realigning the company,” said Arno Antlitz, CFO and COO of Volkswagen Group. “On the other, the operating result declined by a third year-on-year – also due to higher sales of lower-margin all-electric models.”

Building on that, individual EV models like the Audi Q6 e-tron have shown sales growth, yet the broader trend drags down profitability. Automakers must invest heavily in battery technology and supply chains, often at the expense of short-term returns. This raises questions about balancing EV adoption with financial stability, especially as consumer demand for electric models grows but pricing pressures persist.

U.S. Tariffs and Brand Struggles Compound Losses

U.S. import tariffs emerged as a key factor in the profit slide, adding to operational costs. The company’s operating result for the first half dropped 32.8%, with the second quarter alone down 29.4% to €3.8 billion (approximately $4.4 billion). Sales revenue dipped slightly, by 0.3% for the half-year and 3% in the second quarter.

Premium brands within the group faced acute challenges. Audi’s U.S. sales declined 12% year-on-year, prompting provisions for restructuring that further strained finances. Porsche, another subsidiary, grapples with declining sales in major markets, leading to cost-cutting measures.

“Our business model, which has served us well for many decades, no longer works in its current form,” said Porsche CEO Oliver Blume.

These issues reflect broader regulatory and market shifts. Higher tariffs on imported components and vehicles increase expenses, potentially passed on to consumers or absorbed by manufacturers. For EV enthusiasts, this could mean elevated prices for models like Volkswagen’s ID series or Audi’s e-tron lineup, affecting affordability and adoption rates in the U.S. market.

Revised Outlook Signals Caution for EV Transition

Due to the second-quarter performance, Volkswagen Group adjusted its 2025 sales revenue forecast to match 2024 levels, abandoning an earlier projection of 5% growth. This revision highlights the unpredictable nature of the EV sector, where external factors like tariffs can swiftly alter trajectories.

The company is not alone in these struggles; Tesla reported a 16% profit drop in the second quarter, though its issues stem more from other factors. For EV owners and enthusiasts, Volkswagen’s results emphasize the need for supportive policies to ease the transition. Lower tariffs or incentives could bolster margins, enabling faster innovation in areas like range extension—often measured in miles (e.g., converting 400 km to about 249 miles) or charging infrastructure.

This situation also points to operational implications, such as streamlining production to improve EV profitability. Economically, sustained low margins might slow investments in new technologies, like advanced autonomous driving features or lighter battery packs that enhance efficiency. Regulatory changes, particularly around trade, will play a pivotal role in shaping the industry’s future.

Overall, Volkswagen Group’s half-year results illustrate the dual-edged sword of EV expansion: promising growth in sustainable mobility tempered by immediate financial hurdles. As the sector evolves, stakeholders must navigate these dynamics to ensure long-term viability.",https://evxl.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_8070-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:07.241035

In July, a used EV is claimed to be selling on Auto Trader in an average of 28 days after first being advertised - that's a day quicker than the market average across all fuel types and four days faster than EVs were shifted a year ago.

The online sales platform says interest in second-hand EVs has accelerated in the last week - since the Government announced the reintroduction of an Electric Car Grant (ECG) to discount the price of some new models.

With used electric vehicle prices already tumbling as a direct result of manufacturer-driven discounts, the arrival of a taxpayer-funded scheme that further subsidises some new EVs will push second-hand prices even lower, experts have suggested.

And there's one premium EV in particular that's now selling in just over a fortnight as prices have tumbled to be on par with - if not cheaper than - petrol equivalents.

Tesla Model 3s between three and five years old are currently the fastest-selling used car, taking just 17 days to move on in July. That's almost two weeks faster than the average used car.

A 2021 Model 3 with between 35,000 and 40,000 miles on the clock can be had on Auto Trader for less than £16,000 today.

For its biggest petrol-powered equivalent, the BMW 3 Series, the cheapest petrol engined example of the same age and mileage is £22,000 or more.

Underlining the huge crash in value of pre-owned EVs, three-to-five-year-old Jaguar I-Pace SUVs are the second quickest-selling motors of the month, taking just 18 days to find a buyer on average.

The I-Pace, which has been subject to mainstream media criticism due to links to a number of high-profile accidents, has depreciated at such a rate that below-average-mileage are changing hands for around £14,000.

It means you can pick up what was originally a £70,000 luxury motor for around the same price as a petrol supermini of the same age.

Auto Trader believes the surge in consumer appetite for second-hand EVs has been fuelled, in part, by the government's ECG.

It will soon be applied to some sub-£37,000 new models - granted they meet specific manufacturing sustainability criteria yet to be outlined by ministers.

It says searches for used EVs under the £37k price point doubled within a day of the announcement.

'The used market will be key to unlocking mainstream adoption, and with a clear electric strategy in place, all retailers should be able to capitalise on the broader opportunity the grant offers,' the only marketplace said.

Marc Palmer, head of strategy and insight at Auto Trader, added: 'The clear spike in electric vehicle demand this month is encouraging - whenever EVs make headlines, we consistently see a boost in consumer interest not only for new cars, but in the used EV market as well.'

Other EVs to make July's list of fastest-selling used motors are the Hyundai Kona EV and Volkswagen ID.3.

Again, this is based on examples between three and five years old.

They are selling in 20 and 21 days respectively.

Only in-demand petrol-engined compact crossovers including the Nissan Juke and Ford Puma are selling quicker than this.

Ian Plummer, the company's commercial director, commented: 'Pricing data shows a significant gap between new EVs and two–to-three-year-old cars as market forces have caused used EVs to match petrol and diesel alternatives to attract buyers.

'While the Electric Car Grant may boost new EV sales, used EVs remain appealing due to their affordability and it's unlikely the grant will either heavily or immediately impact used EV pricing and residual values.

'It was encouraging to see a strong surge of interest in new EVs on Auto Trader immediately post the grant launch, and some of this positivity also flowed into used EVs, as we know the majority of those considering electric will shop both new and used cars.'

As for the slowest-selling used motors, no EVs made the top 10 order.

The most sluggish of all is something of a shock - the Volkswagen Polo, a supermini that's traditionally very popular in Britain.

Year-old examples, which are holding their value well and therefore appear pricey against other options, are taking an average of 50 days - almost two months - to move on, Auto Trader said.

Shortly after Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander last Monday unveiled Labour's new ECG, industry experts claim it will be a major drain on public spending that will cause used EV prices to plummet.

Philip Nothard, insight director at analysts Cox Automotive told us: 'Heavy discounts on new EVs have already dampened demand for nearly new models available in the used car market.

'While driving down the cost of new vehicles will undoubtedly increase the EV adoption in the new market, these incentives fail to recognise the impact they will have on the used market.'

Nothard says the grant now threatens to increase depreciation of electric cars up to two years old.

'The used market is a crucial source of profitability for the automotive sector, so the strength and consistency of the industry is crucial to the success of the government's net zero ambitions,' he said.

'To ensure this, the government needs to consider more support for the used EV sector to put the brakes on the rapid pace of depreciation.'

British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association chief executive Toby Poston also warned that further stimulating new EV registrations without supporting the used market 'risks creating an even greater supply-and-demand imbalance, putting even more pressure on fast deflating second-hand values'.

What is the Electric Car Grant?

The Electric Car Grant is the Government's new big hope to drive sales of EVs in the run-up to the end of the decade as it continues to steer towards outlawing the availability of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030.

It arrives three years after the previous Tory administration prematurely scrapped its Plug-in Car Grant (PiCG).

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander confirmed the ECG's availability on Monday 15 July, stating: 'The EV grant will not only allow people to keep more of their hard-earned money - it'll help our automotive sector seize one of the biggest opportunities of the 21st century.'

Only cars up to £37,000 qualify for the grant, which rules out premium models, including every Tesla on sale. No Audi, BMW or Mercedes EV will be eligible either.

Some 50 existing models are technically eligible for the grants solely based on their starting price. We've listed these below.

Manufacturers must apply to be eligible for the scheme with their sub-£37,000 cars on a 'first come, first served' basis.

This means that motorists will not need to fill in any additional paperwork to receive the grant, with all administration handled by the car maker, dealership, and the Government.

But because manufacturers must apply for the scheme, the Department for Transport has told us that we are unlikely to see an initial list of eligible EVs until the first two weeks of August.

The new scheme uses a two-tier system based on 'sustainability criteria' to determine the size of the subsidy provided.

Only the greenest models - considered 'band one' - receiving the full £3,750 amount. Band two cars with a lower eco rating will be eligible for a reduced amount as low as £1,500.

Bands are determined by each maker's Science-Based Target (SBT) - an industry-wide scheme, with manufacturers needing to meet carbon scores below a specific criterion to achieve the highest green standard. Volkswagen and Renault Group have both confirmed they are signed up with the SBT scheme.

ECG bands - which could later expand beyond two tiers - will be determined by how much CO2 is emitted in an EV's production, assessing the energy used during assembly as well as battery manufacturing.

An overall SBT score is weighted 70 per cent for the CO2 produced during battery manufacturing and 30 per cent for vehicle assembly emissions.

Threshold levels to achieve the full £3,750 discount or the lower banded £1,500 have yet to be made public. However, vehicles that don't meet a minimum level will not receive a grant at all.

This could be bad news for Chinese EV makers, which currently offer some of the most competitive prices but could fall foul of the emissions-based rules.

Speaking on the BBC's Today programme last week, Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood said she did not expect any cars that are produced in China to be eligible.

'The grant is restricted to those manufacturers that reach minimum environmental standards,' she said.

'And, frankly, if you generate a lot of the electricity that powers your factory through coal power stations, then you are not going to be able to access this grant.'

According to The Telegraph, the Chinese embassy has hit hack and the scheme's stringent requirements.

It has called on the UK to follow World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and create a 'non-discriminatory environment for investment'.

WTO rules stipulate that members must not give favourable treatment to one country over another when it comes to trading goods and services.

An embassy spokesperson added: 'The Chinese side is closely following the situation and will resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies.'",https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/22/17/100531629-0-image-m-14_1753201037941.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 21:00:44.899975

Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

This marks the fastest progress since before the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by advancements in energy equity and sustainability, fueled by lower energy prices, subsidy reforms, and increased adoption of clean energy. However, the report warns that energy security remains a weak link, with only marginal gains exposing persistent vulnerabilities in global energy systems. As geopolitical tensions, trade frictions, and rising energy demand—particularly from AI-driven data centers—threaten to disrupt progress, the world faces a critical moment to balance equity, sustainability, and security in the race to a net-zero future.

A Rebound in Energy Equity and Sustainability

The ETI, which benchmarks 118 countries on their energy system performance and transition readiness, paints an encouraging yet uneven picture. Energy equity, which measures access, affordability, and economic benefits, saw a robust 2.2% year-on-year increase, nearing pre-pandemic levels. This rebound is largely attributed to moderating energy prices and structural subsidy reforms that have made energy more affordable, particularly in emerging economies. For instance, expanded access to electricity and clean cooking technologies has bolstered equity in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, where Nigeria climbed from 109th place in 2016 to 61st in 2025, driven by financial investments and infrastructure improvements.

Sustainability scores also rose by 1.2%, reflecting lower energy and emissions intensities and a growing share of clean energy in the global energy mix, now at 14.8%. Countries like China, which reached an all-time high ETI ranking of 12th, have led the charge with massive investments in solar, wind, and electric vehicles (EVs), commissioning more solar photovoltaic capacity in 2023 than the entire world did in 2022. Emerging Europe, particularly Latvia, which entered the ETI top 10 for the first time, showcased strong gains in renewable energy capacity and equitable access, supported by a 59% drop in electricity prices. These advancements highlight the impact of targeted policies and clean energy adoption, though the report notes that global emissions hit a record 37.8 billion tons in 2024, underscoring the scale of the decarbonization challenge.

Energy Security: The Weakest Link

Despite progress in equity and sustainability, energy security—encompassing supply reliability, diversification, and grid flexibility—saw only a 0.4% improvement, signaling persistent vulnerabilities. The report cites import dependence, inflexible power systems, and limited diversification as key barriers, particularly in regions reliant on fossil fuel imports. Global energy demand surged 2.2% in 2024, driven by electrification, cooling needs during record heatwaves, and the rapid expansion of AI-driven data centers, placing unprecedented strain on grids. Only 28% of countries achieved simultaneous progress across all three ETI dimensions—equity, security, and sustainability—highlighting the difficulty of balancing these priorities.

Advanced economies like Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, which topped the ETI rankings, benefit from diversified energy mixes, robust infrastructure, and strong policy frameworks. In contrast, many emerging economies struggle with grid congestion and supply chain constraints, exacerbated by geopolitical disruptions and trade frictions. For example, the U.S., ranked 17th, excels in energy security due to its diversified portfolio but faces challenges in policy coherence and grid upgrades. The report emphasizes that modernizing grids, enhancing storage, and integrating digital technologies are critical to bolstering energy security and supporting renewable energy deployment.

Transition Readiness Lags Behind

While energy system performance improved, transition readiness—measuring factors like regulation, infrastructure, innovation, and investment—grew by only 0.8%, below its 10-year average of 1.2%. This slowdown raises concerns about the long-term sustainability of current gains. The report highlights that while countries like Luxembourg, Denmark, and Germany lead in regulatory clarity and political commitment, global readiness is hampered by inconsistent policies and fiscal pressures. Rising tariffs, volatile capital markets, and increased defense spending are diverting public funds from clean energy investments, particularly in developing economies where $2.2 trillion annually is needed through 2030 to align with net-zero goals.

Emerging Europe and Asia are narrowing the readiness gap, with regions like Latvia and China benefiting from infrastructure upgrades and clean technology investments. Brazil’s investments in its National Interconnected System, enabling solar power distribution, and Saudi Arabia’s rapid renewable capacity buildout are notable examples. However, the report warns that over 90% of clean energy investment in 2024 flowed to advanced economies and China, leaving developing nations like India and Nigeria underfunded despite their growing energy needs.

Challenges and Opportunities Ahead

The WEF report underscores that the energy transition is no longer just a climate issue but a cornerstone of economic competitiveness, national security, and industrial policy. The global clean energy sector attracted $2 trillion in 2024, supporting 16 million jobs, but this falls short of the $5.6 trillion needed annually through 2030 to meet net-zero targets. The rise of AI and data centers, which are driving energy demand, poses both a challenge and an opportunity, requiring innovative solutions like smart meters and time-of-use pricing to manage consumption. Saudi Arabia’s deployment of 11 million smart meters and Australia’s Clean Energy Training Hubs exemplify how technology and workforce development can enhance system efficiency and resilience.

Geopolitical and economic headwinds, including U.S. tariff policies and supply chain disruptions, threaten to stall progress. The International Monetary Fund’s revised 2025 global growth forecast of 2.8% reflects these pressures, which could delay infrastructure investments and increase financing costs. The report calls for five strategic priorities: stable yet adaptive policy frameworks, modernized grid infrastructure, workforce development, accelerated clean technology deployment, and increased investment in developing economies. These steps are critical to ensuring an equitable, secure, and sustainable energy future.

A Multi-Speed Transition

The ETI reveals a multi-speed transition, with advanced economies leading but emerging markets making significant strides. Sweden, Finland, and Denmark remain top performers, while China, Brazil, and India demonstrate that tailored reforms can drive progress in diverse contexts. However, the persistent lag in energy security and uneven investment flows highlight the need for global cooperation. As the WEF notes, “Achieving these goals cannot rely on single-market initiatives, but a new type of global and regional alliances needs to be forged.” Knowledge sharing and targeted financial support for developing nations will be essential to sustain momentum and close the gap between ambition and reality.

As the world navigates a complex energy landscape, the 2025 ETI offers a roadmap for progress. While equity and sustainability gains are cause for optimism, the stalled progress in energy security and slowing readiness underscore the urgency of collective action. With clean energy at the heart of economic and environmental goals, 2025 marks a pivotal year to accelerate the transition—or risk falling short of a net-zero future.",https://www.bbntimes.com/images/Global_Energy_Transition_Gains_Momentum_in_2025_but_Security_Lags_Behind.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 18:02:49.044311

Way back in 2021, Oilprice asked, “Why is the world still ignoring geothermal energy?” In the four years since that report, everything has changed.
“At that point, water goes supercritical and can hold five to 10 times as much energy as normal steam.” This ‘superhot’ geothermal “could provide cheap, abundant clean energy anywhere.” Drilling a hole deep enough to enable cost-effective and commercial geothermal energy is no easy task.

Plus, enhanced geothermal drilling technologies would democratize clean energy, as any country could theoretically tap into this universal heat source to become energy independent.","Geothermal energy holds massive potential to disrupt global energy markets and provide nearly limitless and constant clean energy. Unlike solar and wind energy, which rely on climatic factors outside of human control, the heat from the Earth’s core is a steady and constant commodity. It’s just a matter of tapping into it. And the race is heating up to determine the best technological approach to do just that.

Way back in 2021, Oilprice asked, “Why is the world still ignoring geothermal energy?” In the four years since that report, everything has changed. The promising clean energy source has – at long last – become a very hot topic. Rising from near obscurity, it’s now shaping up to be “the decade of geothermal.” That’s according to Cindy Taff, chief executive of geothermal company Sage Geosystems, in an interview in The Hill published in February of this year.

So what took so long? Geothermal is already easily accessible in places like Iceland, where heat from the Earth’s core already leaks up to the surface and can be easily captured and converted into electricity. But on most of the planet, temperatures useful for creating electricity are trapped far, far under the ground. The Earth's crust varies from about 3 to 47 miles in thickness, and most of those thinnest areas are inconveniently located way out in the deep ocean.

“The most audacious vision for geothermal is to drill six miles or more underground where temperatures exceed 750 degrees Fahrenheit,” reports the New York Times. “At that point, water goes supercritical and can hold five to 10 times as much energy as normal steam.” This ‘superhot’ geothermal “could provide cheap, abundant clean energy anywhere.”

Drilling a hole deep enough to enable cost-effective and commercial geothermal energy is no easy task. But research and pilot projects trying to figure out the best way to do it are finally taking off.

One potential method borrows hydraulic fracturing technologies that are already well-tested and widely in use in the oil and gas industry. Using fracking infrastructure, geothermal companies can crack open subterranean layers of rock to inject water into the fractures at high volumes and pressures, resulting in artificially made geothermal reservoirs. This technology is not yet cost-effective enough to be commercially viable, since traditional fracking equipment can’t withstand the necessary levels of heat, but it was one of the first “enhanced” geothermal technologies and is therefore more developed than some of the more nascent alternatives.

Another, more futuristic technological approach involves nuclear fusion. Researchers are currently investigating the utility of gyrotrons, a technology used in nuclear fusion to super-heat and maintain plasma with millimeter waves, to basically melt away rock to drill deeper and more efficiently into the Earth. Mathematical modelling from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) suggests that this technology “could blast a basketball-size hole into rock at a rate of 20 meters per hour,” according to IEEE Spectrum. “At that rate, 25-and-a-half days of continuous drilling would create the world’s deepest hole.” And now the gyrotron approach is ready to leave the lab and face real-world testing.

A Slovakian company called GA Drilling is also looking to plasma, but rather than using millimeter waves the technology uses a plasma torch for high-temperature drilling, which they say can reach 10-kilometer depths to “provide clean, inexpensive and nonstop available geothermal energy” at “any location on Earth.”

A geothermal technology breakthrough could reshape global energy industries and shore up energy security – just in the nick of time as energy demand surges on the back of data center growth. A recent report suggests that geothermal energy could meet up to 64 percent of the expected growth in data center energy demand as soon as the early 2030s. Plus, enhanced geothermal drilling technologies would democratize clean energy, as any country could theoretically tap into this universal heat source to become energy independent.

It has caused the UN secretary general, António Guterres, to declare: “We are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age.”

Well, hallelujah.

Except, here in Australia, we are still mired in the politics of climate and at risk of missing the window of opportunity for both environmental protection and economic benefit.

Regulatory hurdles, worker shortages and community blowback in regional Australia have all combined to feed the culture wars and the erosion of social licence that is fundamental to progress the energy transition.

As Ezra Klein, co-author of the viral book Abundance, has remarked of late, “We should be able to argue that the clean energy future should be fucking awesome.”

Yet, we are failing.

And in that we are betraying young people and those who are both most concerned about the impact of the renewables revolution on their communities and most at risk from the disasters that make it necessary.

This week the first sitting of the 48th parliament typified time-wasting point-scoring politics with former Nationals leaders Barnaby Joyce and Michael McCormack teaming up to push for the repeal of the legislated net zero target, undermining the current leader, David Littleproud, in the process.

This is irresponsible and gutless, and the Albanese government with its characteristic pragmatic caution must not allow its massive majority to be an excuse to curb ambition because it doesn’t need to try too hard to appear to be better

Instead, both governments and oppositions at state and federal level need to go back to basics and carefully build the case to step communities through the big changes ahead from the point of view of both an opportunity for affordable power and better jobs as well as a necessity.

We know that Australians care about climate.

Many have already been touched directly by climate disasters. Most will have seen their insurance premiums affected at the very least.

The 2022 election was certainly influenced by the floods, fires and storms that led up to it, and the Morrison government’s refusal to “hold a hose”.

And while the Coalition successfully channelled much of the 2025 election debate into cost-of-living pressure, even here in Goldstein, where the demographic is older than the national average, polling still consistently showed climate in the top three concerns of constituents.

Many Australians also understand that climate and environment policy and the economy are intrinsically linked.

In his recent address to the National Press Club, former Treasury secretary Ken Henry tied the two together, as he described failures in improving environmental management as “a wilful act of intergenerational bastardry”.

The government has revived plans for a federal EPA after parking its promised broader reforms to environmental laws towards the end of the last parliament apparently under pressure from business.

Henry argues for an overhaul that both protects and restores nature, through high-integrity incentives for nature restoration and carbon storage together with genuine cooperation between all levels of government and clear standards and decision-making.

He frames nature restoration as both an environmental and economic benefit, both of which are critical to the net zero transition.

Speaking of which, what was not talked about in Canberra this week?

While Joyce and McCormack try to ditch the 43% net zero 2030 emissions target (which is set as a floor not a ceiling because I negotiated that into the law with the federal energy minister, Chris Bowen), Australia’s net zero target for 2035 has not yet been set.

The government has been waiting for advice from the Climate Change Authority to set the new nationally determined contribution (NDC), which required factoring in the outcomes of both the Australian election and the 2024 US election.

Now that all of that is over, to what extent will the Albanese government take its power amid this circular debate?

Some in the business world, specifically the chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Andrew McKellar, say a target of 65-75% would be “exceedingly challenging for the Australian economy”.

Yet expert analysis shows that a 2035 target of sub 75% or more (on 2005 levels) is aligned with more than 2C of global heating. And, according to the Climate Council, “climate-fuelled disasters are expected to cost the Australian economy $94 billion a year by 2060 if pollution levels remain high”. At least 8.8% of Australian homes will be uninsurable due to high exposure to climate disasters by 2100.

There’s no question it’s complicated, practically and politically.

But arguably, Labor has six years in power ahead. That’s a decent runway.

And pragmatically, three-quarters of millennials and gen Z voters, now the largest group of Australian voters, named climate change as a key voting issue for the 2025 election.

By 2028, there will be several hundred thousand more of them.

And they’ll expect something beyond more “intergenerational bastardry”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0324d78bfdda5a652cf9e565c23a62278a63fc4d/449_0_5109_3066/master/5109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=6ded5be8b726ae0920f095df176e3ee9",N,,2025-07-26 19:01:34.899409

Polyzos said the team pinpointed parameters for successfully incorporating the thinner material into the roll-to-roll production process, despite its being more prone to wrinkling. Other experimental current collectors have generally required expensive and complex manufacturing processes that are incompatible with standard roll-to-roll methods.

ORNL’s study results, published in Energy & Environmental Materials, highlight the potential of the metal-polymer current collector to “revolutionize the roll-to-roll battery manufacturing process and significantly advance the performance metrics of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicle applications.”

Brian Morin, CEO of South Carolina-based Soteria, said ORNL has helped the company understand how to achieve rapid battery charging with the technology, despite increased physical resistance from the plastic film.

“We take 80% of the metal out, which makes it harder to do things quickly,” Morin said. “But they’ve shown that you can still get fast charge and discharge. Soteria’s testing has shown the polymer also makes the battery safer. If there is an internal short circuit that produces a brief rush of energy, it eats the plastic film, which pulls the metal away. Our current collector acts like a circuit breaker inside the battery and eliminates about 90% of lithium-ion battery fires caused by short circuits.”

The metalized polymer current collector research was funded through DOE’s Advanced Materials and Manufacturing Technologies Office, or AMMTO. Other ORNL researchers involved in the project include Sergiy Kalnaus, Sabine Neumayer, Wheatley Steenman and Jaswinder Sharma.

Fears that the Trump administration is looking for ways to lift a longstanding ban on fracking for natural gas in the densely populated Delaware River Basin—which includes part of Pennsylvania—have prompted environmentalists to seek public support for a commitment to defend the regulation.

Activists are promoting a “Pledge of Resistance and Protection” of the watershed in response to what they see as a series of attempts by the administration and some of its supporters in Congress to hobble the Delaware River Basin Commission, an interstate agency that formally banned fracking in the region in 2021 after a moratorium that began a decade earlier.

“The Delaware River frack ban was put in place with public participation, backed by science and fact to be protective of the Delaware River watershed and its communities,” the pledge says in part. “We must continue to stand strong for our environment, and to uphold the pillars of law, science and facts that helped the DRBC make the sound decision that the watershed will not survive, nor will we, if fracking is allowed.”

The Trump administration hasn’t made specific moves to target the ban. But environmentalists’ confidence in the rule has been shaken after multiple actions by President Donald Trump to increase fossil fuel production, including declaring an “energy emergency” and directing agencies to roll back federal policies that “impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources” such as natural gas.

Environmentalists were further spooked after U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan, a new Republican congressman from northeast Pennsylvania, introduced a bill in May that would require a federal review of the DRBC and other commissions in the Mid-Atlantic, including responsibilities that overlap with federal obligations, and recommend any reforms. Bresnahan criticized the fracking ban earlier this year at the event attended by the head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

The Delaware River Basin extends across four states, but only two—Pennsylvania and New York—also contain the gas-rich Marcellus Shale. New York banned fracking statewide in 2014, citing health risks.

Environmentalists say that allowing the industry to drill in Pennsylvania’s part of the watershed would risk contaminating drinking water for some 15 million people, including in Philadelphia and Trenton, New Jersey, with toxic chemicals used in fracking. The critics point to many instances of air and water pollution in heavily fracked areas such as southwest Pennsylvania, and they say that increased production will also worsen climate change.

The gas industry says it protects drinking-water aquifers from fracking chemicals by encasing drills in multiple layers of steel and concrete, and complies with all state and federal laws on fracking safety.

Pennsylvania’s gas industry and its supporters in the state legislature have unsuccessfully fought the DRBC’s frack ban through legislation and litigation for years, arguing that landowners in two watershed counties should be allowed to lease their property to companies active in the rest of the state’s Marcellus Shale. In February, a federal judge dismissed a suit by landowners in Wayne County, northeast of Scranton, seeking to overturn the DRBC’s fracking ban in their area.

The Marcellus Shale Coalition, which represents Pennsylvania’s natural gas industry, said it wants the Delaware River Basin fracking ban to be lifted, but has not “formally communicated” with the Trump administration on the issue.

“The Marcellus Shale Coalition strongly supports lifting the DRBC’s unjust ban on safe, responsible natural gas development. This ban has long violated the property rights of Pennsylvania landowners and ignores nearly two decades of demonstrated, highly regulated shale development in the Commonwealth—including in the neighboring Susquehanna River Basin,” coalition spokesman Patrick Henderson said in a statement.

Still, a study released in 2019 by the University of Delaware found that the watershed represents only 3.3 percent of the Marcellus Shale. The study found that the financial value of potentially recoverable natural gas in that part of the field is dwarfed by the estimated value of the area’s drinking water supply, forests and recreation.

“The value, not just economic but civic and ecological, is many times more than the small amount of gas that’s up there,” said Jerry Kauffman, director of the University of Delaware’s Water Resources Center and one of the authors of the report. “The gas, which is a fossil fuel, is a non-renewable resource that can be exhausted pretty quickly. Protect the drinking water first because it’s much more valuable.”

In banning fracking, the DRBC “acted appropriately” to protect the interests of the people who live in the watershed, Kauffman said. He plans to update the study this year.

One Trump administration move involving the DRBC added to environmentalists’ jitters that more might be coming. The agency’s federal representative, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, proposed a resolution last month to end future federal funding for DRBC work on climate change, and for its policy of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI. The resolution was unanimously approved by governors of the watershed states—New Jersey and Delaware in addition to Pennsylvania and New York, all run by Democratic administrations.

The surprising agreement prompted speculation that the governors were picking their battles with Trump. The federal government has mostly failed to pay its share of DRBC’s running costs since the 1980s, and so the funding cut would have little effect.

DRBC’s executive director, Kristen Kavanagh, said the agency has received no federal funding through the Army Corps since the resolution. But she said the DRBC’s Advisory Committee on Climate Change, a panel of 18 experts, including academics and water-company executives, will continue its work. Its next scheduled meeting is Aug. 27.

Bresnahan’s commission review bill, meanwhile, has advanced in committee and awaits a full vote in the House.

His office did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons for the bill. But Tracy Carluccio with the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, who instigated the pledge, called the legislation a ploy to interfere with the running of an agency that has prompted a sharp improvement in water quality since its inception in 1961, and reinforced that through its ban on fracking.

“This attempt to poke around the DRBC’s inner workings is nothing more than a politically motivated witch hunt, designed to intimidate and disrupt the DRBC,” Carluccio said.

DRBC spokespeople declined to comment on the bill.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also did not respond to requests for comment. But its administrator, Lee Zeldin, attended a meeting in Northeast Pennsylvania with Bresnahan and some pro-fracking state lawmakers in March, according to a press release from the congressman and a story from the River Reporter, a news site in a New York community just over the Pennsylvania state line.

Asked there whether the Trump administration would try to open up drilling in Northeast Pennsylvania, Zeldin said, “President Trump is someone I feel confident we can approach [with] any good idea [and] his response is going to be that he wants to get it done as quickly as possible,” the news site reported.

If the Trump administration finds a way to lift the Delaware Basin frack ban, it will also find activists pledged to resist it, said Carluccio. By mid-July, the document had about 1,100 signers online.

“We have found that people want to make positive commitments that affirm personal power,” she said. “The pledge is like an oath or a vow founded on a person’s allegiance to the issue. We know that there is strong and resolute dedication from people to never allowing fracking to occur here and the pledge is a public statement that each person makes to stake their ground.”",https://982e8d80.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/No-Fracking-1024x768.jpeg,N,,2025-07-26 19:02:52.515999

Electrified Materials, a subsidiary of American Resources Corporation, has received a federal permit to scale up its electric vehicle battery recycling operations.

The news, first reported by Charged Electric Vehicle magazine, centers on a newly granted Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) permit, issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Indiana’s Department of Environmental Management. With this permit, Electrified Materials is now authorized to preprocess and recycle materials including copper, aluminum, iron, rare earth elements, and critical minerals.

Mark Jensen, Chairman and CEO of American Resources, emphasized the strategic value of this advancement, calling it “a key milestone in scaling our recycling and refining partnership with ReElement Technologies.” Electrified Materials specializes in processing lithium-ion batteries from EV motors and other sources turning discarded power systems into valuable raw materials for reuse.

This circular approach is vital to addressing one of the few environmental concerns surrounding EVs. While electric vehicles produce no tailpipe emissions and reduce greenhouse gas pollution especially when powered by renewable sources like solar the production and disposal of their batteries raise serious environmental questions. Mining for raw materials is resource-intensive and can lead to ecological damage. Improper disposal of used batteries poses risks of soil and water contamination due to their toxic contents.

By enabling advanced recycling methods, Electrified Materials aims to minimize these risks. The company will extract usable mineral concentrates from old battery packs, which will then be refined by ReElement Technologies into high-grade materials suitable for new batteries and magnets. This process closes a crucial loop in the EV lifecycle ensuring that fewer hazardous materials end up in landfills while reducing dependence on virgin raw materials.

Jensen also pointed to state-level support as a critical accelerator. “This permit, combined with the $900,000+ grant from the State of Indiana and our strategic alignment with ReElement, will accelerate our expansion and strengthen our domestic footprint,” he said.",https://wonderfulengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-259.png,N,,2025-07-26 22:00:58.996880

If your electricity bill seems shockingly high, you're not imagining it. A big part of the spike is being driven by rising artificial intelligence electricity demand.

PJM Interconnection, the largest power grid operator in the United States, says electricity usage is climbing sharply this summer. Some areas may see bills increase by as much as 20%. One of the main drivers behind this trend is the growing power consumption from data centers that support AI systems like ChatGPT and other generative tools.

TRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND

Why the power grid is struggling to keep up

PJM supplies electricity to 67 million customers across 13 states: Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. It manages a vast and complex network of power distribution. This summer, the grid is showing signs of strain.

In just the past year, data centers running AI have started using much more electricity. These centers can consume up to 30 times more power than traditional data centers. Most of them are connected to the same grid that serves homes and businesses, which means the cost of that power growth is shared by everyone.

AI and data centers are fueling a surge in energy use

AI took off in 2023 when tools like ChatGPT became widely adopted. Since then, companies have been racing to build more infrastructure to keep up. PJM's territory now has the largest number of data centers in the world.

Between 2024 and 2025, electricity demand from AI and data centers in the PJM region contributed to a $9 billion increase in power costs. PJM expects peak usage this summer to reach over 154,000 megawatts, with the potential to exceed all-time records during heat waves or emergencies.

Why electricity prices are rising across the U.S.

While demand is rising quickly, the power supply is not keeping up with the pace. Many fossil fuel plants are shutting down due to state regulations, aging infrastructure or market conditions. More than 9,000 megawatts of coal capacity will retire or convert to gas in 2025 alone.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

Clean energy options like wind and solar are often the cheapest ways to add new power, but developers are struggling with permitting delays, rising costs and a loss of federal incentives. For example, the 30% federal solar tax credit for homeowners will end after 2025. That change is already slowing down new installations.

How AI is increasing your electric bill

Even if you never use AI tools yourself, you are still likely paying for their growth. The cost of expanding the data center's power supply is spread across all grid users, including regular households.

PJM customers have been warned to expect electric bills to increase by $25 or more per month. Commercial users may see prices climb nearly 30%.

To help prevent rolling blackouts, PJM is rolling out demand response programs that pay large businesses to temporarily reduce their electricity use during periods of extreme demand. Still, if electricity usage exceeds 166,000 megawatts, some regions may not have enough reserve power to maintain reliability.

Tips to reduce your electricity bill

Looking for ways to lower your electricity bill as prices surge? Here are some effective tips you can start using today:

Unplug electronics and appliances when not in use to avoid phantom power drain.

Upgrade to smart thermostats and LED lighting for greater energy efficiency.

Run major appliances (like washers and dishwashers) during off-peak hours.

Consider adding weather stripping or insulation to block drafts and improve cooling/heating.

Monitor your energy usage with smart plugs or an electricity usage monitor for real-time feedback.

Kurt's key takeaway

AI electricity demand is growing faster than the grid can handle. As more data centers come online to power tools like ChatGPT, the strain is showing up on your utility bill. Without major upgrades to infrastructure or smarter energy policy, prices could keep climbing. The tech may be smart, but the cost of keeping it running is getting harder for everyone else to ignore.

,Clean Energy ,2025-07-26 20:31:50+00:00,The Telegraph,Ed Miliband eyes battery bonanza to cut wind farm costs - The Telegraph,"Szu Ping Chan, Matt Oliver",,,,,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/07/26/miliband-eyes-battery-bonanza-to-cut-wind-farm-costs/,"Ed Miliband will plough hundreds of millions of pounds into battery storage technology as the cost of ordering wind farms to shut down spirals out of control.
GB Energy think they’ve got a role to play in trying to fund the innovation.” The Energy Secretary is presiding over the drive as part of a £4bn push by GB Energy into emerging technologies.
The push into battery storage technology comes after Mr Miliband abandoned controversial plans to charge southern households more for electricity than those in the North amid a backlash from wind farm owners.
A spokesman for GB Energy said: “Long-duration energy storage is vital to a clean, secure, and affordable energy future for the UK.
“GB Energy sees opportunity to invest in both proven technologies like pumped hydro and emerging innovations such as flow batteries and liquid air storage.","Ed Miliband will plough hundreds of millions of pounds into battery storage technology as the cost of ordering wind farms to shut down spirals out of control.

GB Energy, which is backed by the taxpayer, will use a chunk of its newly minted budget to invest in energy storage systems as households and businesses are forced to foot the bill to prevent the creaking power grid from getting congested.

More than £700m has been spent so far this year on switching off wind farms to avoid overloading the grid as well as firing up alternatives to keep the lights on. This is up from about £450m over the same period in 2024, with the money ultimately coming from energy bills.

Officials are also keen to ensure clean power remains reliable during periods of high demand.

An industry source said: “How do you get around the fact that the wind blows one day, doesn’t blow the next? They have to keep switching off the turbines because they can’t store the energy. GB Energy think they’ve got a role to play in trying to fund the innovation.”

The Energy Secretary is presiding over the drive as part of a £4bn push by GB Energy into emerging technologies.

The push into battery storage technology is understood to be one of GB Energy’s three big priorities, with half its £4bn innovation budget being deployed to bring more of the UK’s net zero supply chain onshore.

The Government is hoping to create hundreds of new jobs in areas such as Scarborough, North Yorkshire, which is reinventing itself as a service hub for the offshore wind industry.

Experts say large amounts of energy storage will be needed for net zero, as countries move away from readily dispatchable gas or coal-fired power stations to intermittent sources such as wind and solar farms.

More storage on the grid should also help to prevent situations where grid operators are forced to pay wind farms to switch off when the network is too busy to accept their power.

Instead, battery operators would be able to snap the electricity up cheaply and store it for later.

There is particular need for so-called long-duration storage that can be deployed over weeks rather than days to counter periods of “dunkelflaute”, when cloudy skies and stagnant wind conditions reduce the output of renewables.

Under Mr Miliband’s plan for a clean power system by 2030, the amount of long-duration energy storage is expected to rise from about three gigawatts today to between four and six gigawatts – enough to power millions of homes.

Traditional lithium ion batteries are not ideal for this owing to their high cost and relatively short-term output, as well as degradation over time and the large numbers that would need to be built.

Possible alternatives include “flow” batteries, which store energy in liquid electrolytes, pumped hydro storage, compressed air storage, heat storage such as thermal bricks or molten salt, and caves that can be used to store hydrogen.

The push into battery storage technology comes after Mr Miliband abandoned controversial plans to charge southern households more for electricity than those in the North amid a backlash from wind farm owners.

Advocates claimed that zonal pricing would also have cut bills for all households overall by removing the need for £27bn of grid upgrades and axing the payments made to wind farms to switch off.

Wind turbines have been built faster than grid capacity over the past decade, leaving Britain’s infrastructure struggling to move electricity from Scottish wind farms to where it is needed in the South.

A spokesman for GB Energy said: “Long-duration energy storage is vital to a clean, secure, and affordable energy future for the UK.

“GB Energy sees opportunity to invest in both proven technologies like pumped hydro and emerging innovations such as flow batteries and liquid air storage. By stepping in early, we can unlock private capital, accelerate delivery, and back British supply chains.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/business/2025/07/25/TELEMMGLPICT000431149250_17534681248670_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:19.740717

,EPA,2025-07-26 20:28:13+00:00,natlawreview.com,"EPA Reorganizes Research Office—ORD Dissolved, IRIS Under Fire",James V. Aidala,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/epas-office-research-and-development-villain-or-victim,"On July 18, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled out the “reorganization plan” for its Office of Research and Development (ORD).
The IRIS Program has evolved over time; its database was made publicly available in 1988 and there are now opportunities for public input into the IRIS process.
In the end, even if ORD, as a separate program office, is taken off the EPA organization chart, the need to coordinate science policies and review procedures across EPA programs will remain.
The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs.
A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws.","On July 18, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rolled out the “reorganization plan” for its Office of Research and Development (ORD). The stated goal of the plan is to reduce budget expenditures, improve “science,” and have EPA’s research activities better support the work of the media offices, including the Office of Water (OW), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), and Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). The EPA press release refers to the effort as a continuation of “comprehensive restructuring” that includes a reduction in force (RIF) for the ORD and a subsequent savings of hundreds of millions of dollars. The release also announced the creation of a new EPA office, the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES), with a mission to “prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,” but provided no further information on the new office.

To Administration supporters, this is the latest chapter in the long overdue reorganization of federal programs to help reduce costs and trim back the “administrative state.” To detractors, it is yet another broad attack on regulatory programs in general, especially those at EPA, and specifically targets the scientific work of EPA and its research office. ORD personnel reorganization was among the many ORD-specific recommendations outlined in the Project 2025 document. Critics of the Administration’s efforts to cut EPA’s budget and staffing see the reorganization of ORD and its associated staff cuts as part of the larger attempt to reduce protections of the environment and health at EPA and other government agencies — as part of the agenda to “gut” EPA programs generally, even if some program offices (including OCSPP) gain positions.

ORD’s work, especially its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), has been controversial for many years and the subject of intense industry and trade group criticism. Established in 1985 and revised periodically, the IRIS Program is an attempt at a uniform, agency-wide database of human health assessments for chemicals found in the environment that serves as the basis for regulatory actions across EPA. The goal is that each EPA program be consistent in its assessments and able to act according to the specific legislative requirements driving the work of the respective EPA offices. The IRIS Program has evolved over time; its database was made publicly available in 1988 and there are now opportunities for public input into the IRIS process. At its best, the IRIS Program is hailed by supporters as being an essential part of bridge-building between different forms of environmental science and the various offices of EPA.

IRIS critics, however, have claimed for years that the program is overly conservative in its assessment assumptions, biased in its selection of information evaluated, and secretive in avoiding public scrutiny of its underlying work and assumptions. A January 27, 2025, letter organized by the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and signed by over 80 organizations affected by the work of the IRIS Program asserts:

IRIS has often fallen short of scientific standards required of EPA and is out of step with global health agencies and regulators. IRIS fails to adequately incorporate high quality and relevant science and does not consistently utilize a “weight of the scientific evidence” approach. Also, the process IRIS uses to prioritize and select chemicals for assessment lacks transparency.

For years, ORD has been subject to legislation introduced in Congress in response to the assertion of critics, most recently the “No IRIS” Act introduced in the House and Senate in February 2025 (H.R. 1415 and S. 623, respectively). The IRIS Program has been reviewed by the General Accountability Office (GAO) at various times over the years and found to indeed have program deficiencies (e.g., timeliness, lack of guidance) cited by critics as evidence of its ineffectiveness. EPA has implemented actions to satisfy the recommendations made by GAO, but some stakeholders remain very critical.

Critique of the IRIS Program is just one facet — there has been a long-standing assault on ORD’s assessment policies and assumptions used in ORD evaluations. In February 2025, partly in response to this sustained assault, EPA employees and supporters created Stand Up for Science. This grassroots movement turned non-profit organization has hosted rallies, created policy goals, and garnered media attention. Of note, the Stand Up for Science website hosts the public Declaration of Dissent, signed by EPA staff and members of the public, and invites visitors to add their name to the Declaration. The Declaration itself is addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and highlights five main concerns. Concern number four is “Dismantling the Office of Research and Development.” The Declaration states that the proposed ORD reorganization will make “EPA science more vulnerable to political interference,” and cites the proposed budget cuts for 2026 as leaving “ORD unable to meet the science needs of the EPA and its partners” and in a place that “will threaten the health of all Americans.”

What any reorganization of ORD or reform of science activities and policies will have to confront is the requirement for a scientific basis at the heart of any regulatory decision. Regardless of presidential priorities or allocated budgets, much of EPA’s work will remain dependent on the underlying science supporting whatever regulatory conclusions are proposed. Those programmatic conclusions will then be subject to public review and comment as part of the fundamental regulatory development process. In the end, even if ORD, as a separate program office, is taken off the EPA organization chart, the need to coordinate science policies and review procedures across EPA programs will remain. The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs. A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws. That centralized science function was developed over time to reduce, and ideally eliminate, inconsistent science and avoid overlapping, unsupported, or inadequate requirements.

After the reorganization and budget allocations are settled, it is not clear what procedures or administrators will fill those needed functions of integration, coordination, and consistency. Debates, especially high-profile controversies, are often more about the derivative outcomes of an assessment masking as debates than about the underlying data and evaluation procedures. Reorganizing the pieces on the chess board will not resolve or avoid such debates in the future.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-07/bigstock-Washington-Dc-Usa--January--196171783.jpg.webp?itok=lGoNZsGM,N,,2025-07-26 22:59:38.414255

That led to the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health and welfare, based on overwhelming scientific consensus and peer-reviewed research.
The Endangerment Finding has withstood multiple legal challenges, and although Trump's first administration considered reversing it, they ultimately held back.
The government is expected to undo the earlier finding that greenhouse gases endanger public welfare.
""It's fatalistic to avoid taking the many actions that could cumulatively fix climate change, because none of them can individually solve the entire problem.""","A proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to change the so-called ""Endangerment Finding"" was sent to the White House on June 30, a spokesperson told AFP. An announcement is expected imminently.

The Clean Air Act of 1970 empowered the EPA to regulate ""air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.""

For decades, the law applied to pollutants like lead, ozone, and soot.

But as climate science around the dangers of heat-trapping greenhouse gases advanced in the 2000s, a coalition of states and nonprofit groups petitioned the EPA to include them under the law, focusing on motor vehicles.

The issue reached the Supreme Court, which in 2007 ruled that greenhouse gases qualify as air pollutants and directed the EPA to revisit its stance.

That led to the 2009 Endangerment Finding, which declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health and welfare, based on overwhelming scientific consensus and peer-reviewed research.

""That 2009 finding formed the basis for all of EPA's subsequent regulations,"" Meredith Hankins, a senior attorney on climate and energy for the activist Natural Resources Defense Council, told AFP.

""They've issued greenhouse gas standards for tailpipe emissions from motor vehicles, smokestack emissions from power plants – all of these individual rulemakings trace themselves back to the 2009 Endangerment Finding.""

The Endangerment Finding has withstood multiple legal challenges, and although Trump's first administration considered reversing it, they ultimately held back.

But the finding is now a direct target of Project 2025, a far-right governance blueprint closely followed by the administration.

In March, the EPA under Administrator Lee Zeldin announced a formal reconsideration of the finding.

""The Trump Administration will not sacrifice national prosperity, energy security, and the freedom of our people for an agenda that throttles our industries, our mobility, and our consumer choice while benefiting adversaries overseas,"" he said.

The government is expected to undo the earlier finding that greenhouse gases endanger public welfare. It will argue that the economic costs of regulation have been undervalued – and downplay the role of US motor vehicle emissions in climate change.

In fact, transportation is the largest source of US greenhouse gas emissions.

""If vehicle emissions don't pass muster as a contribution to climate change, it's hard to imagine what would,"" Dena Adler of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University told AFP. ""It's fatalistic to avoid taking the many actions that could cumulatively fix climate change, because none of them can individually solve the entire problem.""

Since 1970, the US has emitted more vehicle-based greenhouse gases than the next nine countries combined, according to an analysis by the Institute for Policy Integrity that will soon be published in full.

In March, the EPA said it would lean on recent court rulings, including a landmark 2024 decision that narrowed federal regulatory power.

Still, legal experts say the administration faces an uphill battle.

""It will take a few years for the rule to be finalized and wind its way up to the Supreme Court for review,"" said Adler.

""If EPA loses before the Supreme Court, it gets sent back, and EPA then gets it back to the drawing board"" – by which time Trump's term may be nearing its end.

To succeed, the high court may need to overturn its own 2007 decision that led to the Endangerment Finding.

None of the justices who wrote the majority opinion remain on the bench, while three dissenters – John Roberts, Clarence Thomas, and Samuel Alito – still serve, and could spearhead a drive to upend the original ruling.

Even then, market forces may blunt the impact of any rollback.

""Utilities making long-term investments and companies purchasing capital goods expected to be used for decades won't base those decisions on short-term policy changes,"" said John Tobin-de la Puente, a professor at Cornell University's business school.",https://media.tag24.de/1200x800/b/s/bst191i85j6w0h26ic1jjizwier5jobx.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 21:01:51.810558

Several of the new laws signed this year address environmental, agricultural and wildlife-related issues in Vermont, including big game violations, nuisance suits against farmers, water pollution, forever chemicals and financial support for communities recovering from disasters.

Below are explanations on five environmental, agricultural and wildlife-related laws that took effect or began to take effect this summer.

The bill to law process will begin again in January, when lawmakers reconvene in Montpelier for the next legislative session and second half of the biennium.

Increasing big game violation fines, pond slider turtle crack down, more

What it does: Act 47 covers wide-ranging topics related to fish and wildlife laws. The act amends the definition of a big game violation and increases the penalties for it. For first-time offenders, the new minimum fine is $500, up from $400, and the new maximum fine is $2,000, up from $1,000. The maximum fine for subsequent convictions increased from $4,000 to $5,000, and the maximum prison sentence for repeat offenders increased from 60 days to 180 days. The law also repeals the state statute requiring the Department of Fish and Wildlife to compensate farmers for crop damage from deer or black bears. Additionally, it temporarily cracks down on the possession, sale and importation of pond slider turtles, save for a few exemptions, until regulations can be put into place.

The act also allows Vermonters with developmental disabilities to apply for free permanent fishing licenses and establishes Labor Day weekend as “free mentored fishing weekend,” where no more than four unlicensed anglers can fish with licensed anglers during the weekend. As of Jan. 1, 2027, the act will prohibit the “intentional” taking of reptiles or amphibians without permission from DFW. The law makes several other miscellaneous clarifications and amendments to fish and wildlife statutes.

When it goes into effect: Multiple effective dates, beginning June 5, 2025.

Protecting farmers from nuisance suits

What it does: Act 61 strengthens farmers’ protections from “nuisance suits.” The law asserts that an agricultural activity will not be considered a “nuisance” if it falls under the umbrella of “generally accepted agricultural practices” in Vermont. However, farmers must have “good standing” with the state for nuisance protections to apply. Nuisance protections also do not apply in the case of negligence or if the activity can be objectively shown to have negatively impacted one’s health, safety, welfare, use or enjoyment of the property. The plaintiff has the burden of proof and must have attempted to resolve the matter with the farmer via mediation at least once before bringing a court action.

When it goes into effect: July 1, 2025.

Improving compliance with federal Clean Water Act

What it does: Act 67 seeks to help bring Vermont into compliance with the federal Clean Water Act, which dictates how states must regulate water quality and the discharge of pollutants into water. The Act aims to clarify the responsibilities of the two state agencies that regulate agricultural water quality on farms, the Agency of NaturalResources and the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets. Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency determined Vermont was in violation of the Clean Water Act for not adhering to farm pollution regulations, especially those governing concentrated animal feeding operations (e.g. facilities with a large number of animals held in confined spaces).

When it goes into effect: July 1, 2025.

Phasing out PFAS products

What it does: Act 54 sets in motion bans on the sale and distribution of several consumer products with “intentionally added” PFAS – also known as “forever chemicals,” which can cause serious health issues – including cleaning products, dental floss, fluorine treated containers, firefighting personal protective equipment (PPE), respirators and respirator equipment. Vermont currently bans PFAS from items like food packaging and residential carpets and rugs, and is phasing out the chemicals in menstrual products, cookware and more.

When it goes into effect: Multiple effect dates, beginning July 1.

Financial support for flood-impacted communities

What it does: Act 57 provides greater financial leeway to Vermont communities recovering from disasters, such as the 2023 and 2024 floods. Under this law, municipalities will have five years to pay off emergency loans (versus just a year previously), can repay the loans in smaller chunks at the beginning of their repayment plan, can keep more revenue from their local option taxes, can set aside “unassigned funds"" for future emergencies and more.

When it goes into effect: Multiple effective dates, beginning June 11.

At the Africa Policy Dialogue (APD) Kickoff Workshop on “Catalyzing Green Jobs Through Low Carbon Transition” held on July 24, 2025, at the National Assembly Complex in Abuja, Halilu’s vision resonated with attendees, igniting hope for young Nigerians, women, and rural communities eager for economic opportunities in a greener economy.

SPONSOR AD

The workshop, co-organized by the House of Representatives Committee on Renewable Energy, the Inclusive Knowledge Platform, and Advocacy for Policy and Innovation (API), brought together policymakers, industry leaders, and advocates to craft a sustainable framework for Nigeria’s low-carbon transition.

Represented by Dr. Yahaya Tanko, Head of NASENI’s Impact Desk, Halilu outlined a transformative agenda that places people—especially youth and women—at the heart of Nigeria’s green revolution.

At just 32, Halilu, the youngest leader in NASENI’s history, is redefining the agency’s role as a catalyst for job creation and environmental sustainability. Through Dr. Tanko, he shared NASENI’s ambitious projects, including Africa’s largest renewable energy industrial park, solar-powered smart irrigation systems, compressed natural gas (CNG) conversion and training centers, solar panel manufacturing plants, electric vehicle (EV) assembly lines, and energy-saving cooking stove production facilities. These initiatives, he emphasized, are not just about technology but about transforming lives.

“Every solar panel we produce, every irrigation system we install, every electric vehicle we assemble is a job created, a family empowered, and a community uplifted,” Dr. Tanko relayed on Halilu’s behalf.

With a projected 1.5 million direct and indirect green jobs, NASENI’s efforts are poised to reshape Nigeria’s economic landscape, particularly for young people and women who represent 60% and 27-37% of the renewable energy workforce, respectively.

NASENI’s projects align with Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP) and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 2030, aiming for 30% renewable energy by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2060.

The establishment of solar panel manufacturing and EV assembly plants is tackling Nigeria’s over-reliance on imported equipment, a critical barrier to the renewable energy sector’s growth. Halilu stressed the need for local manufacturing incentives, warning, “Unless the proposed Nigeria Green Jobs Bill provides incentives to local manufacturers of solar panels, the renewable energy sector of the country won’t develop.”

His call for policy support resonated with attendees, including Hon. Afam Ogene, Chairman of the House Committee on Renewable Energy, who championed the National Inclusive Green Jobs Act (NIGJA) to ensure job quotas for youth and women.

Halilu’s vision extends beyond job creation to long-term sustainability. Through Dr. Tanko, he urged the workshop to develop a robust framework to safeguard renewable energy investments, emphasizing collaboration between government, private sector, and academia. “NASENI is not just building technology; we’re building systems that turn ideas into jobs and dreams into reality,” Tanko said, echoing Halilu’s 3C Strategic Framework of Creation, Collaboration, and Commercialization.

The dialogue highlighted the challenges Nigeria faces, including a 50% skills gap in the renewable energy sector and weak policy support for local manufacturing. Yet, Halilu’s leadership offers hope. By fostering partnerships with international investors from China and Germany and expanding NASENI’s solar manufacturing capacity from 22 to 50 megawatts—with plans to reach 100 megawatts at the end of 2025—he is positioning Nigeria as a renewable energy hub.

Halilu’s bold leadership at NASENI is lighting the way. His commitment to inclusive green jobs is not just a policy—it’s a promise to millions of Nigerians dreaming of a brighter, greener future. With the National Inclusive Green Jobs Act on the horizon and NASENI’s innovative projects gaining momentum, Halilu is proving that Nigeria can lead Africa’s green revolution, one job, one life, one community at a time.",https://dailytrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/NASENI.png,N,,2025-07-26 18:02:54.623703

While today’s show has its fair share of bad news, we’re gonna start with something to make electric motorcycle fans smile — Energica is back from the dead! Or at least, it’s no longer making death-saving throws.

The Italian electric motorcycle maker fell into insolvency late last year under its U.S. owner Ideanomics, leaving fans and customers in limbo. But this week, Energica’s YouTube channel shared some exciting news: a group of Singapore-based investors has made an offer to buy its assets and pull it out of court-ordered bankruptcy. The company says the investors are “enthusiasts that believe in and share the common values of Energica.” There are still hurdles ahead, but the court process is expected to wrap up in about sixty days. Watch this space — after all, every spell has a cast time.

Mercedes-Benz has confirmed it’s halting all EV sales in the U.S. come September 1 — and it’s already closed its U.S. order books.

This week, a spokesperson confirmed no Mercedes-Benz EVs — domestic or imported — will be sold in the U.S. from now on – at least, for now. That includes EQE and EQS models, even though some are built in Alabama. Mercedes will keep building EVs here — it’s just not going to sell them to U.S. customers. While it hasn’t directly blamed the White House, the timing is convenient, as the move aligns with the end of the U.S. Federal Tax Credits for EVs, which, ironically, Mercedes-Benz EVs didn’t even qualify for. Given Benz’s less-than-stellar EV sales lately, it’s not hard to see this as a convenient excuse. But hey, if you still want one, it’s slashing prices by as much as fifteen grand to clear out the last examples.

We love covering renewable energy and grid decarbonization, so when a massive new solar farm gets the green light, it’s worth celebrating.

This week, a six hundred megawatt utility-scale solar farm was greenlit in Texas. Already under construction, it’s expected to cost nine hundred million dollars and produce enough sun-juice to power half a million homes — at least on paper. But don’t be fooled. Canadian oil and gas giant Enbridge owns the facility and confirmed to electrek this week that every watt from the facility will be sold to Meta. Yup, Meta’s server farms — including its AI systems — are gobbling six hundred megawatts… just so Meta can say its green. Remember, big tech isn’t your friend — and while they flex their eco-credentials, everyone else’s grid stays more polluted.

General Motors posted second quarter results this week, beating Wall Street predictions with revenue of forty-seven point one billion dollars but earnings of three point zero four billion — down thirty-five percent year on year.

GM blamed over one billion dollars in lost earnings on President Trump’s tariffs and said it expects the third quarter to be worse. Still, Q2 EV sales jumped one hundred and eleven percent from this time last year, with GM vehicles now making up sixteen percent of all U.S. EV sales. Strong sellers include the GMC Sierra and Hummer EVs, with Cadillac’s lineup making up over a quarter of Cadillac’s sales. As for Chevrolet? The Equinox EV alone saw triple-digit growth, proving strong demand for affordable EVs still exists. With the next-generation Bolt EV coming later this year and future LMR battery tech promising cost savings, GM is painting a rosy picture for its shareholders. We’ll just have to wait and see how it plays out.

As my last story showed, demand for affordable EVs is strong in a market obsessed with adding costly features and complexity.

In the last year, we’ve seen Ford, GM, and Volkswagen already committed to more budget-friendly EVs — and this week, Subaru joined them. Autocar reports Subaru’s global EV product manager saying the company — which has just unveiled the Uncharted EV (a rebadged Toyota C-HR) — is considering a lower-priced model below its newest EV to better compete in Europe’s subcompact segment. We have zero details on what the vehicle could be or what it will offer in terms of specs, but since Subaru currently relies on Toyota for its EVs, any future budget model will likely be Toyota underneath.

As regulars know, I’m a big fan of using EVs for emergency backup power and to help stabilize the grid, reducing reliance on expensive, polluting peaker plants.

This week, a new project launched on the U.S. East Coast aiming to do just that: the first-ever grid reliability program, a joint venture between ChargeScape and PSEG Long Island. For those who don’t know, ChargeScape — jointly owned by BMW, Honda, Ford, and Nissan — uses AI grid analysis to dynamically control EV charging. Under this program, Ford and BMW customers in the PSEG Long Island area can enroll their EVs for grid support via both vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and smart charging.In return, participants will receive various financial incentives.

The Governor of California has just signed two new bills into law that change electric bicycle regulations in the state.

AB 5-4-5 revises existing laws banning modifications that let e-bikes exceed legal speed limits — currently twenty miles per hour for class one and two e-bikes, and twenty-eight miles per hour for class three. The revision adds software hacks to the prohibited list and includes substantial penalties.The other bill, AB 5-4-4, clarifies U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission guidelines on reflectors. It now mandates all e-bikes used in California must have a rear red reflector or flashing rear light visible from five hundred feet (one hundred and fifty-two meters) when illuminated by another vehicle’s headlights. Since most other countries around the world already have rules like this…welcome to the party, California.

The International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) just released a report on global renewable energy costs — and the news is very positive.

Last year, solar power was, on average, forty-one percent cheaper than the cheapest fossil fuel, with onshore wind even cheaper at fifty-three percent. Of the five hundred and eighty-two gigawatts of renewables added to the grid last year, ninety-one percent — about five hundred and twenty-nine point six gigawatts — cost substantially less than any fossil fuel generation commissioned last year. Grid-tied utility-scale battery systems are also ninety-three percent cheaper than fifteen years ago, showing renewables are unstoppable. At least, they are except in the U.S., where President Donald Trump’s Department of Energy is cutting grid investment, cancelling permits, and propping up loss-making fossil fuel plants.

Speaking of the U.S. federal government, we heard troubling news this week about the EPA’s plan to overturn its 2009 finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health.

That finding has guided EPA policy for sixteen years, but the agency is moving forward with efforts to erase it — effectively dismissing the documented impacts of human-driven climate change. Backing this up, a new letter from NHTSA to automakers revealed this week that the government is wiping away all penalties accumulated since 2022 for missing Corporate Average Fuel Economy (or CAFE) targets. This stems from a clause in the recent “One Big Beautiful Bill” that reduces all CAFE fines to zero, while simultaneously cutting incentives and programs aimed at encouraging cleaner vehicles and a move away from fossil fuels.

And after all of that, you might feel like you need some good news, and fam, I’ve got it for you. Not one, but two real-world EVs proving that EVs don’t need a new battery every few years.

Enter a Volkswagen ID.3 Pro S that’s been in the care of the German Automobile Club (or ADAC) for the past four years. It just received its official health check for crossing more than one hundred and sixty thousand kilometers (or one hundred thousand miles), and its battery state of health sits at ninety-one percent — that means it still retains ninety-one percent of its original battery capacity.Meanwhile, a twenty twenty-two Mustang Mach-E, used as a ride-hailing vehicle for more than a quarter million miles in and around Santa Cruz, California, was just given a ninety percent state of health report by one of Ford’s in-house Mustang Mach-E Engineers. So next time someone comes at you with tired FUD about EV batteries not lasting, just tell them about those two EVs!

Our final two stories are coming up next, but first, a quick word from one of today’s sponsors — Energy Sage, who can help those of you in the U.S. green your heating and energy!

Energy Sage connects you with local, verified solar installers across the US — and now heat pump specialists in select markets — who really know their stuff and can help guide you through the process of getting solar panels installed, or getting a heat pump installed. Not a homeowner? No worries. Energy Sage can still help you green your electricity by joining a community solar program!

We used Energy Sage ourselves when looking for installers willing to put solar panels on the roof of our home, and their verified pros were knowledgeable and even introduced us to a great credit union that allowed us to finance the project with low monthly payments.

As I’m sure many of you know, HR1 is now U.S. law, and all incentives for solar — including savings of as much as thirty percent through the federal tax credit program— will disappear very soon. Solar projects take time, so if you want to lock in these savings, it is super important to act now because… time is running out.

Follow the links below to sign up for Energy Sage’s free, no-obligation service and get started today! And if you choose an Energy Sage installer, we’ll receive a small referral fee — so you’ll be helping us too! Help the grid get greener, save money, gain energy independence, and support the show — it’s a win-win-win-win!

And now, it’s time for those last two stories.

For some time, solid-state batteries have been the holy grail of EV packs. They offer greater electrochemical stability than current lithium-ion tech, along with impressive energy and power densities.

Mercedes-Benz is among the automakers betting big on solid-state. This week, Markus Schäfer, the brand’s head of development, spoke with AutomobilWoche about the solid-state battery EQS prototype being tested in collaboration with U.S. company Factorial Energy. Early test results are very promising, and Mercedes says it expects to scale production of solid-state packs by the end of this decade.With potential range improvements of up to twenty-five percent, solid-state tech could unlock longer-range luxury and performance EVs — alongside more affordable smaller models.

And finally,

I don’t know about you, but when I travel for work and need to rent a car, I always worry I’ll get something large and unwieldy.

These days, I usually find an EV option, but it’s often a bigger model—an SUV or pickup—that’s frankly stressful to drive in an unfamiliar city. If you feel the same way, and you a re heading to Zurich or Bern, Switzerland, you’ll be happy to hear that Europcar has signed a deal with local automaker Microlino to add its compact two-seat microcar to it rental fleet. Perfect for zipping around an unfamiliar city, these pint-sized EVs cost CHF 39.90 per day, including unlimited mileage and charging. It’s still a little pricey, but it beats the hundreds of dollars you might pay renting a U.S. car after declining endless waivers at the local rental counter. Good job, Microlino—and good job, Europcar!

And on that note, we are done for today’s show!

If you’d like to support the channel, you can do so for just one dollar and fifty cents a month on Patreon — and if you can, we would really appreciate it. I don’t know if you saw our livestream this week but we – like so many other YouTube channels – are being abused left right, and centre by the platform. Our revenue is dropping and the number of ads being squeezed into our videos is soaring, which itself drives video views away. Add to that an algorithm whose sole purpose is seemingly to make you angry and stay on the platform, and we’re not seeing our videos shared, and we’re not seeing income from those videos. If we can’t make up for that loss in ad revenue that so many of our colleagues are suffering – we, like other channels of late, will have no choice but to… not exist. So we need your support more now than ever. If just four hundred of our one hundred and fifty-two thousand-ish subscribers who have yet signed up to patreon did so and committed to giving the equivalent of a fancy coffee a month in our direction, would put us in a much better financial position.

Don’t forget we’re also available for third-party video production work in the Portland, Oregon area, and you can find our latest merch — including our Pride designs — at the merch store. Links below, and on our website at https://www.transportevolved.com . Also down below, you’ll find an Amazon affiliate link that helps support the channel when you use it.

We publish every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday here — and every Sunday we drop two videos on Transport Evolved Take Two, our informal behind-the-scenes channel.

I just want to thank all of you if you’re watching today and the video has seemed a little jumpy and if there have been strange noises in the background: the Teleprompter has been misbehaving and I’m on my own in the studio today and haven’t had anyone to help fix it – and..err.. the local utility company has been doing construction work outside of the studio all day – and we don’t have soundproof windows. Sorry!

To finish, remember this:

You are valid. You are loved. You belong — no matter what anyone says or tries to convince you. Living your authentic life, or coming from a different place or a different culture is not, as some are claiming, a sin.

Right now, division and hate aren’t just tolerated — they are encouraged by those in power, usually those in power driven by a lust for cruelty. And at this time in historys, kindness and empathy become acts of resistance. Empathy is not weakness — it’s a skill we must nurture and regularly practice to hold onto our shared humanity.

If you need to rest or step back, I also want you to know that’s okay. Take care of yourself. Then, when you’re ready, stand up for decency, community, and justice. Come back, peacefully, together, build connections that celebrate every voice, embrace diversity, and learn from the past to shape a better future.

Whoever you are, wherever you are, whoever you love — you are not alone. Be an ally. Be kind. Be that positive change you want to see in the world. And please — for the sake of everyone’s future — don’t let hate or ignorance win.

As always, keep evolving!",,N,,2025-07-26 19:01:30.031308

The newly introduced Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund is set to provide personalised career advice along with financial support for training.
This will open doors for workers looking to move into emerging fields such as offshore and onshore wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture.
Through funds like the Just Transition Fund and the Energy Transition Fund, the Scottish Government has already committed over £120 million to the North East.

The newly introduced Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund is set to provide personalised career advice along with financial support for training. This will open doors for workers looking to move into emerging fields such as offshore and onshore wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture.

Around 200 individuals in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire are expected to benefit from the programme, which aims to equip them with the skills needed for jobs in the green energy space. The fund was designed through a collaboration between the Scottish Government and the UK Government’s Regional Skills Pilot, a £900,000 scheme explicitly targeted at the region. Delivery will be handled by Skills Development Scotland, with an additional £40,000 contribution coming from the Scottish Government.

This is part of a broader push to support a just transition to net zero. Through funds like the Just Transition Fund and the Energy Transition Fund, the Scottish Government has already committed over £120 million to the North East. These investments are helping to generate green jobs, foster innovation, and ensure the region’s workforce remains at the forefront of energy expertise for years to come.

Cabinet Secretary for Climate Action and Energy Gillian Martin said: “The North East has long been a titan in the oil and gas industry, and the valuable expertise within our workforce must be at the heart of the transition to new fuels and sustainable energy.

“This new Oil and Gas Transition Training Fund will support offshore workers to take on roles in the sustainable energy sector and has been designed and developed by the Scottish Government, supported by funding from the UK Government’s Regional Skills Pilot for Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, and will be delivered by Skills Development Scotland.

“I am determined to ensure a positive impact and powerful legacy of Scotland’s clean energy revolution, which benefits communities across the North East of the country.”

Skills Development Scotland Chair Frank Mitchell said: “Scotland’s oil and gas workforce possesses a broad range of skills and experience, which is vital to the continued growth of the renewable energy sector.

“The shift to sustainable energy generation and transmission represents a generational opportunity, and this funding will assist workers in making the most of their expertise in that growing sector.

“Our careers advisers are available for anyone who needs support in considering their options, or whether applying for the fund is right for them.”

UK Government Minister for Energy Michael Shanks said: “Aberdeen has been the energy capital of Britain for decades, and while oil and gas will be with us for decades to come, we are determined to make sure that workers are supported to access the thousands of jobs in industries such as offshore wind and carbon capture.

“This funding will help deliver a fair and prosperous transition in the North Sea, unlocking the full potential of renewable energy and reaping the economic benefits from the skills and experiences of Aberdeen’s workforce.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/11062b_81edbbc97b4e402bba95354cffac8a99~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1000,h_563,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/11062b_81edbbc97b4e402bba95354cffac8a99~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-26 18:02:58.209279

Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

Albany Times Union

ALBANY — It’s now the public’s turn to weigh in on New York’s energy future, including environmental goals, rising electricity costs and the impending demand of the massive power requirements for artificial intelligence and chip fab plants.

A panel of state officials unanimously agreed Wednesday to release a draft of a 15 year state energy plan for public comment.

The plan was drafted by the State Energy Planning Board. The board’s 14 members include state agency commissioners, the State University of New York chancellor, leaders of the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority and the Public Service Commission, a representative of Con Edison and the head of the New York Independent System Operator, which manages and ensures the reliability of the state’s power grid.

The draft energy plan is not limited to just electricity projections, and also provided recommendations on public health, transportation and a confluence of related sectors.

“Energy systems are central to quality of life and economic growth, but also a grid that is affordable and reliable and clean,” said Doreen M. Harris, the authority’s president and CEO. “When you look at the plan, it is taking an objective look at how to achieve those various outcomes, each of which has significance with respect to the future of our state.”

Comments on the plan were universally positive at Wednesday’s meeting of the state Energy Planning Board, with agency leaders praising different components of the proposal.

“I’m very grateful for the collaboration that went into this effort to ensure that New York continues to stand up for a strong economy, for affordability and, of course, protecting our environment and our communities that rely on it,” said Amanda Lefton, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

Officials also cited the plan as essential to crafting the state’s energy policy in the wake of a measure passed by Republicans in Congress gutting renewable energy tax credits.

“We’re in a federal landscape that’s shifting in previously unimaginable ways, shifts that not only threaten our ability to address climate change and meet our energy needs, but serve to potentially negatively impact the economic wellbeing of the state,” said Rory M. Christian, chair and CEO of the Public Service Commission.

The proposal can be found on the New York Energy Plan website.

There are nine public hearings scheduled on the draft plan in August and September. One of the hearings is scheduled to take place in Albany on Sept. 10. Locations for the hearings haven’t been announced. Members of the public will also be able to submit written testimony until Oct. 6 on the plan’s site.

After the public comment period ends, the panel will vote on an updated plan including public feedback and updated recommendations factoring in the recent Republican spending and tax legislation.",https://waynetimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Smart-meter-image-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 20:03:16.950840

Dr Gosens said China's increasing wind and solar power generation, combined with increasing domestic supplies of coal, created a ""double whammy"" for Australian coal exports.
He said that would tell the world a lot about where the global appetite to reduce emissions was at.","Climate experts say China's carbon emissions may have peaked, which could affect global climate targets, the fight against global warming — and the Australian coal industry.

China is currently the world's biggest emitter, accounting for some 30 per cent of global carbon emissions, but a report by the Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) found that in the year to May 2025, China's CO2 emissions dropped 1.6 per cent.

China policy expert at CREA Belinda Schäpe said the trend had also continued in the months since.

Ms Schäpe told the ABC the finding was ""really unique"" because the only other times the country had recorded a year-on-year decline in CO2 emissions were during times of economic downturn, like the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It's really quite a historic result,"" Ms Schäpe said.

""It's due to a really rapid increase in renewables build-out in China that has translated into an increase in power generation coming from clean sources and driving down the coal share in the power mix, and with that, bringing down emissions.""

She said China led the world in green energy uptake.

""In May [2025] alone, China built out 90 gigawatts of solar capacity, which is really huge. It translates to roughly 100 solar panels per second.

""We are now at a point where solar and wind capacity is actually bigger than all thermal power capacity. So not only coal, but also including gas, oil and other fossil fuel sectors.""

Li Shuo, director of the China climate hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told the ABC he thought that despite previous emissions fluctuations, the country would continue to reduce its carbon output.

""It certainly suggests that after three decades of very rapid economic growth, and also growth in China's emissions, the emission peak point for China has come very close, if it has not happened already,"" Mr Li said.

""We have entered a new phase of China's emissions, a phase that features a stabilisation of China's emissions and increasingly large-scale integration of China's renewable energy power, which, I hope, will actually make the country reduce its emissions from this point on.""

If the world is to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, the amount of emissions released into the atmosphere needs to come down, not stabilise, according to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Climate experts say a failure to limit global warming below that figure will result in catastrophic consequences for people and the planet.

China still building new coal plants

Despite the rapid installation of renewable energy plants across the country, China is still building new coal-fired power plants.

Beijing approved on average two coal-powered projects a week in 2022 and 2023, after power shortages in 2021.

Belinda Schäpe said a backlog of these projects was now coming online, but they were using less coal.

""There's been a significant drop in coal imports … in June, there was a 25 per cent year-on-year drop in coal imports,"" she said.

""In June, China's power demand growth was actually 70 per cent higher than last year this time around, but solar and wind power generation met 89 per cent of that power demand growth.

""That's what we've been seeing over the last six months, really, where renewables, or solar and wind in particular, accounted for 24 per cent of total electricity generation.

'The writing is on the wall'

Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to continue phasing down the country's coal consumption in the next five years, between 2026 and 2030.

Jorrit Gosens, a climate change and energy policy fellow at the Australian National University, said Australia needed to rethink the future of coal mines.

""The writing is on the wall a little bit in the future economic potential of that industry,"" he said.

China imports roughly 30 per cent of Australian thermal coal exports, making it Australia's largest market.

Dr Gosens said China's increasing wind and solar power generation, combined with increasing domestic supplies of coal, created a ""double whammy"" for Australian coal exports.

""It should be expected that those export volumes will continue to decrease over the next few years.""

Other Asian markets of Australian coal, such as South Korea and Japan, would follow suit as they decarbonised, he said.

Dr Gosens pointed to the Mt Arthur coal mine in NSW, for which BHP could not find a buyer because of the shrinking demand of coal and its liabilities, like rehabilitation costs.

He said local community leaders and the federal government needed to transition communities historically reliant on coal mines into other industries.

""Currently, we're still seeing more resistance to change than embracing of that transition, which I think is a risky strategy given the demand for our product is not going to be determined by those local communities or by the federal government,"" he said.

""Our best bet really is to make sure that there are viable alternatives for when it does get to that point.""

Trump's America 'decoupling' from China on climate

US President Donald Trump's policy agenda has seen green energy subsidies replaced with coal subsidies.

Li Shou said it was clear that the two countries were now on different paths.

He said some conservative forces within China may use the US's withdrawal from clean energy as motivation ""for domestic inaction"", but he was confident that it would not change the country's policy direction.

""China has over the last decade or so become the superpower when it comes to wind technology — deploying and manufacturing wind, solar batteries and electric vehicles,"" he said.

""This will not change because of what is happening or not happening in the US and if anything, Beijing will just continue with this green path because doing these things is ultimately in the country's long-term economic interest.

""There has been a realisation on the Chinese side that they should continue and double down on their climate and environmental agenda, not because of the global situation and the US situation, but just for their own sake, to clean up the skies in major Chinese cities.""

China is set to announce its new climate reduction targets as part of the Paris agreement later this year.

He said that would tell the world a lot about where the global appetite to reduce emissions was at.

""Whether China chooses to coordinate with some of the other geopolitical powers will also tell us a lot about where the global climate agenda stands and to what extent countries, including China and Australia and the European Union, can still engage,"" Mr Li said.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5bbcc310c8edfb8762b131d62dfeaf94?impolicy=wcms_watermark_news&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=316&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-07-26 17:01:28.961977

Enbridge Inc. has made a significant move in the renewable energy sector by reaching a final investment decision on the Clear Fork solar project in Texas. The 600-megawatt (MW) solar facility, located near San Antonio, will be supplied entirely by Meta Platforms, Inc., which has signed a long-term contract for 100% of the renewable output. The project is expected to enter service in the summer of 2027, with an estimated cost of $900 million.

Enbridge's Executive Vice President Matthew Akman highlighted the growing demand for renewable power from blue-chip companies, stating, ""Clear Fork demonstrates the growing demand for renewable power across North America from blue-chip companies who are involved in technology and data center operations"" [1]. The project is anticipated to be accretive to Enbridge's cash flow and earnings per share starting in 2027.

Meta, known for its platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is committed to sustainability and has been a significant corporate purchaser of renewable energy. The company has previously stated that it aims to reach net-zero emissions across its operational portfolio by 2020, primarily through matching 100% of its data center usage with renewable energy [2]. The Clear Fork solar plant is part of Meta's ongoing efforts to support its operations with clean energy.

The project's timeline aligns with the provisions of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which requires wind and solar projects to be placed in service by 2027 to qualify for the altered investment tax credit. This has prompted utility companies to accelerate their renewable energy projects to ensure they meet the new criteria [3].

Enbridge's investment in Clear Fork is part of its broader strategy to expand its renewable energy portfolio. The company's commitment to Indigenous partnerships is also evident, as seen in the recent acquisition by Stonlasec8 Indigenous Alliance Limited, representing 38 Indigenous communities in British Columbia, of a 12.5% ownership interest in Enbridge’s Westcoast natural gas pipeline system [1].

The milestone underscores India’s rapid transition toward a cleaner and more sustainable power mix.

Solar Energy Achieves Unprecedented Scale

Solar energy led the surge, with capacity climbing an extraordinary 4,000%, from 2.82 GW to 117 GW by 2025. Tariff reductions have been equally striking, plunging by 80%, from ₹10.95/unit in 2010–11 to ₹2.15/unit today. Solar-plus-battery systems have now become cheaper than thermal energy, making clean power a more economical choice for industries and consumers alike.

Wind Power Posts Strong Gains

Wind energy also posted significant growth, with installed capacity rising by 140%, from 21 GW to 51.7 GW. The momentum strengthens India’s position as one of the fastest-growing wind energy markets globally.

Investment Momentum Accelerates

Renewables attracted the lion’s share of power sector funding, with 83% of 2024 investments channeled into clean energy. India secured $2.4 billion in global energy development finance in a single year. Foreign direct investment (FDI) since 2020 has topped ₹1.6 lakh crore, including ₹42,000 crore in 2023 alone. In Q1 2025, clean energy investment surged 7.7 times year-on-year, reaching $9.8 billion.

Wind Energy in Europe Europe leads in wind power.
Low Cost: Onshore wind now costs less than $50 per MWh on average.","A life cycle assessment tracks every stage of a turbine’s life. It starts when raw materials are mined. Then factories shape steel, fiberglass, and plastic. Next, ships and trucks carry parts to the site. Builders use cranes and machinery to install towers and blades. Crews maintain turbines for decades. Finally, old parts are recycled or sent to disposal. Each stage adds carbon emissions.

Mining: Iron ore, copper, and other metals.

Manufacturing: Factories use energy to mold blades and towers.

Transport: Trucks and ships burn fuel.

Construction: Cranes and machines work on site.

Maintenance: Technicians use tools and vehicles.

End of Life: Recycling or disposal of parts.

Most studies find turbines emit 5–26 grams of CO₂‑equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO₂‑eq/kWh). That is a small amount compared to fossil fuels. Larger turbines often score lower because they spread emissions over more clean power.

Location Type Size (MW) gCO₂‑eq/kWh USA (Texas) Onshore 2.0 4.9 UK Onshore 1.5 11.8 China Offshore 3.6 25.5 Europe Offshore 6.0 7.8 Global Avg. Onshore 2.0 8.0

Carbon Payback Time

Payback time is how long a turbine takes to make as much clean energy as the emissions it caused. Most turbines repay their carbon debt in just 6–12 months. After that, every kilowatt-hour is almost free of carbon cost. That is key because turbines last two to three decades. So most of their life brings only clean power.

Fast payback helps grid operators plan for quick climate gains. New wind farms can cut the need for old, polluting coal plants. This switch makes grids cleaner right away.

Comparison with Fossil Fuels

Fossil fuel plants burn coal or gas every hour. They release carbon at high rates. Wind turbines only emit during their build and transport. Once spinning, they add near-zero carbon. The gap is huge.

Energy Source gCO₂‑eq/kWh Wind (Onshore) 5–26 Natural Gas 437–758 Coal 675–1,689

Each new wind farm slashes more carbon than any new coal or gas plant could. That is why many countries boost wind capacity first.

Wind Energy in Europe

Europe leads in wind power. In 2024, renewables made up 47% of EU electricity. Wind alone was 17%. Solar and wind together reached 29%. Coal dropped below 10%. These changes cut EU power emissions by 24% in 2023. They also saved over $60 billion in fuel costs.

Renewable share: 47% in 2024

Wind share: 17% in 2024

Emissions drop: 24% in 2023

Jobs: 400,000 in wind sector

EU programs like the Green Deal and Net-Zero Industry Act support growth. Many major turbine makers are based in Europe. That helps local jobs and exports.

Five Key Facts

Green Design: Turbines spin with wind, not fuel.

They use no water once built.

Over 85% of parts can be recycled.

Low Cost: Onshore wind now costs less than $50 per MWh on average.

Gas plants cost $60–76 per MWh.

Coal can exceed $100 per MWh.

Wildlife Safe: Wind farms cause under 0.1% of bird deaths.

Fossil plants kill 30 times more birds per GWh.

Offshore turbines have little impact on whales.

Quiet and Clean: At 300 m, turbines sound like a fridge.

No soot or smoke is released.

No link to sleep problems has been found.

Small Land Use: Each turbine needs 0.46 hectares.

That is less than a soccer field.

Farmers can still grow crops below.

Clean Energy Transition and Grid Resilience PGE's clean energy investments are not just about compliance—they're a competitive differentiator.
The clean energy transition is no longer a distant horizon—it's a present reality.","The Pacific Northwest is undergoing a seismic shift in its energy landscape, driven by surging industrial demand, regulatory tailwinds, and the urgent need for decarbonization. Amid this transformation, Portland General Electric (PGE) has emerged as a standout player, leveraging strategic investments, regulatory agility, and technological innovation to outperform peers and position itself as a leader in the clean energy transition.

Earnings Outperformance and Industrial Load Growth

PGE's Q2 2025 results underscored its ability to navigate a complex market environment. The company reported non-GAAP net income of $73 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, reaffirming its 2025 guidance of $3.13–$3.33 per share. While GAAP net income dipped slightly from $72 million in Q2 2024, the decline was offset by robust industrial load growth. Demand from semiconductor manufacturing and data centers—driven by the energy needs of AI infrastructure—surged 16.5% quarter-over-quarter. This growth reflects PGE's successful alignment with the region's tech-driven economy, where companies like Intel and Amazon are reshaping energy consumption patterns.

The company's ability to monetize this demand is bolstered by its aggressive clean energy investments. PGE's 500 MW battery storage portfolio, including the Seaside Battery Project, is critical for balancing the intermittency of renewables while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. By 2025, these projects will position PGE to meet its 80% emissions reduction target by 2030—a timeline that outpaces many regional peers.

Regulatory Clarity and Strategic Reorganization

PGE's regulatory strategy is a cornerstone of its competitive advantage. In July 2025, the company secured approval for a holding company reorganization from the Oregon Public Utilities Commission (OPUC). This structural shift is designed to streamline capital allocation, accelerate infrastructure projects, and enhance financial flexibility. By centralizing decision-making, PGE can respond more swiftly to the demands of grid modernization and the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs).

The reorganization also aligns with broader industry trends. As noted in PGE's filings, holding companies are becoming a preferred model for utilities seeking to manage the capital intensity of clean energy transitions. For example, Idaho Power, a regional competitor, has similarly pursued rate base growth through transmission infrastructure projects like the Boardman to Hemingway line. However, PGE's regulatory approach is more aggressive in leveraging federal tax credits, particularly under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), to minimize customer costs. Its Seaside Battery and Distribution System Plan (DSP) cost recovery requests—approved for $46 million and $72 million annually—demonstrate a disciplined focus on affordability while securing necessary capital.

Clean Energy Transition and Grid Resilience

PGE's clean energy investments are not just about compliance—they're a competitive differentiator. The company's 2024 ESG report highlights that 45% of its energy mix already comes from non-emitting sources, a 7% annual growth rate since 2020. This progress is supported by a $1.265 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, with $135 million allocated to wildfire mitigation and vegetation management. These investments are critical in a region where climate risks are escalating, and regulatory scrutiny over liability is intensifying.

In contrast, regional peers like Idaho Power are still in the early stages of integrating DERs into their long-term plans. Idaho Power's 2025 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) emphasizes hydropower as a core asset, with supplementary investments in transmission and battery storage. While this approach prioritizes cost stability, it lacks the urgency and scale of PGE's renewable integration. The latter's AI-driven tools for load forecasting and predictive maintenance further enhance operational efficiency, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

Comparative Advantages and Investment Implications

PGE's strategic positioning is evident in its ability to balance growth, affordability, and sustainability. Its dividend yield of ~3.2%—maintained despite reinvestment in infrastructure—signals confidence in its financial resilience. The company's five-year debt-to-equity ratio of ~1.0x and $1 billion in liquidity provide a buffer against rising interest rates and commodity volatility, which are pressing concerns for less capitalized peers.

Investors should also consider PGE's historical performance. From 2022 to 2025, the stock has shown a 63.64% win rate in three-day returns and 81.82% in 30-day returns post-earnings reports. Analysts project a one-year price target of $45.81, reflecting a 14.27% upside from its current $40.09 level. This optimism is justified by PGE's alignment with regulatory trends, its proactive approach to decarbonization, and its ability to capture value from industrial load growth.

Conclusion: A Model for the Future

As the Pacific Northwest grapples with the dual challenges of decarbonization and industrial electrification, PGE's strategic clarity and execution provide a roadmap for success. Its regulatory agility, clean energy investments, and focus on grid resilience position it to outperform peers while delivering consistent returns to shareholders. For investors seeking exposure to a utility that balances environmental stewardship with financial discipline, PGE represents a compelling long-term opportunity.

“There’s nothing more devastating than having an investor or an employer say, ‘You know, we really want to build that factory or that data center and bring those jobs to your city, but we’re just not sure we’re going to be able to have the power we need by the time we need it to do it,’” Mayor Matt Mahan said Friday morning at a press conference outside the gates of PG&E’s Los Esteros substation near North San José.

In an interview with KQED, Mahan said the deal will allow the city and PG&E to offer “speed and certainty” to developers to help ensure data centers stay in Silicon Valley, keeping them as paying PG&E customers and contributors to San José’s tax base.

City officials estimate each data center could generate anywhere from $3.4 million to $6.8 million in annual revenue for the city through utility and property taxes.

“What we’re really talking about here is re-engineering our service delivery model to integrate the city and the utility’s teams into one,” Mahan said. “We can actually sign an agreement that says we’ll have 100 megawatts for you at this site by this date, and we will get it done and deliver.”

The agreement hopes to take advantage of and build on 2,000 megawatts of increased power capacity, expected to be provided by two different transmission line projects from developer LS Power Grid.

The lines would run from Newark into North San José energy centers, and from a Coyote Valley terminal in South San José, to the PG&E Metcalf substation and into downtown.

Officials said PG&E will also be investing $2.6 billion into improving and expanding its infrastructure in the South Bay between 2026 and 2035, to enable more reliable delivery of that increased power to customers, large and small.

Patti Poppe, CEO of PG&E, said the historic partnership is about accountability.

“We have agreed to timelines and performance requirements that the city had for us. We’re up for that. PG&E is willing to stand behind our word and do what needs to be done to serve this new growth,” Poppe said in an interview.

“Having expectations and accountability matched with this massive new demand makes it an absolutely unique opportunity to power the prosperity of tech companies, their employees, the citizens of San José and our community right here.”

One of the major projects includes an envisioned large-scale development on roughly 159 acres of public land on the property of the San José-Santa Clara Regional Wastewater Facility, adjacent to Los Esteros. The facility is jointly owned by the two cities.

The utility company has committed to supplying that land with 250 megawatts of power, enough to power multiple data centers, which are often sized to use about 99 megawatts to avoid stricter oversight for projects that use 100 megawatts or more.

Manuel Pineda, a deputy city manager for San José overseeing energy projects, said having an undeveloped piece of land so large, and pairing it with an energy commitment of that magnitude, is “unheard of.”

Pineda recently rejoined San José after running Silicon Valley Power, the city-owned utility in Santa Clara, which has seen massive growth in data centers over the past several years. This demand — Santa Clara’s more than 50 data centers have eaten through about 60% of the city’s power — has forced the city to approve projects to increase capacity. Earlier this year, the city announced a 5% increase in rates for its customers.

San José is home to about 25 data centers at the moment, city officials said.

Some residents of the region have raised concerns about data centers popping up near their neighborhoods with little transparency around the potential impacts, which may include harm to their community’s air quality, due to the massive diesel backup generators that often support data centers during power outages.

Mahan and Pineda emphasized that San José’s large layout means many data centers can be located in highly industrialized areas, like the fields abutting wastewater plants and energy facilities in the city’s Alviso district.

The city’s planning commission in April approved Microsoft’s plans to build two data center buildings across a 64.5-acre site at 1657 Alviso-Milpitas Rd., just east of Los Esteros.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/07/250725-SJPOWER-JG-1_qed.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 19:02:17.914987

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables.
And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.","President Donald Trump’s plan to boost artificial intelligence and build data centers across the U.S. could speed up a building boom that was already expected to strain the nation’s ability to power it.

The White House released the “AI Action Plan” Wednesday, vowing to expedite permitting for construction of energy-intensive data centers as it looks to make the country a leader in a business that tech companies and others are pouring billions of dollars into.

The plan says to combat “radical climate dogma,” a number of restrictions — including clean air and water laws — could be lifted, aligning with Trump’s “American energy dominance” agenda and his efforts to undercut clean energy.

Here’s what you need to know.

What AI means for the environment

Massive amounts of electricity are needed to support the complex servers, equipment and more for AI. Electricity demand from data centers worldwide is set to more than double by 2030, to slightly more than the entire electricity consumption of Japan today, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.

In many cases, that electricity may come from burning coal or natural gas. These fossil fuels emit planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane. This in turn is tied to extreme weather events that are becoming more severe, frequent and costly.

The data centers used to fuel AI also need a tremendous amount of water to keep cool. That means they can strain water sources in areas that may have little to spare.

What Big Tech is saying and doing about finding all that power

Typically, tech giants, up-and-comers and other developers try to keep an existing power plant online to meet demand, experts say, and most existing power plants in the U.S. are still producing electricity using fossil fuels — most often natural gas.

In certain areas of the U.S., a combination of renewables and energy storage in the form of batteries are coming online.

But tapping into nuclear power is especially of interest as a way to reduce data center-induced emissions while still meeting demand and staying competitive.

Amazon said last month it would spend $20 billion on data center sites in Pennsylvania, including one alongside a nuclear power plant. The investment allows Amazon to plug right into the plant, a scrutinized but faster approach for the company’s development timeline.

Meta recently signed a deal to secure nuclear power to meet its computing needs. Microsoft plans to buy energy from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, and Google previously signed a contract to purchase it from multiple small modular reactors in the works.

What’s at stake in the kind of energy that powers data centers

Data centers are often built where electricity is cheapest, and often, that’s not from renewables. And sometimes data centers are cited as a reason to extend the lives of traditional, fossil-fuel-burning power plants.

But just this week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres called on the world’s largest tech players to fuel their data center needs entirely with renewables by 2030. It’s necessary to use fewer fossil fuels, he said.

Experts say it’s possible for developers, investors and the tech industry to decarbonize.

However, though industry can do a lot with clean energy, the emerging demands are so big that it can’t be clean energy alone, said University of Pennsylvania engineering professor Benjamin Lee.

More generative AI, ChatGPT and massive data centers means “relying on wind and solar alone with batteries becomes really, really expensive,” Lee added, hence the attention on natural gas, but also nuclear.

What does AI growth mean for my electricity bills?

Regardless of what powers AI, the simple law of supply and demand makes it all but certain that costs for consumers will rise.

New data center projects might require both new energy generation and existing generation. Developers might also invest in batteries or other infrastructure like transmission lines.

All of this costs money, and it needs to be paid for from somewhere.

“In a lot of places in the U.S., they are seeing that rates are going up because utilities are making these moves to try to plan,” said Amanda Smith, a senior scientist at research organization Project Drawdown.

“They’re planning transmission infrastructure, new power plants for the growth and the load that’s projected, which is what we want them to do,” she added. “But we as ratepayers will wind up seeing rates go up to cover that.”",https://www.columbian.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump_AI_Energy_Explainer_34331-a8d00.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 20:02:25.217023

However, LGES said it expected to improve profits in the second half by boosting production of batteries for energy storage systems (ESS) to offset the sluggish EV demand, while cutting or delaying investment plans.

LGES is one of the few U.S. producers of LFP batteries, a battery chemistry long dominated by Chinese rivals.

The company said it is considering converting some EV battery production lines in the United States to cater to ESS in response to slowing EV demand.

It started production of LFP batteries at its Michigan factory in May, and aims to increase production capacity of ESS batteries to over 30 gigawatt hours (GWh) by next year, up a projected 17 GWh this year.

""When LGES operates the plant at full capacity, it could generate subsidies for nearly 2 trillion won ($1.5 billion US) ... unlike EV batteries, ESS involves selling full systems rather than just battery cells, which drives up average selling prices and margins,"" said Kang Dong-jin, an analyst at Hyundai Motor Securities.

Kang added that LGES currently stands as the only player in the U.S. market capable of supplying LFP-based ESS, giving it an advantage with virtually no competition.

LGES said its operating profit more than doubled in the second quarter, thanks to U.S. subsidies on battery production and stockpiling by some customers there ahead of potential tariffs.

It reported an operating profit of 492 billion won ($358.73 million US) for the April to June period, versus a profit of 195 billion won a year earlier.

In late 2021 and early 2022 a significant number of small UK energy suppliers went out of business due to the dramatic rise in wholesale gas prices.
Chang said he understood it might take time for Fuse to gain the trust of consumers who were scarred by the failure of smaller energy providers, including Bulb, which was sold to Octopus Energy in 2022 after its collapse the previous year.
“[But] trust and brand is something we’ve got to build over time, and I think the best way to build a good brand and build trust is if we actually are good, rather than just looking good.”","“We have a forecast of how much demand our customers are going to have [for our electricity], we have a forecast of how much we’re going to produce and then we buy the difference,” said Chang, who was employee number three at Revolut, Europe’s most valuable private tech company.

He said the plan was to build Fuse’s solar-generation capacity to one gigawatt, but bureaucratic planning regulations were hindering construction. “The whole process takes two years but actual construction is only three months; it’s super fast. It’s all the waiting, the bureaucracy and red tape that causes the majority of delays. We want to build as fast as we can.”

Chang said he remained hopeful that the government would deliver on its promises for planning reform, but admitted he was disappointed by the slow progress through parliament of its planning and infrastructure bill. “They’ve identified the right problem but for some reason they have not pulled through.”

Fuse was the first big challenger to launch in the sector since energy prices surged in the autumn of 2021 and through 2022, driven by a combination of increased demand after the pandemic, limited gas supply and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

In late 2021 and early 2022 a significant number of small UK energy suppliers went out of business due to the dramatic rise in wholesale gas prices. The increases made it unsustainable for some suppliers to continue offering the fixed-rate tariffs they had previously advertised, and at least 28 energy companies collapsed, affecting more than four million customers who were moved to new suppliers by the energy regulator Ofgem.

Chang said he understood it might take time for Fuse to gain the trust of consumers who were scarred by the failure of smaller energy providers, including Bulb, which was sold to Octopus Energy in 2022 after its collapse the previous year.

Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

Grid Modernization: Prioritize companies with robust renewable integration plans and digital infrastructure, like Terna.
Renewable Storage: Allocate capital to battery storage and pumped hydro projects, particularly in regions with high solar exposure.
As temperatures continue to rise, energy infrastructure must evolve to meet surging demand and avoid catastrophic outages.
Grid modernization, renewable expansion, and innovative storage solutions are not just climate imperatives—they are the bedrock of a resilient, profitable energy future.","As global temperatures climb to record levels, energy systems are being tested like never before. The 2025 European heatwave, which pushed temperatures past 40°C in multiple regions, exposed the fragility of aging power grids. Electricity demand surged by 14% in countries like Spain, while Germany saw prices spike by 175% in a single day. These events underscore a critical truth: without modernization and strategic investment, heatwave-driven demand risks will destabilize energy markets and strain economies.

The Grid Modernization Imperative

Italy's Terna offers a blueprint for resilience. The country's transmission system operator has committed €17.7 billion over five years and €23 billion by 2040 to upgrade infrastructure. These investments aim to connect 107 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 and expand cross-border exchange to 39 GW. Terna's focus on AI-driven predictive systems, IoT sensors, and Digital Twins exemplifies how digitalization can optimize grid operations. By 2030, the company also plans to launch the Mechanism for the Procurement of Electrical Storage Capacity (MACSE), targeting 71.5 GWh of storage to address renewable intermittency.

For investors, Terna's alignment with the EU's green taxonomy—99% of its projects qualify for green financing—positions it as a low-risk, high-impact player in the energy transition. However, risks such as project delays or regulatory shifts must be monitored.

Solar and Storage: Europe's Lifeline in the 2025 Heatwave

During the 2025 heatwave, EU solar generation hit a record 45 TWh in June, mitigating daytime demand surges. Germany's solar fleet provided 33–39% of its electricity during peak hours, supported by 14 GW of battery storage. This highlights a dual strategy: scaling renewables while deploying storage to manage evening peaks.

Battery storage is no longer a niche asset. During the heatwave, price spreads exceeded 400 €/MWh, creating arbitrage opportunities for storage operators. The U.S. has seen similar dynamics, with coal and gas generation temporarily rising by 1.4% to meet cooling demand in 2024. Clean flexibility—via storage, interconnection, and demand-side management—is key to avoiding blackouts.

Innovation in Grid Resilience

The UK's Distributed ReStart project demonstrates how grid-forming inverters can restart the grid post-blackout using renewables. These inverters, capable of operating without external voltage, are critical for creating “energy islands” that stabilize systems during crises. Meanwhile, Poland's Transmission System Operator (PSE) is pushing for real-time data access from distributed energy sources and dynamic tariffs to manage load.

System services markets, such as inertia and voltage control markets in the UK and Germany, are accelerating the adoption of these technologies. Investors should watch companies like Siemens Energy and ABB, which supply grid-forming inverters and smart grid solutions.

The Investment Case

The data is clear: heatwave-driven demand will grow by 5.2%–20.3% by 2050 under current climate scenarios. To mitigate this, three investment themes stand out:

1. Grid Modernization: Prioritize companies with robust renewable integration plans and digital infrastructure, like Terna.

2. Renewable Storage: Allocate capital to battery storage and pumped hydro projects, particularly in regions with high solar exposure.

3. Interconnection Solutions: Support cross-border transmission projects, which help balance supply and demand across regions.

The EU's 2030 target of 60% renewable electricity and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for storage further validate this strategy. However, investors must also consider geographic diversification to hedge against regional climate risks.

Conclusion

The 2025 heatwave was a wake-up call. As temperatures continue to rise, energy infrastructure must evolve to meet surging demand and avoid catastrophic outages. Grid modernization, renewable expansion, and innovative storage solutions are not just climate imperatives—they are the bedrock of a resilient, profitable energy future.

For investors, the message is clear: prioritize companies and projects that align with grid resilience and climate adaptation.","The recent Dominion Energy outage in West Ashley, South Carolina, serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of aging power grids in the face of climate-driven disruptions. On Thursday, July 10, 2025, a single tree falling on overhead power lines caused a cascading outage affecting 1,641 customers, darkened traffic signals, and forced emergency crews to scramble. While Dominion restored power within two hours, the incident underscores a broader crisis: the U.S. electrical grid is increasingly vulnerable to both natural and technological shocks, from extreme weather to surging demand from data centers and AI infrastructure.

This vulnerability is not isolated to Charleston. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) has flagged a growing risk from “near-miss” events, including sudden disconnections by data centers during voltage fluctuations and transformer failures in Texas. These disruptions highlight a critical inflection point: as climate change intensifies and digital infrastructure expands, grid modernization is no longer a luxury—it's a necessity. For investors, this creates a unique opportunity to capitalize on utilities and infrastructure bonds positioned to lead the transition to resilient, climate-adapted energy systems.

The Grid Modernization Gold Rush

Federal and state governments are accelerating investments to fortify the grid. The U.S. Department of Energy's Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnerships (GRIP) Program has already allocated $7.6 billion in 2025 for projects like underground power lines, battery storage, and microgrids. Meanwhile, California's Proposition 4 climate bond—a $10 billion initiative—dedicates $1.2 billion to coastal resilience and $325 million to transmission infrastructure, prioritizing projects that reduce wildfire risks and integrate renewable energy.

These programs are reshaping the energy landscape. For example, Dominion Energy's $2.5 billion Strategic Underground Program in Virginia has reduced storm-related outages by 40%, demonstrating the ROI of grid hardening. Similarly, Southern Spirit Transmission's $360 million HVDC line between Texas and the Southeast will enhance reliability during peak demand. Investors who recognize these trends early stand to benefit from a $500 billion grid modernization boom.

Undervalued Utilities: The New Energy Titans

Several utilities are emerging as key players in this transition.

Eversource Energy (ESV)

Why Invest? Eversource is a regional leader in grid resilience, with a $1.2 billion modernization budget in New England. Its demand response programs have already cut 44,000 kg of CO₂ emissions during peak periods, and its forward P/E of 22.13 and 3.19% dividend yield make it a compelling value play.

NextEra Energy (NEE)

Why Invest? With a $153 billion market cap, NextEra is pioneering offshore wind and solar integration. Its $15 billion debt issuance for undergrounding 1,230 miles of high-risk lines aligns with regulatory mandates, while its P/E of 27.99 reflects growth potential.

Avangrid (AGR)

Why Invest? A subsidiary of Iberdrola, Avangrid is investing $20 billion in grid modernization by 2030, including 16% year-over-year supplier investment growth. At a P/E of 24.8 and 3.5% yield, it's undervalued relative to its clean energy pipeline.

ConEdison (CONED)

Why Invest? ConEd's $100 million AI-focused investments, including tools like AiDASH for infrastructure monitoring, position it as a leader in data-driven grid resilience. Its 4.65% dividend yield and P/E of 21.33 make it a blue-chip staple.

Infrastructure Bonds: A Stable, Long-Term Play

For investors seeking fixed-income exposure, infrastructure bonds tied to grid modernization offer attractive yields and alignment with climate goals. California's Proposition 4 bond, for instance, allocates $850 million to clean energy projects and $325 million to transmission upgrades, with a 40% allocation to disadvantaged communities. Similarly, the U.S. Climate Alliance's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) is financing microgrids and battery storage in states like New York and Washington.

These bonds are particularly appealing due to their low volatility and long-duration cash flows. For example, Proposition 4's $10 billion spending plan spans through 2039–40, providing a predictable funding stream for grantees and bondholders alike.

The Case for Smart Grid ETFs

For diversified exposure, ETFs like the Fidelity MSCI Energy Infrastructure ETF (FENY) offer broad access to the sector. FENY has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past year, driven by electrification and AI-driven demand for energy. Niche ETFs targeting smart grid technologies—such as those focusing on Siemens Energy's 5G-enabled meters or Enphase Energy's IQ Energy Management System—also provide high-growth opportunities, albeit with higher volatility.

The Bottom Line: Buy Resilience, Not Risk

The Dominion Energy outage in West Ashley is a microcosm of a systemic challenge: aging grids, surging demand, and climate-driven volatility. Yet, this crisis is also an opportunity. Utilities like Eversource, NextEra, and ConEd are leading the charge in modernization, while infrastructure bonds and ETFs offer stable, scalable ways to participate in the transition.

For investors, the message is clear: prioritize companies and projects that align with grid resilience and climate adaptation. As AI and data centers drive energy demand higher, the winners will be those who build the infrastructure to support them—without breaking the grid.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 17:02:48.725809

Tesla reported a 12% year-over-year decrease in total revenue to $22.49 billion in the second quarter of 2025, according to its earnings report released on July 23, 2025. The company's automotive revenue fell by 16% year-over-year to $16.6 billion, and net income attributable to common stockholders decreased by 16% to $1.17 billion [1].

Several factors contributed to the revenue decline. Vehicle deliveries dropped by 14% year-over-year to 384,000 units in the second quarter, with significant declines in Europe. Regulatory credit revenue, which accounted for $439 million, fell by 51% compared to the same period last year [1].

Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, warned shareholders that the company could face ""a few rough quarters"" ahead due to the expiration of U.S. electric vehicle (EV) tax credits at the end of September and rising tariff pressures [1]. The ""big beautiful bill"" recently passed by Congress is expected to impact Tesla's business, potentially leading to shortages in the U.S. inventory [2].

Tesla's shares dipped by more than 4% after hours following the earnings call, and the stock was down about 18% for the year as of Wednesday's close, making it the worst performance among tech's megacaps [1]. The Nasdaq was up about 9% in 2025.

Musk has emphasized the company's long-term potential, particularly in the areas of AI, robotics, and autonomous technology. Tesla aims to start domestic production of its first lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) cells for energy storage products in 2025 and anticipates the launch of new vehicles, including a more affordable model, in the first half of the year [1].

Despite the challenges, Musk remains optimistic about Tesla's future, stating that the company is ""technically able"" to achieve its goal of having autonomous ride-hailing available to about half the U.S. population by the end of this year, subject to regulatory approvals [1].

Conclusion: A Balancing Act with Strong Fundamentals AEP's Q2 earnings outlook reflects the dual pressures of demand growth and operational costs in the utility sector.","American Electric Power (AEP) stands at a critical juncture in its Q2 2025 earnings report, as the company navigates a complex interplay of sector-specific drivers and operational challenges. With a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 per share (a 7.2% year-over-year decline) and revenue guidance of $4.76 billion (a 3.9% YoY increase), AEP's performance will hinge on its ability to balance robust demand growth with cost pressures from infrastructure restoration and adverse weather. For investors, understanding these dynamics is key to assessing the utility's near-term resilience and long-term strategic positioning.

Sector-Specific Drivers: Demand Growth and Rate Revisions

AEP's revenue trajectory is being propelled by several structural and cyclical factors. Warmer-than-normal weather in most of its service territories has spurred a surge in cooling demand, a predictable seasonal tailwind for utilities. This is compounded by industrial load growth, particularly in energy-intensive sectors such as data centers and manufacturing, which are reshaping the energy landscape. For instance, AEP's 12.3% commercial load growth in Q1 2025—driven by 500+ customers requesting to connect nearly 80 gigawatts of new load—highlights the company's role in powering the digital and industrial economy.

Favorable rate revisions from prior quarters also provide a buffer. Regulatory approvals for rate increases, coupled with tariff modifications to accommodate large-load growth, have allowed AEP to pass through costs to customers while maintaining profitability. These adjustments are critical in a sector where capital-intensive investments in grid modernization and renewable integration require sustained revenue streams.

Earnings Pressure: Weather Disruptions and Cost Inflation

Despite these positives, AEP faces headwinds that could temper earnings. Adverse weather events—such as heavy rainfall, floods, and tornadoes—disrupted operations in parts of its 11-state footprint, leading to outages and infrastructure damage. The resulting restoration costs and elevated operating and maintenance (O&M) expenses are expected to weigh on margins. For example, AEP's Q1 2025 operating expenses rose 4.5% YoY, driven by emergency response efforts and accelerated grid hardening projects.

Moreover, the utility's capital expenditures are rising in tandem with its $54 billion, five-year investment plan. While these investments are necessary to support the 9% retail load growth projected for 2025, they also strain short-term profitability. AEP's FFO-to-debt ratio, while strong at 14.2%, will face scrutiny as the company allocates resources to balance infrastructure resilience with shareholder returns.

Strategic Resilience: AEP's Long-Term Positioning

AEP's ability to navigate these challenges hinges on its strategic resilience. The company's disciplined capital management—evidenced by a $2.3 billion forward equity offering and a minority interest transaction—has fortified its balance sheet, ensuring it remains well-positioned to fund growth without overleveraging. Additionally, AEP's focus on regulatory engagement has yielded favorable outcomes in key rate cases, such as its recent Ohio and Indiana regulatory filings, which could unlock incremental earnings in 2026.

The Zacks model underscores this resilience, predicting an earnings beat with a +10.63% Earnings Surprise Predictor (ESP) and a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold). Historical data further supports this optimism: AEP has exceeded consensus estimates in three of the past four quarters, including a 10.79% beat in Q1 2025. This track record suggests the company's operational efficiency and cost controls may offset near-term pressures.

Investment Implications and Risk Considerations

For investors, AEP's Q2 earnings report presents a nuanced opportunity. The company's attractive dividend yield (3.5%) and low beta of 0.44 make it a defensive play in a volatile market. However, the risk-reward profile depends on how well AEP manages its capital allocation and regulatory timelines. Key watchpoints include:

1. Weather normalization: Will the frequency of extreme weather events moderate in 2025, or does AEP need to accelerate grid hardening costs?

2. Regulatory momentum: Can AEP secure timely approvals for rate cases and renewable integration projects to sustain its 6-8% long-term earnings growth target?

3. Sector dynamics: How will data center demand and industrial load growth evolve in a potential economic slowdown?

Conclusion: A Balancing Act with Strong Fundamentals

AEP's Q2 earnings outlook reflects the dual pressures of demand growth and operational costs in the utility sector. While the 7.2% EPS decline is concerning, the company's strategic focus on infrastructure investment, regulatory alignment, and cost discipline positions it to outperform expectations. For investors seeking exposure to a utility with strong cash flow visibility and long-term growth catalysts, AEP offers a compelling case—provided it continues to execute its capital and regulatory strategies effectively.

As the July 30 earnings webcast approaches, all eyes will be on AEP's management to articulate a clear path through these challenges. In a shifting energy landscape, AEP's ability to balance resilience with innovation will define its near-term investment potential.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 18:04:20.247335

What's happening?

The Inflation Reduction Act created incentives for people to invest in clean energy through 2034, but those benefits will now end Dec. 31, EnergySage reported.

The platform said buying a solar system by the end of the year would save the average homeowner $9,000 via the 30% federal tax credit. Solar panels will remain affordable in 2026 and beyond because of falling equipment costs and rising energy costs, but it will take 15 to 20 years for installations to pay for themselves instead of eight to 10.

EnergySage noted that this will impact working families the most, as 44% of households that installed solar power in 2023 earned less than $100,000. ""Without the federal credit, solar becomes significantly less accessible to middle-class homeowners seeking true energy independence,"" it stated.

Why is this important?

While the cost of solar energy fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.50 per watt in 2024, residents are paying more for power from the grid because of rising demand and utilities' power generation and infrastructure expenditures. EnergySage added that artificial intelligence-powered data centers are also causing an issue.

""Despite a growing number of these massive data centers coming online, Congress just ended the main incentive for this grid-stabilizing technology,"" the company stated. ""Without distributed solar generation to help balance the load, the grid becomes more vulnerable to load-shedding requests, brownouts, and rolling blackouts.""

Watch now: Does clean energy really cause blackouts?

Solar systems and battery backups reduce reliance on the grid and lock in rates at or near $0, but this change could increase electricity costs for the average household by $143 annually, per EnergySage.

It pointed out that the average 11-kilowatt setup costs about $20,000 instead of $28,160 with the credit. It takes two to four months to get solar installed. ""The solar industry expects a significant rush of installations in the second half of 2025,"" according to the site. ""This could lead to longer wait times and scheduling challenges for homeowners who delay their decision.""

What's being done about the end of the tax credit?

While it's too late to contact your representatives to push back against this bill, you can install solar panels to reap the rewards of the IRA before they vanish. (Companies have longer to act.)

If you're on the fence, EnergySage has a mapping tool that shows costs and incentives by state. This and other free tools will enable you to compare quotes and find vetted local installers. Not only will you save thousands of dollars, but you will also reduce the heat-trapping pollution that is pushing global temperatures higher and contributing to increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events.

""The elimination of the residential solar tax credit represents a fundamental shift in federal energy policy, ending two decades of bipartisan support for home solar installations,"" EnergySage concluded.

In the short term, fewer electric vehicles may be produced, and some slow-selling models could be discontinued.","When President Trump signed his big budget bill into law on July 4, it eliminated the electric vehicle (EV) tax credits enacted under the Biden Administration—$7,500 for buying or leasing a new qualifying EV and $4,000 for buying a used one.

Before Trump killed the tax break, it was scheduled to remain in effect through 2032. You can still get the credit, but you’ll have to act fast—it now expires on September 30. And not all buyers and EVs qualify.

Which Taxpayers and Vehicles Qualify for the Credit?

The Clean Vehicle Credit is limited to certain buyers and specific new and leased models.

You can claim the tax credit if your adjusted gross income (AGI) does not exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly, $225,000 for heads of households, and $150,000 for all other filers.

Twenty vehicle models qualify for the credit, including Teslas and the popular Ford F-150 Lightning. For some models, only certain trim levels qualify. . The credit is available for vehicles meeting these requirements:

MSRP of less than $80,000 for pickups and SUVs, and less than $55,000 for all other vehicles

Final assembly took place in North America

At least 50 percent of the battery’s minerals and components are from the U.S. or a country with a free trade agreement with the U.S.

Gross weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds

Battery capacity of at least 7 kilowatt hours

If the vehicle meets only one of the battery sourcing requirements, it may still qualify for a $3,500 tax credit.

The used-vehicle EV credit is available for 142 pre-owned cars and trucks. The vehicle must be purchased from a dealer, have a sale price of $25,000 or less, and be at least two years old.

For used EV purchases, buyers must have adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 for single filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.

The U.S. Department of Energy has detailed information about the Clean Vehicle Credit on its .

Buy Now or Wait?

If you’ve already decided that you want an EV—and you qualify for the tax credit—it might make sense to buy before September 30. There are many great electric vehicles, sedans, SUVs, and trucks on the list.

But if you’re on the fence, don’t let the deadline rush into a purchase you may regret.

“The last thing you want to do is rush and buy something you’re not prepared for,” said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. “EVs are great, but [they] require a shift in mindset about how you operate them and where you’re going to charge them. And if you’re not ready for that, it can be a bit of a barrier.”

By waiting, you might even get a better deal. Industry analysts predict automakers will find ways to reduce EV sticker prices.

Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at Edmunds, said automakers can “eat the cost “or find a way to incentivize dealers to sell them at a massive discount.” Yoon said he’s more concerned about the impact of Trump’s tariffs, which could drive up the price of some EVs by 25 percent or more.

“Incentives and rebates are powerful and flexible strategies to adjust the price,” said Tom Voelk, automotive journalist and publisher of . “They can make buyers feel like they’re getting a great deal. Who doesn’t love something like $8,000 off the price of a $60,000 vehicle? And incentives work better for wealthy buyers who didn’t qualify for the federal tax credit.”

And consider this: While EVs may have a higher initial purchase price, they’re less expensive to operate and maintain than gas-powered vehicles. Over time, those savings can offset the upfront cost.

Matthew Phillips, CEO of Car Pros Automotive Group in Washington state, said dealers will get as competitive as they can, knowing that demand will drop after September.

“Manufacturers won’t give up on EVs, and some are already offering big rebates,” Phillips told Checkbook.

In June, the average EV incentives “reached an all-time high,” , 14.8% of the average transaction price, or nearly $8,500.

Consumer Reports found July incentives as high as 26 percent for the Nissan Leaf, Nissan Ariya, and Volkswagen ID4. The Kia Niro Electric has a 21 percent incentive, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and 6 are offered at 16 percent off.

This month, most major manufacturers are also offering zero percent financing on one or more of their electric models, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Sierra EV, Honda Prologue, Kia EV6, Lexus RZ, Nissan Leaf, Toyota bZ4X, Volkswagen ID.4, and Tesla Model 3.

Note: If you choose to go electric, check with your electric utility to see if they offer credits or incentives for buying the vehicle or installing a home charger.

This Will Not Kill the EV Market

The demand for EVs is expected to drop after the tax credits expire. At an auto industry event in December 2024, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged that the $7,500 tax credit “is driving demand” and “without that, that’ll slow.” Reuters reported.

In the short term, fewer electric vehicles may be produced, and some slow-selling models could be discontinued. But manufacturers have invested billions in EV technology and recognize that the industry’s long-term future lies in electric vehicles. EV sales are projected to reach 25 percent of the global market this year,

In its July report, Cox Automotive noted that it still believes new EV sales will continue to expand in the U.S. “but the growth trajectory has been curbed,” with volume expected to remain flat year-over-year. Cox said expectations for sales of new EVs in the U.S. for 2025 have been lowered from approximately 10 percent of total vehicle sales to an 8.5 percent share.

The road ahead may be bumpy, but Consumer Reports is optimistic about the future of EVs.

“The price to build these vehicles is only coming down over time,” said CR’s Harto. “So, in the short term, we might see some pullback, but I think we’ll continue to see better, cheaper electric vehicles coming onto the market over the next four or five years. And that’s really what’s going to drive the market: vehicles that meet consumers where they need to be with a better product at a lower price.”

Which Taxpayers and Vehicles Qualify for the Credit?

The Clean Vehicle Credit is limited to certain buyers and specific new and leased models.

You can claim the tax credit if your adjusted gross income (AGI) does not exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly, $225,000 for heads of households, and $150,000 for all other filers.

Twenty vehicle models qualify for the credit, including Teslas and the popular Ford F-150 Lightning. For some models, only certain trim levels qualify. . The credit is available for vehicles meeting these requirements:

MSRP of less than $80,000 for pickups and SUVs, and less than $55,000 for all other vehicles

Final assembly took place in North America

At least 50 percent of the battery’s minerals and components are from the U.S. or a country with a free trade agreement with the U.S.

Gross weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds

Battery capacity of at least 7 kilowatt hours

If the vehicle meets only one of the battery sourcing requirements, it may still qualify for a $3,500 tax credit.

The used-vehicle EV credit is available for 142 pre-owned cars and trucks. The vehicle must be purchased from a dealer, have a sale price of $25,000 or less, and be at least two years old.

For used EV purchases, buyers must have adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 for single filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.

Buy Now or Wait?

If you’ve already decided that you want an EV—and you qualify for the tax credit—it might make sense to buy before September 30. There are many great electric vehicles, sedans, SUVs, and trucks on the list.

Charles Jensen, Detroit, MI

Clean energy generation—or energy generation without the output of harmful greenhouse gases—has become an increasingly hot topic in today’s race for productivity and the growing global emphasis on eco-consciousness. Some of the most widely used forms of clean energy are solar, wind and biofuel. Other expanding clean energy sources include hydroelectric power and geothermal energy, according to Constellation. Constellation also deems nuclear power to be a “clean” energy, which many would dispute.

Regarding clean energy production by country, it is vital to consider that while China leads the world in clean energy production, generating an astounding 951 terawatt-hours in the first quarter of 2025 alone (with the United States following at about 907 terawatt-hours/year in 2023), China and the U.S. do not have the highest proportion of clean energy to total energy generation when compared to other nations. Iceland, Norway, Paraguay and Brazil lead in having the majority of their total energy production come from clean energy sources, such as geothermal energy in Iceland and hydroelectric power in Norway.

So, how are the U.S. and China the leaders in clean energy production despite clean energy being a smaller portion of their overall energy generation? The answer lies in both nations’ large-scale demand for energy due to their size, population and productive efficiency.

While clean energy makes up roughly 30 percent of U.S. energy production, with the total energy production coming in at about 102.83 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) in 2023, the sheer volume of clean energy production from the two countries is larger than any other nation. China’s clean energy production makes up about 38 percent of its total energy production, placing it just below the global average of 41 percent and the U.S. even lower at 30 percent as mentioned above.

Other countries are able to make the complete or nearly total shift toward using solely clean energy due to their relatively smaller size—both in population and land—as well as having relatively less demand for energy. Albania, Bhutan, Nepal and Lesotho utilize hydroelectric power without needing to use coal or natural gas because their demand for energy is so small that their existing renewable resources are able to meet their needs. With factors like population size and energy demand unlikely to decrease in China and the U.S., the current rankings of clean energy production will most likely not shift. In fact, according to Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), “the [clean energy] industry is now a key part of China’s wider economic and industrial development.”

To advocate for the spread of clean energy, reach out to your local legislators and understand the rules surrounding local energy generation facilities, support plans for the creation of clean energy facilities in your area, and emphasize the transition from traditional to clean energy in your own life.

But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive.
iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020.
Will it contract?” Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply.","(iSeeCars) – With the $7,500 federal incentive for new electric vehicles and the $4,000 incentive for used models set to expire on September 30, there will be fewer new EV sales and falling used EV prices starting in October. This is after new electric vehicle market share had already begun to plateau in late 2024, and after used EV values have fallen dramatically compared to gasoline models over the past year.

The latest iSeeCars study analyzed electric vehicle market share growth over the past six years, along with used EV supply and pricing compared to gasoline models. It also looked at which used cars are losing the most value at a time when the average used car price is going up. All three point to declining electric vehicle demand, and this is happening before the EV incentives go away.

“Electric vehicles have a role to play in the new and used car market,” said iSeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer, “but that role won’t be at the level many government and private EV proponents have been touting for years. Everything from market share to pricing suggests EV demand has peaked and will likely decline in the coming years.”

Has Electric Vehicle Demand Peaked?

Predictions that electric vehicles would make up between 20% and 50% of new vehicle sales by 2030 were common just a few years ago. But new EV market share has stalled at 6.9%, and even declined over the past 12 months, according to Cox Automotive. Most EVs cost more than their gasoline equivalent when new, limiting demand even with the $7,500 incentive.

iSeeCars looked at the 1- to 5-year-old used car market to see how much EV share has grown since 2020. Between 2021 and 2024 the presence of EVs grew between 60.5% and 97.3% every year. But in the last 12 months the EV growth rate dropped to just 14.2%, indicating a marked slowdown in the number of new EVs feeding into the used market.

“This is a lagging indicator, and of course it doesn’t include the impact of federal incentives being removed on September 30,” said Brauer. “What will market share growth for 1- to 5-year-old used EVs be in June of 2026? Will there even be growth? Will it contract?”

Used EVs: Gaining Volume, Losing Value

As electric vehicle share grows, so does used EV supply. In fact, there were 61.8% more used EVs for sale in the first week of July 2025 compared to the first week of July 2024. By comparison, used gasoline cars for sale only increased by 22.2% in that same timeframe.

But used EV demand isn’t keeping up with the growing supply, which is why used EV prices continue to fall even as pricing for used gasoline models increases. In June 2025 EV prices fell 4.8% compared to a year earlier; gasoline prices increased 5.2%.

“Used car shoppers focus, first and foremost, on value. For them, used EVs offer about $1,200 less in value than a gasoline vehicle, and while you can love or hate the market, you can’t argue with it,” said Brauer.

EVs Lead the Charge on Losing Value

When looking at which used models are losing the most value, electric vehicles again play a disproportionate role. EVs only make up 3.3% of the 1- to 5-year-old used market, but they take up 50% of the top 10 list when it comes to losing value.

“It doesn’t help the ‘EV value story’ when Tesla makes up the majority of the EV market in the U.S. while also leading the used car market in price drops,” said Brauer. “Tesla takes up the first three rankings in used cars that lost the most value, with Tesla’s fourth model ranking sixth.”

What Do These EV Challenges Mean for Consumers?

If you’re a consumer considering either a new or used EV purchase, keep the following points in mind:

If you’re going to buy an EV, don’t wait: The EV incentive ends on September 30, 2025, and dealers will likely reduce their EV stock after that date. If you want to save money on an EV while also having more choice in which EV you buy, don’t wait until the last minute. Consider making your purchase in the next few weeks versus being forced to sift through the leftovers in late September.

Consider leasing instead of buying: If you lease an EV before the incentive goes away the $7,500 credit can substantially reduce your lease payment, reducing your monthly car costs. And between the consistently low used EV values and the rapid advances in EV technology, leasing can shield you from the negative effects of these factors that can catch up to you later if you buy an EV.

Consider a plug-in hybrid: If the primary appeal of buying an EV is to kick the gasoline habit, keep in mind that today’s plug-in hybrids can offer between 30 and 60 miles of all-electric driving before they run out of range and the engine fires up. If your daily driving needs are less than that range you could be “driving an EV” almost all of the time. If you have to go beyond their all-electric range, plug-in hybrids still get excellent fuel efficiency when the engine is used. They also don’t force you to deal with range anxiety and they hold their value much better than EVs.

Don’t panic, EVs won’t vanish: While it’s likely electric vehicle sales will fall after the new and used incentives go away and many models may be delayed or cancelled due to the drop in demand, automakers have invested too much money to completely abandon EVs. There will always be some electric options in the new and used car markets. If you can’t or don’t want to buy before September 30, that’s okay. Just relax and consider an EV purchase when it makes sense for you.

The collapse of the agreement leaves a significant vacuum in Puerto Rico’s energy planning.
In parallel, the U.S. Department of Energy is preparing to disburse nearly $1 billion in solar and storage funding through the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund.
Legal scholars warned the deal could have violated key provisions of Puerto Rico’s energy reform laws.
While one cargo was delivered to Puerto Rico in early 2025, no current-quarter shipments have been confirmed.","Puerto Rico’s government has pulled the plug on contract talks with New Fortress Energy after the island’s federally appointed oversight board declined to approve a proposed $20-billion LNG supply deal, upending years of negotiations and raising questions about the future shape of its energy transition.

According to a report by Hart Energy, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico withheld support for the contract earlier this month, citing concerns about cost, duration, and long-term fuel dependency. In response, the Puerto Rico government formally canceled negotiations with New Fortress, despite the company’s dominant position in the island’s LNG market.

New Fortress had been in line to supply fuel for the state-owned Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), whose fleet includes aging oil- and gas-fired plants awaiting conversion or decommissioning. The canceled deal was expected to cover LNG imports for a period of up to 25 years, potentially extending New Fortress’s role as the island’s primary gas supplier well into the 2040s.

The collapse of the agreement leaves a significant vacuum in Puerto Rico’s energy planning. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), natural gas, primarily LNG, accounted for approximately 34% of the island’s electricity generation in 2023, with petroleum making up the majority. Although full-year 2024 data is not yet available, analysts at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) had warned that Puerto Rico’s increasing reliance on LNG contracts could entrench fossil fuel use at the expense of federally supported renewable energy goals.

In parallel, the U.S. Department of Energy is preparing to disburse nearly $1 billion in solar and storage funding through the Puerto Rico Energy Resilience Fund. As of July, however, local permitting constraints and utility interconnection delays had slowed the rollout of community-scale renewable projects.

The New Fortress deal had also come under scrutiny for bypassing competitive procurement rules. While the company already supplies LNG to the San Juan combined-cycle plant and EcoEléctrica’s Peñuelas facility, its attempt to lock in a 25-year sole-source contract drew criticism from public interest attorneys and environmental groups. Legal scholars warned the deal could have violated key provisions of Puerto Rico’s energy reform laws.

For New Fortress, which has not issued any public comment on the deal’s breakdown, the canceled contract represents a setback in its bid to expand LNG operations across the Caribbean. The company is still advancing its Fast LNG project in Mexico, with modular floating liquefaction units aimed at flexible export markets, including potentially Puerto Rico. While one cargo was delivered to Puerto Rico in early 2025, no current-quarter shipments have been confirmed. Without a long-term anchor contract, its foothold on the island may be more vulnerable than previously assumed.

Puerto Rico’s Energy Bureau has not announced whether a new solicitation process will follow. With the island’s debt restructuring still underway and federal funding tied to grid modernization, the question now is whether energy planners will reframe the mix around renewables, or seek a scaled-down LNG alternative.

With or without these data centers, the huge price tag for these new power plants would fall to ratepayers and almost certainly result in future rate increases.
Instead of approving these new plants, the PSC should press for a more responsible energy strategy.
The first priority should be greatly expanding the utilities’ energy efficiency programs, to reduce the need for new power plants while lowering customer bills.
And if these data centers don’t materialize, these new gas plants could become stranded assets.","LG&E/KU have asked the Kentucky Public Service Commission to approve construction of two new natural gas power plants, a utility-scale battery, and upgrades to a coal plant, at a cost to ratepayers of $3.7 billion.

However, there’s a fly in the ointment. The utilities claim they need these new power plants to serve hoped-for new AI data centers, but there is no assurance they will ever materialize.

With or without these data centers, the huge price tag for these new power plants would fall to ratepayers and almost certainly result in future rate increases.

Instead of approving these new plants, the PSC should press for a more responsible energy strategy. The first priority should be greatly expanding the utilities’ energy efficiency programs, to reduce the need for new power plants while lowering customer bills. This is widely recognized as the lowest-cost way to meet growing energy demand. This should include supporting customer investments in rooftop solar, battery storage, and other technologies that can be managed as a “virtual power plant.”

Second, LG&E/KU should renew the multiple solar power agreements previously approved by the Commission, but which the utilities cancelled in the past year. Third, data centers’ rate structures should require these massive facilities to use on-site renewable energy, battery storage, and flexible load tariffs; requiring the data centers to ramp down demand at times of peak load, to protect regular customers from black-outs during heat waves.

LG&E/KU forecasts that data center development will increase their load by 1,750 megawatts by 2032, a 30% increase above current generation. By one estimate, this would consume as much energy as all LG&E/KU residential customers combined! And if these data centers don’t materialize, these new gas plants could become stranded assets. But customers would still be on the hook for the next 40 years, paying off massive investments no longer needed.

More importantly, these proposed fossil fuel plants ignore a fundamental challenge, the accelerating climate crisis and how to best transition to a more resilient and affordable energy system.

The Commission should consider this wider context and the risks that the climate crisis poses for the commonwealth. One way to do this would be for the PSC to open a case to investigate the multifaceted risks of climate change in the context of Kentucky’s power system and how that appraisal should shape future decision-making.

Such an investigation would finally acknowledge this overarching issue in making all decisions about energy production. Indeed, all government decisions at this point should ask, how does this decision affect our ability to cope with accelerating climate change?

In the present case, the Commission should protect ratepayers by sending the proposers back to the drawing board to develop plans to transition to a more resilient and efficient energy system. The PSC welcomes public comments prior to and/or at their public hearing August 4. Comments can be emailed to: psc.comment@ky.gov, case number 2025-00045.

In the risk of accelerating extreme weather, the younger you are the more you have at stake. But rest assured that for our children and grandchildren the stakes couldn’t be higher.

However, as several studies have shown, it’s actually quite easy to maintain a healthy battery over time.

One particular Ford Mustang Mach-E, for instance, can still offer over 90% of its original range after driving 250,000 miles.

We’ve featured many owner stories about their electric cars’ battery life over the years, and they’re usually Teslas or some sort of Hyundai. Now, though, it’s time for another American fan favourite to get into the spotlight.

The Ford Mustang Mach-E wasn’t particularly to every brand enthusiast’s taste when it debuted in 2021, mainly because of its Mustang name, but that sentiment seems to have rescinded recently. However, this being Ford’s first proper purpose-built mass-produced EV, questions remain over its reliability in the long run, especially when it comes to the high-voltage battery.

Generally speaking, the Mustang Mach-E has proved to be a solid vehicle, and now there’s one out there that’s bound to smash any misconception about the long-term reliability of EV batteries.

David Blenkle bought his 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E Premium a little over three years ago, and during his ownership, he racked up over 250,000 miles on the odometer. That’s really impressive, but even more impressive is the battery’s ability to still deliver plenty of range.

Photo by: Ford

When it was new, the 2022 Mustang Mach-E Premium with rear-wheel drive had an EPA range rating of 303 miles on a full charge. Now, Blenkle says he consistently gets around 290 miles of range out of the original battery, which means a degradation rate of just 4%. In other words, the battery still has 96% of its original capacity, which is practically the same as getting behind the wheel of a brand-new EV and driving it for around a year.

“The biggest misconception I encounter is about battery life and range, and then I show them my odometer,” David Blenkle said.

So, how does one manage to keep an EV’s main battery so healthy after so many miles? It’s rather simple, actually. In Blenkle’s case, just setting the charge limit to 90% seems to have done the trick, together with mainly using a home charger during the night. DC fast charging was very rarely used on this particular Mustang Mach-E, and some research shows that limiting the number of fast charging sessions may improve battery life.

A couple of dings and scratches have made their way onto David’s car over time, but other than that, nothing major has happened during his ownership. He has a consistent maintenance schedule where he gets regular tire rotations, routine multipoint inspections and new cabin air filters, but that’s about it. In fact, his original brake pads still have life left after a quarter of a million miles.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/jl0G7o/s1/2022-ford-mustang-mach-e-with-250-000-miles-and-still-on-its-original-battery.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 16:01:56.730714

The grant aimed to support climate resilience, clean energy job training, housing repairs, and public health improvements in Albany’s Arbor Hill, South End, and West Hill neighborhoods.

Among the groups impacted is the Capital Area Urban League, which had been using the funds to provide free electrician training programs.

“I think it’s imperative to restore the funding for programs like this so it could give people like myself — or others from the urban community — the opportunity to better themselves,” said Khyri Oliver, a program graduate who credited the training with helping him start his own business.

Trinity Alliance, the lead applicant on the grant, was awarded $10.9 million to build community infrastructure for clean power access, food and water distribution, and health services in disaster-prone areas.

“The direct impact is the three disenfranchised communities — South End, Arbor Hill, and West Hill,” said Daquetta P. Jones-Johnson, CEO of Trinity Alliance.

In West Hill, Neighborhood Association President Tabora Marcus says the now-stalled funding would have gone toward critical home repairs for low-income seniors.

“It’s really impactful for the neighbors — especially the vulnerable population, which is our seniors,” Marcus said. “People are losing their homes. They don’t have the money on fixed incomes to make repairs, and when they fall behind on taxes, the county can take their homes.”

The Arbor Hill Development Corporation had been awarded $1.8 million to support housing rehabilitation in the West Hill area.

Tonko called the grant’s cancellation a “wrongful termination” and said he is pressing the EPA for clarity.

CBS6 reached out to the EPA for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson said:

“Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and so-called ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission.” The agency added it would continue working with communities to support projects that align with its mission to protect human health and the environment.",https://cbs6albany.com/resources/media2/16x9/641/986/0x9/90/e442567a-57a2-47f0-b79f-2f4925834a56-tonkoo.png,N,,2025-07-26 14:04:08.244043

This target is considered crucial for limiting global warming and was part of the agreement made at the COP28 meeting in Dubai in 2023.

The rapid growth of renewable energy might give the impression that the world has made good progress on meeting its climate objectives. However, renewable energy has not even begun to replace fossil fuels at the global level.

As of now, it is catering mainly to the rising electricity demand, which has increased three times since 1990 and is projected to grow even higher.

Unabated use of fossil fuels across the world

While only around 10% of new electricity installed capacity in 2024 was fossil fuel-based, the use of fossil fuels, in absolute terms, is still growing, according to the IRENA report.

Between 2012 and 2023, global electricity generation grew by 2.5% every year on average, and renewable energy expanded at a rate of about 6% during the same time. This has led to a steady rise in the share of renewables in the electricity generation mix. However, fossil fuels currently account for more than 70% of global electricity production.

Story continues below this ad

In absolute terms, more fossil fuels are being burned today than 10 years ago to produce electricity. To make matters worse, the increase in the use of fossil fuels is expected to continue for at least a few more years. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions have reached record highs in recent years.

Moreover, electricity is still only a small slice of total energy use. Just 20% to 22% of the total energy consumed in the world every year is in the form of electricity. Only 30% of electricity generation comes from renewable sources. This means that about 6% of the world’s energy consumption comes from clean sources. More than 90% still comes from fossil sources.

Note that there are some countries, mainly in the Nordic region, where renewables account for a significantly higher share of total energy consumption. However, the special conditions existing in these countries are difficult to replicate elsewhere. According to projections, by 2050, even in the case scenarios, not more than 40% to 45% of the world’s total energy consumption would come from clean sources.

This means that energy transition, which involves moving away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy, on its own, is unlikely to help tackle the climate crisis. That is why carbon removal interventions, which are yet to become viable, assume great importance in the fight against global warming.

Regional imbalance in growth of renewables

Story continues below this ad

There are other concerns with the manner in which the global energy transition is currently taking shape. So far, the bulk of renewable energy deployment has taken place in a handful of countries, while the others have been left behind.

The IRENA report pointed out that while renewable capacity increased by 15% globally in 2024, in Africa it grew by just 7%, and that too from a very low base. Africa is where the largest number of people without access live.

The IRENA report said 71% of the renewable capacity addition last year took place in Asia. This is slightly misleading as China alone accounted for more than 62% of global additions — that is, 364 GW of the 582 GW installed globally. The whole of Africa together got less than 1%.

For the last few years, China has been consistently installing more renewable energy than the rest of the world combined. Apart from developed countries, China, and some large players such as India, the renewable energy footprint has not grown at a fast pace.

Story continues below this ad

It is true that these are the countries that also happen to be the biggest emitters of greenhouse gases. Effective energy transition here would be more consequential from the climate change perspective than in, for example, Africa.

However, this kind of lopsided deployment of renewable energy, coupled with the fact that China has a near monopoly on the production and supply chains of most of the renewable systems, could leave many countries and regions behind once again.

Renewable energy, such as solar and wind, might be available universally — unlike, say, petrol that is found in only limited geographies — but the technologies needed to harness this energy are getting increasingly inaccessible.

China dominates the production and manufacturing of solar PV systems, for example, but also consumes more than half of it. Large buyers such as the United States and India corner most of what is exported. There is little supply for others.

Story continues below this ad

Also, manufacturing outside of China, which could have filled the gap, is struggling. This is because other countries are not able to compete with China’s economies of scale, low labour costs, or state subsidies.

China’s control over the renewable energy system has begun to appear similar to the OPEC countries’ hold over global oil supplies. Energy security has emerged as one of the foremost concerns of countries, pushing many of them to secure whatever option is available to them, irrespective of whether it is clean or not.

The transition to clean and renewable energy systems is not as simple as it is sometimes made out to be. There are several layers of complexity which make the goal of curbing global temperatures below 2 degrees Celsius look increasingly unrealistic to achieve.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/07/Renewables.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 17:01:48.812134

According to the latest information from the US Energy Information Administration, the price of charging can vary wildly according to state.

In one state, it costs as high as 14.15¢ per mile to as low as 3.96¢ per mile in another, so the cost of charging differs wildly.

With the national average price for regular gas sitting at around 10.52¢ per mile, there are some states where it is more expensive to run a gas car than an EV.

Charging varies wildly across states

Part of the draw of EVs is that they can be cheaper to drive than gas cars, but turns out the cost of electricity varies massively between different states.

A student did an experiment in Canada where he discovered that the cost of running an EV can vary massively based on location and that if you live in a more rural area, gas cars are better for your wallet.

In the United States, the price of electrical charging varies from as high as 14.15¢ per mile to as low as 3.96¢, with the highest price of charging being found in Hawaii, and the carbon footprint varies across the US too.

Which US state is it cheapest to drive an EV in?

With the average price of regular gas in the US being 10.52¢ per mile, according to the AAA, as recently as the 18th July 2025, it is actually more expensive to charge your EV in California (10.59¢) and Hawaii (14.15¢) than fill up with gas.

In Vermont, it costs 7.73¢, in Illinois it costs 6.11¢ and in Florida it costs 5.09¢ to charge your EV, making it slightly cheaper to charge than fill up with gas.

While Washington is an impressive 4.34¢ and Louisiana is 4.49¢, nowhere is cheaper to charge your EV than in Idaho where it costs just 3.96¢ per mile.

At its core, the dispute reflects broader tensions between utility interests, state preemption laws, and local governance. For investors, the outcome could reshape the risk-reward calculus for renewable infrastructure projects in Michigan and beyond, influencing everything from permitting timelines to project financing.

The Regulatory Crossroads: State vs. Local Control

DTE Energy's lawsuit challenges St. Clair County's May 2025 regulations, which include stricter noise limits (45 decibels vs. the state's 55 decibels), visual obscurity requirements, and health department oversight for decommissioning. The utility argues these rules function as zoning laws, violating Public Act 233—a 2023 state law designed to preempt local restrictions and accelerate Michigan's 80% clean energy target by 2035.

This case mirrors a national trend where local governments increasingly impose restrictions on renewables, often citing health and environmental concerns. A 2025 report from Columbia University's Sabin Center revealed a 32% rise in public opposition to renewable projects in 2024 and a 16% increase in “severe” local restrictions, totaling 459 laws across 44 states. Wind projects, in particular, face more restrictions than solar, with 298 anti-wind laws compared to 248 anti-solar laws. Michigan alone has 62 local restrictions, the highest in the nation.

The Sabin Center also notes that local opposition often delays or cancels projects. For example, setback requirements can reduce solar resource efficiency by up to 38%, while 30% of solar and wind projects were canceled in 2024 due to local ordinances. These trends underscore the growing importance of regulatory clarity for investors.

Investment Implications: Risk and Opportunity

The DTE case highlights two critical risks for renewable energy investors: regulatory fragmentation and project uncertainty. If St. Clair County's regulations are upheld, it could embolden other localities to craft their own rules, creating a patchwork of requirements that complicate large-scale development. This would increase costs and timelines, deterring capital inflows. Conversely, a ruling in favor of DTE would reinforce state preemption, streamlining permitting and boosting investor confidence—a scenario akin to New York's 2020 law, which allowed the state to override local bans on renewables.

For Michigan, the stakes are high. The state's aggressive clean energy goals depend on rapid deployment of solar and storage projects. Yet, local opposition—often driven by misinformation or legitimate concerns about land use—threatens to derail progress. Investors must weigh the potential for regulatory stability against the risk of localized delays.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Prioritize Jurisdictions with Clear Preemption Laws: States like Michigan, California, and Illinois, which have enacted laws to limit local restrictions, offer more predictable environments for renewable projects. These regions are likely to attract the bulk of clean energy investments, particularly as the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) incentivizes domestic infrastructure.

Engage in Community Co-Creation: Investors should proactively address local concerns through transparent dialogue and community benefits agreements. For example, DTE's proposed Greenwood Township solar project could mitigate opposition by offering landowner compensation or shared revenue from energy production.

Diversify Geographically and Technologically: A diversified portfolio across solar, wind, and storage can hedge against regional regulatory risks. Projects in states with strong preemption laws (e.g., Ohio, Texas) should be balanced with those in states with emerging local opposition (e.g., New York, Nebraska).

Monitor Legal Precedents: The outcome of DTE's lawsuit could set a national precedent. Investors should track rulings in similar cases, such as Clean Energy Choice Coalition v. Village of Oak Park in Illinois, to anticipate shifts in regulatory frameworks.

The Broader Picture: A National Legal Battleground

The DTE case is part of a larger legal and political struggle over the clean energy transition. In 2025, 459 U.S. counties adopted restrictive policies, reflecting a surge in local governance efforts to assert control over energy development. While these actions are framed as democratic participation, they often lack scientific basis. For instance, St. Clair County's health department cited vague risks like “visual intrusion” and “noise pollution” without peer-reviewed evidence, a common tactic in anti-renewable campaigns.

For investors, the lesson is clear: regulatory risk is no longer confined to federal policy shifts. Local-level conflicts now play a decisive role in project viability. The Inflation Reduction Act's $369 billion in clean energy incentives will only be fully realized if states and municipalities align their policies.

Conclusion

DTE Energy's lawsuit is more than a legal dispute—it is a bellwether for the future of renewable energy investment in the U.S. If Michigan courts uphold Public Act 233, it will reinforce state authority and create a model for other states to follow. Conversely, a victory for St. Clair County could exacerbate regulatory fragmentation, slowing the clean energy transition.

Investors must navigate this uncertainty with a dual strategy: leveraging jurisdictions with strong preemption laws while engaging constructively with local stakeholders. The next few months will be critical. As the Michigan Court of Appeals deliberates on the PSC's interpretation of Public Act 233, the renewable sector—and the broader economy—will watch closely for signals of regulatory clarity.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 16:03:20.806114

The vote to override Stein’s veto of S. 266 will take place in a legislature awash with Duke Energy and other industry money.","As North Carolina lawmakers prepare to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of a controversial energy bill, constituents are receiving mailers from a dark money entity with ties to Duke Energy’s industrial and commercial customers.

Citizens for NC Jobs registered with the state as a nonprofit in January and launched a Facebook page three days after lawmakers introduced the legislation in March. The group is specifically targeting Democrats who voted with Republicans to pass the measure, likely aiming to maintain the members’ support ahead of the override vote.

Senate Bill 266 eliminates Duke Energy’s 2030 carbon emissions limits and shifts costs and risks from the company’s shareholders and industrial customers – including power-hungry data centers – to residential users. Eleven Democrats in the House and three Democrats in the state Senate broke with their party last month and joined the Republican majority to pass the controversial bill.

The measure aims to make building large-scale methane gas and nuclear plants more economically attractive for Duke Energy by forcing customers to pay for them before the plants are operational through a financing mechanism called construction work in progress or CWIP. With CWIP, customers rather than shareholders would be on the hook for repayment if a project falls through. The consequences of CWIP continue to be evident in South Carolina, where Santee Cooper customers are still paying $9 billion for an abandoned nuclear reactor project at the V.C. Summer plant, which never generated power due to delays and cost overruns. After the Summer project collapsed, four executives from a partner utility company involved in the project were criminally sentenced for fraud and lying to federal investigators.

S. 266 would also shift costs from large-load customers to residential users. Currently, Duke Energy’s residential customers in North Carolina use just over 40% of all the power the company purchases, rather than generates itself, and they pay for about 41% of the costs. An analysis by EQ Research found that under S. 266 residential customers would continue to use the same 40% of purchased power but would bear almost 49% of the costs. This cost shift to smaller-load users is being considered as a growing number of power-hungry data centers are eying North Carolina for expansion.

Source: EQ Research

Another analysis released this week by BW Research found that S. 266 would also lead to a loss of over 50,000 jobs and $1.5 billion in unrealized state tax revenue due to a decline in power sector investments, and to a state energy capacity shortfall of as much as 12 gigawatts. The analysis used modeling by the North Carolina Public Staff, which advocates for customers’ interests at the state Utilities Commission.

S. 266 was introduced by former state Sen. Paul Newton, who retired from his job as Duke Energy’s North Carolina president in 2015. He claimed the bill would save the utility’s North Carolina customers $13 billion but did not release the analysis or explain how the figure was calculated. In response, a trio of North Carolina State University professors specializing in utility economics conducted their own analysis of the proposal and found it could potentially raise customers’ bills by $23 billion by 2050 due to volatility in the price of methane gas, upon which Duke Energy is becoming increasingly dependent.

Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, vetoed S. 266 earlier this month. He said the bill’s climate provision was “sending the wrong signal to businesses that want to be a part of our clean energy economy,” while the cost-shift section meant “families will pay more so that industry pays less.”

Legislators may vote to override the veto as early as July 29 when the Senate and House reconvene. The House passed S. 266 by a final vote of 75-36 and the Senate by a vote of 29-11. Overriding a governor’s veto requires a three-fifths supermajority of lawmakers present at the time the vote is called, so the margin needed can vary. Assuming full attendance, Republicans hold a supermajority in the Senate, but House Republicans have only 71 members – one short of a supermajority.

Industrial interests tied to the mailers

Constituents of some of the Democrats who voted with Republicans on S. 266 have received mailers from an obscure nonprofit about the upcoming override vote that repeats challenged claims about cost savings to customers and asks recipients to call and thank their representative for supporting it.

The Energy and Policy Institute obtained a copy of the mailer targeting state Rep. Ray Jeffers, a Democrat who voted for S. 266. He represents parts of Durham County and Person County, where Duke Energy is among the largest employers and taxpayers.

The text on the mailer says it was paid for by Citizens for NC Jobs, a nonprofit that registered with the state in January 2025 and launched a Facebook page on March 13, three days after the legislation was initially introduced as S. 261. Newton, the former Duke Energy executive, resigned from the Senate to take another job, and the text was cut from his bill and pasted into a stripped-out S. 266 that had been introduced to speed rebuilding in the western part of the state after flooding from Hurricane Helene.

In paperwork filed with the state, Citizens for NC Jobs disclosed its registering entity as “WASLAW” and gave among its addresses that of Ward and Smith, a North Carolina law firm. Ward and Smith practice before the North Carolina Utilities Commission as counsel for two organizations representing the interests of Duke Energy’s large industrial and commercial customers: Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates (CIGFUR) and Carolina Utility Customers Association (CUCA). Susan Vick, a lobbyist for the groups, told EPI that her firm merely registered the paperwork for the nonprofit, has had no further contact, and was unaware of the mailers.

Citizens for NC Jobs’ registration paperwork also lists the exact same mailing and principal office address, down to the suite number, as the North Carolina Chamber, the state’s top business lobby. Duke Energy is a top-tier “Pinnacle” member of the NC Chamber, with a seat on its strategic board. Last year, Duke’s state president Kendal Bowman co-chaired a Chamber fundraising campaign. The NC Chamber did not respond to EPI’s request for comment.

The NC Chamber has lobbied legislators to support S. 266. In an email obtained by EPI, NC Chamber lobbyist Alyssa Morrissey accused Gov. Stein’s veto statement of “cherry pick[ing]” data on the bill’s cost. In lobbying materials reviewed by EPI, the NC Chamber dismissed the N.C. State analysis as a “scare tactic” and urged a vote to override Stein’s veto. In another email obtained by EPI, Morrissey told lawmakers this week that utilities have addressed the methane gas price volatility issue, arguing that they have “various mitigation strategies” to manage it. However, an analysis conducted last year by EQ Research for the Environmental Defense Fund showed that since 2017 methane gas has been the primary driver behind rising Duke Energy electric bills in North Carolina.

The vote to override Stein’s veto of S. 266 will take place in a legislature awash with Duke Energy and other industry money. Over the past decade, Duke Energy has contributed over $2.5 million to North Carolina politics; among its top recipients were Newton’s campaign as well as that of state Sen. Dan Blue, one of the Democrats who voted for S. 266.

Before Trump killed the tax break, it was scheduled to remain in effect through 2032. You can still get the credit, but you’ll have to act fast—it now expires on September 30. And not all buyers and EVs qualify.

Which Taxpayers and Vehicles Qualify for the Credit?

The Clean Vehicle Credit is limited to certain buyers and specific new and leased models.

You can claim the tax credit if your adjusted gross income (AGI) does not exceed $300,000 for married couples filing jointly, $225,000 for heads of households, and $150,000 for all other filers.

Twenty vehicle models qualify for the credit, including Teslas and the popular Ford F-150 Lightning. For some models, only certain trim levels qualify. . The credit is available for vehicles meeting these requirements:

MSRP of less than $80,000 for pickups and SUVs, and less than $55,000 for all other vehicles

Final assembly took place in North America

At least 50 percent of the battery’s minerals and components are from the U.S. or a country with a free trade agreement with the U.S.

Gross weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds

Battery capacity of at least 7 kilowatt hours

If the vehicle meets only one of the battery sourcing requirements, it may still qualify for a $3,500 tax credit.

The used-vehicle EV credit is available for 142 pre-owned cars and trucks. The vehicle must be purchased from a dealer, have a sale price of $25,000 or less, and be at least two years old.

For used EV purchases, buyers must have adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 for single filers, $112,500 for heads of households, and $150,000 for married couples filing jointly.

The U.S. Department of Energy has detailed information about the Clean Vehicle Credit on its .

Buy Now or Wait?

If you’ve already decided that you want an EV—and you qualify for the tax credit—it might make sense to buy before September 30. There are many great electric vehicles, sedans, SUVs, and trucks on the list.

But if you’re on the fence, don’t let the deadline rush into a purchase you may regret.

“The last thing you want to do is rush and buy something you’re not prepared for,” said Chris Harto, senior policy analyst for transportation and energy at Consumer Reports. “EVs are great, but [they] require a shift in mindset about how you operate them and where you’re going to charge them. And if you’re not ready for that, it can be a bit of a barrier.”

By waiting, you might even get a better deal. Industry analysts predict automakers will find ways to reduce EV sticker prices.

Joseph Yoon, consumer insights analyst at Edmunds, said automakers can “eat the cost “or find a way to incentivize dealers to sell them at a massive discount.” Yoon said he’s more concerned about the impact of Trump’s tariffs, which could drive up the price of some EVs by 25 percent or more.

“Incentives and rebates are powerful and flexible strategies to adjust the price,” said Tom Voelk, automotive journalist and publisher of . “They can make buyers feel like they’re getting a great deal. Who doesn’t love something like $8,000 off the price of a $60,000 vehicle? And incentives work better for wealthy buyers who didn’t qualify for the federal tax credit.”

And consider this: While EVs may have a higher initial purchase price, they’re less expensive to operate and maintain than gas-powered vehicles. Over time, those savings can offset the upfront cost.

Matthew Phillips, CEO of Car Pros Automotive Group in Washington state, said dealers will get as competitive as they can, knowing that demand will drop after September.

“Manufacturers won’t give up on EVs, and some are already offering big rebates,” Phillips told Checkbook.

In June, the average EV incentives “reached an all-time high,” , 14.8% of the average transaction price, or nearly $8,500.

Consumer Reports found July incentives as high as 26 percent for the Nissan Leaf, Nissan Ariya, and Volkswagen ID4. The Kia Niro Electric has a 21 percent incentive, while the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and 6 are offered at 16 percent off.

This month, most major manufacturers are also offering zero percent financing on one or more of their electric models, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Ford F-150 Lightning, GMC Sierra EV, Honda Prologue, Kia EV6, Lexus RZ, Nissan Leaf, Toyota bZ4X, Volkswagen ID.4, and Tesla Model 3.

Note: If you choose to go electric, check with your electric utility to see if they offer credits or incentives for buying the vehicle or installing a home charger.

This Will Not Kill the EV Market

The demand for EVs is expected to drop after the tax credits expire. At an auto industry event in December 2024, GM CEO Mary Barra acknowledged that the $7,500 tax credit “is driving demand” and “without that, that’ll slow.” Reuters reported.

In the short term, fewer electric vehicles may be produced, and some slow-selling models could be discontinued. But manufacturers have invested billions in EV technology and recognize that the industry’s long-term future lies in electric vehicles. EV sales are projected to reach 25 percent of the global market this year,

In its July report, Cox Automotive noted that it still believes new EV sales will continue to expand in the U.S. “but the growth trajectory has been curbed,” with volume expected to remain flat year-over-year. Cox said expectations for sales of new EVs in the U.S. for 2025 have been lowered from approximately 10 percent of total vehicle sales to an 8.5 percent share.

The road ahead may be bumpy, but Consumer Reports is optimistic about the future of EVs.

“The price to build these vehicles is only coming down over time,” said CR’s Harto. “So, in the short term, we might see some pullback, but I think we’ll continue to see better, cheaper electric vehicles coming onto the market over the next four or five years. And that’s really what’s going to drive the market: vehicles that meet consumers where they need to be with a better product at a lower price.”

This story was originally published by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

The devastating flood that swept through Camp Mystic in Texas this month is every parent’s worst nightmare. Hours or days of fear and uncertainty, feeling powerless to help, and, for the families of the 27 campers and staff members who perished, the most painful news imaginable.

Although flash flooding is a recurring problem in the region, climate change exacerbates the problem. Scientists in Europe have already conducted a rapid assessment and determined that the storm dropped 7 percent more rain than it would have otherwise because of global warming. With 129 fatalities—including at least 36 children—and more than 170 people still missing, it is among the deadliest floods in the state’s history.

Katharine Hayhoe, a professor at Texas Tech University and chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, posted a message to LinkedIn about the flooding on July 5, writing, “The news is heartbreaking. As a parent it’s hard to even process.”

The fact that so many children and young people lost their lives underscores the importance of educational groups like Science Moms, a nonpartisan organization started in 2019 by Hayhoe and other leading climate scientists and mothers. The group works to demystify climate change and motivate moms to demand plans and solutions that will protect the planet for their kids—and their kids from dangerous, climate-change fueled extreme weather events.

Joellen Russell, an oceanographer at the University of Arizona, says her identities as climate scientist and concerned mother merged long before she helped start Science Moms.

Russell was several months pregnant with her first child in 2007, when 12 states sued the EPA over the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Russell reached out to John Mike Wallace, her mentor and former colleague at the University of Washington, where Russell worked as a research associate after completing her PhD. “I wrote to him, and I said, ‘Hey, Mike, I’m pregnant. I’m waiting on this new little one, and you need to step up and help me, because we need to turn this bus,’” she recalls. “‘We need to make a change in the world.’”

Wallace wrote back right away saying he’d help. Russell, Wallace, and other scientists signed an amicus brief submitted in the landmark Supreme Court case, Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, which the Supreme Court cited when they ruled the Clean Air Act covered carbon dioxide as a pollutant. Russell’s son Joseph was born a few months later.

United States emissions have dropped 15 percent since 2007.

Now, Russell says, she tries to lean into her humanness and her “momness” as an educator, scientist, advocate for truth. “I’m so thrilled that I have these two gorgeous babies, and I am really worried,” Russell says. “I don’t want them to have to lift this burden. They will, but if there’s anything I can do, I want to do it.”

Science Moms has partnered with Potential Energy, a nonprofit marketing firm “for planet Earth,” on a multimillion-dollar campaign to inform moms about climate change. Their most high-profile ad to date ran during the 2025 Superbowl, when millions heard the message: “Climate change is like watching them grow up: we blink and we miss it.” Months after the commercial aired, Erica Smithwick, a Science Mom and professor of geography at Penn State, still gets postcards from moms the ad resonated with.

A 2020 study by the Yale Program on Climate Communication found over half of the US population is concerned about climate change. An analysis by Potential Energy found approximately 70 percent of mothers say they’re concerned about climate change. According to Smithwick, moms are ideal environmental advocates because they cut to the core of complex issues. Moms already led advocacy groups like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America (now Everytown for Gun Safety), and climate change will impact future generations most of all, so a mom-led climate science organization just made sense.

“Mothers throughout time have always put in that extra labor because they care about the health of their families,” Smithwick says. “Whether that’s smoking or seat belts or gun safety, all of those are things that I think moms do care about profoundly. When we think about climate change…we really are worried that our kids are going to get heat stroke, and we’re worried that our kids aren’t going to be able to go on vacation or play outside.”

Smithwick says she waited 15 years to take her two kids to Yellowstone National Park, where she has research​​ed forest resiliency. With the recent wildfires in the West, she thinks it may be too late for her children to see these landmarks without them being shrouded in smoke. Now, as a dangerous heat wave surges across the eastern United States, moms like Smithwick worry even more about the safety of their kids in a rapidly changing world.

Despite the gravity of the issues Science Moms communicate, Smithwick says they strive not to “problematize,” and instead move toward action.

The Science Moms website provides mothers with resources and connects them with individual scientists. The site features explainer-style videos and podcasts, guides for how to talk about climate change with family members, and a letter template for moms to reach out to local leaders and ask about plans to stop big polluters.

This year, Science Moms will be rolling out education campaigns related to extreme weather events. They want to ensure moms around the country are prepared for emergencies, including heat waves and hurricanes, in what may be the hottest summer on record. Russell lives in Arizona, one of the fastest warming states in the nation. In 2024, Arizona’s health department appointed its first chief heat officer, Eugene Livar, to lead the state’s Extreme Heat Preparedness Plan.

“We’re sitting in the hot seat, the bullseye of global warming,” Russell says. “We feel like we have an obligation to both, get prepared, get on it, reduce our emissions and help our people weather this.”

Russell says Science Moms will be focusing outreach toward purple and red-leaning states like Arizona, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, states where a large percentage of people have been skeptical about climate change information in the past.

According to Russell, the mission of Science Moms remains the same, regardless of administration. Science Moms aims to cut through misinformation and share facts backed up by science. “The sort of cacophony of shifts that are happening up at the higher level of the administration doesn’t really speak to what a lot of moms care about, whatever side of the political aisle they’re on,” Smithwick says.

Tragedies like the Texas flood show how challenging it is to walk a neutral political line, especially when attacks on science are primarily coming from one political party. The exact degree to which the Trump administration’s National Weather Service budget and staffing cuts may have played a role in the disaster is still a matter of debate.

“I think every time we have a tragedy like this, which is unimaginable in its own ways—this particular one—it’s unfortunately a reminder that we have to not look away from climate change,” says Emily Fischer, a professor in the department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University and one of the founding members of Science Moms. “We have to look straight at it and work together to prevent these kinds of disasters from getting worse.”

But she recognizes how difficult that can be, especially in a moment like this. “It’s really hard to shine the light on climate change after a tragedy,” she adds. “It feels icky in some ways, I think, but it’s actually super important.”

Writing on LinkedIn (in a personal capacity, not necessarily as a representative of Science Moms) Katharine Hayhoe said: “The more climate change supersizes our weather extremes, the more info we need to keep people safe. This includes experts, instruments, models, research, and assessments: everything that’s currently being reduced or cut by the US administration.”

Despite political and environmental uncertainty, Russell sees hope for the future in the eyes of her children. Climate change is a family affair, she says, one she shares with her son, Joseph—a budding climate educator who has passed out exams in her classes for years—and his younger sister, Maeve. It’s an issue that has developed over generations, and it will take generations to fix.

“I plan to fight until I can’t anymore,” Russell says. “When I drop in the traces and can’t go any farther, my kids will step right over me and get up that hill.”",https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ScienceMoms.webp?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-26 14:04:24.758714

NuScale Power has the government support, the technology and the financial backing to succeed. Will that be enough?

NuScale offers exposure to what could be a transformative energy technology - if you can stomach the stock's volatility.

Nuclear power is having its moment again. After decades in the wilderness, small modular reactors (SMRs) are emerging as a potentially transformative technology, backed by close to $1 billion in new U.S. federal funding and surging demand from AI data centers hungry for clean, reliable electricity.

At the center of this renaissance sits NuScale Power (SMR) - the only company with a U.S.-approved SMR design. Its stock has become a proxy for investors betting on the nuclear future - and judging by its 32% gain in the past month, optimism is high.

First to market, but is that enough?

NuScale's competitive moat stems from a hard-won regulatory victory. In May, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the Oregon-based company's uprated 77-megawatt reactor design, the second SMR design ever cleared by U.S. regulators. The plant design retains the safety features that made NuScale's technology attractive to regulators - natural convection cooling and passive safety systems - while boosting power density through larger individual modules. Each upgraded module produces 77 megawatts compared to the original 50-megawatt design, with six-module plants generating 462 megawatts total.

NuScale is now the only SMR developer with an NRC-approved design ready for deployment. Technically it's a ""standard design approval"" - one step below full certification - but it provides the regulatory foundation utilities need to reference the design in license applications and move forward with concrete project planning. This matters less than the practical advantage: NuScale can offer customers a pre-vetted design while competitors are still navigating the complex approval process.

This regulatory head start isn't trivial. In an industry where licensing can take longer than actual construction, having preapproved designs positions NuScale as an early contender for the U.S. Department of Energy's new $900 million SMR funding program. The DOE initiative, reissued in March, aims to support up to two first-mover SMR projects with $800 million in funding, while allocating another $100 million for broader industry support.

Financial reality

For all its technological promise, NuScale remains a pre-revenue company navigating the expensive transition from research to commercialization.

For all its technological promise, NuScale remains a pre-revenue company navigating the expensive transition from research to commercialization. In the nuclear industry context, this means the company doesn't yet earn income from electricity sales or operating plants, though it is beginning to generate revenue from engineering services and licensing fees for early-stage SMR projects. The first quarter of 2025 offered glimpses of this developmental progress: revenue jumped nearly nine-fold to $13.4 million from just $1.4 million a year earlier, driven by initial technology sales and engineering work for Romania's first SMR plant.

Losses remain substantial. NuScale posted a $35 million operating loss in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease from the prior year as R&D spending eased. More encouraging for investors is NuScale's financial runway. As of March 31, the company held about $492 million in cash and equivalents, plus $30 million in short-term investments. This war chest was bolstered by a $102 million stock sale in the first quarter of this year, providing what management estimates is more than three years of runway at current burn rates.

Moreover, federal backing runs deep. The DOE has provided more than $575 million to support NuScale's SMR development to date - an extraordinary level of public investment that underpins the company's financial position and validates its technology approach.

Volatile stock in an uncertain business

NuScale's stock performance tells the story of an industry caught between promise and uncertainty. After going public via a SPAC in 2022, NuScale shares languished before skyrocketing 445% in 2024. The momentum continued into 2025, with the stock doubling in weeks and gaining 120.6% in the first six months of the year.

NuScale's market capitalization tops $13 billion - remarkable for a company with no operating plants. The primary catalyst has been policy momentum, particularly Trump's aggressive pro-nuclear stance. A flurry of executive orders in May 2025 directed regulators to expedite reactor licensing and designated AI data centers as ""critical defense facilities"" requiring advanced reactor power. This enthusiastic federal endorsement sent NuScale and other nuclear stocks soaring.

A U.S. setback is a cautionary tale

NuScale's journey hasn't been without setbacks. The collapse of its first planned U.S. project - a six-module plant canceled in late 2023 - serves as a reminder that interest doesn't equal investment. Cost estimates for that project ballooned 53%, to $89 from $58 per megawatt-hour, prompting several municipal utility participants to withdraw and ultimately killing the venture.

This experience underscores the cost risk inherent in first-of-a-kind nuclear projects. While SMRs promise economies of scale through factory fabrication and modular construction, these benefits remain theoretical until proven in practice. The hope is that standardized manufacturing will drive down costs, but early projects inevitably face the learning-curve premium that comes with pioneering technology.

NuScale has pivoted from that U.S. disappointment to pursue international opportunities that could serve as crucial proof-of-concept projects. The company's flagship overseas venture in Romania is moving forward, with engineering design work underway for a six-module, 462-megawatt plant at Doicesti. Groundbreaking is expected by 2027, targeting operation around 2030 in partnership with Romanian utility Nuclearelectrica (RO:SNN).

The Romanian project could become the first operational NuScale SMR in the world, providing powerful validation for other potential customers. Success there would demonstrate that NuScale's design works as advertised and create a template for international export of U.S. nuclear technology.

NuScale has also forged a manufacturing partnership with South Korean conglomerate Doosan (KR:000150) to produce the first 12 reactor modules, addressing supply-chain concerns that have plagued other nuclear projects.

Racing for the lead

While NuScale enjoys its regulatory head start, competition is intensifying. For example, GE Vernova Hitachi Nuclear Energy - a joint-venture between GE Vernova (GEV) and Japan's Hitachi (JP:6501) (HTHIY)- is leveraging decades of experience with a small modular reactor now under construction in Canada. The project is expected to be completed in 2028; its success could quickly erode NuScale's first-mover advantage.

Meanwhile, privately held companies such as Holtec International and X-energy are also pursuing aggressive strategies, with X-energy securing Amazon.com (AMZN) as a strategic backer for five gigawatts worth of new SMRs by 2039. These partnerships with tech giants underscore the growing nexus between cloud computing and nuclear power that could drive demand.

For investors, timing is everything

The next 18 months will be crucial for NuScale.

For investors, NuScale represents both the promise and peril of betting on transformative technology. The company sits at the intersection of several powerful trends: surging electricity demand from AI, federal commitment to nuclear and corporate appetite for clean power. NuScale CEO John Hopkins has indicated a goal of securing the first ""tier 1"" customer by the end of 2025, potentially a utility or data-center consortium, to keep the timeline of delivering a plant by 2030 intact.

The next 18 months will be crucial for NuScale. Success in landing DOE funding, signing concrete customer contracts and maintaining project timelines could validate the stock's premium valuation. Conversely, delays, cost overruns or losing ground to competitors could trigger significant downside.

The investment case ultimately rests on execution. NuScale has the regulatory approval, the technology and the financial backing to succeed. Whether management can convert its head start into operating plants and sustained profitability is the defining question for investors willing to bet on nuclear power's next chapter.

With the first SMRs potentially online by the end of this decade, NuScale offers exposure to what could be a transformative energy technology - provided investors can stomach the inherent volatility of pioneering an entirely new nuclear sector.

Big questions surrounding solid-state batteries, though, have been the price and whether or not they would be the exclusive domain of luxury brands.
Solid-state batteries do away with the liquid, and the entire anode.
That technology is coming soon; in addition to Mercedes, other companies like Volkswagen and Honda are developing solid-state batteries.
MG wants to prove that's the case, and what's more, it can be done on the cheap.","MG Motor has announced that the second generation of its MG4 hatchback will feature a semi-solid-state battery. Solid-state batteries are the holy grail of EVs, a much more energy-dense construction that allows for all the things you ever wanted — faster charging, more range for the same weight, less risk of fire, you name it. Mercedes has already begun testing an EQS prototype with the technology. Big questions surrounding solid-state batteries, though, have been the price and whether or not they would be the exclusive domain of luxury brands.

The originally British but now Chinese-owned brand appears to have found a way to bring costs way, way down. Debuting August 4 in China, the MG4 will start at just $11,000 in that market, per InsideEVs. How did MG do it? By not making the solid-state pack entirely solid. The batteries, developed by QingTao Energy, still feature about 5% liquid electrolyte, resulting in a gel rather than a pure fluid like in a traditional lithium-ion battery. It's also not the world's greatest battery; it's actually less energy dense than Tesla's current batteries and even the semi-solid designs from the emerging American battery manufacturer Factorial.

That may sound like a downgrade, but the semi-solid battery still has one advantage: It doesn't lose performance in cold weather, an Achilles heel of the lithium-ion type. The new battery operates at full capacity all the way down to 19 degrees fahrenheit, and at this price, that makes the MG4 a pretty great EV option for daily use.

A traditional lithium-ion battery features both a cathode (a positively charged half) and an anode (negatively charged), which are awash in a liquid electrolyte that allows charged particles to move from one to the other, creating an electrical current. Solid-state batteries do away with the liquid, and the entire anode. Instead, when plugged in, the charged particles coming out of the solid lithium block pass through a ceramic separator and build themselves up into their own, temporary anode. When that's discharged by turning the car on, the anode particles flow back through the circuit, eventually depleting the anode altogether.

This design allows the overall size of the battery to be much smaller and lighter, as you don't have to lug an anode around everywhere. Weight, as we all know, is one of the big downsides of EVs. Get the weight down, and suddenly range gets way better even for the same amount of electrical storage.

That technology is coming soon; in addition to Mercedes, other companies like Volkswagen and Honda are developing solid-state batteries. But they require more pure lithium than a traditional battery, and given supply chain issues, that presents a problem of its own. Semi-solid-state is literally a halfway point between the two, and somewhat like PHEVs may provide a ""best of both worlds"" solution, at least for the near-term. MG wants to prove that's the case, and what's more, it can be done on the cheap. If it can, that's a big step forward for EVs as a whole.

This acquisition marks another significant step in Agilitas Energy’s mission to add resilient and clean power solutions across the United States.
Once operational, Agilitas Energy’s solar project is projected to generate approximately 16,000megawatt-hours (MWh) of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 2,500 Rhode Island homes.
These credits will be sold to commercial, industrial, public or municipal customers within the Rhode Island Energy territory, offering them long-term energy savings and price stability.
“In an era where tariffs and policy shifts are reshaping the clean energy landscape, acquiring this project underscores Agilitas Energy's commitment to navigating these challenges head-on and strengthening energy infrastructure in whatever way we can,” said Barrett Bilotta, CEO of Agilitas Energy.","Agilitas Energy announced the acquisition of a 12.5-megawatt (MW) solar project located in North Smithfield, Rhode Island, from a local developer.

This acquisition marks another significant step in Agilitas Energy’s mission to add resilient and clean power solutions across the United States.

The project is fully permitted, with construction slated to begin in 2025 and commercial operation expected by the end of 2026. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.

Once operational, Agilitas Energy’s solar project is projected to generate approximately 16,000megawatt-hours (MWh) of clean electricity annually, enough to power over 2,500 Rhode Island homes.

The project will participate in Rhode Island’s Net Metering Credit (NMC) program, providing credits that offset 100 percent of supply, distribution, transmission and transition charges for each kilowatt-hour produced. Because development began before the state’s eligibility deadline, the project is grandfathered under Rhode Island’s original rules, making it eligible for the full 100% credit value.

Projects developed after the cutoff face a 275-megawatt cap and receive reduced value credits, making this asset particularly attractive to off-takers. These credits will be sold to commercial, industrial, public or municipal customers within the Rhode Island Energy territory, offering them long-term energy savings and price stability.

In addition to net metering revenues, the solar project will generate New England Power Pool (NEPOOL) Class I Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), contributing to the region’s Renewable Portfolio Standards and providing an additional revenue stream for Agilitas Energy.

“In an era where tariffs and policy shifts are reshaping the clean energy landscape, acquiring this project underscores Agilitas Energy's commitment to navigating these challenges head-on and strengthening energy infrastructure in whatever way we can,” said Barrett Bilotta, CEO of Agilitas Energy.

“By integrating this project into our portfolio, we not only reinforce our commitment to establishing resilient energy infrastructure but also contribute to local grid reliability and economic growth.

Decades after reactor disasters at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima, Americans’ appetite for nuclear power is on the upswing according to recent polling from the Pew Center and Gallup.
But Hartman said the payoff is worth it — enormous amounts of 24/7 electric power made without climate-warming pollution.
About a quarter of New England’s electricity comes from nuclear reactors in New Hampshire and Connecticut.
“This is a serious issue and frankly if it doesn’t get resolved soon people should stop talking about nuclear power 2.0,” Hudson said.","The remains of the Maine Yankee nuclear plant in Wiscasset are protected by a tall chain link fence topped with razor wire and a checkpoint manned by armed guards.

Surrounded by trees and fields, towering pylons from an electric substation are some of the only infrastructure still visible from the road leading down to Bailey Point.

But Don Hudson says 30 years ago it was a completely different scene: A huge dome covered a reactor that cranked out a third of Maine’s power, the largest single source of electricity in the state.

“That concrete dome would have dwarfed the other buildings which after a while you would have picked up,” Hudson said.

“The adjacent buildings that housed the spent fuel pool and all the apparatus needed to generate electricity,” he added.

Back then, Hudson was working with the Chewonki Foundation, an environmental nonprofit located across a narrow coastal channel from the plant.

“As a young man, I was opposed, strongly opposed to nuclear power, largely because it was right next door to the place I worked,” Hudson said.

He remembers the plant opening in 1972. Twenty-four years later, safety concerns and expensive repairs shuttered Maine Yankee.

Hudson chairs the community advisory panel group established first to help decommission the plant and now to advocate for removing fuel waste from the site.

And all these decades later, he’s still working to find a final resting place for 540 tons of spent nuclear fuel still stored in specialized concrete tubes at the former plant.

Without a national strategy to collect and manage America’s nuclear waste, Bailey Point will likely remain a storage facility that costs about $10 million a year.

And under current rules, the material will have to remain secure for 10,000 years, Hudson said.

“If we’re going to use nuclear power from here into the future, we need to resolve this issue with high-level radioactive waste,” Hudson said.

Decades after reactor disasters at Chernobyl, Three Mile Island and Fukushima, Americans’ appetite for nuclear power is on the upswing according to recent polling from the Pew Center and Gallup. Refocused attention on nuclear is being driven by tech companies hungry for electricity to fuel data centers and startups developing “small modular reactors” that could be deployed faster than traditional power plants.

Meanwhile, both the Trump and Biden presidential administrations have pushed policies aimed at encouraging new nuclear generation.

“Whether you’re looking from the federal level or the state level, or you’re the industry, or at the local level, I think you there are a lot of people that see the potential that new nuclear can provide that just other generation sources can’t,” said Kristy Hartman, a spokesperson for the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry trade group.

Nuclear plants are incredibly costly and take years to get approved and constructed.

But Hartman said the payoff is worth it — enormous amounts of 24/7 electric power made without climate-warming pollution.

That attribute could be attractive to states like Maine, with goals to use completely clean energy in the near future, Hartman said.

States “have these mandates and they have these decarbonization goals in particular and they are not going to reach the finish line with just the renewables that they originally set,” Hartman said.

About a quarter of New England’s electricity comes from nuclear reactors in New Hampshire and Connecticut.

But Jamie Dickerson, senior director of climate and clean energy programs at the Acadia Center, doubts nuclear will make significant inroads in the region.

“Most of the modeling that we have reviewed largely suggests a future where solar, wind and batteries are really dominating the generating resource mix well into the future,” Dickerson said.

Even as New England states see prospects to rapidly build out offshore wind resources in the face of market forces and political obstruction, Dickerson still thinks nuclear will complement, not displace, renewable generation.

And Jack Shapiro from the Natural Resources Council of Maine said new reactors have a track record of construction delays and massive cost overruns.

“Building new nuclear will not occur in time to meaningfully contribute to emissions reductions, while renewables are being rapidly deployed today,” Shapiro said in testimony to the Legislature this winter.

Maine lawmakers rejected two bills aimed at smoothing the way for nuclear generation in the 2025 legislative session. But a third bill, to request informational bids for small modular reactors, was carried over for more debate next year.

Patrick Woodcock, CEO of the Maine Chamber of Commerce and a former energy official in Maine and Massachusetts, said all options should be considered to bring down escalating electric costs.

But he doesn’t think it is realistic to expect a new reactor in Maine in the near future. Any nuclear development requires approval from a statewide referendum, which could make developers think twice, Woodcock said. Plus, the state’s electric market is likely too small to justify the massive expense of building a new plant.

But regional projects to maintain or expand New England’s remaining reactors could be worth considering, Woodcock added.

“Ultimately this comes down to economics,” Woodcock said “Does this make sense for ratepayers? Does this make sense for our load growth trajectory? Ultimately that comes down to a specific proposal and we are a long way from seeing that in New England,” he added.

Back in Wiscasset, Don Hudson says he got more comfortable with Maine Yankee after seeing the plant in operation. But without a national strategy to manage spent fuel, he’s not convinced new reactors are a solution for future electric demand.

“This is a serious issue and frankly if it doesn’t get resolved soon people should stop talking about nuclear power 2.0,” Hudson said. “It just doesn’t make any sense.”",https://bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/07/maine-yankee-canisters.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 14:03:57.266730

PJM had said that its existing interconnection process, which FERC approved in November 2022, met the requirements of Order 2023.
But in its decision this week, FERC said that while parts of PJM’s process complies with Order 2023, the grid operator must revise others.

Before joining FERC, Christie served as a member of the Virginia State Corporation Commission for about 17 years.","The PJM Interconnection must make significant changes to its plan for meeting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s grid interconnection requirements, the agency said in a decision released Thursday.

The issue centers on FERC’s Order 2023, which set baseline requirements for grid interconnection rules. It requires a “first-ready, first-served” cluster study approach and made other reforms intended to cut down the interconnection backlog. The rule also set deadlines for regional transmission organizations and other transmission providers to complete interconnection studies, and imposed penalties for missing those deadlines.

PJM had said that its existing interconnection process, which FERC approved in November 2022, met the requirements of Order 2023.

But in its decision this week, FERC said that while parts of PJM’s process complies with Order 2023, the grid operator must revise others.

FERC gave PJM 60 days to propose changes to its interconnection rules. Some of them include:

Striking language that says PJM must only make “reasonable efforts” to meet certain deadlines;

Describing how network and substation upgrade study costs will be allocated;

Explaining how network system upgrade costs will be shared;

Requiring transmission owners to use operating assumptions in their interconnection studies that reflect the planned charging behavior of battery storage projects; and,

Requiring that interconnection studies include an evaluation of grid-enhancing technologies.

FERC’s order comes amid a spike in PJM’s capacity costs, which reflect tight supply and demand conditions in its footprint in 13 Mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, and the District of Columbia.

One of the first steps in building new power supplies is successfully passing through a grid operator’s interconnection process.

PJM has paused its review of new interconnection requests as it works through a backlog of interconnection requests. The grid operator expects to begin using its reformed process to start evaluating new requests next year.

PJM has approved about 46 GW of interconnection requests for generating projects that have yet to be built, according to the grid operator. It expects to finish reviewing an additional 63,000 MW of interconnection requests through 2026.

Getting new power supplies online is urgent, and interconnection reforms can help, according to FERC commissioners.

“We only have to look to the news in terms of soaring energy demands and the cost consequences for real consumers to see how much this work tangibly matters,” FERC Commissioner Lindsay See said during the agency’s open meeting Thursday. “We’re going to continue to commit to work with [grid operators and utilities] on fast, innovative and fair solutions to get more sources connected and doing their job, delivering power quickly.”

More work on interconnection reform is needed, but acting on PJM’s compliance plan — the last major pending FERC Order 2023 compliance plan — is a “step in the right direction,” FERC Commissioner David Rosner said.

Roser highlighted a separate decision that shows how frustrating the interconnection process can be. In that decision, FERC approved an 18-month extension of the commercial operation deadline for a key part of a 180-MW wind farm under development by ENGIE North America in Iowa. The new deadline is June 1, 2028.

The Midcontinent Independent System Operator started studying an interconnection request for the North Hills wind farm in 2017, according to FERC’s decision. The project was hit with multiple delays, including from a Jan. 20 executive order from President Donald Trump ordering a pause on new leases and permits for wind projects, FERC said.

Also, import tariffs and the threat of tariffs on goods from Mexico, China and Canada, as well as on steel and aluminum imports, caused procurement delays, according to the agency. ENGIE said it expects to have completed an offtake agreement for power from the project in the third quarter.

“The [interconnection] delay was so long that the original equipment that they expected in their application is no longer manufactured, and so they have to ask for a waiver for more time,” Rosner said. “It’s just taken too long, and … we have, unfortunately, examples like this all the time that show us these problems, and the only way to solve those problems is with speed.”

Here are three other takeaways from FERC’s open meeting.

Christie to leave in early August. FERC Chairman Mark Christie said he plans to leave the agency in early August. He aims to help issue key orders, some of which face statutory deadlines. In a media briefing, Christie declined to say what those orders may be, noting FERC commissioners are barred from discussing contested cases the agency is considering.

When Christie leaves, FERC will have three sitting commissioners, enough for a quorum needed to issue orders. However, the three remaining commissioners — Rosner and Judy Chang, Democrats, and See, a Republican — may have conflicts from their previous work that could keep them from participating in certain cases, which would prevent votes on them until at least one of the agency’s two empty seats are filled.

President Donald Trump named Laura Swett, an energy attorney and former FERC staffer, and David LaCerte, an official with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, to fill the empty seats. The nominations must be cleared by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the full Senate, a process that can take months.

Before joining FERC, Christie served as a member of the Virginia State Corporation Commission for about 17 years. During the open meeting, Christie said one of his guiding principles as a utility regulator is to consider the people who, unlike lawyers and lobbyists, aren’t present at agency deliberations but who are affected by commission decisions.

“When you’re on a commission like this, when you’re on the Virginia commission, when what you do affects what people have to pay in their monthly bills — and God knows we have millions of people struggling to pay their bills these days,” Christie said. “When it affects whether their lights are going to stay on, you have to remember those people who are not in the room.”

FERC approves IBR reliability standards. FERC approved two North American Electric Reliability Corp. reliability standards that require inverter-based resources — wind, solar and battery systems — to ride through frequency and voltage excursions like faults on the transmission system instead of tripping offline.

The final rule largely adopted a proposal FERC issued in December. FERC directed NERC to review concerns raised by some stakeholders about the rules’ exemption provisions and potentially propose changes to them. Some stakeholders contend that without the changes, existing IBR projects may be forced into early retirement and projects that are under construction may be canceled before reaching operation, according to FERC.

“While providing latitude to address these two concerns raised by commenters, NERC and industry should be mindful of the commission’s overarching concerns … that a comprehensive and timely resolution is needed so that IBR performance no longer poses a threat to the reliable operation of the bulk-power system,” FERC said.

FERC eases hydro permitting requirements. During the meeting, See highlighted FERC’s July 3 decision to adopt two “categorical exclusions” that exempt certain hydroelectric activities from environmental impact statements and environmental assessments.

Categorical exclusions are types of actions that a federal agency has determined generally do not significantly affect the human environment. By adopting the two exclusions that are already used by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, it won’t take as long to get approvals for certain maintenance, replacement and safety enhancing projects at hydro facilities, according to See.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jdk-Yii3_oAUM3aevims0pa2AZtqhH1-IxPBaSScjBg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xNTU1OTg1MTUyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-07-26 12:03:34.910453

That’s what a coalition of consumers and environmental advocated said Friday after PJM Interconnection, which runs the power grid in Pennsylvania and parts or all of it in 12 other states, held a capacity auction.

A capacity auction is a mechanism to guarantee future electric supply. This year’s auction could result in rates going up another 5% next year, on top of hikes this year.

Advocates cite three reasons for the increase: “The ever increasing demand from data centers, lower reliability from gas-fired power plants and the continued delay in clearing primarily new clean energy and battery storage resources,” said Robert Ruth, Pennsylvania policy director for climate and energy at the National Resources Defense Council.

But PJM blamed the higher costs on the retirement of some older power plants and said it is doing everything it can to bring more energy supply into the grid. It also said it’s changing some rules and using AI to find ways to lower prices.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has a different theory. Last year, he filed a complaint with federal regulators over the auction process, calling it “the largest unjust wealth transfer in the history of U.S. energy markets.”

Shapiro said he was successful in getting PJM to lower its auction cap, shaving $8.3 billion from an earlier possible result. However, the governor said reform is still needed.",https://www.abc27.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2022/10/GettyImages-1350713242.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-07-26 16:02:32.125101

Tesla needs 'actual new' models to generate excitement again

Tesla Inc. Chief Executive Elon Musk ""let the cat out of the bag,"" as he put it, earlier this week, saying that one of the long-awaited cheaper Tesla electric vehicles would look a lot like a pared-down version of the Model Y.

The notion that at least one of the more affordable Tesla models - the company keeps mentioning cheaper vehicles, plural, in its communications with investors - would be fundamentally a Model Y has been around for months.

The confirmation of sorts came as Musk made off-the-cuff remarks on the post-results call this week - right after another Tesla executive said that the company didn't want to get into a discussion about what the car would look like - but that is likely to do little to pull Tesla (TSLA) out of its sales slump.

That's because to really get people excited about the brand again, Tesla needs ""actual new vehicle models,"" not just updates to existing ones, CFRA analyst Garrett Nelson said in an interview.

""It's been over five years now since Tesla made its first Model Y delivery, and the only new model the company has brought to market in that time has been the Cybertruck,"" Nelson said.

Musk and other executives did not mention the Cybertruck at all during the call. Their emphasis was entirely on robotaxis and a future robotaxi network, and on the company's Optimus robot.

A revamped Model Y, launched earlier this year, appears to have done little for Tesla sales.

Tesla delivered 384,122 EVs in the second quarter, down from 444,000 in the same quarter of 2024. The company groups Model 3 and Model Y sales together and does not offer sales breakdowns by country or region.

On the call, Musk went as far as promising to offer robotaxi services to roughly half the U.S. population by the end of the year.

""Meanwhile, competition has increased, overall EV sales growth is waning - and the tax-credit expiration won't help - and consumers have since shown much greater interest in hybrids, so Tesla is really paying the price for dragging its feet on new models over the last few years,"" Nelson said.

Lower-priced vehicles are usually money losers, as well. Several carmakers have either done away entirely with entry-level cars or sent their production lines overseas to try to boost slim profit margins.

Some see those cheaper cars as gateway vehicles to a brand. But brand loyalty is not as strong as it used to be, as consumers have been increasingly squeezed by higher prices and interest rates.

The average price of a new car in the U.S. has hovered around $48,000 this year, and that's before tariff costs are factored in. In June 2020 it was about $39,000, according to Edmunds.com. General Motors Co. (GM) said this week it plans to raise prices of its North American vehicles by between 0.5% and 1%.

For Tesla, the economics of a lower-priced vehicle would be highly dependent on consumers also subscribing to Full Self Driving (Supervised), Tesla's suite of advanced driver-assistance systems meant for city driving, which is available as a one-time purchase for $8,000 or as a $99 monthly subscription.

Many people might be ""reluctant"" to go for that, Nelson said.

In the post-results call with analysts, Musk said that the ""biggest obstacle"" for the cheaper Model Y is that people want to buy the car but don't have enough money to make the purchase.

""Literally, that is the issue. Not a lack of desire, but lack of ability. So the more affordable we can make the car, the better,"" he said.

But Wall Street is not so sure about the desire part of the equation. Interest in EVs in general has waned, and the Tesla brand has been badly damaged by Musk's involvement in right-wing politics in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Musk then went on to presumably alienate some supporters of President Donald Trump by very publicly feuding with the president and vowing to start a third political party in the United States.

Several investment banks have dialed down sales expectations for Tesla. While a small sales boost could come from a cheaper Model Y entering volume production later this year, there's a bigger drag ahead, as federal tax credits for EVs are slated to end in late September.

Morgan Stanley on Thursday tweaked its sales forecast lower for the second half of the year and for 2026, saying the move was ""a result of the removal of EV consumer tax credits,"" partly offset by the cheaper Model Y reaching volume production this year. The investment bank expects sales of 1.85 million Teslas next year, down from a previous expectation of 1.89 million.

The FactSet consensus is for sales of 1.65 million Tesla vehicles this year, below the 1.79 million sold in 2024 and the 1.81 million in the year before that. The consensus for 2026 is at 1.95 million.

And while consumers might appreciate the option to buy a cheaper Model Y, Wall Street largely has set its sights on robotaxis and the Optimus humanoid robots as the real future moneymakers at Tesla.

The ""overwhelming key to the Tesla story over the next year is the success of its Unsupervised FSD technology and robotaxi traction,"" Stephen Gengaro at Stifel said in a note Friday.

A successful expansion of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, plus a potential rollout in a few other markets ""is likely a catalyst for the shares,"" Gengaro said.

Meanwhile, Tesla's stock continues to underperform the broader equity market. The stock is down about 21% this year, including an 8% wallop on the first trading day after the most recent quarterly results. The S&P 500 index SPX has gained around 9% in 2025.

The thing is, it's not anymore just an EV play, but it's also not a robo taxi robot company already.","On the Tesla earnings call, Elon Musk hinted at master plan, his next master plan he's working on. Now, master plan number two, if you go back, they are dropped in 2023, April 5th, the day after my uh my birthday. That's how I remember it. Um lots of talk about the green economy. I would think his next master plan will lean into robots and AI. How do you view Tesla here? Is it still a car maker first? Or is it a, is an AI play that should be put on the same pedestal as anvidia?

Yeah, you just mentioned the the great problem here with AI. When we look at valuation, investors also do not know exactly how to value it. Is it an EV maker? Is it more than that? Um, I think we are in the transition phase. So, it's a very critical phase for Tesla at the moment. The thing is, it's not anymore just an EV play, but it's also not a robo taxi robot company already. So, we we have struggles here, and especially with Tesla, we have to be a little bit careful. There is a lot of um, yeah, broken promises down the road, right? A lot of huge um promises, but but then delayed launches and and and it doesn't really realize all that much. So, I think we have to be a little bit careful here. And for us to being able to be a buyer here, we would need really some food, we would need to see some food on the ground, and we would need to see some realization first.

Ali, um, you know, on the earnings call last night, I was looking for something that would hint to me earnings estimates have bottomed in Tesla for this year and next year. We've been tracking that a lot. You could track this on the Yahoo Finance platform. Just go to the Tesla ticker page, click analysis and you can find these numbers. But they have continued to trend lower really over the past year. I didn't get that from this earnings call. It was unclear to me. Has the auto business bottomed? Uh, is Elon really going to truly go all in on robo taxis? Because if he is, this is going to be a very costly endeavor with an unproven top-line benefit.

Yeah, Tesla seems to be a company that's stuck between what it was, what it is, which is that pure EV play, and really what it wants to be, which is this AI powerhouse leaning in on robots, autonomous driving. But that is definitely far out down the line, and we still have murky timelines there for when we could see these rollouts be more aggressive, and ultimately, when that's going to be a profitable part of the business. The EV side of Tesla's business, that's the bread and butter. That's what makes them money. And we're seeing sales slow in the US, in Europe. There's a heck of a lot of competition on that front. So, I get why investors are frustrated. And now with Trump's one big beautiful bill, that's going to be removing those EV tax credits. So that's going to weigh on demand for Tesla's business. That's also going to impact the energy side of the business because those solar tax credits are going to be removed. And that's something executives also talked about on the call. So there just seems to be a lot of hurdles here for a company that's looking way out into the future.

Costs of electric vehicles in the US could drop by $6,000+ with LFP batteries.

The Chinese EV industry dominates with over 80% of new EVs using LFP technology.

GM, Samsung, and LG plan to convert US battery plants to produce LFP batteries for mass-market EV models.

Electric vehicle costs in the US could drop by $6,000 or more. Ford, GM, and Tesla have all invested heavily in LFP battery production in the US, partnering with LG, Samsung, and in the case of Ford, using tech from Chinese battery giant CATL. Stellantis has also partnered with CATL to build an LFP factory in Spain.

Lithium-iron Phosphate or LFP is cheaper than the original Lithium-ion NMC that the EV industry was built on, but until quite recently, this technology was not suitable for use in most EVs. Major technological advances, mainly in China, have improved LFP batteries to the point where they're replacing Lithium-ion batteries around the world.

The dominance of the Chinese EV industry -- with BYD recently surpassing Tesla as the biggest EV maker -- is based on its LFP dominance to a large extent. Over 80% of new EVs in China use LFP, and this technology is gaining traction in Europe and other markets where China has a footprint. The only notable LFP in the US was in the Model 3 discontinued last year, as well as in mass storage batteries. However, it's all about to change.

GM, Samsung, and LG

Cost savings in mass-market models

Korean battery giants Samsung and LG plan to add LFP manufacturing capacity to their US plants co-owned by GM. These plants currently produce NCM (nickel-cobalt-manganese) batteries. This move is the result of pressure from GM to lower EV costs to boost lagging uptake.

GM's strategy seems to envisage a two-tier system, with its mid-range, mass-market models using LFP, and its premium vehicles staying with NCM. Models like the Bolt, Equinox, Blazer EV, and Silverado EV will get LFP batteries, while the GMC Hummer EV and Cadillac Lyriq will keep using NCM. GM is known to be keen on LFP EVs under $30,000. Moving from NCM to LFP can cut battery costs by 20 to 30%, or at least $6,000 per vehicle.

GM's move is in line with expectations in the industry, where cost pressure on EV are rising. The move to LFP for volume vehicles will likely happen across all carmakers with EVs in their lineups.

Converting existing plants

Samsung and GM have a $3.5 billion joint venture facility in Indiana set to begin production of NCM batteries in 2027, and will convert part of this capacity to LFP. Samsung is currently securing supply chains and redesigning equipment for this move.

LG will convert its existing plants in Tennessee and Ohio to allow LFP manufacturing there.

Ford Michigan plant

Bringing manufacturing back

Ford has publicly acknowledged China's technological lead in EVs and their batteries, and it faced massive criticism when it started building a battery factory in Michigan in 2023 that would depend on Chinese technology. Ford defended its decision to use CATL's tech under license at the plant because it would bring back manufacturing expertise long ceded to China. This initiative will not only create jobs in the US, but also give Ford access to the technology it needs to compete globally.

Ford plans to launch the LFP batteries in a series of affordable EVs from 2027 on. It isn't clear how much of a role CATL will play in the Ford venture, beyond the original licensing agreement.

Tesla's Nevada battery factory

From big batteries to cheaper cars?

Tesla, with its major presence in China, has long had relationships with CATL and BYD outside the US. A lesser-known, but quite massive, part of its business is producing enormous electricity supply systems (ESS), massive batteries that can charge during oversupply and feed the grid when power supplies are lower. Although its new Nevada plant is believed to use CATL LFP equipment and technology for these large storage cells, it could provide an indirect pathway into the US market.

This possible relationship is currently more in the realm of conjecture, but Tesla, like all EV makers, is under pressure to lower prices. This pressure will get more urgent once the EV tax rebate falls away at the end of September.

LFP batteries

Invented in Texas, perfected in China

LFP (lithium-iron-phosphate) batteries were invented in Texas in 1997, and are cheaper than the ones using nickel and cobalt, because they use widely available materials. Until a couple of years ago, LFP was not really suitable for EVs, because they did not have the same energy density as lithium-ion batteries.They were used in mass storage, where size and weight were not an issue. But Chinese companies like CATL and BYD have invested heavily in this more affordable technology and managed to increase the density in specifically designed batteries, bringing range, size, and weight into parameters that make them ideal for EVs.

These companies now control most of the patents and manufacturing expertise needed to make LFP batteries.

LFP vs NMC-based

Both LFP and NMC batteries have advantages and drawbacks.The advantages of LFP are:

Raw materials are cheaper and easier to find

Cheaper to manufacture

Does not use cobalt, often sourced from conflict areas

Can handle heat and high voltage better

Degrade slower

Less prone to overheating or catching fire

Disadvantages of LFP are:

Lower energy density

Shorter range for same size battery

Slower charging in cold weather

Advantages of NMC:

More energy density

More power and range

Can charge faster

Disadvantages of NMC

Degrades in heat and with high voltage

Relies on conflict materials

More expensive

LFPs are still very new

LFPs have only really been an option for EVs from around 2020, and the technology is rapidly improving. BYD, for example, has developed its Blade Battery, which allows LFP to get the same power and range as NMC-type batteries. GM has just unveiled a manganese-rich battery which it considers a game-changer; others are working on graphene, while the elusive solid-state battery should go into production pretty soon.",https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tesla-model-s-plaid.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 15:02:28.863466

With legislation set to eliminate popular tax credits, experts are urging Americans to act quickly before the money is no longer on the table.

What's happening?

Thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), eligible individuals could access tax credits and rebates for electric vehicles, heat pumps, and solar panels.

Many of the credits were instant rebates at the point of sale, making these changes easier and more affordable for everyday people.

But under the Big Beautiful Bill, many of those incentives will vanish, starting in September 2025. That means anyone planning eco-friendly improvements could lose out on thousands of dollars unless they act sooner rather than later.

Advocates at clean energy groups have warned that the new legislation would significantly undermine recent progress.

Ari Matusiak, CEO of Rewiring America, stated that the plan ""doesn't just burden families, it undermines our country,"" emphasizing that it cuts consumer-facing credits that have helped households save thousands and improve energy efficiency.

Why is the IRA important?

This isn't just about saving money — it's also about protecting your health and improving your home.

Fortunately, some aspects of the IRA have survived, including rebates for heat pumps, insulation, and induction stoves.

The latter is a smart upgrade for households. Gas stoves release pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide, which scientists have linked to asthma and other health risks, especially in children.

Induction stoves offer a safer, faster, and more cost-effective solution. And right now, the Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate Program can knock up to $840 off the cost of an induction range.

But with the uncertainty surrounding government policy on these rebates, it's best to act soon.

If they do disappear, portable plug-in induction burners start at just $50 and work on any standard outlet. This tech is also great for those who rent or don't have the budget for a full range.

What can I do to make the most of the IRA incentives?

If you've been thinking about upgrading your home, now's the time to act. Rebates and tax credits are still available for weatherproofing your home, upgrading your HVAC system, installing electric appliances, and more. Many of these improvements can lower your utility bills in the long run — and help cut pollution at the same time.

Induction stoves, for example, boil water nearly twice as fast as gas or traditional electric ones, use less energy, and don't release harmful fumes into your kitchen. That makes them a smart choice for your wallet and your health.

Just don't wait too long. Take advantage of what's available now, and your future self (and your budget) will thank you.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/home-improvement-tax-creditsimage-recnJzzB2zQjOn0iO-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 12:04:33.674424

Construction is underway, with the system expected to come online by the start of the Fall semester.
College officials estimate the project will yield annual savings of approximately $300,000 in electricity costs.
These credits, combined with the anticipated utility savings, could allow the college to recoup the full project cost within 10 to 12 years.
“This project reflects who we are and who we want to be,” Gilgour said.","Mineral Area College (MAC) is moving forward with its large-scale solar energy project, which is expected to save the school hundreds of thousands of dollars annually while significantly reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing sustainability efforts across the campus.

The project, approved by the MAC Board of Trustees in January 2025, is being built on approximately eight acres of college-owned property located behind the softball fields on the main campus in Park Hills. The Board selected A.P.C. Solar as the contractor in a competitive bidding process. Construction is underway, with the system expected to come online by the start of the Fall semester. When completed, the system will produce about 3 megawatts of direct current (DC) power and is projected to generate up to 80% of the electricity needed for the facilities it serves. College officials estimate the project will yield annual savings of approximately $300,000 in electricity costs.

“We believe this is not only a smart financial investment, but a necessary step to modernize and position the college for a sustainable future,” said MAC President Dr. Joe Gilgour. “It allows us to lower our utility costs while aligning with our responsibility to be good stewards of both public funds and the environment.”

The project is funded through a bond issue approved by district voters in April 2024. By pursuing direct ownership of the system rather than using a lease or power purchase agreement, the college will be eligible for direct-pay federal tax credits offered through the Inflation Reduction Act. These credits, combined with the anticipated utility savings, could allow the college to recoup the full project cost within 10 to 12 years.

In addition to financial benefits, the solar array is expected to reduce the college’s greenhouse gas emissions by an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually—the equivalent of removing nearly 1,000 cars from the road. The college stated that it selected the site to minimize visual disruption and avoid any negative ecological impact, noting that the field behind the athletic complex had been previously unused.

College leaders say the project also supports MAC’s educational mission. The array is expected to provide opportunities for hands-on learning in areas such as environmental science, electronics, facilities management, and workforce development. Administrators are exploring the possibility of incorporating real-time solar data into science and technology courses, and faculty are being encouraged to develop new coursework related to renewable energy.

“This isn’t just a cost-saving measure—it’s a teaching tool,” said Gilgour. “Our students will have the opportunity to learn about solar technology not just from a book, but by observing and analyzing a system that’s producing real power right here on campus.”

Although the college does not currently have a formal sustainability plan, the project represents a significant step toward achieving its long-term environmental and operational goals. Officials say it will improve the school’s eligibility for future grants, raise its profile in sustainability initiatives, and serve as a model for other rural institutions considering similar investments.

The solar array is part of a broader strategy to reduce the college’s reliance on fossil fuels, lower operational costs, and reinvest savings into student services and infrastructure improvements.

“This project reflects who we are and who we want to be,” Gilgour said. “It’s forward-thinking, fiscally responsible, and rooted in the support we received from our community. We’re grateful for the opportunity to take this next step.”

Once completed, the system will be one of the largest solar installations among Missouri’s community colleges and is expected to be fully operational before the end of the Fall semester.

As data centers expand to process trillions of computations daily, the demand for reliable, scalable power infrastructure has surged. This creates a unique investment opportunity in underappreciated stocks that are strategically positioned to benefit from the AI-energy nexus. Among the most compelling plays are Argan (AGX), a leader in gas and renewable energy infrastructure, Constellation Energy (CEG), a nuclear power innovator, and DoorDash (DASH), a high-growth delivery platform leveraging AI to transform local commerce.

The AI-Driven Energy Landscape: A $Trillion Opportunity

AI's insatiable hunger for energy has forced a reevaluation of power infrastructure. Data centers alone are projected to consume 3% of global electricity by 2030, a 50% increase from 2023. This demand is driving a shift toward hybrid energy solutions—combining gas-fired plants for baseload reliability with renewables for sustainability. Companies that bridge this gap, like Argan and Constellation Energy, are poised to outperform traditional utilities.

Argan (AGX): The Infrastructure Engine Behind AI Growth

Argan Inc. (AGX) has emerged as a critical player in the energy transition, with a 36% year-over-year increase in project backlog to $1.9 billion in Q1 2026. This includes $1.26 billion in gas-fired projects and $532 million in renewables, reflecting its balanced approach to meeting AI infrastructure needs.

AGX's financials underscore its strength: revenue rose 23% to $193.7 million, driven by a 45% surge in Power Industry Services. Its gross margin expanded to 19%, up from 11.4% in Q1 2025, as higher-margin projects gained traction. The company's $546.5 million in cash and investments, coupled with $315 million in net liquidity, provides flexibility for share repurchases and dividend hikes.

Key projects like the 1.2 GW Sandow Lakes Power Station and a 700-MW gas plant highlight AGX's role in supporting data hubs. CEO David Watson's emphasis on long-term gas demand—driven by turbine bookings through 2030—adds visibility to future growth. However, supply chain delays and regulatory risks remain challenges. For investors, AGX offers a compelling leveraged bet on AI-driven energy demand, with a P/E ratio of 12.8 and a forward dividend yield of 1.2%.

Historical data shows that AGX has demonstrated a strong tendency for positive short-term performance following earnings releases, with a 71.43% win rate over 30 days, indicating investor confidence in its financial performance.

Constellation Energy (CEG): Powering AI with Nuclear Innovation

Constellation Energy (CEG) is uniquely positioned to capitalize on AI's energy needs through its nuclear fleet and strategic acquisitions. In Q1 2025, CEG secured a 20-year, 1.1 GW virtual power purchase agreement (PPA) with Meta, supplying carbon-free power from its Clinton Plant starting in 2027. This deal locks in premium pricing of $80–90/MWh, significantly above current market rates, and highlights nuclear energy's value for AI data centers requiring uninterrupted power.

CEG's financials reinforce its momentum: adjusted operating earnings grew 17.6% to $2.14/share in Q1 2025, and the company reaffirmed its $8.90–$9.60/share full-year guidance. The Inflation Reduction Act's production tax credits (PTC) add downside protection, with revenues from nuclear units expected to rise as incremental GWs are contracted.

The acquisition of Calpine, a natural gas generation leader, further diversifies CEG's energy mix, creating a coast-to-coast fleet. This move is projected to boost adjusted operating earnings by over 20% in 2026 and $2.00/share through 2029. CEG's stock has surged 45% since March 2025, trading at a P/E of 22.8, but its robust balance sheet and $1 billion share buyback program suggest room for further upside.

Historical analysis reveals CEG has shown a moderate positive trend post-earnings, with a 62.50% win rate over 30 days, reflecting steady investor interest despite slightly lower returns compared to AGX.

DoorDash (DASH): AI-Driven Commerce and Delivery Evolution

While not an energy provider, DoorDash (DASH) exemplifies how AI is reshaping local commerce. The company's 2025 AI-powered tools—such as the Item Description Generator and AI-Powered Camera—enhance merchant efficiency and customer engagement, driving a 44% increase in sales for participating restaurants. These tools are part of a broader strategy to transform DASH into a ""super-app"" for local commerce, with advertising revenue projected to grow from $1B to $2.6B by 2027.

DASH's recent acquisitions, including Deliveroo and Symbiosys, have expanded its global footprint to 40 countries and bolstered its adtech capabilities. Partnerships with Aldi and Starbucks further diversify its revenue streams, reducing reliance on food delivery margins. Despite regulatory challenges—such as Canada's drip pricing lawsuit—DASH's market cap of $92.29 billion and 279.23 P/E ratio reflect high growth expectations.

Strategic Entry Points and Market Momentum

The AI-energy infrastructure sector is still in its early innings, offering strategic entry points for investors with a 1–3 year horizon. Argan and Constellation Energy represent low-volatility, high-margin plays with clear tailwinds from AI-driven energy demand. DoorDash, while more speculative, offers exposure to AI's transformative impact on local commerce.

For AGX, a pullback to $28–$30 (from its current $32.50) could present a buying opportunity, given its strong backlog and dividend yield. CEG's stock, currently at $88, is undervalued relative to its 2026 earnings potential, making it a core holding for long-term energy portfolios. DASH, despite its high P/E, is justified by its advertising growth and AI-driven monetization, though investors should monitor regulatory risks.

AGX's strong post-earnings performance, with a 71.43% 30-day win rate, suggests that strategic entry points around earnings dates could enhance returns. Similarly, CEG's 62.50% win rate indicates that its post-earnings momentum supports its inclusion as a core holding.

Conclusion: Building the Future, One Megawatt at a Time

The convergence of AI and energy infrastructure is reshaping industries, creating opportunities for companies like Argan, Constellation Energy, and DoorDash to lead the charge. As data centers expand and local commerce evolves, these stocks offer a mix of strategic positioning, financial strength, and innovation. For investors seeking to capitalize on the AI revolution, a diversified approach—balancing infrastructure plays with high-growth disruptors—could yield outsized returns in the years ahead.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-26 15:02:01.845763

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies restored a severely impaired Class 3 electric truck from an estimated 40 km of Effective Driving Range (limited by a Defective Cell) to an estimated 265 km of post-intervention range-representing an estimated 225 km increase (563% improvement) using its patent-pending Prototype 2.0 diagnostic and rebalancing platform. Compared to the estimated Baseline Range of 100 km prior to rebalancing, this restoration reflects a 165 km increase, or a 165% improvement in driving range.

Prototype 2.0 successfully diagnosed and enabled targeted replacement of a Defective Cell within a parallel-connected group, which had caused premature vehicle shutdown below 60% state of charge (SOC)-demonstrating critical diagnostic precision in real-world conditions.

The Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention restored the Electric Truck's functionality, corrected a severe voltage imbalance in a 144-cell NMC battery pack, and demonstrated measurable recovery of battery performance under real-world driving conditions.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news releases dated June 6, July 4 and July 18, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a second real-world electric vehicle (EV) battery rebalancing procedure (the ""Rebalancing Procedure"") and driving performance trial (the ""Performance Trial"") under its Commercial Revenue Share Agreement (the ""Revenue Share Agreement"") with an arm's-length, independent automobile service center based in Vancouver, BC (the ""Automotive Service Center""), which specializes in servicing out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles.

The Rebalancing Procedure and subsequent Performance Trial demonstrated a significant improvement in estimated driving range for a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck"") following a complete rebalancing process using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

Performance Trial Results

The baseline estimated driving range of the Electric Truck prior to the Rebalancing Procedure was approximately 100 kilometers (km) (the ""Baseline Range""). This estimate was based on a pre-rebalancing controlled driving trial conducted under mixed city and highway conditions, during which the vehicle consumed approximately 39% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 39 km.

Prior to the Rebalancing Procedure (defined herein) and Intervention (defined herein), the Electric Truck exhibited a critical issue where it became inoperable once the state of charge (SOC) dropped below approximately 60%. Although the baseline driving range of the battery pack was estimated at 100 km under normal conditions, the presence of a Defective Cell (defined herein) caused the Electric Truck to shut down prematurely, limiting effective driving range to just ~40 km (the ""Effective Driving Range""). This discrepancy highlights the material impact of undiagnosed cell-level defects on real-world EV performance. Following the identification of a Defective Cell within the Affected Group (defined herein) using Prototype 2.0's integrated cell diagnostics, the entire Affected Group was replaced with a specification-matched Replacement Group (defined herein). Together with the Rebalancing Procedure, this intervention restored the Electric Truck's effective driving range to an estimated 265 km-an improvement of approximately 225 km, or 563% from the Effective Driving Range, and an improvement of 165 km, or 165%, from the Baseline Range.

Following completion of the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a controlled Performance Trial on the Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing improvements in estimated driving range and battery efficiency under actual operating conditions. During this post-rebalancing trial-also conducted under mixed city and highway conditions-the Electric Truck utilized approximately 17% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 45.1 km.

Based on this data, the post-rebalancing estimated driving range of the Electric Truck is approximately 265 km under no-load conditions. This reflects a net increase of approximately 165 km compared to the pre-rebalancing condition-representing an improvement of approximately 233%.

The Performance Trial results demonstrate a significant improvement in both effective battery capacity and real-world driving range of the Electric Truck. These results further support the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution and underscore its broader applicability across commercial electric vehicle fleets and other light-duty EV use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 km. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Performance Trial yielded an estimated range of approximately 265 km under no-load conditions following the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck parent company's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Performance Trial results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Performance Trial was performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.1

The Performance Trial results further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide technical validation supporting further evaluation of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Rebalancing Procedure and Cell Diagnostics

The Rebalancing Procedure was performed on the Electric Truck's 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack, which had developed significant voltage imbalance under real-world operating conditions (the ""Electric Truck Battery Pack""). The battery pack utilizes lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry.

At the time of inspection, the Electric Truck was effectively inoperable-even at a state of charge (SOC) as high as 60%-indicating a critical disruption in battery functionality. Specifically, once the SOC dropped below approximately 60%, the vehicle was unable to engage or sustain drive mode, rendering it immobile and unfit for road use, highlighting the severity of the cell imbalance and the urgent need for corrective intervention.

Using its integrated diagnostic system, Prototype 2.0 identified one specific group of parallel-connected cells registering approximately 3.56 volts (V) (the ""Affected Group""), while the remaining cells in the battery pack measured closer to 3.86V (the ""Initial Voltage Target""). Since the vehicle could not operate with a group of cells falling below ~3.6V, the Affected Group was identified as the likely source of the operational failure.

An initial Rebalancing Procedure on the Electric Truck Battery Pack was performed with the intent to rebalance the voltage of the Affected Group to the Initial Voltage Target. However, due to time constraints, the Rebalancing Procedure was only partially completed, and the Electric Truck Battery Pack was left idle overnight for diagnostic observation. By the following morning, the Affected Group, identified using Prototype 2.0's integrated diagnostic system, exhibited a voltage decline of approximately 140 millivolts (mV), indicating potential abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline characteristics of a battery cell within the Affected Group.

To further assess voltage retention within cells of the Affected Group, Electric Truck Battery Pack was fully charged using a Level 2 charger, with all cells but the Affected Group reaching approximately 4.10V-referred to as the ""Voltage Target"". The Initial Voltage Target and Voltage Target fall within the standard operating range for NMC lithium-ion cells (3.0V to 4.20V), with 4.20V typically recognized as full capacity.2

After a second overnight observation, one individual cell within the Affected Group displayed an abnormal voltage drop relative to the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack, including the Affected Group (the ""Defective Cell""), which at that time was at 4.05V. In this context, a Defective Cell refers to a battery cell exhibiting abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline. While such cells can technically be rebalanced, their atypical behavior may comprise group-level voltage stability, reduce usable capacity, and negatively impact long-term battery performance. Prototype 2.0's ability to isolate and identify Defective Cells is a key diagnostic advantage, enabling targeted interventions that aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Rebalancing Procedure.

To address the potential long term implications on battery capacity, technicians at the Automotive Service Center-acting under the Revenue Share Agreement-replaced the Affected Group, which included the Defective Cell, with a specification-matched set of cells (the ""Replacement Group"") to ensure compatibility with the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack (the ""Intervention""). The Rebalancing Procedure was then rebalanced to the Target Voltage, and reintegrated into the Electric Truck Battery Pack.

Under typical conditions, a final Rebalancing Procedure of the Electric Truck Battery Pack-including the newly installed Replacement Group-would have been recommended at this stage to achieve optimal voltage balance and uniformity across all cells in the Electric Truck Battery Pack. However, due to time constraints, the vehicle advanced directly to the Performance Trial phase. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, had this final Rebalancing Procedure been conducted, the recovery in battery capacity and driving range would have been even more pronounced.

Notably, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, while the Defective Cell was a primary contributor to the Electric Truck's inoperability at approximately 60% SOC, its targeted replacement served as an enabling measure to restore localized stability rather than the principal driver of performance recovery. The subsequent Rebalancing Procedure, during which the Repaired Group was brought to the Voltage Target, was the key intervention that re-established acceptable operating tolerances and materially improved the battery pack's functional capacity. Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.

These results underscore the diagnostic precision and corrective capabilities of Prototype 2.0, which not only rebalances imbalanced lithium-ion battery packs but also identifies and isolates Defective Cells that may impact long-term performance. This integrated functionality supports more efficient battery maintenance and scalable reconditioning-particularly valuable in high-utilization commercial EV fleets.

Significance of Results

The results of the Performance Trial, Rebalancing Procedure, and Prototype 2.0's demonstrated Defective Cell diagnostic capabilities (collectively, the ""Results"") confirm that Prototype 2.0 is not only capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance, but also of identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only demonstrate the technical effectiveness of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance and identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Performance Trial further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of degraded battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023.3 With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units,4 a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years. 5,6

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage.5,6 This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements.7 As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only demonstrate the technical effectiveness of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance and identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Performance Trial further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of degraded battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023.3 With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units,4 a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years. 5,6

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage.5,6 This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements.7 As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.
Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing.","News Release Highlights:

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies restored a severely impaired Class 3 electric truck from an estimated 40 km of Effective Driving Range (limited by a Defective Cell) to an estimated 265 km of post-intervention range-representing an estimated 225 km increase (563% improvement) using its patent-pending Prototype 2.0 diagnostic and rebalancing platform. Compared to the estimated Baseline Range of 100 km prior to rebalancing, this restoration reflects a 165 km increase, or a 165% improvement in driving range.

Prototype 2.0 successfully diagnosed and enabled targeted replacement of a Defective Cell within a parallel-connected group, which had caused premature vehicle shutdown below 60% state of charge (SOC)-demonstrating critical diagnostic precision in real-world conditions.

The Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention restored the Electric Truck's functionality, corrected a severe voltage imbalance in a 144-cell NMC battery pack, and demonstrated measurable recovery of battery performance under real-world driving conditions.

Battery X Metals Inc. (CSE:BATX)(OTCQB:BATXF)(FSE:5YW, WKN:A40X9W)(""Battery X Metals"" or the ""Company"") an energy transition resource exploration and technology company, announces that further to its news releases dated June 6, July 4 and July 18, 2025, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies Inc. (""Battery X Rebalancing Technologies""), has successfully completed a second real-world electric vehicle (EV) battery rebalancing procedure (the ""Rebalancing Procedure"") and driving performance trial (the ""Performance Trial"") under its Commercial Revenue Share Agreement (the ""Revenue Share Agreement"") with an arm's-length, independent automobile service center based in Vancouver, BC (the ""Automotive Service Center""), which specializes in servicing out-of-warranty Tesla vehicles.

The Rebalancing Procedure and subsequent Performance Trial demonstrated a significant improvement in estimated driving range for a fully electric Class 3 commercial vehicle, or light-duty electric vehicle (the ""Electric Truck"") following a complete rebalancing process using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending second-generation lithium-ion battery rebalancing hardware and software platform (""Prototype 2.0"").

Performance Trial Results

The baseline estimated driving range of the Electric Truck prior to the Rebalancing Procedure was approximately 100 kilometers (km) (the ""Baseline Range""). This estimate was based on a pre-rebalancing controlled driving trial conducted under mixed city and highway conditions, during which the vehicle consumed approximately 39% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 39 km.

Prior to the Rebalancing Procedure (defined herein) and Intervention (defined herein), the Electric Truck exhibited a critical issue where it became inoperable once the state of charge (SOC) dropped below approximately 60%. Although the baseline driving range of the battery pack was estimated at 100 km under normal conditions, the presence of a Defective Cell (defined herein) caused the Electric Truck to shut down prematurely, limiting effective driving range to just ~40 km (the ""Effective Driving Range""). This discrepancy highlights the material impact of undiagnosed cell-level defects on real-world EV performance. Following the identification of a Defective Cell within the Affected Group (defined herein) using Prototype 2.0's integrated cell diagnostics, the entire Affected Group was replaced with a specification-matched Replacement Group (defined herein). Together with the Rebalancing Procedure, this intervention restored the Electric Truck's effective driving range to an estimated 265 km-an improvement of approximately 225 km, or 563% from the Effective Driving Range, and an improvement of 165 km, or 165%, from the Baseline Range.

Following completion of the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies conducted a controlled Performance Trial on the Electric Truck to evaluate post-rebalancing improvements in estimated driving range and battery efficiency under actual operating conditions. During this post-rebalancing trial-also conducted under mixed city and highway conditions-the Electric Truck utilized approximately 17% of its available battery capacity to travel a distance of 45.1 km.

Based on this data, the post-rebalancing estimated driving range of the Electric Truck is approximately 265 km under no-load conditions. This reflects a net increase of approximately 165 km compared to the pre-rebalancing condition-representing an improvement of approximately 233%.

The Performance Trial results demonstrate a significant improvement in both effective battery capacity and real-world driving range of the Electric Truck. These results further support the technical effectiveness and commercial potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution and underscore its broader applicability across commercial electric vehicle fleets and other light-duty EV use cases.

The Electric Truck parent company has represented that the Electric Truck's expected driving range under maximum payload conditions is approximately 290 km. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' Performance Trial yielded an estimated range of approximately 265 km under no-load conditions following the Rebalancing Procedure and Intervention. Although these figures were obtained under different load scenarios, the close alignment between the Electric Truck parent company's reported range and the post-rebalancing estimate supports the reliability of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' testing methodology. Furthermore, the Performance Trial results underscore the potential of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing process to restore battery performance to levels consistent with the high end of manufacturer-reported specifications.

The Performance Trial was performed under no-load conditions; it is relevant to note that payload can have an effect on energy consumption and overall driving range. This consideration is consistent with widely recognized industry dynamics and is disclosed to provide a complete and transparent understanding of factors that may influence real-world vehicle performance. Range may vary based on payload, terrain, driving behavior, and other operational conditions.1

The Performance Trial results further validate the effectiveness and market relevance of Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary rebalancing solution in restoring degraded battery capacity and materially extending the remaining useful life of commercial electric vehicle batteries. The Company believes these results provide technical validation supporting further evaluation of Prototype 2.0's broader commercial deployment, particularly in fleet environments where range reliability, battery lifespan longevity, and total cost of ownership are mission-critical considerations.

Rebalancing Procedure and Cell Diagnostics

The Rebalancing Procedure was performed on the Electric Truck's 144-cell lithium-ion battery pack, which had developed significant voltage imbalance under real-world operating conditions (the ""Electric Truck Battery Pack""). The battery pack utilizes lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) chemistry.

At the time of inspection, the Electric Truck was effectively inoperable-even at a state of charge (SOC) as high as 60%-indicating a critical disruption in battery functionality. Specifically, once the SOC dropped below approximately 60%, the vehicle was unable to engage or sustain drive mode, rendering it immobile and unfit for road use, highlighting the severity of the cell imbalance and the urgent need for corrective intervention.

Using its integrated diagnostic system, Prototype 2.0 identified one specific group of parallel-connected cells registering approximately 3.56 volts (V) (the ""Affected Group""), while the remaining cells in the battery pack measured closer to 3.86V (the ""Initial Voltage Target""). Since the vehicle could not operate with a group of cells falling below ~3.6V, the Affected Group was identified as the likely source of the operational failure.

An initial Rebalancing Procedure on the Electric Truck Battery Pack was performed with the intent to rebalance the voltage of the Affected Group to the Initial Voltage Target. However, due to time constraints, the Rebalancing Procedure was only partially completed, and the Electric Truck Battery Pack was left idle overnight for diagnostic observation. By the following morning, the Affected Group, identified using Prototype 2.0's integrated diagnostic system, exhibited a voltage decline of approximately 140 millivolts (mV), indicating potential abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline characteristics of a battery cell within the Affected Group.

To further assess voltage retention within cells of the Affected Group, Electric Truck Battery Pack was fully charged using a Level 2 charger, with all cells but the Affected Group reaching approximately 4.10V-referred to as the ""Voltage Target"". The Initial Voltage Target and Voltage Target fall within the standard operating range for NMC lithium-ion cells (3.0V to 4.20V), with 4.20V typically recognized as full capacity.2

After a second overnight observation, one individual cell within the Affected Group displayed an abnormal voltage drop relative to the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack, including the Affected Group (the ""Defective Cell""), which at that time was at 4.05V. In this context, a Defective Cell refers to a battery cell exhibiting abnormal self-discharge and persistent voltage decline. While such cells can technically be rebalanced, their atypical behavior may comprise group-level voltage stability, reduce usable capacity, and negatively impact long-term battery performance. Prototype 2.0's ability to isolate and identify Defective Cells is a key diagnostic advantage, enabling targeted interventions that aim to enhance the overall effectiveness of the Rebalancing Procedure.

To address the potential long term implications on battery capacity, technicians at the Automotive Service Center-acting under the Revenue Share Agreement-replaced the Affected Group, which included the Defective Cell, with a specification-matched set of cells (the ""Replacement Group"") to ensure compatibility with the rest of the Electric Truck Battery Pack (the ""Intervention""). The Rebalancing Procedure was then rebalanced to the Target Voltage, and reintegrated into the Electric Truck Battery Pack.

Under typical conditions, a final Rebalancing Procedure of the Electric Truck Battery Pack-including the newly installed Replacement Group-would have been recommended at this stage to achieve optimal voltage balance and uniformity across all cells in the Electric Truck Battery Pack. However, due to time constraints, the vehicle advanced directly to the Performance Trial phase. Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, had this final Rebalancing Procedure been conducted, the recovery in battery capacity and driving range would have been even more pronounced.

Notably, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies believes that, while the Defective Cell was a primary contributor to the Electric Truck's inoperability at approximately 60% SOC, its targeted replacement served as an enabling measure to restore localized stability rather than the principal driver of performance recovery. The subsequent Rebalancing Procedure, during which the Repaired Group was brought to the Voltage Target, was the key intervention that re-established acceptable operating tolerances and materially improved the battery pack's functional capacity. Collectively, these actions restored vehicle operability and resulted in a measurable increase in effective driving range under real-world operating conditions.

These results underscore the diagnostic precision and corrective capabilities of Prototype 2.0, which not only rebalances imbalanced lithium-ion battery packs but also identifies and isolates Defective Cells that may impact long-term performance. This integrated functionality supports more efficient battery maintenance and scalable reconditioning-particularly valuable in high-utilization commercial EV fleets.

Significance of Results

The results of the Performance Trial, Rebalancing Procedure, and Prototype 2.0's demonstrated Defective Cell diagnostic capabilities (collectively, the ""Results"") confirm that Prototype 2.0 is not only capable of effectively rebalancing lithium-ion battery packs exhibiting significant, naturally occurring cell imbalance, but also of identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This successful outcome builds upon previously disclosed validation milestones achieved by Battery X Rebalancing Technologies, including third-party technical validation conducted by the National Research Council of Canada (as referenced below), as well as the Company's news release dated May 30, 2025, announcing the successful rebalancing of a naturally imbalanced Nissan Leaf battery pack-the second most common out-of-warranty electric vehicle platform in the United States.

Importantly, the Results not only demonstrate the technical effectiveness of Prototype 2.0 in an Electric Truck application, but also demonstrate its potential to recover substantial lost battery capacity resulting from cell imbalance and identifying Defective Cells that can materially impact battery capacity and as demonstrated in this instance, vehicle operability. This performance reinforces the relevance of the Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' patent-pending technology in practical, real-world scenarios and highlights the broader need for scalable, cost-effective battery recovery solutions. The Performance Trial further substantiates the commercial viability of Prototype 2.0 as a solution to extend the remaining useful life of degraded battery packs in commercial electric vehicle fleets.

The Problem: Rising EV Adoption Presents New Battery Lifecycle Challenges

In 2024, global EV sales reached approximately 17.1 million units, representing a 25% increase from 2023.3 With cumulative global EV sales from 2015 to 2023 totaling an estimated over 40 million units,4 a significant share of the global EV fleet is expected to exit warranty coverage over the coming years. 5,6

By 2031, nearly 40 million electric, plug-in hybrid, and hybrid vehicles worldwide are anticipated to fall outside of their original warranty coverage.5,6 This projection is based on current EV adoption figures and standard industry warranty terms, and underscores a growing risk for EV owners facing battery degradation, reduced capacity, and costly replacement requirements.7 As the global EV fleet continues to expand, the demand for technologies that extend battery life, reduce long-term ownership costs, and support a sustainable transition to electric mobility is increasing.

The Solution: Pioneering Next-Generation Technologies to Support Lithium-Ion Battery Longevity

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' proprietary software and hardware technology aims to address this challenge by extending the lifespan of EV batteries. This innovation is being developed with the aim to enhance the sustainability of electric transportation and the goal to provide EV owners with a more cost-effective, environmentally friendly ownership experience by reducing the need for costly battery replacements.

Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology, validated by the National Research Council of Canada (""NRC""), focuses on battery cell rebalancing. The NRC validation demonstrated the technology's ability to effectively correct cell imbalances in lithium-ion battery packs, recovering nearly all lost capacity due to cell imbalance. The validation was conducted on battery modules composed of fifteen 72Ah LiFePO₄ cells connected in series. The cells were initially balanced to a uniform state of charge (SOC), with a measured discharge capacity of 71.10Ah. In the validation test, three of the fifteen cells were then artificially imbalanced-one cell was charged to a 20% higher SOC, and two cells were discharged to a 20% lower SOC-resulting in a reduced discharge capacity of 46.24Ah, following rebalancing using Battery X Rebalancing Technologies' rebalancing technology.

These advancements establish Battery X Rebalancing Technologies as a participant in lithium-ion and EV battery solutions, aiming to tackle the critical challenges of capacity degradation of battery packs and expensive replacements. By extending the lifecycle of battery materials within the supply chain, Battery X Rebalancing Technologies aims to support the energy transition and promote a more sustainable future.

President Trump’s recent proclamation will permit 25 chemical manufacturers, including 12 in Louisiana, to bypass new federal emission limits.

Last week, Trump issued “regulatory relief for certain stationary sources to promote American chemical manufacturing security.” This created a two-year exemption from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) May Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants, or the HON rule.

“The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations,” Trump said in his proclamation. “Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions.”

The facilities in Louisiana now exempt from the HON rule include:

Shell Chemical, Geismar

Dow Chemical Co. Glycol II, Plaquemine

Formosa Plastics, Baton Rouge

Union Carbide/Dow Chemical, Hahnville

Westlake Vinyl, Westlake

BASF Corp., Geismar

Rubicon, Geismar

Citgo Petroleum, Lake Charles

TotalEnergies Polystyrene, Carville

Denka Performance Elastomers, LaPlace

Sasol Chemicals, Lake Charles

DuPont Specialty Products, LaPlace

Congressman Troy A. Carter, Sr. said Trump’s proclamation is based on the false claim that there is already strict government oversight of chemical facilities.

U.S. Rep. Troy A. Carter, Sr. sharply criticized Trump’s proclamation this week for granting a two-year exemption to 12 petrochemical companies in Louisiana, calling the decision “appalling” and a threat to public health.

“As the U.S. Congressman from Louisiana—where most of these petrochemical facilities are located—I find it appalling that this administration shows so little regard for the health of communities, families, and workers living near these plants.

Carter, a Democrat representing Louisiana’s 2nd Congressional District, emphasized that industry and communities can coexist only when “the safety and well-being of people come first.”

“Granting twelve petrochemical companies in Louisiana a two-year exemption from a 2024 rule that aimed to reduce pollution and cancer risk is reckless. That rule was designed to lower emissions of toxic chemicals, such as ethylene oxide and chloroprene, by over 6,200 tons per year and reduce cancer risk by up to 96% for nearby communities.

“Polluters and violators should not get a free pass. We can protect jobs and protect people—but profits should never come at the cost of public health. I am committed to holding these companies—and this administration—accountable,” he said.

Many facilities on Trump’s HON rule exclusion list have environmental concerns, with Denka Performance Elastomers in Laplace being the most prominent.

In February 2023, the EPA and DOJ sued the company, alleging that its neoprene operations pose an imminent threat to public health due to cancer risks associated with chloroprene emissions.

The Biden administration has demanded that Denka reduce chloroprene and ethylene oxide emissions at its LaPlace plant. The EPA gave Denka 90 days, unlike the two years allotted for other facilities. Gov. Jeff Landry accused the federal agency of trying to shut down the Denka site.

Within weeks of Trump returning to the White House, the Justice Department had the EPA lawsuit dismissed. In September, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality reported a chloroprene leak at the Denka plant, forcing it to halt operations. The EPA identified five census tracts in LaPlace with the highest chloroprene exposure in the U.S., all linked to the Denka plant.

Other incidents at the exempted chemical plants have also made the news.

In July 2023, a fire at Dow Chemical’s glycol plant in Plaquemine burned for two days. The plant has experienced multiple emergencies since 2019, including four unauthorized releases of ethylene glycol, a flammable and toxic compound that can cause kidney damage with prolonged exposure.

In January 2022, an explosion at the Westlake Chemical complex in Calcasieu Parish injured six people and led to school lockdowns until the smoke cleared. Federal records indicate that the plant has a history of spills, accidents, and injuries.

Before Trump took office again, the EPA enforced financial penalties on facilities that violated safety and environmental rules. The agency reached a $1.4 million settlement early last year with Sasol Chemicals over an “alleged accident” in October 2022 that caused a fire burning 8 tons of triethyl aluminum, a catalyst used to produce synthetic materials and jet fuel.

Sarah Melotte and Julia Tilton // The Daily Yonder

A charging station can have anywhere from several to several dozen charging ports. The term “charger” refers to the hardware. While chargers and ports might seem interchangeable, they’re not. It gets tricky because one charger can have the hookups for more than one vehicle. The number of ports, then, is a useful metric for mapping how EV charging infrastructure is built out in any given area.

In rural areas, charging ports have been slower to come online than in metropolitan areas. That’s partly because of low utilization, or the amount of time the ports are plugged in and providing vehicles with electricity. In cities like San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Miami, where a greater share of the cars on the road are EVs, charging ports can have utilization rates as high as 30% or 40% during peak hours, which are typically in the evening. For much of the rest of the country, though, and particularly in less densely populated rural areas, utilization rates tend to be in the teens or lower.

North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana have the lowest state-wide utilization rates in the country, according to Loren McDonald, Paren’s chief analyst. Rural counties in those states also have the fewest charging ports.

“There just aren’t a lot of them on the road there locally to have that sort of baseline level of usage of those stations,” said McDonald.

The rural charging catch-22

Few EV drivers and a limited number of charging stations pose a dilemma for rural areas looking to expand EV charging infrastructure. Beyond ideological and price considerations, drivers may be hesitant to switch to EVs when there are few places to charge them, while at the same time, investors are hesitant to build charging stations because there aren’t many EV drivers on the road. In order for privately funded charging stations to break even on their investment, utilization rates have to hit certain percentages, usually greater than the teens or low twenties.

“The deck is stacked against those rural areas,” McDonald said. “There aren’t the trends and the economic viability to motivate private industry to put them there.”

To mitigate what McDonald calls this “emerging charging divide,” state and federal-level government programs offer competitive funding for developers to build out EV charging infrastructure in rural areas.

However, the Trump administration has made funding at the federal level difficult for states to access. In February, the Trump administration suspended funding from the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program. Several states and nonprofit organizations, including Earthjustice, the Sierra Club, and Plug in America, have since sued the government for withholding the funds, which were authorized by Congress in 2021.

On May 22, the Government Accountability Office found that the Department of Transportation, which administers the program under the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), does not have the authority to suspend NEVI and that the agency must continue to carry out the requirements of the program. The court case brought by states and nonprofits is still pending.

Funding for NEVI is designed to be allocated to states over a five-year period. The FHWA has allocated a total of $3.3 billion of NEVI funding to states through fiscal year 2025. States had awarded or obligated $527 million when the Trump administration suspended the program, and an estimated 57 NEVI-funded charging stations had opened across 15 states.

Of those NEVI-funded charging stations, 19 are in Ohio, where Bill Ferro, Paren’s chief technology officer, said many are in rural areas. This has to do with Ohio’s major interstate highways that run North-South and East-West through rural counties. In November and December 2024, when traffic increased during the holiday season, utilization rates spiked for Ohio’s rural EV chargers. Ferro said the stations are an example of how NEVI projects can be successful in rural areas.

“We would say they were the best use of NEVI funding in that they were outside the major cities, and they were intended to allow that great American Road Trip to go,” said Ferro.

Another hotspot on the map is in La Paz County, Arizona, where there are 140 ports, more than any other rural county in the country. Like in Ohio, an interstate is responsible for the buildout, Ferro and McDonald said. Interstate 10 connects Los Angeles to Phoenix, and one Tesla Supercharger station right off the highway has 84 ports.

As of early June, states are still waiting to see how the future of NEVI is resolved, and some have paused the application process for the next cycle of funding. While the program’s freeze has been a blow to rural areas looking to build out their charging infrastructure, McDonald stressed that NEVI is not the only source of money available to communities.

“Almost every charging station in America has some type of incentive, grant, or tax credit,” McDonald said. “NEVI gets all the headlines, but there are lots of other sources of incentive and grant money to offset costs.”

Utility companies and states have ""make-ready"" incentives to prepare sites to power EV charging stations. Some programs will cover the cost of getting sites connected with the utility and any construction that's needed before the ports go in. Other programs offer rebates for the hardware, helping to facilitate the buildout of EV charging stations in places where private investors would otherwise not be interested in installing charging ports.

McDonald sees the government’s role in funding EV chargers as a way to ensure Americans have access to services regardless of where they live. He compared the current buildout of EV infrastructure to the Rural Electrification Act, which provided federal loans for the installation of rural electrical systems in the 1930s. In that era, the government stepped in to ensure communities had access to electric services in places where private investors didn’t see a way to make a profit.

“There are some things that literally require government help, or otherwise it’s never going to happen,” McDonald said.

Across the U.S., EV sales grew in 2024, increasing the share of EVs among all car sales, according to the International Energy Agency's annual report released in May.

Your take?

The EPA’s signal on coal plants stems from its ability to regulate CO2 output from industrial plants under a 2007 Supreme Court ruling on the Clean Air Act. The CAA language, originally intended to control true pollutants like sulfur and nitrogen oxides (SOX and NOX), was written so broadly as to include anything that would “reasonably endanger public welfare.” Justice Scalia, in dissent, said this language would include “frisbees and flatulence.” Calling CO2 a pollutant is akin to calling water a pollutant. Yes, too much CO2 in the atmosphere will certainly kill us, but, as we’ve seen a lot this summer, too much water will do the same. Before humans started pumping CO2 into the atmosphere, the concentration of that essential gas was at a planetary low. If it had fallen much further, photosynthesis would have stopped, and along with it, life on Earth.

That said, the Supreme Court ruling isn’t outrageous. The problem is that prematurely decommissioning coal plants doesn’t make our lives better. The regulations passed concerning the CO2 output from coal plants effectively make them illegal and must be shut down by 2030. Hurrah, right? Coal is dirty, and we should get rid of it anyway. But coal plants provide 24/7 baseload power and cannot be replaced with wind and solar. Even if you believe in miracles that Colorado reaches our 2030 climate goals (zero chance of that), it makes no sense to shut down base load generation until we have a replacement. In late May, the Department of Energy issued an emergency order to delay the shutdown of a coal plant. A few days later, power demand surged, and a blackout was averted only because that plant was still operating.

I understand the desire to reduce CO2, but let’s not cut off our nose to spite our face. Nowadays, natural gas power plants are half the price of coal plants, provided there is pipeline infrastructure. It is unlikely that any new coal plants will be built in the U.S. Ally Sullivan, a Polis spokesperson, stated that utilities plan to transition to “more stable clean energy.” That phrase is oxymoronic. There might be valid reasons to use more wind and solar power, but stability is not one of them. There is nothing stable about wind or solar. They are intermittent. If and until we have viable energy storage, they cannot replace baseload power. Coal power remains essential in the U.S.

Making s’mores is a summer ritual for millions of Americans. Next week, my grandson, Ellis, will come out to Colorado. My wife and I will be sure to tutor him in the fine art of roasting marshmallows. The confection must be held above the flame so that the sugar glazes to a golden brown on all sides. If held too close to the fire, it ignites and is transformed into blackened ash, carbon waste, and one must start over.

The residue of burned coal is coal ash, carbon waste, and currently, 1.6 million tons of coal ash is spread across 15 acres between Valmont Butte and Leggett reservoir in Boulder. It seeps into the groundwater, according to Xcel Energy, at “acceptable levels.”

One hundred years ago, the Valmont smokestack was the pride of a growing city; now it stands as a reminder that, with fossil fuels, we are too close to the flame. Coal is used to convert water into steam, which produces electrical energy. Coal was the engine of the Industrial Revolution and propelled the Front Range into the 20th Century. But we inhabit a new century and face a new moment.

Trump and other climate deniers must not lead us into a future fueled by coal. Trump, through executive order, seeks to promote “Clean Coal.” We know such phrasing from “1984” as “doublespeak,” language that distorts or reverses the intended meaning of words. George Orwell would agree, there is no such thing as “clean coal.” Trump has doubled down on doublespeak. In his administration, the EPA has become the AEP, Abolish Environmental Protection. We must weigh the needs of the environment against the need for increased energy production and finally admit that coal is among the worst sources of pollution in the world and has pushed climate change to the crisis point. The Trump cabal wants to keep the coal burning and loosen environmental protections. The EPA has now federally mandated that coal-burning power plants be kept operative despite state regulations and wishes.

In 1966, Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” detailed the impact of human activity on the natural world. In 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency was formed, followed by the passage of the Clean Air Act. Soon after, public service companies went to court to seek variances against regulation. People pushed the government, and the government responded. In the Trump Administration, we are going backwards … again.

Like the first celebrants of Earth Day, we must put Earth first. This is urgent. All other concerns orbit around this priority. Toast your summer marshmallows, not the planet.

The Environmental Protection Agency has signaled it may reject Colorado’s plan to count coal plant retirements toward meeting clean air goals under the Clean Air Act (CAA). The law requires states to submit State Implementation Plans (SIPs) outlining how they will reduce specific pollutants to meet federal air quality standards. Once approved, SIPs become enforceable under federal law. While the CAA doesn’t address climate change or carbon emissions directly, it does regulate regional haze — a visibility issue affecting national parks and wilderness areas that many states have used as an indirect way to support coal plant closures. Colorado followed that precedent, including planned retirements in its SIP as a practical way to meet federal goals.

The EPA now claims the CAA doesn’t allow states to include coal closures as credit toward meeting haze targets — despite decades of precedent under both Republican and Democratic administrations. It also suggests the closures may violate the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause, arguing they amount to an uncompensated seizure of private property. But coal plants are already heavily regulated, and states routinely impose such requirements without raising constitutional issues. The EPA appears determined to avoid any federal fingerprints on coal plant closures, framing them as purely local decisions — even though the legal basis for including them in the SIP remains strong.

If the EPA rejects Colorado’s SIP, it is legally obligated to impose a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) within two years unless a revised plan is approved. What happens next is uncertain. The agency might argue that further regulation isn’t needed, or be legally compelled to impose costly retrofits and pollution controls to meet the same air quality targets. Either outcome serves no one well — not Colorado, not the utilities operating the coal plants, and not even the federal government. Rejecting the SIP risks an inefficient path forward, especially when the state’s plan relies on a plant already scheduled for closure. It’s a counterproductive move driven more by political optics than practical outcomes.

The good news is that Colorado’s energy transition is well underway, with or without federal approval. Utilities like Tri-State are retiring coal plants simply because it no longer makes economic sense. Maintenance is costly, retrofits expensive, and natural gas remains cheap and flexible. Even more promising, renewables like wind and solar are now the lowest-cost sources of new energy. Tri-State’s plan to shut down the Craig coal units by 2028 reflects this shift.

Still, it’s a bittersweet transition. Natural gas, while cleaner than coal, is far from carbon-free. And companies like Xcel Energy will surely weigh regulatory risk against operational cost — not just act out of principle. What’s ultimately at stake is precedent. Colorado’s closures are secure, but if this legally untested EPA stance takes hold, it could constrain future climate action and render the Clean Air Act even less relevant in a rapidly changing energy landscape.

Nuclear power is too costly, too risky and too slow to deploy.
And not only would nuclear power not support renewable energy generators on the grid, it would also actually work against these clean, low-cost technologies.","As the last coal plants in Colorado shut down, nuclear power proponents are campaigning to replace them with nuclear reactors. An advisory committee for the city of Pueblo recommended that Xcel replace its Comanche 3 coal plant with an “advanced nuclear power plant.” Bolstering that effort, the Colorado Legislature recently passed a bill redefining nuclear as a “clean energy resource.”

Colorado’s only experience with nuclear power was not a good one. The Fort St. Vrain reactor near Platteville operated from 1979 until 1989, when it was shut down due to safety problems. It took three years to decommission the plant at a cost of $125 million, which, like the $200 million of plant costs, was passed on to Xcel ratepayers. A special facility has stored 244 canisters containing the reactor’s high-level radioactive waste for the past 36 years. Ultimately, they will need to be transported over Colorado roads to an as yet unidentified deep geologic site to be stored for thousands of years.

Should Colorado give nuclear power a second look? I argue no for three key reasons.

High cost and high risk

According to the financial firm Lazard, the cost of the electricity produced by a nuclear power plant (in dollars per kilowatt-hour) is three times that of solar and wind. The only new reactors recently built in the U.S., Vogtle Units 3 and 4, were completed seven years behind schedule at a cost of $36.8 billion — more than two and a half times the original budget. That high cost has resulted in higher electricity bills for Georgia Power ratepayers.

There is much talk today about developing new, untested small modular reactors, or SMRs (defined as 300 megawatts or smaller in size) to ostensibly lower the cost, and this is the technology being promoted in Pueblo. The problem here is that virtually anything — be it a power plant or a container of pretzels from Costco — is cheaper per unit item the bigger it is. Nuclear plants have gotten much larger over time because of this economy of scale. The Vogtle units are each 1,100 MW. A 300 MW plant will have a higher capital construction cost per kilowatt, and its delivered electricity cost will also be significantly higher. The one SMR design approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NuScale, which was scheduled to be built in Idaho, was canceled because its projected capital cost had risen to $20,000 per kilowatt — more than 10 times that of utility-scale solar with battery storage.

Very long lead times

The total time from concept to operation for a new nuclear power plant is about 15 years, compared to solar and wind plants, which take one to two years. Fifteen years is a long time to wait to address climate change and air pollution. And during that time, you could spend far less money deploying solar and wind and preventing all those emissions.

Bad fit for Colorado’s renewables-based electric grid

Nuclear proponents argue that because nuclear plants run 24 hours a day, they can fill in the gaps when solar and wind are not available. But let’s take a closer look at that claim. Xcel plans to provide 80 percent of its electricity from solar and wind in just the next five years. Although Colorado is very sunny year-round, grid operators must be prepared for occasional “dark lull” periods of four days or more when local solar and wind resources are limited by the weather. Xcel plans to burn stored natural gas in low-cost combustion turbines during these brief periods.

Now imagine if new nuclear power plants come onto the grid in 15 years. Like all nuclear plants in the U.S., they will need to be run at full power 24 hours a day to sell enough electricity to pay off their high debt. So, what happens when an occasional dark lull occurs, and solar and wind power drop off? The utility won’t be able to boost nuclear plant output because it will already be at full power. Furthermore, because it will duplicate power already being provided by solar and wind, it will cause that renewable electricity to be wastefully curtailed.

Nuclear power is too costly, too risky and too slow to deploy. And not only would nuclear power not support renewable energy generators on the grid, it would also actually work against these clean, low-cost technologies.",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-07-26 15:01:46.833876

On one hand, the recently signed federal “One Big Beautiful Bill” pulls back from recent progress that has been made in clean energy production, limiting our energy options instead of supporting an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy.

That means fewer jobs, less economic growth and an electric grid that will become increasingly strained under continued and unprecedented demand for more power.

On the other hand, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick and President Donald Trump were in Pittsburgh recently to announce a whopping $90 billion in energy and technology investments in Pennsylvania.

Among them is a plan from Westinghouse Electric Company to build 10 new, large nuclear power plant reactors across the U.S. – expected to generate $6 billion in investment and 15,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania alone.

There is widespread support for more investment in safe, reliable nuclear power.

Pennsylvania has a strong nuclear legacy and generates the second most nuclear energy in the country.

To lead the new nuclear resurgence, we’ll have to exceed our current pace. As other states are making investments in advanced nuclear energy technology, Pennsylvania should be next.

That’s why we’re calling on federal and state leaders to renew their commitment to an energy future that keeps Pennsylvania at the forefront of energy dominance.

That means setting aside party labels and advancing commonsense energy policy that is solution-driven and puts Pennsylvanians first.

Nuclear power can play an important role in our clean energy future, but we must also include other energy sources and technologies, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.

Only through a comprehensive approach to our energy policy can we ensure our power supply is reliable, clean and affordable – not just today, but for future generations.

Portland General Electric (NYSE: ) presented its latest investor presentation on July 25, 2025, highlighting the company’s strategic focus on clean energy transition and robust industrial load growth. The vertically integrated energy company serves approximately 950,000 retail customers and covers roughly half of Oregon’s population, including the high-tech ""Silicon Forest"" corridor.

PGE’s stock has faced challenges recently, closing at $39.73 on July 25, 2025, near its 52-week low of $39.55, despite posting better-than-expected earnings in Q1 2025. The company’s shares saw a modest 4.2% gain on the presentation day, with minimal after-hours movement.

Strategic Initiatives

PGE outlined a comprehensive investment thesis centered on clean energy transition, grid modernization, operational efficiency, and capitalizing on its high-growth service area. The company is particularly focused on meeting increasing demand from semiconductor manufacturers and data centers.

As shown in the following investment thesis overview:

The company is advancing plans to form a holding company structure, with an application filed with Oregon regulators in July 2025 and an estimated effective date in mid-2026. This restructuring aims to provide greater flexibility for non-regulated investments and transmission development.

Financial Performance Highlights

PGE reported 2024 revenue of $3.4 billion and diluted earnings per share of $3.01 (GAAP) and $3.14 (adjusted non-GAAP). For 2025, the company has provided adjusted non-GAAP guidance of $3.13-$3.33 per share, reaffirming its long-term earnings growth target of 5-7%.

The company’s financial performance shows improvement after a challenging 2023, with accounting ROE trending upward from 7.5% in 2023 to 8.8% in 2024, though still below the allowed ROE of 9.5% (9.34% for 2025).

The following chart illustrates PGE’s long-term financial performance:

Dividend growth has remained consistent, with a 5.7% CAGR from 2016 to 2025 (estimated). The company maintains its long-term dividend growth guidance of 5-7%, aligning with its earnings growth targets.

As shown in the following dividend growth chart:

Capital Expenditure & Growth Plans

PGE’s five-year capital expenditure forecast totals $6.5 billion, driving an expected 7% average rate base growth from the 2024 base year of $7.0 billion. With potential incremental RFP (Request for Proposal) opportunities, this growth could increase to 9%, reaching a rate base of $10.9 billion by 2029.

The capital expenditure plan is detailed in the following chart:

The company’s rate base growth projection is illustrated here:

PGE maintains strong liquidity of $980 million as of June 30, 2025, and plans equity financings of approximately $300 million per year to support its capital program.

Demand Growth & Service Area

One of PGE’s most compelling growth drivers is the robust industrial load expansion in its service territory. The company reported an 8.2% CAGR in industrial load from 2019-2024, with semiconductor and high-tech customers representing approximately 50% of industrial load, followed by data centers and AI at 25%.

The following chart details this demand growth:

Oregon ranks as the fifth-largest data center market nationally, with over $40 billion in ongoing high-tech investment expected to create approximately 6,300 jobs in the region. This trend aligns with the company’s Q1 2025 results, which showed a 16.4% increase in industrial load, contributing to total load growth of 4.6%.

Clean Energy Transition

PGE has made significant progress toward its decarbonization goals, with the company more than one-third of the way toward the emission reductions needed to meet its 2030 target. The company aims to reduce emissions by 80% by 2030, 90% by 2035, and achieve 100% clean energy by 2040.

The company’s emission reduction trajectory is shown here:

In 2024, PGE completed construction of the Clearwater 311 MW wind energy facility and integrated 292 MW of battery storage. The company’s current resource mix includes 45% non-emitting energy sources, as shown in the following chart:

PGE is also investing in transmission infrastructure to support its clean energy goals, with projects focused on ""last mile"" connections, Pacific Northwest regional upgrades, and interregional projects.

Operational Excellence & Customer Focus

The company highlighted improvements in key operational metrics, including a Lost Time Incident Rate of 0.26 in 2024 (improved from 0.29 in 2023) and second-quartile performance in System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI).

PGE has maintained strong customer satisfaction, ranking #1 in 2024 for customer experience and maintaining the top-ranked renewable power program in the United States for 15 consecutive years.

As shown in the customer focus highlights:

Outlook & Guidance

Looking ahead, PGE reaffirmed its 2025 adjusted earnings guidance of $3.13 to $3.33 per diluted share. The company expects long-term load growth of 3% annually through 2029, driven primarily by continued industrial expansion.

Key regulatory proceedings include a Seaside ARM (Automatic Rate Mechanism) with a requested effective date of October 2025 and a Distribution System Plan ARM with a requested effective date of April 2026.

PGE’s resource planning includes a reprice opportunity for its 2023 RFP in Q3 2025, with project in-service dates expected in 2027. The company also plans to issue a new RFP to the market in Q3 2025, with final contracts expected in the second half of 2026.

Despite the positive outlook presented, investors should note that PGE’s stock has underperformed recently, trading near its 52-week low despite beating EPS expectations in Q1 2025. The revenue miss in Q1 ($928 million vs. expected $976.05 million) may be contributing to investor caution despite the company’s strong industrial growth narrative.

The country watched in horror as torrential rain drenched Texas earlier this month, sweeping at least 135 people to their death. Kerr County alone lost 107, including more than two dozen children at Camp Mystic.

From afar, it would be easy, even tempting, to think that floods like these could never happen to you. That the disaster is remote.

It’s not.

As details of the tragedy have come into focus, the list of contributing factors has grown. Sudden downpours, driven by climate change. The lack of a comprehensive warning system to notify people that the Guadalupe River was rising rapidly. Rampant building in areas known to flood, coupled with incomplete information about what places might be at risk.

These are the same elements that could trigger a Kerr County type of catastrophe in every state in the country. It’s a reality that has played out numerous times already in recent years, with flooding in Vermont, Kentucky, North Carolina and elsewhere, leaving grief and billions of dollars in destruction in its wake.

“Kerr County is an extreme example of what’s happening everywhere,” said Robert Freudenberg, vice president of energy and environmental programs at the Regional Plan Association. “People are at risk because of it, and there’s more that we need to be doing.”

The most obvious problem is we keep building in areas prone to flooding. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, produces readily available maps showing high-risk locales. Yet, according to the latest data from the nonprofit climate research firm First Street Foundation, 7.9 million homes and other structures stand in a FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area, which designates a location with 1 percent or greater chance of being inundated in any given year.

In Louisiana, a nation-leading 23 percent of properties are located in a FEMA flood zone. In Florida, it’s about 17 percent. Arkansas, New Mexico, and Nebraska are perhaps less expected members of the top 10, as is New Jersey, which, with New York City, saw torrential rain and flooding that killed two people earlier this month.

Texas ranks seventh in the country, with about 800,000 properties, or roughly 6.5 percent of the state’s total, sitting in a flood zone. Kerr County officials have limited authority to keep people from building in these areas, but even when governments have the ability to prevent risky building projects, they historically haven’t. Although one study found that some areas are finally beginning to curb floodplain development, people keep building in perilous places.

“There’s an innate draw to the water that we have, but we need to know where the limits are,” said Freudenberg. “In places that are really dangerous, we need to work toward getting people out of harm’s way.”

Kerr County sits in a region known as Flash Flood Alley, and at least four cabins at Camp Mystic sat in an extremely hazardous “floodway.” Numerous others stood in the path of a 100-year flood. When the Christian summer camp for girls underwent an expansion in 2019, the owners built even more cabins in the water’s path.

“It’s an unwillingness to think about what the future—and the present—have in store for us,” said Rob Moore, director of the Water and Climate Team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, or NRDC, about Americans’ tradition of floodplain development. ”It’s a reluctance to own up to the reality we live in.”

Many people don’t even know they are in harm’s way. According to the NRDC, 14 states have no flood disclosure laws, and in eight they deem the laws “inadequate.” FEMA maps are also flawed. For one, they can be politically influenced, with homeowners and communities often lobbying to be excluded in order to avoid insurance mandates and potential building costs. And experts say the science underpinning the maps is lagging too.

FEMA “only maps main river channels and coastal storm surge areas,” explained Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications research at First Street Foundation. The agency, he added, specifically doesn’t model heavy rainfall, isn’t great about indicating the risk of urban flooding, and is behind on accounting for climate change.

First Street built a flood model that tries to fill in those gaps. It found that 17.7 million people are at risk of a 100-year flood, a number that’s more than double what FEMA’s hazard area covers.The state rankings also change, with mountainous areas susceptible to inland flash flooding jumping up the list. West Virginia moves into first, with a staggering 30 percent of properties built in flood-prone areas. Kentucky climbs from 19th to sixth.

Texas remains at seventh, but the portion of properties at risk goes to 15 percent. In Kerr County, FEMA’s maps showed 2,560 properties (6.5 percent) in a flood zone. First Street’s model nearly doubled that.

“There’s a ton of unknown risk across the country,” said Porter, who says better maps are among the most important goals that policymakers can and should work toward. First Street has partnered with the real estate website Redfin to include climate risk metrics in its listings.

Rob Moore says political will is essential to making that type of systemic change when it comes to not only flooding, but other climate risks, such as wildfires or coastal erosion. Strengthening building codes and restricting development in high-risk areas will require similar fortitude.

“Governments and states don’t want to tell developers to not put things in a wetland, not put things in a floodplain,” he said. “We should be telling people don’t put them in a flatland, don’t build in a way that your home is going to be more susceptible to wildfire.”

Until then, hundreds of communities across the country could—and likely will—be the next Kerr County.","https://media.wired.com/photos/6883d21df4bf4fa0a2819967/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/Kerr-County-Tragic-Flood-Science-2224716293.jpg",N,,2025-07-26 08:00:33.659775

Only one in five Scots believe the energy transition away from oil and gas will create jobs, a new poll has revealed.

The nationwide survey, conducted by YouGov for the GMB and Prospect trade unions, shows that Scots have more at stake in the drive to cut emissions than anywhere else in the UK, but share far less confidence it will deliver economic or climate benefits.

The UK and Scottish governments have insisted that a just transition will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in clean technologies for former oil and gas workers as the industry declines, but the poll of 2,100 people across the UK reveals most Scots are unconvinced.

The survey suggests that 17 per cent of Scots work in the energy sector or know someone who does - a far higher proportion than anywhere else in the UK. But less than half, 47 per cent, feel positive about the transition from oil and gas to renewable energy - lower than in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - while 21 per cent feel negative, more than any of the other home nations.

Only 17 per cent of Scots think the transition will increase job opportunities, the lowest level of optimism across the country.

Louise Gilmour, GMB Scotland secretary, said: “Experienced and skilled workers across oil and gas know better than anyone what the scale of this transition will demand and what is at stake.

“Promises of green jobs tomorrow mean nothing when real jobs are being lost today and, so far, this transition has been something done to our workers and their communities not with them.

“These workers understand change and know how to make it happen but their expert voice has been drowned out by the din of politicians and campaigners making a noise instead of a plan.

“The insight and expertise of workers must be front and centre in this transition and, if it is not, this transition will fail.”

Prospect general secretary, Mike Clancy, added: “The government have raised the ambition on energy policy, which is welcome.

“Now they need to be bigger and bolder when it comes to energy jobs and put energy workers at the heart of this agenda.”

The Scottish Government is also under increasing pressure to reverse its ban on new nuclear power as the construction of new small modular reactors in England is poised to create thousands of well-paid jobs and apprenticeships.

Scottish Labour net zero spokesperson, Sarah Boyack, said: “Scotland can be a global clean energy superpower, but both the Tories and the SNP have been squandering this opportunity.

“Under the SNP green jobs targets have been missed, supply chain jobs have been sent abroad, our seabeds have been sold off on the cheap, and just transition funding has been frittered away with little to show for it.”

Scottish Conservative energy and net zero spokesperson, Douglas Lumsden, said: “With the SNP repeatedly missing their own emissions targets, it’s little wonder public confidence is collapsing in their ability to deliver the renewable jobs they keep promising.

“Warm words on green jobs are cold comfort to the thousands of skilled oil and gas workers who have been chucked on the scrapheap by both Labour and the SNP.”

Climate Action and Energy Secretary Gillian Martin said: “We’re clear in our support for a just transition for Scotland’s valued oil and gas sector, which recognises the maturity of the North Sea basin and is in line with our climate change commitments.

“Communities, workers, and trade unions are at the heart of Scotland’s renewable energy transition, and we are committed to ensuring local voices are central to any decisions we take, this includes the voices of the workforce within our oil and gas industry.

Congressman Gonzalez is fighting to ensure that South Texas voices are heard as the committees hear from Texans in other parts of the state as part of the ongoing redistricting process.

The full testimony is as follows:

Chairman King and Chairman Vasut:

As the United States Congressman proudly serving the 34th Congressional District of Texas, I write to convey my written testimony to this committee. First and foremost, I would like to assure that the record reflects the following: never in the history of our country have we seen the Governor of Texas bow down to a New Yorker. Gone are the days of tenacious and fiercely independent leadership in the Lone Star State.

I am ashamed to see such a blatant attempt to sell out Texans and shut out key communities – like my own in the Rio Grande Valley - from the process. Our community is strong, and we deserve to be properly represented during both this process and in Congress. I wrote to you all just a few days ago urging you to schedule a field hearing – in-person, not virtual – in the Rio Grande Valley, where all of our citizens have the opportunity to participate if they so choose.

My district is a hardworking and rapidly growing community of over 778,000 South Texans. It is home to SpaceX’s Starbase, two liquefied natural gas facilities, and the Port of Brownsville, the only deepwater port on the United States – Mexico Border, not to mention a multitude of land ports of entry that are economic drivers on not just the state scale, but on the international scale.

With all that we have to offer, our region finds it wholly unacceptable and disgusting that metropolitan areas such as Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth (Arlington), and Austin are afforded hearings for their populations, but the Rio Grande Valley, an entire region of the state, won’t have a physical hearing before our legislature decides to cheat the system and silence our voice. I am not asking for you to move heaven and earth, we are only asking for the Rio Grande Valley have the same opportunity as people in other parts of Texas – not have to travel hundreds of miles to do so.

Therefore, I urge the Texas House and/or Senate Select Committees on Congressional Redistricting to hold an official and in-person field hearing in the Rio Grande Valley that is accessible to all voters in our region. I remind the committees that the voters of Texas are watching closely, and they will remember this on election day.

DTE Energy's recent lawsuit against St. Clair County, Michigan, over solar regulations offers a microcosm of the broader tensions between local control and state-level clean energy mandates. For investors, this case underscores the critical interplay between legal uncertainty and the long-term viability of renewable infrastructure.

The Legal Battleground: Local Autonomy vs. State Mandates

At the heart of DTE's lawsuit is a clash over the interpretation of Public Act 233, a 2023 Michigan law designed to streamline large-scale solar development by preempting local zoning restrictions. St. Clair County's regulations—such as stricter noise limits (45 decibels vs. the state's 55 decibels) and requirements for visual obscurity—have been challenged as overreaching. DTE argues these rules effectively function as zoning laws, violating the intent of Public Act 233 to accelerate the state's transition to 80% clean energy by 2035 and 100% by 2040.

This dispute mirrors national trends. In New York and California, courts have increasingly affirmed state and local authority to enforce clean energy goals, even in the face of fossil fuel industry pushback. For example, New York's recent court victories for all-electric building laws highlight how judicial systems are becoming battlegrounds for the energy transition. Conversely, California's struggles with federal tax policy changes—such as shortened timelines for claiming solar incentives—show how external political shifts can disrupt state-level progress.

Implications for Utility Stocks and Renewable Infrastructure

The outcome of DTE's case could ripple across the sector. If the Michigan Supreme Court rules in favor of DTE, it may set a precedent limiting local governments' ability to impose restrictions on renewable projects, thereby accelerating solar deployment in the state. This would benefit utilities like DTE, which have invested heavily in solar and battery storage, but could also expose them to regulatory backlash from communities feeling disempowered.

Conversely, a win for St. Clair County might embolden other localities to adopt similar regulations, creating a patchwork of rules that complicate large-scale development. This scenario could slow the pace of renewable adoption, particularly in states where local governments hold significant sway. For investors, this duality highlights the need to assess not just technological or market risks but also regulatory volatility—a factor often overlooked in traditional ESG analyses.

National Trends and Investor Opportunities

The U.S. energy transition is increasingly defined by state-level innovation. In New York, streamlined permitting processes under the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act have cut project approval times from years to months. In contrast, California's permitting delays and federal policy uncertainties underscore the fragility of state-level gains in the face of national political shifts.

For investors, these dynamics present both risks and opportunities:

1. Regulatory Arbitrage: States with clear, supportive policies (e.g., New York, Colorado) offer safer bets for renewable infrastructure. Conversely, states with fragmented or contested regulations (e.g., Michigan, Texas) require deeper due diligence.

2. Legal Resilience: Utilities with strong legal teams and diversified portfolios—like NextEra Energy or Brookfield Renewable Partners—are better positioned to navigate regulatory uncertainty.

3. Policy Hedges: Investors might consider hedging against policy risks by allocating capital to companies with federal tax credit exposure (e.g., those benefiting from the Inflation Reduction Act) or those operating in multiple jurisdictions.

Strategic Recommendations for Investors

Diversify Jurisdictional Exposure: Avoid overconcentration in states with high regulatory risk. Prioritize regions with stable, pro-renewable policies and active permitting pipelines.

Monitor Legal Landscapes: Track court decisions and legislative updates in key states. Tools like regulatory calendars or legal risk indices can help identify emerging threats.

Leverage Policy-Linked Instruments: Consider green bonds or project finance structures tied to state-specific incentives, which can offset regulatory volatility.

Engage with Policy Advocacy: Long-term investors may benefit from supporting industry coalitions that push for regulatory clarity, such as the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA).

The organization Green Amendments for the Generations (GAFTG) is working state-by-state alongside community partners to get new state-level Green Amendments passed.","Reproductive justice means fighting for a safe, healthy environment for all children. Environmentalists are among those leading this fight.

At least 137 people are dead after devastating flash-flooding in Texas in early July, including many children. As climate change induced disasters grow more common and the Trump administration rolls back environmental protections, several organizations are pursuing creative legal strategies to defend children’s fundamental right to a safe, healthy and stable natural environment.

Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit public interest law firm, is currently suing the Trump administration to protect young people’s environmental rights. The firm has represented youth plaintiffs in climate litigation for over 10 years.

Green Amendments for the Generations, an independent 501(c)(3), is working to enshrine environmental rights explicitly in state constitutions across the country. The two organizations have a synergistic relationship, according to Green Amendments founder Maya van Rossum, J.D., and Our Children’s Trust litigator and co-director Mat dos Santos, J.D.

Environmental Justice, Reproductive Justice

The environmental movement (often youth-led and women-led) is a feminist fight by its very nature.

The three guiding principles of reproductive justice are the right to have a child, the right not to have a child and, importantly, the right to raise your children in a safe and healthy environment. Pollution and climate change, among other violations, are a clear threat to this third principle.

Almost 40 percent of older members of Gen Z doubt whether to have children because of the threat climate change poses, making the climate crisis a widespread reproductive justice issue.

The reproductive justice framework is a defining feature of contemporary feminist thought. It was coined by Black feminists to emphasize how every human rights issue impacts reproductive decision-making, especially for women of color and other vulnerable communities.

“I believe in the alignment of reproductive justice, racial justice, health justice, and environmental justice. I just think there’s this wonderful alignment that’s taking place,” Loretta Ross, reproductive justice pioneer and founding member of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective, told FEMINIST.

As pollution and climate change disproportionately impact Black and brown communities, women, younger generations, low-income people and people in the Global South, environmentalism remains intertwined with the fight for economic and racial equality as well as gender and reproductive rights.

Youth v. Gov

On behalf of 22 young people, Our Children’s Trust filed Lighthiser v. Trump in May as part of its multi-case Youth v. Gov effort, asserting that three of the president’s pro-fossil fuel executive orders violate their constitutional rights to life, health and safety.

The organization is suing under the Fifth Amendment for the right to life. They are also making an Ultra Vires claim (they claim Trump is acting outside his executive authority), and under the State-Created Danger Doctrine, claiming government inflicted harm.

“Children right now are suffering from extreme heat, illness, asthma, the flooding that’s happening in Texas. People are literally dying, being deprived of that most basic right [to life] … It is unlike anything we’ve ever seen, and we want to stop it,” dos Santos told Ms.

Children right now are suffering from extreme heat, illness, asthma, the flooding that’s happening in Texas. People are literally dying, being deprived of that most basic right [to life] … It is unlike anything we’ve ever seen, and we want to stop it.

Mat dos Santos, J.D.

On July 16, hundreds gathered outside the U.S. Capitol to hear from Lighthiser plaintiffs and members of Congress at a press conference hosted by Our Children’s Trust and several organizational partners.

The same day, the Children’s Fundamental Rights to Life and a Stable Climate System resolution was introduced by Sen. Merkley (D-Oreg.) and Reps. Schakowsky (D-Ill.), Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Raskin (D-Md.). More than 50 additional senators and representatives joined the resolution as cosponsors.

“As I speak, my rights to life and liberty are being violated. As I speak, more and more greenhouse gases are getting trapped in our atmosphere. As I speak, my health and safety is put in further jeopardy.” said lead plaintiff Eva Lighthiser, 19, at the press event.

Plaintiff Lander Busse, 20, told Ms. that his family’s “culture and way of life” in Montana “has been degraded” by climate change.

“Whether it’s the streams that we fish in,” he continued, “or the game we hunt so that we can put food on the table for our families, all of that is in jeopardy because of the impacts of climate change and the prioritization of fossil fuels in this administration.”

“We’re more optimistic than ever for the success of our case,” added Busse. “I’m an undefeated climate litigant at this point, so we’re going for the federal and we’re hoping to keep that record.”

The Green Amendment Movement

Lighthiser and Busse were also plaintiffs in Held v. State of Montana, in which the Montana Supreme Court ruled that state law restricting consideration of climate change in environmental reviews violated youth plaintiffs’ right to a clean and healthful environment.

The suit saw success largely because Montana has a Green Amendment.

Green Amendments are constitutional amendments in the Bill of Rights section of a constitution explicitly declaring the legal right to a safe, healthy and stable natural environment for all people. Such amendments are a powerful legal tool to advocate for climate action, environmental justice and multigenerational protection from dangerous ‘forever’ chemicals, pesticides and endocrine disruptors that impact reproductive health.

Thus far, only Montana, Pennsylvania and New York have Green Amendments. The organization Green Amendments for the Generations (GAFTG) is working state-by-state alongside community partners to get new state-level Green Amendments passed.

I want my children to have a happy, healthy future. The laws as written aren’t going to do that. They are going to sacrifice my children, and all children, to horribly degraded environments.

Maya van Rossum, J.D.

Led by Maya van Rossum and her daughter, Anneke Walsh van Rossum, J.D., GAFTG is creating new legal tools for environmental advocates. The organization has ongoing efforts in 32 states and federally.

Founded in 2014 after van Rossum’s victory suing Pennsylvania under the Commonwealth’s Green Amendment, GAFTG seeks to make environmental rights enforceable across the country.

“You have a right to free speech, but you don’t have a right to clean water and clean air,” van Rossum said, “You may have an inalienable human right, but it’s not enforceable under the law. Do you really have the right then?”

“Helping people understand that there is this fundamental failing in our system of environmental laws that needs to be addressed, and that the best way to address this is through constitutional reform, is part of the work [of Green Amendments for the Generations],” van Rossum added.

GAFTG-supported Green Amendment proposals even have provisions specifically protecting future generations. Van Rossum says this is intentional.

“Legally, that generational protection really raises the bar in terms of the quality of environmental protection that people can advocate for, and are entitled to,” van Rossum said. “Protecting the quality of water for the next week, month, year or even 10 years, opens the door to tremendous amounts of pollution, as compared to having a legal obligation to protect water over 50 years, 100 years, generationally.”

Van Rossum added that her push for multigenerational protection is also motivated by her identity as a mother.

“I have children, and I want my children to have a happy, healthy future. The laws as written aren’t going to do that. They are going to sacrifice my children, and all children, to horribly degraded environments,” van Rossum said. “We have a responsibility to make sure we are doing all we can to ensure the safety and security of future generations.”

We, feminists, often discuss the essential right to contraception and abortion. Intersectional feminists, particularly women of color and disabled women, have encouraged our movement to resist forced sterilization, eugenics and other forms of reproductive oppression, and to incorporate all human rights into the feminist movement.

The first and second components of reproductive justice—the right to have children and the right not to—are, of course, essential. Even so, those components are only part of a whole.",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 08:00:18.461418

The stated goal of the plan is to reduce budget expenditures, improve “science,” and have EPA’s research activities better support the work of the media offices, including the Office of Water (OW), Office of Air and Radiation (OAR), and Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP). The EPA press release refers to the effort as a continuation of “comprehensive restructuring” that includes a reduction in force (RIF) for the ORD and a subsequent savings of hundreds of millions of dollars. The release also announced the creation of a new EPA office, the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES), with a mission to “prioritize research and science more than ever before and put it at the forefront of rulemakings and technical assistance to states,” but provided no further information on the new office.

To Administration supporters, this is the latest chapter in the long overdue reorganization of federal programs to help reduce costs and trim back the “administrative state.” To detractors, it is yet another broad attack on regulatory programs in general, especially those at EPA, and specifically targets the scientific work of EPA and its research office. ORD personnel reorganization was among the many ORD-specific recommendations outlined in the Project 2025 document. Critics of the Administration’s efforts to cut EPA’s budget and staffing see the reorganization of ORD and its associated staff cuts as part of the larger attempt to reduce protections of the environment and health at EPA and other government agencies — as part of the agenda to “gut” EPA programs generally, even if some program offices (including OCSPP) gain positions.

ORD’s work, especially its Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), has been controversial for many years and the subject of intense industry and trade group criticism. Established in 1985 and revised periodically, the IRIS Program is an attempt at a uniform, agency-wide database of human health assessments for chemicals found in the environment that serves as the basis for regulatory actions across EPA. The goal is that each EPA program be consistent in its assessments and able to act according to the specific legislative requirements driving the work of the respective EPA offices. The IRIS Program has evolved over time; its database was made publicly available in 1988 and there are now opportunities for public input into the IRIS process. At its best, the IRIS Program is hailed by supporters as being an essential part of bridge-building between different forms of environmental science and the various offices of EPA.

IRIS critics, however, have claimed for years that the program is overly conservative in its assessment assumptions, biased in its selection of information evaluated, and secretive in avoiding public scrutiny of its underlying work and assumptions. A January 27, 2025, letter organized by the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and signed by over 80 organizations affected by the work of the IRIS Program asserts:

IRIS has often fallen short of scientific standards required of EPA and is out of step with global health agencies and regulators. IRIS fails to adequately incorporate high quality and relevant science and does not consistently utilize a “weight of the scientific evidence” approach. Also, the process IRIS uses to prioritize and select chemicals for assessment lacks transparency.

For years, ORD has been subject to legislation introduced in Congress in response to the assertion of critics, most recently the “No IRIS” Act introduced in the House and Senate in February 2025 (H.R. 1415 and S. 623, respectively). The IRIS Program has been reviewed by the General Accountability Office (GAO) at various times over the years and found to indeed have program deficiencies (e.g., timeliness, lack of guidance) cited by critics as evidence of its ineffectiveness. EPA has implemented actions to satisfy the recommendations made by GAO, but some stakeholders remain very critical.

Critique of the IRIS Program is just one facet — there has been a long-standing assault on ORD’s assessment policies and assumptions used in ORD evaluations. In February 2025, partly in response to this sustained assault, EPA employees and supporters created Stand Up for Science. This grassroots movement turned non-profit organization has hosted rallies, created policy goals, and garnered media attention. Of note, the Stand Up for Science website hosts the public Declaration of Dissent, signed by EPA staff and members of the public, and invites visitors to add their name to the Declaration. The Declaration itself is addressed to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and highlights five main concerns. Concern number four is “Dismantling the Office of Research and Development.” The Declaration states that the proposed ORD reorganization will make “EPA science more vulnerable to political interference,” and cites the proposed budget cuts for 2026 as leaving “ORD unable to meet the science needs of the EPA and its partners” and in a place that “will threaten the health of all Americans.”

What any reorganization of ORD or reform of science activities and policies will have to confront is the requirement for a scientific basis at the heart of any regulatory decision. Regardless of presidential priorities or allocated budgets, much of EPA’s work will remain dependent on the underlying science supporting whatever regulatory conclusions are proposed. Those programmatic conclusions will then be subject to public review and comment as part of the fundamental regulatory development process. In the end, even if ORD, as a separate program office, is taken off the EPA organization chart, the need to coordinate science policies and review procedures across EPA programs will remain. The development of the IRIS Program was a response to the need for agency-wide procedures to avoid conflicting science among internal EPA programs. A chemical’s production, exposure, and environmental release might cut across many EPA programs, subject to a variety of environmental laws. That centralized science function was developed over time to reduce, and ideally eliminate, inconsistent science and avoid overlapping, unsupported, or inadequate requirements.

After the reorganization and budget allocations are settled, it is not clear what procedures or administrators will fill those needed functions of integration, coordination, and consistency. Debates, especially high-profile controversies, are often more about the derivative outcomes of an assessment masking as debates than about the underlying data and evaluation procedures. Reorganizing the pieces on the chess board will not resolve or avoid such debates in the future.",https://www.lawbc.com/wp-content/uploads/epa03.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 12:04:01.223977

States like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island rely heavily on offshore wind to meet their emission targets.
He has repeatedly criticized wind energy as visually unappealing, environmentally harmful, and economically inefficient.
Scientists and marine experts overwhelmingly agree that offshore wind is not a threat to ocean life.
So, I urge the board to move forward with the SouthCoast Wind Project.”","“I’m a resident of Portsmouth. Not only am I a resident of Portsmouth, with a view of the Sakonnet River. I’m blessed where I live. It’s one of the most beautiful places in the Northeast. I’ve traveled throughout the world. I spent considerable time at McCorrie Point with my family, friends, and others. I even spend evenings there.

“I have a question for the siting board. Have you visited any sites along the Sakkonet in Portsmouth? You don’t have to answer, but I will make a suggestion. Please go to McCorrie Point so that you understand what you’re about to approve. I don’t have an opinion, but I can tell you that it doesn’t make sense. You are not crossing a river just to cross it. You’re traversing that river from its mouth to Brayton Point, the entire river, a class A, class one waterway, the only one in Rhode Island, and one of the few. It is imperative that we get this correct.

“What’s going to happen is - I’m not a scientist, I’m a statistical analyst by trade. I’ve done data science and analytics, so I look at numbers. I’m going to ask the siting board to consider this: Would you ever approve a project that you knew was destined for failure and would never be used? You don’t have to answer that, but ask yourself while sitting at McCorrie Point, and then let’s talk about where we are today.

“Why is offshore wind no longer favored under the current administration? They were voted in, whether you like it or not. I’m going to go through a couple of bullet points:

“One. Executive Order halts offshore wind expansion. In January of 2025, the President of the United States signed an Executive Order that withdrew the entire outer continental shelf from the future of offshore wind leasing. Not only did he do that, he paused all new and renewable lease permits and rights of way for wind energy on federal lands and waters. Next, he’s also initiated a review of the existing leases with potential cancellation/modifications.

“Two. New federal oversight delays projects. All wind and solar projects on federal lands and waters must now receive personal approval from the Interior Secretary, Doug Burgum. This change adds significant regulatory delays and uncertainty to project timelines. I’m just telling you what the lay of the land is, compared to when we first started these conversations. High costs from tariffs and subsidy rollbacks - tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and turbine components have increased project costs. That’s going to turn into increased electric rates.

“I’m no fool. New tax legislation, signed by the President, is rolling back clean energy tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, making it financially harder for offshore wind developers.

“Now let’s talk about what has been done to the industry: industry pullbacks and writedowns. Ecuador recorded a $955 million write-down on its U.S. offshore wind portfolio. Citing administration policy changes, they’re divesting. Shell withdrew from the Atlantic Shores project off New Jersey, and this one. Projects like SouthCoast Wind have been delayed by years, losing hundreds of millions of expected value. SouthCoast wind knows it’s in trouble. They already said they are likely going to delay by four years.

“I only have a few more points—impact on the state climate goals. States like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island rely heavily on offshore wind to meet their emission targets. The targets were made under a different administration. I don’t know if the targets are right or wrong. What if we’re wrong? We’re going to ruin a river. That’s going to delay timelines, create potential energy supply gaps, and pose challenges to meet the climate mandates.

“We’ve heard that from our president’s mouth. He favors fossil fuels and nuclear over renewables. He has repeatedly criticized wind energy as visually unappealing, environmentally harmful, and economically inefficient.

“This administration’s philosophical stance will make it very difficult for wind projects. So again, I’m going to ask the siting board: Would you approve a project before you know whether the energy source in that ocean will come to fruition for 20 years? I ask you. The most important thing you can do is take your beach chair down there to McCorrie Point, take a nice visit, and understand the threat of putting that power line up that river for a project that’s deeply in trouble.”

“I’m a resident and property owner, if that matters, of Rhode Island. I’m here to voice my strong support for the SouthCoast Wind Project. Rhode Island and the broader New England region are facing a real challenge. Electricity demand is rising, yet our grid is aging, and we remain too dependent on expensive, polluting, fossil fuels, especially peaker plants that are extremely expensive to run and very harmful to public health. There’s no question we need new, reliable sources of power that can be built now and serve well into the future.

“SouthCoast Wind offers a practical and much-needed solution. It will deliver 1200 megawatts of emission-free, reliable electricity to the New England grid, enough to power 800,000 homes, including 125,000 Rhode Island homes.

“That’s more than a quarter of the homes in the entire state. That’s not just impressive, it’s essential. We won’t have enough capacity to meet our energy needs without projects like this. From an affordability standpoint, this project makes sense. Offshore wind offers long-term fixed price contracts. That means Rhode Islanders are better shielded from market shocks and price volatility. We’ve already seen how global instability can cause our energy bills to skyrocket. If we rely only on solutions like natural gas, we are at risk of fluctuating, unpredictable energy costs. SouthCoast wind will help insulate us from that. It replaces costly fossil fuel generation with stable American-made energy, ultimately saving Rhode Islanders money.

“The project also adheres to strict regulatory standards and has been subject to extensive, rigorous environmental permitting reviews. The underground and undersea cables will be installed using horizontal directional drilling, a proven method that avoids disruption to our beaches and coastal ecosystems. This is safe and well-established infrastructure, far less invasive than pipelines or new fossil fuel facilities.

“I also want to address that there has been a lot of misinformation about environmental risks that are rooted in myths and propaganda funded by outside groups aligned with the fossil fuel industry. Scientists and marine experts overwhelmingly agree that offshore wind is not a threat to ocean life. These projects have been built and operated successfully, in some cases for decades, in other areas of the world, like Europe and Asia. The biggest environmental risk we face is doing nothing, continuing to burn fossil fuels, and delaying the better solutions we desperately need.

“Let’s also not forget about the economic opportunity. As you’ve heard, this project supports local jobs, builds Rhode Island’s workforce, and creates a strong supply chain of jobs and businesses in our coastal communities. This is not going to harm our fishing industry. It’s going to enhance and strengthen our coastal economies. It’s an investment not just in energy infrastructure, but in the future of our coastal communities. No other energy resource is going to bring this level of economic development to our region.

“We know more power generation is needed. The question is how we build it. As a relatively young person who wants to raise a family here in Rhode Island, I want to see Rhode Island empower and embrace innovation, low-cost energy, and real solutions to air quality and public health. We have the opportunity to move forward on a solution that will, without any doubt, offer cleaner air, more cost stability, enhance our energy security, and create economic growth for our coastal communities.

“There’s no backup plan or project that comes close to offering the solutions our region desperately needs. There’s no nuclear project, no other project that offers this kind of economic investment and other benefits for the region. So, I urge the board to move forward with the SouthCoast Wind Project.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!U8OJ!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F947a5048-fbaf-40d1-9844-858805075e1a_2000x1125.jpeg",N,,2025-07-26 15:01:38.953274

For a primer on the important ""infill"" housing-related California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) reforms, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""California Legislature Enacts Major CEQA Reforms for Housing-Rich 'Infill' Projects,"" July 2, 2025. Additional alerts on other aspects of Assembly Bill (AB) 130 and Senate Bill (SB) 131 will be available on Holland & Knight's West Coast Land Use and Environment blog, Breaking Ground. A two-part webinar series is scheduled for Aug. 20 and Aug. 27, 2025, and will feature analysis of the new laws and a Q&A with Holland & Knight attorneys.

In addition to the important ""infill"" housing-related CEQA reforms explained in the aforementioned Holland & Knight alert, AB 130 and SB 131 contain a variety of CEQA reforms that are unrelated to housing. These new laws were signed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom on June 30, 2025, and went into effect immediately. The purpose of this Holland & Knight alert is to focus on provisions of SB 131 that establish new statutory CEQA exemptions that apply to a variety of qualifying non-housing projects.

The statutory CEQA exemptions established by SB 131 are summarized as follows:

Advanced Manufacturing Projects. Pursuant to SB 131, CEQA no longer applies to a project that consists exclusively of ""advanced manufacturing"" that is proposed to be located on a site that was zoned exclusively for industrial uses but does not also qualify as ""natural and protected lands."" SB 131 generally defines the term ""natural and protected lands"" to include the following:

state and national park lands

protected marine areas

national recreation areas

national monuments

national wild and scenic rivers

ecological reserves and wildlife management areas

hazardous waste sites (absent applicable regulatory clearances)

regulatory floodways (absent applicable regulatory clearances)

lands subject to a conservation easement

wetlands and land within 300 feet of a wetland

environmentally sensitive areas within the coastal zone

lands protected as preserve areas or reserve lands pursuant to a habitat conservation plan or natural community conservation plan

lands within a very high fire hazard zone (absent adopted fire hazard mitigation measures)

prime farmland and farmland of statewide importance

land zoned or designated for agricultural preservation or protection by an approved local ballot measure

To define the term ""advanced manufacturing,"" SB 131 refers to a definition of the same term set forth in Public Resources Code Section 26003 that defines ""advanced manufacturing"" broadly to include, among other things, microelectronics and nanotechnologies, semiconductors, advanced materials, integrated computational materials engineering, additive manufacturing, industrial biotechnology, improvements in manufacturing processes that are often referred to as ""smart"" or ""intelligent"" manufacturing systems and which integrate computation predictability and operational efficiency, and sustainable manufacturing systems that are not required to be implemented pursuant to state or federal laws and regulations.

By its terms, however, the current version of Public Code Section 26003 will expire on Jan. 1, 2026, when it will be replaced by a different version that does not define the term ""advanced manufacturing."" A legislative fix will therefore be necessary to ensure definitional clarity beyond Jan. 1, 2026.

Daycare Centers. SB 131 exempts daycare centers from CEQA review, provided that the daycare center would not be located in a residential area or on a site that qualifies as ""natural and protected lands."" The term ""daycare center"" is defined broadly to include licensed childcare centers, child daycare facilities other than a family daycare home, infant centers, preschools, extended daycare facilities and school-age childcare centers.

Health Centers and Rural Health Clinics. SB 131 also provides a CEQA exemption for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics, provided such facilities do not exceed 50,000 square feet in total space or would be located on ""natural and protected lands."" In summary, SB 131 defines the term ""rural health clinic"" to mean a facility that would primarily furnish outpatient health outside of ""urban areas,"" as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau, where there are insufficient numbers of needed healthcare practitioners. This exemption also covers ""federally qualified health centers,"" a term generally defined to mean ""rural health clinics"" that receive federal grant funding.

Nonprofit Food Banks. SB 131 provides a CEQA exemption for nonprofit food banks and food pantries that solicit, store and ""distribute sufficient food to their defined service area,"" provided the facility would be located on a site that is zoned exclusively for industrial use but does not qualify as ""natural and protected lands."" However, SB 131 does not define the phrase ""distributes sufficient food to their defined service area."" Thus, to reduce the likelihood of legal challenge, lead agencies that rely on this CEQA exemption should be careful to include substantial evidence in the administrative record of the anticipated food demand within the food bank's service area and of the food bank's ability to satisfy such demand.

Parks and Nonmotorized Trails. Under SB 131, any activity or approval necessary for or incidental to planning, design, site acquisition, construction, operation or maintenance of public parks or nonmotorized recreational trail facilities are exempt from CEQA, but only if such facilities are funded in whole or in part by bond funds allocated pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Bond Act of 2024, which was approved by California voters in the November 2024 election (Proposition 4).

State Climate Adaptation Strategy Updates. Existing law requires the California Natural Resources Agency to update every three years the state's climate adaptation strategy to identify the state's vulnerability to climate change and priority actions needed to reduce climate-related risk and achieve climate resilience. SB 131 completely exempts future climate adaptation strategy updates from CEQA review.

Housing Element Rezonings. Existing law requires cities and counties every eight years to approve Housing Elements that are capable of accommodating their respective share of the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA),then rezone land within their jurisdictions as necessary to accommodate RHNA units. Housing Element rezoning pursuant to Government Code Section 65583(c) is now exempt from CEQA, provided the rezoning would not permit construction of a distribution center or oil and gas infrastructure or would otherwise permit development within ""natural and protected lands."" When combined with AB 130's new infill housing CEQA exemption, it is possible that some infill housing projects would entirely avoid CEQA review at both the long-term planning and project levels.

Agricultural Employee Housing. Though SB 131 predominately addresses non-housing projects, this CEQA exemption builds off another CEQA exemption for agricultural employee housing found in Public Resources Code Section 21159.22 but adds further restrictions mandating that in order to use the SB 131 agricultural employee housing CEQA exemption, an agricultural employee housing project must be any of the following:

funded by the Joe Serna Jr. Farmworker Housing Grant Program

funded by the Office of Migrant Services within the Department of Housing and Community Development

funded by a local government, or

owned or operated and funded by a public or nonprofit entity, or that receives state, federal, or local public funding

Please note that this exemption does not apply to a project consisting exclusively of the repair or maintenance of an existing farmworker housing project.

Certain Water and Sewer Infrastructure Projects. SB 131 exempts from CEQA review various water and sewer projects that primarily benefit a small, disadvantaged community water system or a state small water system by improving water quality, water supply or water supply reliability, as well as encourages water conservation and provides drinking water service to existing residences within a disadvantaged community. There are various qualifying criteria, such as not affecting wetlands or an environmentally sensitive habitat area within the coastal zone, not having unusual circumstances that would cause a significant effect on the environment, not having a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historic resource and ensuring that construction impacts are fully mitigated. This exemption imposes a skilled workforce requirement or prevailing wages depending on various factors. SB 131 extended expiration of this CEQA exemption to Jan. 1, 2032.

Community Water Systems. A project that consists of a community water system funded by the Safe Drinking Water, Wildfire Prevention, Drought Preparedness, and Clean Air Bond Act of 2024 or the State Water Resources Control Board's Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience program that does not otherwise include any construction activities is now exempt from CEQA until Jan. 1, 2030, if the project results in long-term net benefits to climate resiliency, biodiversity, and sensitive species recovery or includes procedures, as well as and ongoing management for the protection of the environment. This exemption imposes a skilled workforce requirement or prevailing wages depending on various factors.

Wildfire Risk Reduction Projects. Given the prominence of wildfire risk in California, especially in light of the 2025 Palisades and Eaton fires, the legislature stepped in with a new CEQA exemption for wildfire risk reduction measures. As long as a wildfire risk reduction project is in compliance with all other applicable laws, ordinance and zoning requirements, all of the following wildfire risk reduction projects are now exempt from CEQA:

projects consisting of a prescribed fire or fuel reduction to reduce wildfire risk by reestablishing the fire return interval appropriate to the ecosystem for biodiversity or other benefits (but entirely excluding projects located on coastal sage scrub habitat or any other sensitive habitat), provided the project 1) does not exceed 50 contiguous acres, 2) is located within a half-mile of a subdivision of 30 or more dwelling units, 3) is subject to consultation with the Department of Fish and Wildlife, 4) avoids impacts to riparian areas and water quality, and 5) provides for the identification and protection of potentially impacted tribal cultural resources

projects consisting of ""defensible space"" fire clearance of up to 100 feet (as measured from the center line of the roadway) for a public roadway identified as an egress and evacuation route for a subdivision or community of 30 or more dwelling units to remove flammable vegetation or trees of less than 12 inches in diameter as measured at chest height

projects consisting of the establishment or enhancement of residential home hardening or the establishment of wildfire defensible space within 200 feet of a legal structure located in a high or very high wildfire hazard zone

projects consisting of the establishment of a fuel break extending up to 200 feet from structures, including the clearance of flammable vegetation and trees less than 12 inches in diameter as measured at chest height

Linear Broadband Projects. SB 131 amends Public Resources Code Section 21080.51 to clarify the CEQA exemption for above-ground or subsurface linear broadband projects within, or within 30 feet of, a right-of-way, including but limited to a local street or road right of way. To qualify for this updated exemption, above-ground projects must install improvements aerially along an existing utility pole right of way, and subsurface projects must restore the surface to preexisting conditions. Moreover, qualifying broadband projects must 1) include monitors during construction activities to avoid or address impacts to cultural and biological resources, 2) comply with mitigation requirements lawfully imposed through the local agency permit process and 3) comply with applicable laws related to wetlands preservation, endangered species, and other applicable state and federal laws.

Conclusion

Newly enacted SB 131 decrees several statutory exemptions from CEQA that will facilitate the development of a variety of socially and environmentally beneficial projects that have often been stymied in the past by CEQA lawsuits. This Holland & Knight alert, however, summarizes only the new exemptions, and the application of each is highly dependent on the specific facts associated with each individual development project.

The coalition, officially named the Minerals for National Automotive Competitiveness Collaboration (MINAC), has its sights set firmly on securing a domestic source of battery materials—key to the heart of the American automotive revival.

Announced on Wednesday, the partnership features the likes of Alaska Energy Metals and Canadian ventures Graphite One, Electric Metals, and RecycLiCo. According to a report by ABC15, Marc Winterhoff, Lucid’s interim CEO, said, ""Domestic supply chains strengthen manufacturing resilience, fortify sustainable supply chains, and accelerate job growth."" These are not just ambitions on a corporate whiteboard; the ensemble’s vision includes setting up streamlined mineral production and sees cooperation for commercialization and consumer adoption as prerequisites for the future of U.S. manufacturing.

ABC15's coverage pointed out that the partners convened in Washington, D.C., on July 23, a gesture underscoring the strategic significance of the collaboration. The roundtable flaunted prominent Arizonian political faces, including Governor Katie Hobbs and representatives across the political spectrum, from Sen. Dan Sullivan to Rep. Andy Biggs.

Onboard this ambitious collaboration are companies carving niches in the critical mineral market: Alaska Energy Metals helms a nickel project in Alaska while Electric Metals USA Limited develops Minnesota's high-grade manganese deposit. Graphite One brings graphite production facilities to the table, expecting operation by 2028. Lastly, RecycLiCo is set on refining mined ore and upcycling lithium-ion battery materials through cutting-edge technology.

These efforts haven't gone unnoticed by the political realm. ""Arizona is proud to be home to Lucid's state-of-the-art manufacturing facility,"" Sen.

US President Donald Trump’s negative impact on clean energy has been intense this year, but this week he took it to a new level.

His administration on Wednesday canceled $4.9 billion in federal financing for the Grain Belt Express, a transmission project that’s faced backlash from Republicans over ties to wind energy.

The same day, NextEra Energy Inc., one of the world’s biggest suppliers of wind and solar power, saw its shares tumble 7% as analysts worried Trump’s elimination of clean-energy tax credits would hurt the company.

And Tesla Inc., once the apple of Trump’s eye, warned of difficult times ahead after losing electric-vehicle incentives.

Go back a bit further for another prime example. The administration halted construction of a $5 billion wind farm off New York’s coast, then reversed the decision after reaching a deal with the governor that could allow new natural gas pipelines in the state.

Source: BloombergNEF, Grain Belt Express project website.

Note: Route is approximate and for illustrative purposes only.

That one really hurt: The farm’s developer, Equinor ASA, this week took a $955 million writedown on its offshore wind projects in the US and said it was unlikely to develop the second stage of Empire Wind.

Meanwhile, companies that profit off fossil fuels are doing great. Shares in the big independent power producers that own gas plants rose after an auction to ensure electricity supplies on the largest US power grid set record-high prices.

GE Vernova Inc., whose shares almost quadrupled on the strength of gas turbine sales, saw the stock climb further after saying its turbine backlog had grown by 10%.

There doesn’t seem to be a limit to how far Trump will carry his war on clean energy.

As analysts from ClearView Energy Partners wrote in a note about the cancellation of the Grain Belt Express financing: “Could the White House be expanding its ‘green new scam’ battlefield into transmission?”

The disastrous flooding in the Texas Hill Country is at the confluence of two crises: climate change and a torrent of U.S. debt. They are related, and the federal response is making both worse.

First, climate change: Current average global temperatures have exceeded 1.5 degrees above preindustrial levels. This is the low end of the threshold established in the Paris agreement to avoid tipping points on the planet. Warmer air holds more moisture, and heat and low humidity increase the risk of drought and wildfires. We are experiencing more frequent, severe and costly storms, droughts and fire events in the U.S. and across the globe; a new abnormal. The floods along the Guadalupe River and East Coast are the latest examples of extreme events.

Like the Texas flood waters, the costs of climate disasters are rapidly rising. In 2023 there were 28 separate weather and climate disasters with damages of $1 billion or more. The total cost of disaster in 2023 was $94.8 billion. The Asheville, North Carolina, floods in 2024 are estimated to have cost between $48 billion and $53 billion. The estimated cost of this year’s Los Angeles fires is between $135 billion and $150 billion. Guadalupe River flood damage is estimated between $18 billion and $22 billion.

The Trump administration has responded by waging a war on climate science. Virtually every climate science program in every agency has been eliminated or drastically cut including: NOAA, the National Weather Service, the EPA, NASA, Energy and FEMA. These are the programs that conduct climate research, provide early severe weather alerts, hurricane and fire warnings, and emergency management preparedness. They are also cutting funding to state and local governments for disaster relief while shifting more responsibilities to them. In addition, they have also cut tax credits for clean energy while increasing subsidies for fossil fuels. These policies are literally throwing gas on the fire and then cutting funds for the fire department. See “We can’t manage what we refuse to measure,” The Herald, June 7.

Second, debt, deficits and the budget: To be sure, current spending levels are unsustainable. The federal government has spent $1.34 trillion more than it has collected in fiscal year 2025. In 2024 the total was $1.83 trillion.

The national debt is the accumulation of all borrowing along with interest, currently in excess of $36 trillion. As reported by the The Economist: “Over the past 12 months America’s budget deficit has been an astonishing 6.7 percent of (gross domestic product) … and the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio will in about two years exceed the 106 percent reached after the second world war.”

Interest on that borrowing increases each year, thereby increasing the deficit and squeezing out spending for all other needs. The so-called Big Beautiful Bill will make matters worse. By all objective accounts, it will increase the national debt more than $4 trillion over the next 10 years. That will create structural deficits constraining all other spending priorities such as defense; climate disasters such as floods, heat, and hurricanes; fiscal downturns and growth.

The BBB also abolishes billions for green energy, solar and wind, electric vehicles, heat pumps and other provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act. It is estimated that it will increase energy costs, and increase carbon emissions by roughly 10 percent by 2030.

The July 5 Economist magazine feature story was “Big beautiful … bonkers” in which it described the BBB as a “big beautiful fairy tale … a showcase for fiscal incontinence and ideological exhaustion.”

It is based on rosy forecasts, unrealistic growth projections and low-balling deficit impacts. “The White House has devised a fiscal fantasyland to dispense with such tiresome facts, in which the BBB initiates such breakneck growth that revenues soar and debt plummets,” it said.

The administration and Republican-majority Congress are exhibiting the same disregard for math as they do for climate science. The Economist continues: “The bloating of the deficit — at a time when interest rates and inflation risks are high — is being waved away by a Republican Party that preaches about fiscal discipline when out of power, and spends with reckless abandon when in it.” Nowhere is this more apparent than failing to respond to growing climate emergencies across the nation.

The U.S. deficit requires serious attention. So does climate change, including adaptation to increasingly severe weather events, improvements to infrastructure and responding to disasters.

We are ignoring the laws of science and math at our peril. Tightening our belt in the wrong places — around our neck instead of our waist — is dangerous and expensive for the economy and environment.

Paul Roberts is retired and lives in Everett. His career spans five decades in infrastructure, economics and environmental policy including former Chair of the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency Board and advising Washington cities on climate change.

LaCerte is the White House liaison and senior advisor to the director for U.S. Office of Personnel Management, where he helped shepherd candidates through the nomination process and advised on personnel policy for the agency that administers employment for the 2 million federal workers.

The five FERC commissioners serve five-year terms. LaCerte, who was nominated last week by President Donald Trump, would be replacing FERC Chair Willie L. Phillips, who was tapped by President Joe Biden and resigned before his term expired on June 30, 2026.

His nomination will be vetted, probably in the fall, by the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The panel has nine Democratic members and 11 Republicans, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge. If the committee recommends LaCerte, 45, the full Senate will have to vote on his confirmation.

LaCerte has very little experience in utility law and administration, wrote Dan Farber in Legal Planet, an environmental law policy collaboration of faculty at the University of California Berkeley School of Law and UCLA School of Law.

“For this administration if you’re looking for someone to reform something and cut red tape that is what David is known for,” said Mary-Patricia Wray, a Baton Rouge lobbyist who has worked with LaCerte as a legal and regulatory expert on behalf of her clients.

A former Marine who was involved in the Afghanistan conflict, LaCerte joined the state veterans’ department in 2010 and was appointed secretary by Gov. Bobby Jindal in June 2014, during a time when state government was cutting agency budgets. But even under budget pressure, LaCerte was able to build veterans cemeteries and increase benefits for disabled vets.

He resigned from the post in October 2015 amid an investigation into his office. In February 2016, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor and the State Inspector General's Office released a scathing joint report accusing the department of misspending thousands of dollars and failing to report crimes against veterans.

LaCerte called the report “garbage” and filed a defamation lawsuit against Auditor Daryl Purpera and Inspector General Stephen Street.

The lawsuit was tossed out in May 2025 by Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal on a summary judgment basically finding that while the allegations were not proven to have been his fault, LaCerte was a public figure at the time as were the Legislative Auditor and the Inspector General and therefore immune from defamation claims.

After his state employment, LaCerte practiced employment law with the New Orleans firm of Sternberg, Naccari & White before joining the Office of Personal Management during the first Trump administration.

He worked at the Office of Personnel Management during the first Trump administration. The office is the chief human resources agency and personnel policy manager for the federal government.

LaCerte was acting managing director at the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board.

He joined the Houston-based Baker & Botts law firm in 2023 providing regulatory advice to large corporations.

LaCerte contributed to Project 2025, the 920-page conservative manifesto to change how the federal government operates. His role was to advise the project’s authors on the mechanics of combining agencies and shrinking the size of government.

Climate change—to which Bolivia has contributed very little—has also played a role in drying out forests.
Numerous scientific studies have established a link between climate change and worsening drought conditions, as well as rising temperatures, which contribute to longer and more intense fire seasons.
Those strategies for growth are “increasingly incompatible with a safe and sustainable future under climate change,” Palummo told Inside Climate News in an email.
They find themselves torn between the need to grow economically and the escalating impacts of climate change that are not of their own making.","Last year, record wildfires fueled by dry conditions incinerated large swaths of Bolivia’s forests, wetlands and other ecosystems, burning an area larger than the state of Indiana.

The blazes decimated ecosystems, affecting thousands of families, many of whom are Indigenous and reliant on forests and waterways for their livelihoods, food, water, culture and medicine.

A new report by Javier Palummo, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights’ special rapporteur on economic, social, cultural and environmental rights, documents the extensive human rights toll of the fires. The sweeping and highly critical review also identifies how the Bolivian government contributed to the dry conditions that created the circumstances for the fires to rage longer and faster than before.

According to the analysis, tensions between the national and local governments hindered emergency responses while policies aimed at aggressively expanding industrial agriculture have dried out large areas of the country, leaving ecosystems vulnerable to fire.

Those policies included laws that legalized past illegal land clearings, authorized the use of fire in agricultural activities and opened Indigenous territories to intensive agriculture and livestock operations.

“The expansion of agribusiness in Bolivia is closely linked to the increase in forest fires and deforestation,” the report said.

Neither Bolivia’s Ministry of Environment and Water nor the country’s consulate in New York responded to requests for comment. But the national government has long championed poor countries’ right to develop while calling on rich countries—the largest contributors to climate change—to provide financial support for developing countries’ conservation efforts.

The report follows Palummo’s December visit to Bolivia, where he toured impacted areas and met with government officials, communities and civil society groups.

Citing research from Global Forest Watch, Oxfam and academics, the report said agricultural and livestock expansion were responsible for nearly all of Bolivia’s deforestation in recent years. Soybean production and cattle ranching have boomed over a 23-year period ending in 2019, with about 7 million hectares of forest converted to single-crop plantations during that time. Much of that activity happened in Santa Cruz province, the epicenter of last year’s fires.

Deforestation is linked to more frequent and intense fires because tree loss disrupts the forests’ natural cooling and water cycling process. Trees draw water through their roots and release moisture from their leaves. Clearing land throws this cycle out of balance, resulting in drier, more drought-prone conditions.

According to the report, Bolivia’s fires reached an unprecedented scale last year, with hot spots emerging earlier than usual and fires spreading more rapidly than ever before. In all, 10 million hectares burned with dangerous smoke reaching as far south as Buenos Aires in Argentina.

Climate change—to which Bolivia has contributed very little—has also played a role in drying out forests. Numerous scientific studies have established a link between climate change and worsening drought conditions, as well as rising temperatures, which contribute to longer and more intense fire seasons.

Rich nations like the United States and countries in Europe are some of the biggest historical emitters of the greenhouse gases warming the planet. Those countries also previously decimated much of their forests and other ecosystems to generate wealth. The United States, for example, has lost 90 percent of its original forests since the 17th century, replacing much of that land with single-crop plantations and urban development.

Those strategies for growth are “increasingly incompatible with a safe and sustainable future under climate change,” Palummo told Inside Climate News in an email.

“This is a classic climate injustice,” he said, with nations that have contributed relatively little to global warming facing some of the worst climate disasters. They find themselves torn between the need to grow economically and the escalating impacts of climate change that are not of their own making.

“The situation underscores how countries like Bolivia are essentially caught in a trap: the traditional extractive path to development is now directly imperiling their people due to the climate crisis,” Palummo said.

He pointed to other structural factors that he said are worsening the problem, including foreign investment protections that complicate efforts to fight climate change and long-term under-investment in rural and Indigenous territories that hinder governments’ ability to respond to disasters.

In Bolivia, Indigenous communities that have largely opposed the degradation of the forest were the most severely affected by last year’s fires, according to the report.

“Because of fires and the climate crisis, indigenous peoples have suffered losses that are difficult to calculate,” the report said, emphasizing the link between the peoples and their territories. “The loss of land and natural resources not only compromises their subsistence economy, but also represents a direct threat to their survival.”

The report noted “enormous concern” about the uncontacted Ayoreo Indigenous peoples who reside in a region affected by the fires.

Last year, Inside Climate News reported from the Bolivian Amazon on one Indigenous community’s fight against the fires, and the industrial agricultural plantations that have infringed on its territory.

Palummo in his email said Indigenous and rural communities face a double vulnerability: They are disproportionately impacted by climate change and also largely excluded from the benefits of industrial extractivism.

“In our region the extractive model tends to concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few,” he said, referring to Latin American countries. “The revenues it generates rarely translate into structural improvements for the broader population, especially not for those living in the territories directly affected by extractive activities.”

Yet those communities hold critical knowledge of ecosystems and sustainable development possibilities, Palummo said. “These perspectives are not only culturally relevant, but have proven effective in sustaining ecosystems over generations.”

Among the report’s other findings:

More than 145,000 children and teenagers were affected by forced displacement, school closures, families’ lost livelihoods and exposure to smoke. Their ailments included respiratory problems, inflamed eyes, dehydration and diarrheal diseases. Thousands more adults were treated for similar health problems linked to the effects of the fires.

Fires destroyed staple crops, while cows, pigs and other animals raised for food were burned alive or starved because pastures were destroyed.

Fire-ravaged areas paralyzed subsistence hunting and fishing, with animals either fleeing or dying. Food cultivation is expected to face long-term challenges due to fire damage. Thousands of families required food assistance and other aid.

Rivers polluted by the widespread use of agrochemicals and illegal goldmining were further contaminated by the fires’ ash and debris while scorched earth impeded the soil’s ability to absorb rainfall and replenish groundwater.

The report also noted that dozens of endangered and endemic species—including blue-bearded parrots, tapirs and giant armadillos—along with other wildlife lost habitats or died in the flames and smoke. Incinerated grasslands and old-growth forests released climate-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Bolivia’s responses to fires included issuing disaster declarations, deploying fire brigades and the military more than 800 times and distributing humanitarian aid and medical care.

“These reactive approaches, based primarily on emergency interventions, tend to overlook the structural causes driving the recurrence of wildfires, such as land-use change and unsustainable agrarian dynamics,” the report said.

The report called on Bolivia to adopt a national fire management plan that includes ecosystem-based knowledge, is aimed at preventing fires from starting in the first place and incorporates the participation of Indigenous and rural communities.

The report also recommended that Bolivia repeal laws and policies that incentivize land-use change and deforestation, and that the government commit to performing environmental and social-impact assessments for all activities impacting people and ecosystems.

In his emailed statement, Palummo notes that the report makes the case for rich countries to meet their commitments to international climate financial funds. Countries like Bolivia need more resources to move from extractive development models while navigating growing climate risks, he said.

Bolivia’s fires were among many disasters in 2024, Earth’s hottest year on record. Palummo emphasized that the report offers lessons for nations around the world.

“This is not just an environmental issue, but a human rights issue,” Palummo said in his email. “The right to a healthy environment, to health, to water, and even to life and livelihood are at stake when climate-fueled disasters strike. It’s a warning that resonates far beyond Bolivia’s borders.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2173500102-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-07-26 05:59:02.796616

The future of mobility is electric, and it should have been here by now, considering that Morris & Salom’s Electrobat cars were running on Philadelphia’s streets in 1894. In 1909, an electric car beat a gasoline car in Boston’s busy traffic by 15 minutes. But electric cars are still at the 25% sales mark globally, and like most averages that figure is misleading.

When 70% of all electric cars are made in China, and 65% are sold there, the picture looks distinctly ICE-y – short for internal combustion engine – for the rest of the world. Then consider market leader Tesla’s woes. Its quarterly revenue has slumped. Half-yearly sales in Europe are down 33%. But more worrying for it is the drying carbon credits market under Trump. So far, Tesla’s made billions selling these credits to makers of ICE cars. It earned $2.1bn from them in just the first nine months of 2024. Tesla also has to worry about the phase-out of the $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers in Sept.

Carbon and tax credits are nothing but subsidies for the EV business in US and Europe, and the Chinese EV miracle was also built on subsidies. By some accounts, China spent $231bn over a decade to prop up the industry, which now has spare capacity of 3mn cars, leading to cut-throat competition at home and dumping outside. That raises an important question. If EVs have truly come of age, why do they need state support? In 1900, US had only 8,000 cars. By 1915, there were over 2mn. Henry Ford’s Model T – launched for $850 in 1908 and priced at just $300 in 1917, thanks to economies of scale – brought the horseless revolution without any state help.
